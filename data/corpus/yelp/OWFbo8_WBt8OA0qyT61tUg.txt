Versailles is an institution in L.A., and therefore difficult to review. I have been coming here for as long as I've lived here, and a trip last night reminded me that I need to review it ... but how? You don't go to Versailles not knowing what to expect or because you are out for an evening full of surprises, you go because you know exactly what you're going to get:  good, salty, heartburn-inducing food, sort of tacky ambiance and service that is hardly ever better than "meh." But, it's Versailles, so it's perfectly fine.. . Everybody knows by now that the dish to get is the #6, the garlic chicken with onions. In the past though, I have had good luck with the pork chops and the squid ink rice--which Jonathan Gold once described very accurately as the color of asphalt ... yummy, delicious asphalt. . . Last night, friend and I decided to go the cheap route and get one order of the chicken and one vegetarian plate--of rice, beans and plantains, and then just split the chicken. It was a good idea, too, because we both had enough to take home as leftovers. . . Side note:  their "vegetarian" menu is pretty funny. It's comprised of two items:  the aforementioned plate of rice, beans and plantains, and another plate that offers the rice and beans served TOGETHER, plantains, and a green salad. Here's a tip--if you have vegetarian/vegan friends, DO NOT take them to Versailles. Looking at that menu reminded me of the scene in Everything Is Illuminated, when Elijah Wood's character explains that he's a vegetarian, and the others react aghast and ask, "NO MEAT?" Yeah, those two paltry veggie options is Versailles' way of asking NO MEAT?. . Still, if you know that going in, and you are prepared for garlicky, salty goodness, head to Versailles:  you will not be disappointed.
