I think 3.5 is actually a bit more accurate, but I am not one for details and didn't figure out how to give a half star. . Not much to say, dangerously good sushi for delivery, very expensive prices squashed that exercise, however their 1/2 price sushi menu Sat and Sun days, with ample seating (usually) and street parking makes this a great start to a productive weekend day, to treat yourself to some good (somewhat creative) sushi without killing your wallet. Check out Lincoln Square and Albany Park for tons of great authentic and esoteric spots! One of the most underated pockets for foodies in the city!
