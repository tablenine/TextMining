Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
This restaurant is in an odd spot. Outside it's surrounded by run down looking outlet stores, but inside it's as if you stepped into another world. The decor and lighting help bring out the casual sophisticated atmosphere it is trying to go for. The servers were polite and were knowledgeable of the limited menu. I personally thought the crab rangoons and beef chow-funn were top notch, but my girlfriend thought the food was just average. Regardless, the place is worth a try, and is definitely a place you can take a date to.
