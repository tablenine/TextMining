I'd say a solid 4.5 star for this place but I'm going to give them the whole five for the extra effort our server put in as well as the bartenders.. . First the drinks... I had a mojito and my friend had an old fashion.  Both took the bartender a bit longer to make but it was worth it.  They make the whole thing from scratch and I have to say, it was one of the better mojitos I've had in awhile.. . It just got better when we sat and ordered food.  I would have to say the shichahi 3 way or whatever it was call was very VERY tasty.  And the meat coca was a little filly but very well balance flavors.  We topped it off with the pork belly tacos.  We did have plans to order a main dish but after all that food, we were more than full.  And the best thing, it came out to only about $30/person with the drinks.  Would definitely return... too bad I don't live in the area though, darn!!!
