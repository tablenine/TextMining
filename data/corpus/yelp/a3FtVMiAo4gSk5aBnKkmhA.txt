OMG! A bar in the East Village/NoHo area with a huge outdoor seating area? Awesome!. . No, it's not. Yeah, the outdoor space is beautiful, but you can only sit if you order food. There were 30 or so open tables but my group of 6 had to stand along the edge because we had just come from dinner and were only interested in having drinks. 10 minutes later, a group of snobby girls and their douche boyfriends sit down at a table next to us and order round after round of drinks, with no food, and were given no problem. What kind of BS is that?. . $7 beers are not a deal, either. You're better off in the back garden of Bull McCabe's on St Marks. A lot less douche-y and Â drinks are actually worth the price.
