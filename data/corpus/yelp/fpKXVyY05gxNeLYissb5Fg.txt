Restaurant: A Taste of Heaven
Category: Bakeries
I was looking forward to this cute little place, but I felt like their selection was a little shy of heaven. I'm a very picky eater though. My boyfriend thought the food was ok, but on the expensive side. As we were leaving we decided to buy cupcakes for dessert that night. We had two half eaten cupcakes left. Really who eats only half a cupcake?! They weren't worth the calories!
