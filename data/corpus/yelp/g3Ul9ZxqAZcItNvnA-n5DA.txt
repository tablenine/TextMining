I want to give this 4.5 stars because everything was nearly perfect. The service was impeccable, the food was cooked to perfection, the flavors remained on my palate long after I left the restaurant, and the selection was my kind of comfort food.. . We arrived missing 2 guests from our party. The waitress said she would be OK seating us without everyone present, but there was an hour wait for a party this large. So, she offered us the garden area downstairs. We were starvles, so we took it! For a party of our size, this was the perfect place to seat us. It gave us privacy, exclusivity to our very own bartender and waitress, and closer proximity to the kitchen, meaning our food would arrive quickly.. . We couldn't agree on entrees, so we ordered a bunch of appetizers. The parmesan truffle fries, baked mac n' cheese, hamburger spring rolls (ridiculous), sliders, fresh ricotta, and truffle spinach and artichoke dip (so rich), and caesar salad were our choices. I can't imagine returning and NOT ordering every one of those dishes again.. . Mac bar is directly next door for your midnight mac n' cheese cravings.
