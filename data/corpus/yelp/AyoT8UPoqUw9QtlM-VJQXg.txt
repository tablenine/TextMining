Canters Deli is a place like so many in L.A, you can't really complain as it is what it is, but for what you pay you'd expect more. . . I lived in Florida for 11 years, and spent a great deal of time in Jewish enclaves on the east and west coast. I've dated Jewish girls, heck I even took a Jewish girl to prom. :). . I feel like certain places think because they heap mounds of meat on a sandwich, that makes it a sandwich. What came to my table wasn't bad, it just wasn't worth 12 dollars. I would have loved to order some potato pancakes, but not for 9.95. I would of loved my matzo ball soup (5.50 for a cup?) if it it wasn't a gigantic matzo ball sitting in a bland broth devoid of any herbs, with a good deal of broth under the bowl on the plate. Considering how many times I pray to the garlic god, I was amazed that I felt the pickles where over garlicky and under par. Â . . What's with the cash register and the "credit card line?" They ask you what you would like to tip at the register, it felt very unprofessional. Very poor direction and lack of signs. The service staff was mildly attentive but seemed to be much more focused on when they were leaving which they loudly announced. . . The menu looks like it hasn't been redesigned since 1950, so many items with lack of adequate description. They are 24 hours in an area where nothing is, but if I paid 1/2 of what I did this would be a 4 star rating and I would be a repeat customer.
