Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
This place has great shabu shabu with the added value of being in a cozy, mom and pop type of place.  It's not much to look at but those are always the best types of places.  The staff is really friendly and accommodating - giving you as much rice as you want!  They've got all the condiments you need of course, and they're constantly slicing up the beef right there in the middle.  Once, one of the staff members came over and chatted with us and then mixed my sauce for me, which was very amusing and it turned out to be really yummy because it was a combo I had never tried before! Everything - the meat, the sauce - is really great quality.  There's usually a wait but it's definitely worth it.  I've gone at less busy hours (i.e., right when they open for dinner) so you might want to try that.  Ever since I've moved to the westside, I haven't been eating as much Shabu because this is the only place I'll go to!  I've seen that Mizu place on Sawtelle and it just looks too fancy.  I miss this place!
