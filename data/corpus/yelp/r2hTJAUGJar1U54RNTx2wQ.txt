Restaurant: The Mermaid Inn
Category: Seafood
urrrgggghhhh! Last week we ate at the Upper East Side Mermaid Inn - which I reviewed very positively. Last night, we went to the East Village Mermaid Inn....and were sorely disappointed. Please, just the facts sir.... . 1)oysters were completely dry. None of the sea water remained in the shell after shucking. This diminishes the bi-valve experience because I eat my oysters with only lemon juice.. 2) the tuna tar tare was plebeian. The quality of the tuna was good, but chopping up tuna is no mean feat. There was no other spicing or adornment. . 3) risotto was awful...flavorless, undercooked . 4) the shrimp avocado sandwich was average. . . Positive: a) We arrived at 9.30pm on a Friday night and were seated immediately (I wonder if there is a message there...?); b) bar tender did a good job pairing wine with the food. . . Conclusion: Go to the Uptown Mermaid Inn. You will not be disappointed.
