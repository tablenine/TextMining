If you are starving and in dire need of some good sausages, I would avoid coming here on a Friday night (or maybe even Saturday... that is, unless you're a fan of waiting in line for an hour.. . Asides from the line out the door, around the block &amp; back to your mom's house, the food was great! They have a large selection of sausages, from chicken, turkey, pork, to even vegetarian sausages and of course some odd ones like rabbit and ...rattle snake!? (YEEUCHk.. *My expression of disgust*). . Also, if you're a fan of fries, they've got them! There's an array of dipping sauces available, from thai peanut, curry ketchup, pesto mayo, chipotle, and so on.. . Oh yeah! If you like beer, well.. they've got 'em! A whole side of the menu dedicated to that even.. . Make sure to put on a fightin' face after you've ordered your food. You'll be standing around like an idiot waiting for someone to hurry up and finish their food. (Cafeteria-style seating).. . If you are here solely for drinks, DO NOT enter on the 3rd street entrance. They have another entrance just for the bar around the corner. . . Cheers!
