Excellent fish, but small pieces for exorbitant prices.  Stick to the nigiri as the rolls aren't super impressive.  The Otoro was the standout of the night, but the hamachi and hotate were also delicious.  The sake menu is pretty extensive  but our waitress could have been more knowledgeable, or at least directed someone to our table to assist with the selection.  Overall 4 stars, but unless it's for business or a nice date you can probably get great fish elsewhere
