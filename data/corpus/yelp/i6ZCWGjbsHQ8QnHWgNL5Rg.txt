Delicious!  My new favorite steak house.. . I had the dry aged, bone out ribeye, seafood tower, lobster mac n cheese, and cream of spinach.  The steak was the best steak I have ever had!  It is grilled to perfection, with a good pepper seared top.  The seafood tower was good, but, in my opinion, not worth the price.  The lobster mac n cheese was good too, but not as flavorful as I imagined.  I think christine's in rolling hills has better lobster mac n cheese.. . This place serves delicious food, and the quality of the food is definitely reflected in the price. Expensive!
