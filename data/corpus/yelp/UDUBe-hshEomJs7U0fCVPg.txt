If u wanna make a cool impression from ur soon to be girlfriend, this is it! . It's hip, it's unique in it's own right with great tasting dishes. I think the. pizzas are a little overrated, it's good don't get me wrong, some if not too. salty it's too greasy. It's served thin slightly crispy straight from the brick. oven---oooooohhhh!!!.    The appetizers r generally good like the meatball, the amazing caprese. and the mussels, (drool, drool). The bone marrow, I sincerely advise you. not to order it as it is a RIP OFF!!!! It looked amazing looking at it but with. a booger size marrow u get from it, not worth it!. The butterscotch budino I must say was a turn off, it just didn't sound. an echo for me, sorry "The Edge". The assortment of gelato was nothing special just pricey, ouch!.    It's really cramped inside, it's like being in a packed club with tables and. benches in the middle of it all. You are literally eating side by side with. your neighbor, LOL. It's a small bedroom turned into an Italian restaurant.. Basically, taking a quick shower prior won't hurt so as not to offend your. friend beside you. If u have a special occasion to celebrate with an extra. $100 to burn and pizza hut just won't seal the deal with your special. someone, this might be as close to heaven as u can be for a pricey meal. . .    :)--- fennel sausage pizza, caprese, cool crowd, brick oven, fast .           friendly service..    :(--- Atleast 1 month of reservation ahead, long wait even w/ reservation,.           Not for the claustrophobic, too pricey ok food items, too dark .           inside, limited parking, valet $12? dude! and no, you won't see.           Mario Batali hangin' around.
