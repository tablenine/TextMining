Great burger.. . Great beers.. . Pretentious definitely comes to mind - why can't I have ketchup with my fries?. . Open seating has to be the stupidest part of this place's schtick (moreso than the no-substitutions burger or the aforementioned ketchup ban).  Let's keep the guy at the door with the red rope from actually doing something useful like taking people's names and handing out tables first come, first served.  . . Could easily be five stars, could easily be one - good thing I left the place with a decent buzz.
