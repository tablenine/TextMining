Bf's friend took us here for lunch. Apparently its bombass to him... the foos never even been here before!. . First step in, almost felt like a NY pub. Unorganized. Pretty much you can cut someones who been waiting for half a hour by moving a few feet over. (Our bad dudes, us newbs got lucky). . Ordered the beef. Sat on stools. Ate on cafeteria-like tables.. . Lemonade couldve been better. Same w/ ice tea. Potato salad was alright.. . &amp; cockroach infestation? I wouldnt be surprised if a few of them lingered behind in the kitchen still or swam in the au jus.. . All in all... this felt like... high quality cafeteria food. Or this could be bombass food like the homie said... but served within jail. My bf knows -_- Well thats what i get for eating non-asian food in Chinatown.. . &amp; thanks for the most weirdest airy stomach feeling afterwards. Felt like Dragon Ball Z action was going on inside... air being pushed all over the place... SUPER SAIYAN!
