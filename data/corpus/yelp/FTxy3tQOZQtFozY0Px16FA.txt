Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
The Alcove is the no-so-hidden gem of Los Feliz.. The Alcove's relaxing ambiance and demeanor really makes you appreciate the perfect days Socal has to offer. You can't come here and not feel relaxed. It epitomizes what a great restaurant should be although I do have some qualms with the hipsters that strut in with their tiny dogs, v-neck shirts and their damn macbooks but even they can't ruin the qualities of the Alcove. . . Given that I use to live walking distance from here my typical Sunday routine would be to wake up from a strong night of drinking throw on whatever clothes I can find and hangout with a couple friends enjoying a delicious breakfast. I rarely wake up early enough for breakfast so when I can I usually appreciate it even more so. The Alcove never seems to disappoint. I'm a sucker for their eggs benedict but I can't remember not liking anything I've ordered their. . . Everything is on the pricey side but nothing outrageous. Given the great service and the great food its nothing that should hold you back from visiting.
