This would be my all time favorite sushi venue in all of Los Angeles. Yes sometimes the waits are long, the parking stinks and they don't take Credit cards. But most know that going into it. Yet there is a reason people still keep going. Quality and price. You can't beat the freshness and butteriness of the fish. The scallop specials I would kill for. when in season the amaebi is like little pieces of heaven that were just killed 2 seconds b4 they put it on your plate. Sometimes I will plan out what I'm going to open with and what will be the closer. It varies from time to time. Sometimes it's salmon to open and salmon to close. or maybe it's salmon to open and amaebi to close. it all depends on my mood, but a very crucial part of the experience. I suggests a party no bigger than 2 and choose the s/t option. Sushi bar/table... you will get seated sooner than bigger parties. Also I believe they are not open on mondays
