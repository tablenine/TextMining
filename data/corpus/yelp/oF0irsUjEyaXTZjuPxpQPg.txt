Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Came here while on vacation because of the high reviews and even recommendation from a friend.  Heard so many great things about it I was craving some since I hadn't had Shanghai dumplings in a few months.  Maybe I had too high expectations.. . Well, the experience wasn't that great.  The dumplings are far less tastier and soupier than what I have eatten in Vancouver, Canada.  I only live 2.5 hours driving distance from Vancouver so that's where my taste buds have been spoiled.  . . The only good and tasty dishes worth eating are the hand shaven cake noodles (small quantity though) and the red bean buns.  Those two dishes are the only things worth mentioning about.  If you ever go to Vancouver, try Shanghai River and you will taste real good dumplings that melt in your mouth.. . As far as service, I would recommend all parents with toddlers to bring their own boosters or request a high chair.  Their chairs are not square shaped on the seat so we saw a child fall off the booster and chair while eating there.  Can't imagine how much it hurt.   Service was a bit slow and they won't allow you to get a table unless your whole party is there.
