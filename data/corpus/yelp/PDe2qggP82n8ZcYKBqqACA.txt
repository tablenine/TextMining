Restaurant: The Marlay House
Category: Pubs
Great place - the atmosphere, the lack of pretense, the friendly service + owners.  Good selection of drinkables.  The food varies from "pretty good" to "really good" - it's not the standout, but it works well enough when you want a nice place to just hang out, not feel rushed and have some drinks.. . Prices are fine.  . . The Grange gets lots of competition with Leon's and the Brick Store down the road, and they do out-do it in food for the former and brew selection for the latter, but they're pretty packed usually, so this makes a worthwhile alternative, not to mention really good outdoor patio seating.
