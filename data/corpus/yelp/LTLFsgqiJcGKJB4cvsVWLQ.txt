This place is super busy over the weekends.. you may wanna allocate time before coming here.. The menu is so extensive that I always seem to get lost reading it. They have so many omelette options that I kinda get confused when trying to decide. . . I'll think, "wait, what is the difference between this and that omelette? Oh.. this one is egg white only and that one is not.." why can't they just put it in one line instead of two different omelettes?? I mean, the changes are very minute.. and I can't use that much brain power in the mornings! :(. . After ordering, be prepared to wait. Food comes, it is good, but not awesome. I would say between good-great, but nothing that really spectacular.. . Noisy, crowded place. Laid back and good to go to with a bunch of friends.
