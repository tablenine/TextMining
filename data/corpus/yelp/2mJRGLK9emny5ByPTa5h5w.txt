Okay, now that was a really bomb sandwich. I was already in a good mood after having the smoothest Downtown parking experience ever. I was a little worried that the food had been too hyped up and that it wouldn't live up to my expectations, but as we edged forward in the line, I could feel my excitement building regardless.. . The bf and I ordered 1 beef double-dipped, 1 pork double-dipped, 1 lamb triple-dipped (which ended up only being double... sad), 4 Arnold Palmers, a side of coleslaw, and a slice of apple pie. All for about $35. To be honest, we weren't sure what was what until we decided to just took a bite out of all three. I figured out "my" lamb sandwich and proceeded to splatter mustard on it. This was definitely one of the best parts of the dinner -- call me crazy, but it makes a difference whether you put a little mustard on the sandwich before you take each bite or you open the sandwich and drizzle some onto the bread/meat. Both make for sinus-clearing awesomeness, but I preferred putting some on with each bite. The lamb was flavorful but a little bit dry (until I got to a fatty piece. That made me really happy.) The au jus is amazing and full of meaty goodness. With the coleslaw, I saw other reviewers' point that it was a little soggy, but as the bf said, "That's what forks are for!" He loved how the coleslaw kept the crispy integrity of the cabbage. I finished off my one sandwich with the slice of delicious apple pie. It was great -- the apples were still a little crisp, and the crust was just so tender with the right amount of flakiness. (I can't say it's like how Grandma made it because.. well.. I'm pretty sure apple pie is not very commonplace in Vietnam.). . Totally worth the drive... and extra trip to the bank for cash.
