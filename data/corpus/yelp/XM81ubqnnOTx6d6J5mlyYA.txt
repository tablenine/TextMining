Restaurant: Opera
Category: Chinese
Opera was a place I frequented several times in 2007 and a few times in 2008. I just recently went back and the place is falling under par. Our server was the only thing that kept our spirits high (Andrea). She was very kind and attentive to our needs. . . The food was not good. I don't know what happened over time but the ribs were dry, the pineapple dessert was dry and nasty, prices went up, and some of the main dishes were horrible. It was the equivalent to a normal asian restaurant just triple in price. Not everything was bad it was just not to the expectations of a nice restaurant nor $28 per meal. . . The bartender and his drinks were horrible. His attitude sucked and was not even close to inviting ,and the drinks were just bad. We had a Lychee martini and it was sour with a cherry in the bottom? Why not a Lychee? We thought they just didn't have one until I saw one on my Creme Brulee'. It's the little details like this that justify charging me $12 for that sour drink. It also sets the tone for the rest of the evening. Applebee's could of done better.. . I'm not sure what happened Opera but you need to fix it before you end up empty on a Sunday night (the night of your three items for $29)
