I know this is like an LA institution, as integral as say hollywood, to the fair functioning of the fairfax neighborhood but its just ok. Perhaps I'm spoiled after having eaten at the shangra-la that is Katz's in NYC and Shwartz's in Montreal I feel like I've eaten at the table of the corned beef gods. Canter's corned beef is a nice effort but it seems to lack the love or tradition that goes into Katz's super fatty juicy corned beef, or Schwart'z smoked meat which sticks as much to your clothing as it does to your bones. Still when craving a mount off meat on rye with saurkraut this does satisfy and is blissfully open quite late...
