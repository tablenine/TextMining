Only been there once, so maybe I'll revisit this review at some point? I had the fried plantains, which for some reason I though would look like their cookbook cover (on their website), and a linguine special of the day, which had a good mix of veggies and, lo and behold, not salty pesto (likey). . . Price-wise it's a bit high, but we're in Buckhead.... I didn't overeat, so took half of the plantains and pasta home, so theoretically that's 2 lunches (?). . I would expect a wider tea selection, and more plain &amp; natural choices.
