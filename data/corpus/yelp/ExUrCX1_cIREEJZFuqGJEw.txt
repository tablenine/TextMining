Incredible!  The aged beef was the greatest.  It is a bit pricier than other steak houses, that is due to the amount of shrinkage during aging.  I had the 28 day aged Porterhouse, but two of my colleagues had the 40 day bone in ribeye and one even went up to the 55 day ribeye and had it rare (braver man than I).  All of them raved about their steaks, and I have to admit, after having a fine Delmonico at Kinzie two nights before, and a great Porterhouse at Frankie &amp; Johnnies in New York last month, this is my new favorite.. . Sides were great, including the truffle asiago fries.  Desserts were also excellent.  I had the chocolate beignet .....yummm!  This place is THE new place for steak in my book, and I can't wait to try the one in NYC, as well as Burke's restaurant in Las Vegas.. . The service couldn't have been better.  After the meal we asked to see the Himalayan Salt lined aging room, and were given the full tour by the chef, who really seemed to enjoy her job.
