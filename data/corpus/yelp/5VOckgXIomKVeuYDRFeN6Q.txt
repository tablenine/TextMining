The ramen here is awesome, but if you're a vegetarian you should know that there is NOTHING vegetarian on the menu except I think a tempura appetizer.  You can ask for your ramen without pieces of meat in it, but it still comes in pork broth, so it's only okay if you're willing to make an exception.. . Anyway, the only reason it doesn't have four stars is because of the crazy long waits.  If I'm going to go, I make a point of going at off-hours, and even then we usually have to wait a little while.  The last time I tried to go, it was 2 PM on a Saturday and we ended up eating at a place down the block because there were like 15 or 20 people in line in front of us (and I don't think there are even 15 or 20 tables in the whole place).  So, yeah, it's so so good but only if you can get in quickly or are willing to wait outside for a realllllllllllllly long time.. . I haven't tried the new location in Monterey Park (?...maybe somewhere else.  I know it's east on the 10 kind of by Alhambra) but maybe since that isn't smack dab in the middle of Little Tokyo it has the same great noodles without the wait.
