This is a great place if you want to feel as if you are on Top Chef, eating things you'd normally not and speculating about what flavors were actually in the dish.. . Everything is really amazingly tasty and fresh.  I actually liked the sweet potato amuse bouche the best of anything we ate, but the pumpkin and corn succotash was also delicious.  And the poached egg potato puree lived up to expectations.  My girlfriend and I split 5 dishes and that was enough food for both of us.. . It is pricey, so it's a good special occasions place and reservations are probably a good idea.  I called on a Thursday for Saturday reservations and they had 5-6 or after 9 available.
