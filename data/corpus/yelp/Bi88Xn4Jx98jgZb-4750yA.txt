Fred 62 has a quirky menu, in that no two items seem to be priced the same.    They do share one feature, in that they are all overpriced by about $2.  Most of this fare is exactly what you'd find at Denny's except your server is wearing a 'funny' T-shirt, and Vincent Gallo is eating at the bar.. . Also, the famed pancakes were staggeringly normal.  Maybe they only make them special in the morning?
