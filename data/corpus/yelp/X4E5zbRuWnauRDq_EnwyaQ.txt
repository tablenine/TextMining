So, for several years the background of my computer was Chris Webber. I thought he was the most handsome man on the planet and harbored a not-so-secret desire to marry him. Well, on Saturday night, to my absolute joy, I looked up about 4 feet away from me and there he was, in all his fantastic glory. So wonderful. .       As for the club itself, I thought it would be more difficult to get in, but after 10 minutes in line, we were ushered inside. The space was cramped, but the DJ was great, and just about every person there actually apologized when they bumped into me, which is a rare, but appreciated thing. After seeing Chris Webber, nothing else could get much better.
