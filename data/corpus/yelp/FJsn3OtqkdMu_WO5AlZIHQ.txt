Great brunch spot if you have out-of-towners with you and are looking for a spot where you can sit outside, have a good meal, and enjoy great coffee.  Also, a great bakery in of itself. My only knock on this place is if you come here a couple of times, the menu gets extremely boring since it's limited and nothing is "amazing."  It's good...but nothing that will make you say "I love this place and need to come back here again soon."  Be prepared for a long wait anytime after 10:30am on weekends too.  . . One last comment....if they ever feature the Chicken Salad Sandwich on the specials menu, definitely get it.  It's awesome.  Probably the best thing I've had here, despite often coming here for breakfast/brunch.
