Friends and I used to go here when we were students at UCLA.  The food is pretty standard and consistent.  Does everyone like their salsa?  Well, they certainly don't give you enough of it when you take food to go.. . The location isn't the best as it's close to the Freeway overpass.  It's noisy and you might get mugged so don't park too far away.
