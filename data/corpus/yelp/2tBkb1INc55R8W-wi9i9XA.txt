Sorry...I hate to disagree with the other reviews, but I gotta speak my mind.  My family has been going to Newport for many years, but the past couple of trips have been less than satisfactory meals.  We came for lunch again today.  The hot and sour soup was...well...lukewarm.  Why?  It was strange.  The chunks (tofu, black fungus, or whatnot)were warm, but the soup was cold...so i guess that makes the soup, overall, lukewarm.  We got our usual dishes and everything came out lukewarm.  The kungpao chicken was still tasty and the lobster was mediocre... but compared to other restaurants, Newport definitely falls short now.  I most likely won't be returning.
