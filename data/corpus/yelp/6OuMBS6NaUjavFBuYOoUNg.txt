3.4.10: I came here several times, but I have not bothered to update until now. It is the New Year and the place has a new location that I have not written about yet. I really like the new location mainly due to the size. I did not feel crowded as I did in the past. In addition, the place has a contemporary and Chinese design feel to it, which makes the place looks fresh. Â . . On to the food, I always felt as if their dinner pricing is on the pricey side. One day I decided to tag along to eat lunch here after Ultimate Frisbee. We ordered quite a bit of stuff: Fish Fillet, Clam with Basil, Calamari, Two chicken dishes and I cannot remember the rest. Lunch specials are good size portioned and priced. It was price along the lines of approximately $6-$9 a dish. Not too shabby considering the dinner menu on the average ranges from $13+. The food was delicious. I could not stop thinking how everything tastes so Mmm mMm good. . . I was super duper satisfied, I have gone two more time after this date listed and at all times I was super happy. . . Therefore, for those of you who may think this place are overrated or not worth it, think again!. . "Do a little dance, and get down tonight"
