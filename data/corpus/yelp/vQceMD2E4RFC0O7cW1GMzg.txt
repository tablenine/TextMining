There is a wait there almost at every visit to DTF.....well worth the wait though. huh expanded restaurant?? they took over the desert place next door....awesome! If you need to burn some time, there is a shop next door. . . All the dumplings come bite size, thin skin, juicy center! Their red bean desert dumplings are good....I've tried one of their special dumplings that run out by midday...nothing special, not sure why it sells out so quick. The chicken soup is a must after a night of drinking. =)
