Category: Tapas Bars
First, there were the lost reservations . . . and I was not the only one in my party to feel like we were being blamed for the mix-up because we did not receive a day-of confirmation phone call.  Since it was our first time, we did not know this was standard practice.. . Secondly, I have a feeling the menu has been changed because several dishes we saw in other reviews were not there.  They have a fairly limited menu in my opinion as well.. . Finally, the portion sizes . . . I am well aware that tapas are small dishes but it gets ridiculous when you pay 10 dollars for 4 dates wrapped in bacon  . . . that's literally $2.50 per bite.  My favorite tapas restaurant The Courtyard recently closed, but their dates in bacon dish was comparably priced for double if not more the number of dates.  When you go with a group to a tapas restaurant, you want a dish you can easily share with everyone, not a dish where you have to fork and knife it into teeny bits so that everyone is only able to taste it on half a taste bud.  I've been to other tapas restaurants in LA and and the Valley and these were by far the smallest portion sizes I've seen.  Even the fries, which are pretty much the cheapest thing they can give you, came in a really small portion size.. . In the end, this restaurant didn't live up to its hype and there are better places out there.
