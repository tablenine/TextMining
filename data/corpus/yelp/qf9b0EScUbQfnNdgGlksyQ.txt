Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
It's been a while but I will keep this one simple.... . . 18 beers rotating on tap and so many damn sammy's to choose from or to create your own if you're a control freak. The also have a dozen or so sandwiches for each meat selection (turkey, smoked chicken, corned beef, roast, beef, pork options like tenderloin sandwiches, etc) Choices of 4-5 breads and homemade sides to boot. They offer beer pairing suggestions which is a nice touch. Daily specials too. . . In short, the sandwiches are good, not great, but the beer list and the fact that you have so many options is what makes this a cool place. . . Hit up the patio this summer, get yourself a cold beer and a big ass sandwich and enjoy
