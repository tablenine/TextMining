Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Prices are good and servers are very accommodating.  My friends and I went there last weekend and they managed to seat the 12 of us in 15 minutes on a packed Saturday!  No guarantees though. We just got lucky.. . Here's the low-down for those who don't have time to read the long reviews:. . Valet: $2.50. . Performances: Asian Elvis and unknown lady. They sing the old stuff so it's fun to sing along.. . What we ordered:. Pad Thai w/Chicken. Beef Panang . Kee Mao Noodles (thai spicy...it was HOT HOT HOT) but oh-so-delicious. Palms Thai Noodles - Eh...it needs sauce. . BBQ Beef - One of my new favorites!. Pinapple fried rice. Coconut soup. ...and much more. . I highly recommend this place!
