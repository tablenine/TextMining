Great service and interesting flavors!  My wife and I have been trying to find the time to go to Home Bistro for months.  We ended up getting a last minute late (9:30pm) reservation on a Saturday, and we could not be more happy with the place.  Initially, due to an event on Halsted, we ended up waiting 15 minutes for a table.  The host apologized and made sure that we had glasses for our wine while we waited.  The good service continued with our waiter offering helpful suggestions, when we had trouble deciding.  We had the artichoke and edam fritters and the fried haloumi cheese to start.  The fritters were good sized and tasty, and the fried cheese was paired with a strawberry jam and baby greens to make an interesting treat.  For entrees, we ordered a braised pork belly special, the salmon, mussels and the red grouper.  The grouper included 5 short-neck clams, chick peas and a few olives for just a touch of brine counter point to this well balanced dish.  The pork belly had tasty onion jam and was served over a cheesy polenta (only negative was that the pork was a little salty - not an issue for my polish blood).  The mussels looked good, but I only got a taste of the truffle oil fries, which I recommend if you enjoy potatoes at all.  The salmon was served over lentils.  We finished with a  wonderful apple crisp with caramel and whipped cream (not too fluffy, but still light).  After the meal, the wait staff made no effort to hurry us out.  Overall, I applaud the service and would come back for the food - perhaps for the Wednesday price fix menu.
