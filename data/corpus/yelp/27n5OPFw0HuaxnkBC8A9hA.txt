My favorite for Cuban food.  I order their roasted chicken with garlic.  I never go home hungry or unhappy.  The fried plantains are always a great finishing touch.  I usually leave the black beans alone, despite being a black beans fan -- there is too much other good food on the plate to focus on the beans.  . . Go early or expect a wait.
