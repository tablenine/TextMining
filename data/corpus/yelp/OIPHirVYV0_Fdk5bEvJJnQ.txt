Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
my first experience tonight at manna was simply mediocre. I would have enjoyed it more if the motherfucking (excuse my language but it needed to be stated) valet BOY did not leave my headlights on and left me stranded in the parking lot for an hour until my friends showed up. Otherwise this restaurant would have gotten at least a 4 stars due to the price of the unlimited BBQ get all beef brisket it's fast and easy to cook. Just park your own car and don't give him a tip he'll screw you over!!
