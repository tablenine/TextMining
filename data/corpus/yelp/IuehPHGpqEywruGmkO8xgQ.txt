I ate here a few weekends ago with my roommate. The best part of the experience for me was when the waitress took my order. Without a hint of sarcasm in my face, I asked her if the turkey sandwich was vegetarian. She was dumbfounded and didn't quite know how to respond. Then I laughed. It was awesome.. . So yeah, the food and stuff... The food was good and as advertised--comfort food. The drinks were strong. The service was decent. My glass of water was always full. I can't say that I was blown away by anything, but I certainly wouldn't be opposed to going back either.
