I have heard a lot about The Grange from my friends and have been waiting to check it out!  Today myself and a coworker had lunch there and it was wonderful (turkey sandwich/sliders and risotto balls).  The service was great, our server was very friendly.  The food was very tasty and great size portions.. The interior is very clean and very nice.  Looking forward to going for beers very soon.
