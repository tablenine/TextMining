SUper cute inside. Little lounge..then the main dining area.. Super cute hostess stand.  Super cute kitchen.  Slightly fancy.. they sell food that's ready to eat and ready to go.  quite pricey. but looks good.  They get their bread from the bread bar I think.. . Macarons are $1.65 each.  Earl grey is yummy.  Lemon is yummy.  Other ones..Not sure. haha  Other desserts in the dessert case look yummy.  various tarts and cakes and such.. I havn't had their food..but it looked good as I was watching them run it out of the kitchen to the tables.
