Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
I'd been hearing about The Veggie Grill since it opened, read about it in the Vegetarian Times editorial, and being vegan, I knew I had to try it. . . I loved that it's very meat-eater friendly (it doesn't mention everything being vegan anywhere on the menu, I only found out because I asked). I also liked that the menu described tempeh and their veggie protein blends, things non-vegans/vegetarians may not be familiar with. . . I got the Santa Fe Crispy Chickin' with sweetheart fries and it was SO good! The patty was very crispy and yummy, and the spiced vegan mayo was delicious. Most reviewers have already written about the fries, so I won't go on about them, but they are very good.. . My husband (a carnivore) even liked it! He got the Chill Out Wings and sweetheart fries. He says it was "very good and the wings had a good texture that closely resembled chicken!". . If you're vegan/vegetarian, this is the perfect place to bring your friends who aren't. If you aren't vegan/vegetarian, give it a try anyway, you'll be glad you did!
