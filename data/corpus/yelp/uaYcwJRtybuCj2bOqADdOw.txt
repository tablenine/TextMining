Rattlesnake in sausage form?!?  The idea was at first so absurd to me.  After one bite... okay, still a strange idea but I'm liking it...  two more bites.... ah who really knows what sausages are made out of anyway?  All I know is this one is good!. . So this is the trendy exotic sausage joint known as Wurstkuche.  Tucked away in the always changing Arts District, it's quite a shining beacon for those looking for chow that's different than their usual fare.  It's also a great place for beer lovers as they have a whole page of beers, locally and foreign, most of which are on tap.  Oh and can't forget to mention the Belgian double dipped fries that can be paired with any of their delicious dipping sauces.. . For about $20, you can get your happy meal of exotic sausage, fries and adult beverage.  Oh and if you're not into rattlesnake, they have plenty, plenty other flavors too, exotic and boring.. . My only cons I'd say is that there's usually a line before you order.  Luckily, you can order your beers at the bar in the back so you don't have to go through others to get another round.  Another improvement I think is that this place seems a bit too hip or trendy for its own good.  A little bit of fun German music played in the dining area might make for a livelier atmosphere in the back, given the communal seating.  Still, anyplace that introduces something new to me gets two thumbs in my book... ain't no place like this one in LA.
