Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I love how efficient Din Tai Fung's are! Even when it's at it's busiest, you won't wait that long. It's Chinese restaurant business at it's best. They get you in and they get you out of there fast! Still my favorite place for dumplings, but unfortunately they don't even come close to the full blown experience and yumminess that you experience at the original Din Tai Fung in Taipei and the newer one in Shanghai. P.S. I've never had it, but I was told the chicken dumpling is bad (but, who gets a chicken dumpling anyway unless you're in/from the south, right?)
