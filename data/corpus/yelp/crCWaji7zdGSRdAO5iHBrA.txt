Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
Hands down, my favorite pizza place, ever!. . I love Ian's Pizza, I cannot get enough of it. I take every friend from out of town here and they always love it. I dig every kind of pizza they have, especially the chicken burrito and chicken penne. . I really like their punch card. After 10 punches, you get a free slice, I know I've had more than 5 free slices. . Every week, they have a different special slice. I remember one they had with shrimp, it was so insanely good. I wish they always had it. . All of the people who work here are super nice and the guys making the pizzas never skimp on the toppings and really care about what they are making. It would be awesome to work here, if for nothing else, getting a free lunch every day. I am happy this place is so close to my house. I Hope they have great success in Chicago and are around for a long time. . You really should get to Ian's and discover all the awesome pizzas you'll never be able to eat at any other pizza joint. . I can not say enough good things about them.
