The menu is creative and the entrees are well prepared.  We started with the grilled artichoke and the beet salad.  Both were delicious.  On to the main course:  I had the cumin spiced pork chop with mac and cheese and sugar snap peas.  Very generous portions, very well prepared.  The pork chop was succulent, perfectly seasoned.  The mac and cheese was stunning: smoked gouda cheese--excellent.  Chocolate bread pudding for dessert.  Excellent.. . My only hang up about the place is the service.  Very friendly, mind you, and attentive.  Still, I had the feeling that none of them have been trained.  It was as if they were new to the food industry--all of them.  Still, it was more amusing than anything, but they should step it up a notch with regard to the formality of service.
