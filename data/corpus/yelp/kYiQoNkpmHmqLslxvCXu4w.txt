Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Spotted.. . A new haven, in the heart of the city of the angels.. Where the crowd chatter and the elegant white&amp;gold-crusted decor mix in such a eloquent rhythm. . . Italian delicatessen, farmers-market -style.. Healthy and tasty. and they open EARLY (6.30a. rejoice early birdies). and stayed up LATE too - makes life so much better.. . Food is Divine.  . . The thin crust pizza can easily be the winner, though I highly recommend everyone to try their portobello fries at least once  (Picture this:  portobello mushroom, sliced thinly and fried in deep (and not so greasy) batter with the oh-so-orgasmic pesto sauce.. . Or go for caprese when you feel like bloating. Can't go wrong.. . For sugar-craver: Vanilla Chai Latte and Lavender Macaroons.. . Ahhh Bottega Louie.. . A spoonful of gourmet food and fine wine that leaves you crave for more (either/or) makes you sigh in contentment.. . Life is good.
