We went after I had read a review praising the ahi steak sandwich when I was super craving seared rare ahi...And I have to concur that it was delectable!  Jonny had the gorganzola burger medium rare...cooked to perfection! They both came with those skinny fries that are so easy to eat!!!  The service was friendly and fast!  They stay open late even on weeknights so I know we will be going back to try all the other yummy sounding options!
