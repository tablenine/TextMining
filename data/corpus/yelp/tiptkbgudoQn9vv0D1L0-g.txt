I was driving past this place and stopped by to check it out.  it's very cute inside.  I've only had the strawberry ice cream sandwiches here but they are so good, I can have dreams about them.  . . don't know about the food and the green tea (it was tooo leafy for my taste) but the ice cream sandwiches are to die for.
