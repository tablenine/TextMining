Service, or lack thereof is the problem here. And  it's not an issue of nationality, hierarchy, customs, or traditions. It's just bad business practices and a flow of ignorant fresh guests or browbeaten victims trudging back to this place for a beatdown and some decent Korean food.. . I've come here twice over the last 10+ years and wondered each time what was wrong with the people running this place. I hear from Korean and non-Korean friends that the food is ok.. . Last month, I invited my family here for a lunch at my brother in law's suggestion to give it a second chance . So I drive my parents, wife, kids... and they walk in, sit down at an open table while I go park. No greetings, no hellos. By the time I walk in a couple of minutes later, I see the waitress yelling at my father to move our group to another table. I look around, there's nobody in the place, and I'm thinking to myself, why are you insisting that we move near the door? Why can't we pick the table? So I walk over and tell her that we are expecting two more (bro-in-law, sis) and that we like the table. And I tell her to stop yelling.. . She goes right back to telling us to move.  Now he's a more broad minded man than I and would have moved, but the only moving I did was to walk my family out. Now we all know there aren't too many places within the city for good Korean food, but there are plenty of avenues where the appetizers don't start with insults "on the house".. . Did I mention that I am Korean?. This place is an equal opportunity hellhole. Stay away from here.
