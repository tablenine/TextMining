After reading a lot of great things about this restaurant, my husband and I decided to give it a try.  Sadly, I wasn't to thrilled about the food.  The decor and ambiance are great, very Hollywood, but the food was just okay.  . . Here are some of the items we tried and the "grade" I thought they deserved:. 1. Kanpachi Serrano - (B-). 2. Grilled Mongolian Lamb Chops - (C). 3. 911 Spicy Tuna - (C). 4. Frightened Geisha - (C). 5.Octopussy - (B)
