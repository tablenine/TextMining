The best thing about this restaurant is the Friday night "barely free" happy hour. For $2.95, you can indulge in an all-you-can-eat mini-buffet with two types of paella, chips and salsa, and the boniato and plaintain croquetas. Add a pitcher of sangria to split amongst friends and you have a very affordable meal. . . We also tried some things off of the menu. A mini beef taco, which tasted sort of barbecue sauce-ish, and a shrimp skewer, which had the same barbecue sauce flavor. Man, those Latins love the bar-b-que. I also had the oyster shooter. An oyster in a little bloody mary shot glass and for an extra buck they throw some vodka in there too. It was good. . . Nothing else off of the menu really stood out as a "must try." As my friend said "this is like the Latin version of a chain restaurant...like the Latin TGI Friday's." Except there were no pieces of Latin flair. . . I would definitely go back for the Friday special. Also, their drink menu was phenomenal so I might go back on a Friday or Saturday night for some salsa dancing and drinkies. Pisco sours, y'all!
