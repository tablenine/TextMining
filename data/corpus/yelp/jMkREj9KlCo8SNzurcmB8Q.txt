Restaurant: Kevin Rathbun Steak
Category: Steakhouses
Overall, another great experience.  This time I started with the caesar salad and the portion was enough for two people.  However, just a typical caesar salad.  Nothing notable.  I ordered the filet mignon medium rare and it was cooked the way I ordered, tender and succulent.  For my side, I had the scalloped sweet potatoes with gruyere.  One word describes that dish - delicious!. . On this occasion, Kevin Rathbun happened to be on site working in the kitchen which was nice to see.. . Rathbun Steak remains a fav of mine.
