Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
My dad took me here one afternoon on a whim... I suppose he had a craving for Prime Rib. . . This is definitely not a place to go if you're a penny pincher - a bill for two easily runs over $100 (more if you order cocktails). That said, the experience and food are completely worth the sky-high prices. The food is mostly prepared in front of you by waiters that roll trays around to the tables. The waitress who made our salad did so with incredible zest, and the dressing on the salad is yet to be beat in my opinion. The grilled asparagus was to die for, and, of course, the prime rib was mouth watering.. . I would recommend dressing up for this place... the crowd tends to be very high-brow, and it's always better to be dressed up than dressed down.
