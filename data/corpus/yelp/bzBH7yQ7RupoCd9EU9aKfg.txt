Restaurant: Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar
Category: Seafood
Probably my favorite steakhouse in Chicago. Skip the lines at Gibson's and head over here, they have pretty much the same menu and even share a kitchen.. . Steaks are very good, but the seafood is really to kill for. The crabcakes are just spectacular, not to mention the neon sauce they serve it with. And what is a steakhouse without a hearty helping of creamed spinach? Nothing, thats what... Good thing Hugo's has the best I've ever had. . True to it's name, they also serve frog legs which I gave a shot for the first time. Tasty, and yes, tastes like chicken.. . Also highly recommended for people watching on a nice summer day in Near North.
