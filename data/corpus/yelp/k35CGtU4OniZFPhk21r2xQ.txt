Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The Griddle is definitely a MUST STOP place if you're in L.A.  The food is amazing and the atmosphere is cozy. When walking in from the back, you have to take a peek in the 'VIP' room, cause you never know what celebrity is gettin' their grub on!. . Food: Pancakes and French Toast are B.I.G. and amazing.. . Service: Was spot on, the few times that I've been there.... . Venue: Cozy and crowded...long wait, but worth it.
