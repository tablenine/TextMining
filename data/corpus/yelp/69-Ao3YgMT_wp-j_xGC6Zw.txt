Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
We went to Casa Bianca on a Saturday night and it was around a 40 minute wait.  The restaurant serves wine or beer during the wait, which is pretty smart.. . We chose the sausage and mushroom pizza.  The thin-crust pizza was quite good, even with canned mushrooms.  Their homemade sausage was flavorful.  Service was good and I really liked the waitress.  . . Some of the best pizza I've had in a while.
