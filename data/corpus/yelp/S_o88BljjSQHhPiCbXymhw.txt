Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
The most important thing about korean bbq is the quality of the meat and soowoon galbi has this in spades.  I (along with my 4 other friends from my high school asian posse) ordered the $99 Combo A which included whole beef ribs, beef sirlion, beef rib eye, pork neck meat, marinated beef sirlion, beef brisket, panchan, soba noodle soup, and one bottle of beer or soju.  All the meat was so good but the rib eye was frankly the best I have had at korean bbq ever.  Tender and deliciously marbled with fat.  The panchan could have been a little more inventive, but my staples (the thinly sliced daikon and pickled daikon) were provided.  Given the quality of the meat (and the affordability), this is one of my new favorites in koreatown.
