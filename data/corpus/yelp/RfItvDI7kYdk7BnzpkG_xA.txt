Having red velvet cake from this place topped off a nice vacay to Atlanta. We actually had three different slices our last night there. Two red velvet cakes - one with chocolate frosting/filling and the other with cream cheese - and one mint chocolate cake. Oh it was pure heaven. The cakes are ridiculously rich and I admire anyone who can finish a slice on their own. I didn't finish my slice so I had it for breakfast the next morning at the airport!
