Biker bar vibe, unique, funky, awesome food, awesome drinks. They have this sweet roofdeck that is great for the summer. We come here for work lunch during hte summer.. . Huge sandwiches, great brunch, awesome chili. Their fried egg sandwich is amazing. Add avocado and split it because its enormous. One of my faves. Easy to find street parking.
