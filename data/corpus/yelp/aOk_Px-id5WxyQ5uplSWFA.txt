This was a great place to come and have a relaxing summer evening last night.  The key is to go with the expectation that you will have really, really slow service.  For instance, the table behind us got up and left the restaurant literally 30 seconds before their food arrived, presumably because they had been waiting such a long time (which I think spurred our waitress to get our food out more quickly, so thanks!).  . . Our waitress was clearly over busy and also completely socially inept and almost unable to communicate...  Also, a low-talker!  Although I guess I would be scared of the customers too if I worked here.  . . The thing is, the food just isn't that good that people make it out to be.  The cheeseburger is just ok, onion rings were over cooked and the beer selection is super-meh.  So why put up with bad service to get this food?  I'm not sure.  Maybe you love places that look like the early 70s?
