blue velvet cake... oh my... so good, they have blueberries in them... and it wasn't too sweet... i don't like what my family calls "american cake", its too sweet... this was the right amount of sweetness and the frosting was light, fantastic and i didn't feel like i was rotting my teeth or too guilty after having a slice... but its sooo good, it has to be bad for you!. . oh and the coconut macaroons, yummy!  . . the table next to us got a turtle i believe?  not sure, he wasn't trying to make an issue at all and just asked if it should be gooey-er since all ones he ever had at other places were and immediately they gave him another one and said "we just want you to be happy" and the second one was in fact gooey-er so he was a happy camper...that was great customer service imo
