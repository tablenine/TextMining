I came with a few girlfriends after work.  We had a reservation, but ended up camping out at the bar and doing bar fine dining (one of my fav ways to go big). . Everything is delicious, portioned to perfection, and created with care.. . We started with grilled octopus, which rivals that of Petro's in Manhattan Beach.  There are three large juicy pieces grilled al dente. For cheese (they have a whole menu of Mozzarella) we ordered the Burricotti, which had a clean taste and was steeped over fresh bread with artichoke and a few other goodies.. . For the main course, I was pretty full off of wine, so i got a plate of Maltagliati pasta with wild boar ragu.  This was the highlight of the evening for me.  The pasta is very flat thickly cut ribbons, home-made like your Italian grandma used to make, and the ragu adds a nice texture and flavor.  Buonissimo!. . My friend had linguini with clams, which was perfectly cooked.  Another friend had salmon--which was good, but a little bit bland.. . For dessert we got the pannacotta and some cappuccinos (another place that knows how to make them) The only thing we missed was biscotti--we always crave biscotti these days
