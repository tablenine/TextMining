Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's is good...like, CRACK GOOD.. . I think God made me find a place in West Los Angeles for a reason. Reason being, to keep me from visiting Porto's in Burbank on the DAILY. . . It was my very first time yesterday stopping by this place. I love how its HUGE! I was on the way to the airport to drop off my sister. We had time to kill so we decided to explore this Porto's goodness. I got 2 Dulce de Leche Kisses and 1 Cheese Roll. By the time we left the bakery, I consumed all 3 crack goods in my stomach. I never even had it before and after my first time, I ate it all under 5 minutes. 5 MINUTES! Are you kidding me? Thank God, I am not diabetic. . . Dont be too intimidated by the line, it goes by QUICK! If you are overwhelmed by the variety of pastries to choose from, may I suggest the Dulce de Leche Kisses and Cheese Rolls. Ultimate bakery crack paradise.
