This place got degraded from my previous visit.. First being greated nicely, then sat on our table for 10 mins with no waiter introducing himself to us.. . Then got moved to different table, waited another 5 mins before the waiter came to take the order, without introducing himself.. No smile on his part, nor a courteous service. When asked for a spoon it was like asking him for the world.... . The food itself was good, but the service was really miserable.. Even tho our server Andres tried really hard to serve us, he should show that he cared. . . The check arrived faster than the service itself.. I am not sure if he had a bad day, but won't step back in this restaurant at all regardless if the food was good.
