Category: Thai
Hubby and I spent a cozy evening eating basil squid, lettuce wraps and shrimp curry. The atmosphere is soothing, the mango martini's are to die for and the food was good but nothing extraordinary. The prices are medium range and we have gone back since the first time we ate there (I was craving the mango martini's) but it's not the first place we want to go when we're in the mood for good Thai.
