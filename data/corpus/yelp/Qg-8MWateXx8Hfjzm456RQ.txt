After an uneventful morning shopping at the Paige denim sample sale, my friend suggested that we eat at Milk for lunch. I shrugged and agreed, still sulking over the Laurel Canyons with the perfect dark wash and cute sparkly flower pattern with rhinestones on the butt-cheeks that were two-sizes too small. (My friend by the way, fit them snugly, and was lucky to walk out with a whopping 3 pairs of jeans..grrr...). . Eating at Milk cheered me up though! Because I recalled exactly why I am not 2 sizes smaller.... I am utterly, passionately in love with tasting good food. And I was delighted to find that Milk serves good food!. . For lunch, we had the tomato garbanzo soup du jour, herbed roasted chicken breast sandwich, oober goober cookie, and the MILKIE way malt. It was all fabulous.. especially the Ooey Gooey double chocolate cookies.. such rich, decadent chocolate flavor.. eating those was bliss!. . I may not fit those jeans, but hey at least I'm enjoyin' life eating goood food! As a consolation to myself, I bought a nice pair of Hudsons instead the next day. On sale, in my size, AND it was better than the Paige denim anyway!
