Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
My chicken stroganoff tasted like they mixed it with thousand island dressing. I didn't notice it 'til my friend pointed it out. "..it tastes like thousand island"... "no it doesn't..... wait, no, yes it does actually. boo." But always get fried plantains when i eat Brazilian. Theirs was pretty good.. . Our server was really good though. Very attentive to our party. Wide range of food on the menu.. it took me a while to choose: from salads to pizzas to pastas and sandwiches. Parking was pretty easy too.. lots of free meter parking during dinner time.
