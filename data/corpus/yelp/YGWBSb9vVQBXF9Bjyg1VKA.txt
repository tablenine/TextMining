2nd visit with my friend and i was not disappointed at all still good as it was. If you are incredibly picky on what you want in your burger this is the place worth to visit. You can choose your bun, meat, size, greens, and sauce which is very nice. For the ladies you can order your burger in bowl ( without bun) on the greens of your choice like salad. I ordered Grilled chicken in the bowl and i was touched. They really can grill chicken. I have never expevteed to have suck nice experience with chicken since i am not that into it. All the ingredients in my greens was so fresh. For guys, they have many types of fries and they come on the huge plate so be ready to keep your mouth busy. . . The negatives of the restaurant is the tiring slow service! You wait 3 minutes for menu 4 minutes for water 3 more minutes to get your ordered drink 10 or more minutes to get your fries 7 or so minutes to get you meal. So if you are very hungry and hit this place. You will die before the food comes. Horrible!!! You will barely have chance to see you servers face and they practically throw your foods and drinks on the table instead of putting them. well, Maybe they need some more servers. But food is good and definitely going back with hope; they may improve their service!
