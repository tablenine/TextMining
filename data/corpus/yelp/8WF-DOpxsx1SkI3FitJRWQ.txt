went here once on an odd evening with a few friends...we got all mature and sipped on some wine and got some fancy little oar-dervs (not in the mood to try to spell that out right now)...but this place was pretty good, nice little ambience inside and pretty cozy, friendly people working there, i would go back sometime, the food we ate was definitely unique and creative and i enjoyed it.
