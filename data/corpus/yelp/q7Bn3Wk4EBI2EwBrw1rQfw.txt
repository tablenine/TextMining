Food is fantastic. Service is spotty but I've never taken is personally - kind of like dealing with an ADHD kid. Â The house wine is usually so bad your first instinct is to spit it out - that said, a lot of great wines on the menu, and a lot of crappy wines that are over priced; so could take a couple of tries to settle in on one that works.
