This is place is pretty cool.  The food is really nummy and i recommend on sharing the dishes.  the portions are well...  proportional *not too big*.  i always manage to have leftovers, but perhaps that's because i don't eat much.  the drinks are nice as well.  all in all, i like the place.  i enjoy the environment which compliments the food.  and i do agree with some peeps that the dishes can be quite sweet.
