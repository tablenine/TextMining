Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
It's a bit sad that the first thing I think of when Bottega Louie comes to mind- more than the food is the hassle.  . It's a big hassle to get a table and to get a server to pay attention to you and be served.. . Yes the ambiance is quite impressive.  It reminded me of a bustling Manhattan eatery but one can only look around and people watch for so long.  At some point, the service needs to come through.. . The food did not disappoint (when it finally came) so perhaps I would give this place more chances.  We shall see.
