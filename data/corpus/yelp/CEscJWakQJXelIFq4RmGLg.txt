Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The wait gets pretty bad but I roll in with my elderly father (after getting the handicap parking spot right in front aka the most rock star parking spot in the lot if you're going to DTF) and he's basically VIP there so we get seated almost immediately. Sorry, not everyone is as cool as my dad. . The xiao long baos are like bite-size, juice-filled pouches of perfection. I could eat them non-stop. The beef noodle soup is also excellent. The small side orders are delicious. The porkchop fried rice is tasty. Basically, you can't go wrong.. Xiao long baos from Din Tai Fung are partly to blame for my failed anorexia attempts.
