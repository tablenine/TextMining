We were impressed on our first visit yesterday, a Monday night.   We had spring rolls and some spicy beef and noodle appetizer.    The spring rolls were nothing special but we loved the beef and noodle dish.   My wife had chicken with leeks and I had what was listed on the menu as Roasted Fish.  It was actually deep fried and served "dry" with no sauce.  I loved it.   It was had a crispy, spicy coating and moist inside.   I could not place the spices but it almost seemed more Indian than Chinese.   . . We enjoyed our own bottle of wine with no hassle and no corking fee.. . I can't wait to return and explore more of the menu.
