Don't tell my bf that The Office Burger has blue cheese (Maytag blue) in it.  The burger is the only thing that piqued our interest.   Or anybody-in-the-bar's interest, it seemed.   The frites too.  Sweet potato fries are pretty common and $7 is no reason to have it here, even if it is borne by a shopping cart. . FO2 is much more spacious and less chaotic.  Plus easy parking.  Last thing i wanna do is eat while sitting on a barstool with my bf stealing bites while standing behind me, because the bar is packed like sardines (i.e. the normal scene of the original FO).. . He had a Craftsman 1930s Prohibition Lager - good lacing, very hoppy. . . I had a glass of Domaine Alfred Syrah Chamisal Vineyard 2005.  The red goes with the burger, but at a Ruth's-Chris-glass-of-wine price of $14, I could have had another burger plus fries.   Not worth the dineros.  But i must thank my bf for treating me so.. . If you're one of those trend-chasers wanting to give Father's Office a try, suck it up and go to the original one and cross it off your list.  Remember to eat the signature burger and have a glass on tap.  . . see pics!
