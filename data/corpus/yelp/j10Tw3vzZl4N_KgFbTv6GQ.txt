Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
This was a pretty standard suburban Asian restaurant. The decor is very upscale, modern, and date appropriate. We had the roti canai (meh), some special seafood in curry sauce dish (awesome and deserves 5 stars), and pad see ewe (too sweet). They were probably half full. Service was fine. I ended up leaving my umbrella. They put it in the umbrella bucket and I had someone retrieve it the next day for me. I've been around a lot of Thai - this place seemed mediocre in comparison with my other Thai experiences in NYC and that's my reasoning for the 3 stars.
