perhaps a celebrity hang out, witnessed someone from desperate housewives.... . it would've been a solid 5 if the pita and hummus i had ordered wasn't exactly dry. it tasted not as gooey and the texture was like rubber glue ...  other than that, i believe this place deserves a fat 5 stars.. . as the year 2oo9 hit, ive been living a whole new lifestyle ... im trying to eat as much vegan food as possible, and believe it or not, it's actually darn yummy ... most people freak out, esp those who haven't given it a chance, but its so good... sooo sooo good .... . place is super spacious, has an outdoors and an indoors, but it can get too hot if you sit outside.... . lots to choose from. lots of fresh and chilled beverages, small platters, salads, main courses, sammies, wraps, and more...  they sell dressings, sauces and spreads per pint, if i remember it was like $8 or something. they even customize wedding cakes.... . . he ordered the el bandito rojo for $14 which is basically enchilada... picture uploaded. omg, it was SOOO good. yummay for yo tummay .... my tofu wrap can come alacarte or with a basic, which means you can get a selection of beans and grains, veggies and proteins for $4 more. mine was good too but his enchilada was sooo yummay ... argh!!!!. . i left happy. isn't that all that matters? . . sry real food, you gotta stop supplying DRY hummus btw...
