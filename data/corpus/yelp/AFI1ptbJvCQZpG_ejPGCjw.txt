Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Twenty bucks buys just about one of every item on the menu with change to spare. Besides bargain-basement prices, the secret to Tito's success is loyal customers with no taste buds (no offense to anyone who loves titos). Seriously I don't know what the hypes all about? Their hard tacos tasted EXACTLY like jack in the cracks tacos: fried, soggy and bleh. Enchiladas are a major disappointment, there was nothing but cheese rolled up inside with some salsa slathered on top. I think I would have had a better meal eating at Taco Del Mar. enuff said.. . ,
