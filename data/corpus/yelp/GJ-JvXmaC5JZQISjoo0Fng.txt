I really don't know what the rave is about this place.  First time here I had the Hainan chicken because it was highly recommended and while here I noticed a lot of people order the curry dish.  I've had better curry than this.... it had no curry flavor, no coconut milk taste, just a hint of spiciness.  Thick crust pizza ... ok.... not my preference.  Pasta... no good.  Creme brulee... no way... it's so fast foodish.  Salad... expensive and mediocre.
