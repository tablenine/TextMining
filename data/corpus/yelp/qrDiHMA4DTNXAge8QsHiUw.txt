The decor is great.  Teal green alligator seats that are comfy, red booths line the back wall...more comfort.  . . At first I didn't get "noticed" for a good 15 min...actually I had to go ask for  menu's.  It wasn't as busy when I got here around 9.45 but, 10AM got really busy.  Although the crowd had that "hip-urban" Silverlake vibe...you could tell they all were "well-off".  You have to be to afford the food and drinks here on a regular basis.  . . The 10AM crowd....which will not be bringing me back here...at least at this time.  Mom's and their babies!  There's probably 6 of them right now running around and the atmosphere is pretty loud.  So, don't come here to study.  But, if you are a non-working new mom and want to make friend....DO come here.. . The down falls:. prices (but the food is served in a fancy way and on cute china.  . . only 2 hours free wi fi.  In other words...move it along.. . the good stuff:. free parking. good coffee. people watching. outdoor seating for peeps with dogs.. . All in all it was ok.  But, I'd rather go to Intelligentsia on Sunset.
