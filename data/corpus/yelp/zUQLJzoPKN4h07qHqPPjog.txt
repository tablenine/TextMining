Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I love this place. I've only been 2 times. Great prime rib and lots of it. I stuffed myself. Our waitress wasn't that great but she tried. This place can get pricey when start doing add ons such as the lobster tails(they weren't that great) or a nice bottle of wine. Overall I like it and I will return.
