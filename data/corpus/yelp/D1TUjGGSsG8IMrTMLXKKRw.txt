Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
My boyfriend and I went to Fogo De Chao during DineLA week.  It was our first time trying Brazilian BBQ.  The salad bar, dinner sides, and meats were all you can eat. . . The salad bar was okay. I was more interested in the different meats and sides. The fried plantains, garlic mashed potatoes, and cheese bread were delicious!. . Of all the meats, we really enjoyed the lamb chops. They were well seasoned.  There were so many different kinds of meat that everything started to just taste like MEAT. The chicken wings and sausages gave us some variety and they were juicy and well seasoned. . . We tried the Keylime Pie and Flan.  The desserts were good, cant go wrong there. . . The food deserved 4 stars.. but the service was horrible. . . They sat us in the wine room against the wall. It was so hard to get our waiter's attention. I had to yell out "Excuse Me" to get some more water. The meat servers would pass by and skip us. We spent about two and a half hours at the restaurant and  majority of the time we were waiting for service. . . Also, the waiter said he would give us complimentary desserts because we were "being so patient" when really the desserts were part of our fixed 3 course meal menu for DineLA week. I don't appreciate the lies. . . While he was clearing the table, he dropped my dirty fork on my dress.. I was not happy with our waiter. . . It was one unlucky first time experience. I'm not sure if I'll ever come back.
