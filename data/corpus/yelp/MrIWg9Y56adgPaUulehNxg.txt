Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
to quote Mr. Flav of PE, "don't believe the hype.". . not that UB was a bad experience, but $50 for lunch? two entrees, a side, and some dumplings...oy vay.. . thank goodness the place was empty when we went in, as I had heard about how hard it was to get a table. Â service was extremely friendly and helpful.. . $12 for a bowl of ramen with a few pieces of pork belly just seemed a bit over the top for me.... . i am glad i tried UB, but i feel the same when i pay $15.00 for a burrito.
