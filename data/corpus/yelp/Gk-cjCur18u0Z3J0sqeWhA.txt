Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I'm wondering if the reviewer before me is sure they are reviewing the right joint..... . The food is delicious, the service is even better. Joseph--the owner--is the man! The first time I visited with my boyfriend, he asked us our names, then asked if we wanted to try something that wasn't on the menu, some shrimp cervichie (sp?) that he had made for his own dinner that night. I hadn't eaten shrimp since I was 7, but he was so nice and enthusiastic, I had to give it a try. It was delicious!. . I'm going there tonight and I'm going to try the shrimp taco. But I've had the fish taco several times before and have been more than satisfied each time.. . The salsa's are soooooo good. The seafood is fried to perfection. And did I mention, Joseph is Fing awesome? Nuff said. Try it out if you haven't yet.
