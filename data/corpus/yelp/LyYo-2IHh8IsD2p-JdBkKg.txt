I was looking for a spot to eat lunch while I was working in the area and stumbled upon this place from Yelp.  I ordered the pupusas like many of you recommended and was really disappointed in the food.  Everything was very bland and I wasn't very satisfied at all.  Not to mention (although I will anyways) the parking was pretty horrific.  I may have to give this place the benefit of the doubt and give it another try, but until then... I would try to eat somewhere else.
