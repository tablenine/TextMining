Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Daikokuya reminds me of the tiny ramen-ya in Japan, minus the vending machine that despenses your meal ticket and the very orderly line that stands alongside it waiting for a spot at the counter. Here you sign your name on a clipboard and mill around outside till your name's called. My wife usually tries to get us to go a few shops down to Mr. Ramen, to avoid the wait, but the two just don't compare.  . . My wife likes the little extras that you can add on at Mr. Ramen (mostly she likes a crap ton of bean sprouts and tofu). Daikokuya's ramen, though needs no additions. Glistening jewels of pork fat, tender cuts of kurobuta (black pig), noodles served the way you want (just ask), and a savory shoyu/tonkatsu broth. There are some other things on the menu that are good, but go for the ramen. Other than the food, the waitstaff is very friendly and the décor of old Japanese signs and movie posters is nice.. . It seems that most Yelpers know what's up, but if you think ramen only comes from little instant packages in your cupboard, come here to taste how this Japanese staple should be prepared... oh yeah, and watch Tampopo.
