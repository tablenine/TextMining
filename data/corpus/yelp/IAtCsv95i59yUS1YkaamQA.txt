Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
When you need to sit down with a cup of coffee and get some work done or just think a little bit, Grey Dog Cafe is the place to be. They play the music just loud enough so that you can't focus on what the person next to you is saying, but not so loud that you can't hear your own thoughts. It's also nice to have the option to get good food in case you're hungry but don't want to loose your rhythm.
