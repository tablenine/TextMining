Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Palm's Thai is great.  They have an extensive menu full of delicious Thai dishes at great prices.  Service is great, the waiters are friendly and will actually come to your table to check up on you, which is a total shocker for cheap Asian restaurants.  You also gotta love their Thai Elvis, he's pretty entertaining!  When he's not performing, other singers take the stage, so the atmosphere here is always energetic.  It's a good place to have dinner w/ a group of friends before heading out for a fun night in Hollywood.
