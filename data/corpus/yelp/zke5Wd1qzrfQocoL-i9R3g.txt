Restaurant: Harry &amp; Sons
Category: Sushi Bars
This is actually weird... they own another Thai restaurant a couple blocks away, also in the Highlands. They have the same exact menu but Harry and Sons has sushi. Sweet right? The setting seems more set for groups, but all in all I like them both. Whether it's H&amp;S or Surin of Thailand.
