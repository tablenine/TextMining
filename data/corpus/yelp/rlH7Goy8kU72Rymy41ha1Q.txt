Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
It has been far too long since I've visited Mozza. I'm not sure if it's still tough to get reservations, but we typically like to go early-ish for dinner and sit at the bar, where they save seats for walk-ins. While this is a pretty good strategy, it's hard to get all the way over there for early dinner from Santa Monica, making this a special occasion place. . . I can confidently say that this is the best pizza I've had in my life. Mozza made me realize that pizza is really 90% about the crust. And Mozza's crust is absolutely perfect: bubbly, fluffy, crusty and chewy all at once. . . My faves include the pizza that has cheese (forget what kind) and sage, and the sausage and fennel pizza. The squash blossoms are also awesome on a pizza or by themselves as an appetizer. For dessert be sure to try to butterscotch pudding dish. . . The service is amazing, and it's a treat to watch the pizza artists at work when you eat at the bar facing the oven. The decor is really simple but warm, and reminds me a lot of my favorite places in San Francisco, where great eateries tend to me more low-key and less sceney. . . Mozza has a firm spot on my all time fave list and it's not going anywhere soon!
