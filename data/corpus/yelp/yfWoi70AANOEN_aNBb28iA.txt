They didn't have the pupusas but the kimchee quesadilla, korean short ribs taco, spicy chicken taco, and the spicy pork were good.  Definitely try it for a taste that is different from your average taco truck.  Tired, so not a long review but yes, the genius of using viral marketing to infect L.A. with korean taco fever.  Thankfully, I got there around 6-7 pm so the wait wasn't too long.  Good stuff.  Saving the korean short rib burrito for later ;D
