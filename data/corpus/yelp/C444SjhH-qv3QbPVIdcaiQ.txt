The Â first time I went here was about 5 or maybe even 6 years ago for New Year's Eve and I thought it was fantastic, BUT NOW after eating the sushi all over California - this time around - not so impressive. Not at all.. . It was nothing special. The salad was soggy (gross) and food just OK.. . I give it 3 stars however because I was with the best company and we sat outside which was really nice and comfy - perfect humid summer night.. . I think California sushi blows Chicago sushi away, ya that's probably it.
