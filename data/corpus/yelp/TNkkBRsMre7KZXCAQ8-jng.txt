Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
My friend and I decided to pay the Osteria a visit to celebrate our October birthdays together, it's full house on a Monday evening, at around 8:45pm, there was still people waiting to be seated by the bar area, the restaurant has got great vibes and fun ambiance.  I love cheese but not necessarily pastas; however, Mozzerella and pastas served here, I would be happy to eat everyday, the taste and qualities are so fresh and consistent, it's a must try, and absolutely the best I have had outside of Italy; the low light were some of the main dishes, the monk fish was unimpressive, and the sweetbreads were not prepared correctly, a pity, the spotty service also had plenty of room for improvement, the sommilier was excellent, thought, and this helped to balance things out nicely; besides, we love to eat and drink and always know how to enjoy ourselves.   . Ask to be seated at the Mozzerella Bar for a casual outing, it seemed great fun, I would return here again, with no hesitation.
