If Bloomberg is going to pass this low sodium initiative, the first thing to go is going to be ilili's fries. Those things are so salty, and SO GOOD. . . And the rest of the food isn't so bad either.. . For $16 at lunch, you can cop a salad or sandwich and a side. If you were paying attention just now, you would've heard me say that the fries were amazing. But if you're one of those health nuts*, you could try the baba ghanouj (nice and smoky), or a salad of some kind. They even bring out big poofy bread** to eat it with.. . If you're going the sandwich route, I don't think you can do better than the lamb shank. Juicy and messy, but DOPE. Although, I could've done without the unexplained nuts all over the plate. Cashews, pistachios, etc. I don't know why they were there. Forgive me, ilili, if I have just misunderstood your culinary vision.. . Be aware though, this place is a bit classy. The kind of restaurant you want to bring your parents, or a potential client. Not me. Don't bring me here. I'd probably embarrass you.. _________. . *What are ya, one of those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.. **Poofy bread is one of my favorite kinds of bread.
