I had the reasonably priced Mojito Chicken with black beans and rice.  It came with a delectable bowl of potato cheese soup.  Our server was excellent.  The best part, it was quiet, the lighting was low and good.  Perfect for conversation.  If you want a fast or slow sit-down dinner, you could have either.  From the outside, it looks like some jejune design abortion, inside, it's charming and nice.  The parking lot is awkward.
