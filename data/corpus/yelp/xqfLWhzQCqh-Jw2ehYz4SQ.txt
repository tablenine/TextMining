Had high hopes for this place since I enjoyed its sister restaurant, Sola.  But left extremely disappointed.  $20 3-course prix fixe on Mondays and Tuesdays would be a good deal if the food was palatable.  Short rib dish was largerly flavorless.  Trout with risotto was salty and sour.  Chocolate pudding dessert had weak flavor.  Highlight was plum crisp cookies with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Perhaps it was an off night.  Perhaps their main menu entrees are better.  Either way, don't see myself making a return visit to find out.
