Expensive brunch foods? Check. Celebrity sighting? Check. Sucky parking? Check. Giant ass line? Surprisingly no. . . And no on the sucky parking, but only because I walked there with a friend. Much better than trying to park. There was a huge line outside, and me and my friend were afraid it would be a long wait, but we were seated immediately! Seriously?!? But this was Father's Day! How can a pretentious and famous brunch spot NOT have a wait? Was everyone waiting for outside tables? Or for valet? Possibly to retrieve their cars from valet. That can take a while.. . So even though it was lunchtime I ordered cinnamon walnut pancakes. They were the yum. But what is up with these trendy brunch spots and their lack of service? The hot waiter flashed us a smile and took our order, but then completely disappeared. We had to flag him down for syrup, for our check, for water, for really everything else after he knew he was going to get paid. Blech. Anyways, I'm always conflicted at these joints because although I want pancakes, I also want eggs and bacon and hashbrowns as well. But trendy spots do not make breakfast plates like that. Pancakes are pancakes, and that's all you get.. . My friend's lunch wrap with sweet potato fries looked awesome as well. I stole a bunch of her fries.. . Anyways, I believe this is my first review of a place with 200+ reviews... there's really nothing new I can add. Other than eat inside. I know it's supposed to be all romantic eating outside, but you're pretty much on the sidewalk, and Third street is noisy. It is not relaxed and lovely, it is hot and exhaust-fume-y.
