Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
So after years of eating every type of instant ramen that exists, it's nice to eat at a proper ramen restaurant every now and then to taste what ramen is supposed to be like.. . The ramen at Orochon is excellent and the portions are huge.  The pork meat in the soup is tender and tasty, and this joint can definitely bring the heat  This is my favorite ramen place in all of Cali, cause you get mad noodles and soup for a reasonable price under $10.. . The "Special #2" is the spiciest food I've ever eaten at a restaurant, and anyone that finishes a giant bowl in less than 30 mins gets their picture on the restaurant's wall of fame.. . You can find my picture up there 'cause I'm super awesome and everything.. . Of course, most sane diners should not eat the Special #2, and all will be pleasantly satisfied with the mild to moderate spicy ramens Orochon has to offer.. . A couple of notes:. . 1.  If you do try the Special #2, I suggest going with the "soy sauce" flavor because "salt" flavor gets extremely salty by the end of the bowl. . . 2.  Contrary to popular belief, if you kill the Special #2 Challenge, the ramen ain't on the house, so don't get cocky expecting a free lunch.. . 3.  This place is sorta hard to find.. . 4.  Wait times for getting a table can be long...30 mins for a table for 6 at 1:30 pm on a Sunday last I checked.
