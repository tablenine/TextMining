Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
The food, its not fresh, probably frozen, probably parboiled a few days ago, but their flavors and amount of spice is inconsistent and unreliable. If you order mild, you may get hot and vice versa. But the thing that effects my rating most is the service, it is horrible, they have under paid under trained students hosting and waiting tables with no experience (and probably in back cooking) who don't care or know about customer service. . . Go to a real seafood restaurant for better food and better service.
