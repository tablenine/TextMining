i love this place. I dont mind the wait so much, i can kill some time at the bakery across the way.  They have the best dumplings ever.  Theres not much to say about this place but that its the best.  Juicy pork dumplings, crab dumplings, ugh need i say more?  Dont hate this place, just try it again.  Its just yum.
