Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
I agree that there are better Asian fusion places throughout the city, but this is the line up you need to order for a fresh summer meal at Penny's, which I get at least once a week when it gets warm:. . Tom Kha Kai Soup, which is odd since I'm talking about the summer but this soup is kind of unreal (tastes like a mild penang) try it.. . and. . Sesame Beef Noodle now this is the dish I'm talking about it's a cold noodle entree with fresh Asian veggies and this awesome chili-lime vinaigrette that you pour over the dish (note ask for an additional sauce one is not enough) if you haven't experienced this dish you missing out for sure.
