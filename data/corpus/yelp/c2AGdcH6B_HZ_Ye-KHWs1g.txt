Great sandwich for $5.42 (tax included).  Just go with the classic banh mi, I didn't really like the chicken or the sloppy bao.  The classic has three kinds of pork, some vegetables, and a custom amount of spicyness in a fresh french roll.  The place has cool blown-up pictures of Vietnam as wallpaper and when the weather is nice the store is opened up to the street (unfortunately the street is St. Marks so it can be noisy and smelly).  If you get your sandwich to go it'll take about 8 minutes and it's a little awkward trying to find a place to stand and wait.  But worth it for the sandwich.
