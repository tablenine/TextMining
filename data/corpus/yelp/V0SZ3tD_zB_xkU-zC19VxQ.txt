I had the pork chops and they were heavenly.  I have referred several friends here simply for that dish.  The cheese flight was a fun way to try new foods and the wine list has extremely helpful descriptions for a wine-novice like myself.  A bit pricey, but I'd definitely go back...  I've been dreaming about the pork chops since I left!
