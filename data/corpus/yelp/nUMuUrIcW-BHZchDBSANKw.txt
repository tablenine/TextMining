Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Good pizza, bad wait.  Had the prosciutto with arugula. Was quite tasty, but a little too much arugula.  I mean it was like a little green and leafy mountain on the top of my pizza.  Only drawback was the ridiculous wait.  Not necessarily Mozza's fault though.  Just way too many people wanting to eat at a relatively tiny establishment.   No matter what time you get there, you're guaranteed to wait at least 20 minutes.
