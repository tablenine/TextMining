Category: Chinese
Despite arriving five minutes before they closed for the afternoon we were fed freshly made dumplings, noodles, rice, and vegetables.  Father  agreed that everything was seasoned well.  I wanted to bring my boyfriend back here for his birthday but he says money doesn't grow on trees.  My brother eats here every week but didn't take my family until today, in order to complete my father's birthday trifecta of buying a lottery ticket, eating Chinese food, and singing off-key to The Platters in the car.  My parents loved the chicken fried noodle and fluffy shrimp fried rice.  . . Our sauteed seasonal vegetable was bok choy.  The shrimp and pork shiaomei are also good.  We ordered two servings of awesome juicy pork dumplings.  We're going back in a couple of weeks for my mother's birthday.  With hot black sesame buns, our lunch cost about $15 per person.
