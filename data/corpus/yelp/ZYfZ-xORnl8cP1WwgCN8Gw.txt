I don't really remember their burger other than the smoky BBQ sauce dribbling down the sides of my mouth and me licking it up as if I'm licking Heaven's water. I think the burger itself was good?. . But what I do remember is their apple pie. So warm topped off with melting ice cream.... . Everyone sits at the counter, has an Americana feel to it. I can't think of the apropos adjective, but Americana should suffice. Warm, friendly, a definite lunch spot. I've been here only on the weekends, but I'm sure on weekdays, the counter rarely cools down.. . LOVE IT!
