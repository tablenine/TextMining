Restaurant: Souper Jenny
Category: Caterers
With the name Souper Jenny I assumed there would be lots of soups but only 4 were offered--2 being cold soups. Ehhhh.  I did the 12/$ lunch special--chicken soup and half a sandwich-canned drink and obviously not a made in- house cookie. Soup was pretty good  and generous portion but not hot ---barely warm. Sandwiches are pre-made---I had the veggie and it was good although the pita bread was somewhat soggy. The cookie made me mad--for 12/$ have some creativity! Not some Sysco frozen cookie!!!!  I think with Souper in the name there should be at least 6 soups offered daily---at least --and more hot than cold.
