Restaurant: Yeah! Burger
Category: Burgers
A definitive 'hell yeah' for Yeah! Burger. We rolled in late this afternoon and the place was dead. With everyone complaining about the lines, we planned to beat the rush and we did (but when we left around 5:30, the place was already half full--on Father's Day, no less).. . Honestly, I can't think of a negative thing to say about this place. I personally loved my burger. The pimento cheese was some of the best I've had and the bacon was perfectly crisp (soggy bacon is bad bacon in my book). Finishing it all off, the homemade pickles--essentially sliced cukes--were a nice touch, too. I even liked the Southern bun from H&amp;F bakery, which had the sponginess of a brioche roll.. . The sides were also surprisingly good, but Nova and I stupidly ordered the same ones. If we'd ordered different sides, we could've sampled more of what was offered, particularly the fried pickles. That said though, the mix of fries and onion rings were pretty damn tasty. Initially, I thought the onion rings might be a little undercooked, but they were actually delicious...and as addictive as crack. . . All in all, I thought what I paid and what I got were pretty well aligned. For two burgers, two sides and two drinks, we dropped about $27. Which, when you think about it, is about the same you'd pay at a restaurant like Chili's or Applebee's for the same thing. Factor in the local and organic ingredients and it's a pretty fair price, I think. . . In any case--if you couldn't already tell--we'll be coming back. With all the possible burger combos, I imagine it'll be a while before I repeat myself. There are easily 20+ toppings, and another ten condiments and sauces. And I'm not even factoring in the other choices like the chili cheese dog, concretes, floats and more.
