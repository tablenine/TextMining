This is THE place to go on Sundays if you love sangria!  Although it's not on the menu, you can ask for the all-you-can drink sangria special for $15 bucks a person.  It doesn't open until 5pm, though.  This is a great little jewel of a place hidden in Buckhead. The vibrant ambiance is a great match to the tapas on the menu. Everything we ordered was great.  Service was excellent and the live music was refreshing, too. Gotta LOVE local talent!
