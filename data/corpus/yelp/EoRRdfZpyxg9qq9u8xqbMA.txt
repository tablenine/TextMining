I had been wanting to try out Baraonda for quite some time.  My father was in town for the weekend and we stopped by in the afternoon.  It was a nice little spot.  I had hawaiian pizza and it was excellent.  I have never had such great ham on a pizza.  My father told me his lasagna was very good.  I don't know why I haven't been back yet after such a positive experience.
