Where is the joy in Joy Yee?  I did not find much.. . Bright YELLOW room.  Yes, it screams yellow.. . Uncomfortable chairs.. . Questionable hygiene - server had really dirty fingernails.. . Huge, confusing menu.. . Food isn't bad, which raises it to two stars from the one I otherwise would given it.  I've had crispy noodles with seafood (excellent) and seafood udon (OK).  . . Otherwise, blech.
