45 yelpers before me can tell you that the sushi here is fantastic, so I won't waste your time telling you about my mostly identical experience. What I'm really going to do is share a little secret... come on in a little closer. That's it... ok, listen up.... . If you are looking for a fancy drink on an off night or waiting for your table on a Friday night, I HIGHLY recommend that you head to the upstairs bar. There you will find a nice looking gentleman behind the bar named Jeremy. Say hello, tell him the flavors you like and then ask him to make you "something." Prepare to be amazed by what you get. I gave Jeremy the explicit direction of "not sweet" and was graced with quite a fine cucumber-ginger saketini that he shook up on the spot. It was excellent. It wasn't the cheapest drink I have ever had, but I will certainly make my way there if I am looking for "something" and have no idea what the hell that is.
