I love a good happy hour. The Yard House has a Great happy hour! . . They have half off apps and certain alcoholic beverages. The apps aren't ALL the fried crap you get at so many other happy hours.. The hubby and I went yesterday evening before going to see Avatar (yup, finally saw it). We try to get a different app each time we go. Last night it was the mooo shooo egg rolls -they were very tasty. We also had the turkey sliders. Which were fantastic.. The selection of beers is unbelievable. I had the seasonal New Belgium and a mix called the Dark Castle, which was New Castle and some other dark beer. So good. Hubby selected a couple IPAs.. Service was fine.. My only problem was not with the establishment, it was with my bladder. I do not recommend drinking 2 beers and a large water before watching a 3 hour movie.
