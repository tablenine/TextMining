Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I was taken here as an unassuming tag along during a work lunch with employee and boss, and had to steady myself within the first two minutes of sitting down as I was blown away by not only the food menu, but also the extensive beer list.  I will admit I am a beer nut, and the list (all US breweries) is one of the most extensive I've seen.  More on that later, I am going to give this review in two stages: food and beer.. . Food - To say the menu here is daunting would be a slight understatement.  Sandwiches, the main fare, are broken down by meat type, and combine any number of ingredients.  There are approximately 80 pre-arranged sandwiches and you have the ability to construct your own.  I have sampled several, including the Wolfie P, Diego R, and Hermann H, which were Turkey, Steak, and Ham based respectively.  All have been outstanding!  I have found the ingredients well balanced, the meat and breads fresh, and the sides unique and delicious.  There are also several appetizers and salads if the sandwiches wouldn't fit your needs.  Any sandwich can be turned into a salad which ranks high on the flexibility scale.  Overall, the food is fresh, unique, and delicious, what more can you ask for?. . Beer - Self proclaimed beer-nut, and I was astonished by this beer list.  All US breweries, selection broken down by type, with outstanding descriptions of flavor profile, abv, and gravity.  My only complaint is that they don't have more on draft, but the overall selection more than makes up for that.  The other winning note about the beer selection is the list of rotating seasonal brews that they have.  A great appreciation of beer is not necessary to enjoy this list because of the detailed explanations, but for those of us that do consider beer an art form, no disappointment at Jerry's.
