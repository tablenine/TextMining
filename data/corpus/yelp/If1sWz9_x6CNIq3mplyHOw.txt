Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I'd give this place 5 stars but I'm deducting one star because it's a bit pricey for the amount of chicken that you get. Any chicken meal with the waffles is great but when the hunger is upon me, I'll need to order an addition dish because their tiny chicken pieces just isn't enough.
