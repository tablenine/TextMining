Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
This place used to be alot better a few years ago!!! They used to take a little more time on their food and the portions were alot bigger!!!  Like one of the other review states, this is more of a fusion then a authentic Brazilian restaurant but, none the less its still pretty bomb!!! They have a wide variety of entrees from pasta to pizza, sandwiches, and of course Brazilian entrees as well. They make a really good homemade Sangria!!! The black bean soup is my favorite thing on the menu!!! The prices are fair, anywhere from 9 to 17 bucks!!! Oh yea and did I mention this place delivers!!! This is a good place to unwind after a concert at the Hollywood bowl or after a long night of  whatever you do. I remeber you used to be able to smoke in the enclosed patio area!!! I will be back as always!!!. . Pros: Good food, cheap, relaxing dim lighting!!!. Cons: Could get crowded, shakey tables!!!
