Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pinks! It's the kind of place I would love... in theory. Unfortunately in practice, there are several things that aren't working in Pink's favor:. . 1. The HYPE. Before you even get to Pink's, you hear about it - "you have to go there", "it's an LA landmark", etc. ... even if you try to avoid the talk, you can't help but subliminally develop high expectations of eating a cosmically orgasmic hot dog while rubbing elbows with Steven Spielberg. . . 2. The crowd. Ugh, the last time I was here was around 2:30pm on a Wednesday, and there was still a 20-25 minute line. Granted, the wait can get much longer, but still?! Also, the parking lot is cramped and fills up easily. So bring some patience, a good book, or some boozed up friends to help you pass the time in line.. . 3. The hot dogs. So, you've heard the hype and stood in line for x minutes, staring at the menu of tacky celebrity-named hot dogs. And you finally order. And the food arrives and ... the moment comes when you take that first bite... AND!!!.... it tastes like a hot dog. Womp womp. It's a good hot dog, very plump (so much that it pops when you bite into it), but still a hot dog. I can't think of any hot dog that is worth the wait. Yes, there are definitely worse hot dogs out there, but I guess unless you're a hot dog connoisseur Â [thank you spell check], there isn't much that noteworthy about the hot dogs themselves. There are a bunch of different toppings that are decent, but not extraordinary.. . So, it's Pinks. It's been here for a while. And the people will still come. Eh, I might come back on occasion too... I mean, it's an LA landmark - you HAVE to go!
