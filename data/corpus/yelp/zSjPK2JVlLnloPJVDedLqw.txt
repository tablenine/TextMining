Restaurant: Crustacean
Category: Vietnamese
I've come to this Crustacean multiple of times within the past few years. They do have some pretty delicous food (most of the time), and I dont mind splurging on good food. I recommend their garlic noodles, crab, shaken beef, halibut, ragout eggplant and seabass. But sometimes, I've been there on an off night when the garlic noodles are way too oily and you become sick to your stomach after only 2 bites. Sometimes, their halibut or seabass isn't seasoned right and tastes bland.. . Valentines Day: NEVER EVER come to Crustacean on Valentines Day. They manadate a hold on a credit card for reservations for a prix fixe meal. That I don't mind, but their service was horrible that night. Because they charge 2x more than a regular night, they want to rack in the money by overbooking the restaurant and fitting in as many tables and chairs as possible. About 2 years ago, my bf and I made reservations for 9pm. We got there a little before 9pm and was told to wait about 15 minutes while they set up our table. LIARS! We waited an hour. ONE HOUR!! Sure, within that hour we saw some famous people, like Chris Rock, Xzibit, and one of the Wayan Brothers, but I was hungry, and when I'm hungry, I'm bitchy. . . When they finally sat us, the tables were so close together that it felt like a family dinner. When we ordered from the prix fixe menu, surprise, it was so late that they ran out of an appetizer and a dessert. How do they run out? For a restaurant like Crustacean, shouldn't they have planned ahead of time and made sure they had enough of each dish to go around? And it really wasn't our fault since we really should have been orrdering an hour earlier.
