This place may be a tad bit pricey, but I still like it. I haven't eaten at the restaurant (yet), but I did grab a chai latte and a yummy bakery item this morning on my way to my acupuncture appointment. It's a really cute little place in Lincoln Square, with a friendly staff and what looks to be a delicious menu. I look forward to returning for more tasty treats and a visit to the restaurant.
