Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I love love love their Ramen and the good service of course!. . Eventhough they only have one soup base, but it is the best soup base I had so far! I like how you can choose how soft you want the noodle to be, and the level of oil and flavor!. . Also like their small salad (only $1)! Amazing house dressing!. . Don't forget to try their Gyoza and takoyaki~!
