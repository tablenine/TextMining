Restaurant: Taka Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
If you are looking for an excellent quality Japanese food, Taka's place is one of the best in Atlanta.  His style is pop and stylish new Japanese.  But this is not a fusion place.  Taka knows how to combine the wonderful traditional authentic Japanese with comteporary style Japanese flavor.  When I say comteporary style Japanese, it does not mean Fusion or Western Style.  If you taste his food, you know what I mean.. His place is a little bit pricey, but definitely worth it. Authentic dishes, great service, and great food - couldn't ask for much more. Also, location is great! It's in Buckhead.
