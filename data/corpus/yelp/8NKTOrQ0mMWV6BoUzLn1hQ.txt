Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I really like Flo-- Its a little crowded to wait in the winter, but they give you free coffee while you wait.  . . A friend and I try a new brunch place every month or so- I had a huevos verdes because I saw someone else with it and it looked so good!  I would love to go back and try everything else!  My dining partner really liked hers as well.. . The dinner menu looks really good and they had some enticing special events.
