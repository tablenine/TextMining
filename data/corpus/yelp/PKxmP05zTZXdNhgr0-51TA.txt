Restaurant: LA Mill Coffee Boutique
Category: Desserts
I first tasted LA MILL coffee at a restaurant and was so amazed by the quality of a cup of brewed coffee that I asked the waiter what coffee they use.  This happened again when I ordered coffee at Patina.  I normally don't like to drive out of my way to go to a coffee shop, but this place is the real deal and I finally made my way out here when I had friends visit me from out of town who are coffee fiends.  It was well worth the trip and everyone was duly impressed by the quality of the coffee.
