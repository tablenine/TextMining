On a work-related trip to Chicago, we discovered this place on Yelp (big surprise!) and headed out to Wicker Park for some Italian cuisine.  We had no reservation and no wait.. . The food was amazing, from the pear carpaccio to the dumplings to the lava cake for dessert.. . I generally find Americanized Italian food bland and boring, but this place is neither.  We were all very pleased with our meals and with our server, who called us all "princesses." . It was a wonderful start to our trip.
