Not sure if this Kogi Truck is permanently stationed outside The Brigg but the last few times I've been there on a weekend night, the truck is parked in the lot right by.  . . After all the hype, I was expecting something good.  Maybe it's that the increased popularity resulted in the inevitable decline of the quality of food, but I thought the food was just aight.  In fact, my sense is that any Korean who is capable of making their own marinaded beef and the marinaded greens that you get at a restaurant could make a better version of the standard kalbi taco.  That being said, it's pretty good when you want a bite after a night of drinking.
