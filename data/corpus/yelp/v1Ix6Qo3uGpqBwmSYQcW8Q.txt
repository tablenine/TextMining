You know, I don't even remember the food, it was breakfast food and not too memorable.  It was 10 minutes to 11 when we went in.  My friend asked if she could see a lunch menu and was told that lunch started at 11.  So we took a few more minutes to look at the breakfast menu.  Okay 5 minutes till lunch is served- seeing as businesses survive on the money they receive from their customers, you would think we could see a lunch menu by then!  I should have left then and there, but someone in the group wanted to stay.  . All I will say is customer service was terrible!  I wouldn't have been surprised if I had found a surprise in my eggs!  I will never return.
