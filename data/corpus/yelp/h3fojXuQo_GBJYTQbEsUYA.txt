I'm  a little tired of people complaining about the Korean servers.  Every korean place i've ever been to are all cold and too point.  I don't know or care if it's a race issue, Korean food is out of this world, i'll deal with it.  There wasn't anything unusual about that at Cho Sun Ok.  This place is tiny and we had to wait awhile.  Everything was fantastic but the jab chae was edible but far to oily for my liking. . . Otherwise, 4 stars and two blocks away!! I'll be back :)
