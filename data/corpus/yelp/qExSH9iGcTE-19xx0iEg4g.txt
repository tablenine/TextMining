What a charming little place!  Located in the heart of Midtown and walking distance to Piedmont Park, this restaurant overlooks a bustling vibrant area on 10th Street.  . . I came here for lunch and ordered a 3 item combo for $8.99...  I indulged (key word) in the Turkish Shepard Salad, Veggie Panini, and the Hummus (and a couple glasses of Cab- I was both drinking and eating my lunch).  For dessert, I shared the Pumpkin Cheesecake to complement the Halloween month.. . While the food was certainly delicious, what was also appealling were the cute decorative notes with, among other things, stars and lamps hanging from the ceiling.  Also, they have weekly events including Martini specials and even a Wii game night!  . . Drinks and food are reasonably priced, and this spot is great for people watching and good times.  Highly recommended- I will be there again and am looking forward to it.
