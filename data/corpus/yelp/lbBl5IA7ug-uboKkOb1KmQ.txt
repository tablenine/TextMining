first of all, i'm rating the Andersonville location. not sure why, but the food is consistently better here than the downtown location.  . . I love their Lamb Shank and dill rice.  So tasty.  And the portions are very generous.  I never leave hungry.  The kebabs are great as well.  Great for groups, and reasonably priced.
