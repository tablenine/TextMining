I went with a friend initially to check out the macarons; she heard this place had some of the best in LA so it was a must-visit. However, after getting there we realized they also had a very chic-cute restaurant so we sat down for lunch.. . We ordered small plates - got the tuna, egg and asparagus, portabello mushroom fries, and Rock shrimp in a light rice vinaigrette with cucumber. Of all of the dishes, YOU MUST GET THE MUSHROOM FRIES. Absolutely must. They are deepfried-tastic with garlic mayo magic.. . While on the list of "musts", you must also try their macarons! Really awkward to order them because they and the staff are behind a giant glass display and there is no written list of flavors so you have to constantly ask the staff to repeat the names. but when I went they had raspberry chocolate, salted caramel, pistachio, vanilla, dark chocolate, banana caramel, coffee.
