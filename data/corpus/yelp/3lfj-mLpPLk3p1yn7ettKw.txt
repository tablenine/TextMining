Not much else to add to the myriad of reviews.  I came, I saw, I was awed by the desserts.  The grasshopper was more minty than I was expecting, but the moonpie, oh my.  The sandwiches and salads I've tried are tasty as well.  The parking is a bit of a pain, so I'm always prepared for neighborhood parking hunts and a block or so walk to get my fix.
