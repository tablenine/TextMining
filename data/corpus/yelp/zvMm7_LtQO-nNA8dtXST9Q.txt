Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Five stars for the delectable side dishes, bitchin' wine list, Bill Clinton sightings and "cougar" crowd / old coot pickup scene upstairs - delightfully entertaining!!. . Steaks used to be six stars, then dropped in quality recently when this group began syndicating "Mastros" restaurants and the original chef moved on...as it turns out there is not enough good filet to go around. Still a very good steak, but not the palate-gasmic steak of years gone by.... . Regrettably, only 3 stars for the confused maitre'd and reservationists. Despite being on time for our business dinner reservation we were made to wait for almost an hour until our table was ready. Not cool..... . Overall, a fairly solid steakhouse that is getting a little, ahem, grey around the edges...but still an excellent meal.
