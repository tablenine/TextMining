Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
I've visited several of the Buckhead Life restaurants, and this was not my favorite one.  There was nothing really wrong with the food, and the service I received was good, but like other reviewers have said, nothing really stood out.  I did enjoy the fun "snazzy diner" feel, but the food was not impressive overall.. . I did really enjoy the famous homemade potato chips with Maytag bleu cheese sauce.  It's possible that the reason I wasn't wowed by my meal was that I ate too many of these yummy chips.  :). . I had the "Surf and Turf" entree, and it was good enough.  It just wasn't astounding.  The dessert I had was good, although I'm not sure now that I remember what it was.  I think it was the chocolate cake sundae, though.. . In conclusion, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it wasn't bad, either.
