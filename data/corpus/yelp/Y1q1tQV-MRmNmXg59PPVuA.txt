Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
FOOD:. Usually we are skeptical of any sushi place that is a pan-asian restaurant, but we were pleasantly surprised.  The fish is very fresh (sometimes you get sushi that tastes a little fishy.. at cheap sushi places) and they stick to fairly traditional rolls.  There are little differences here and there when they put  drop of sriracha on top of spicy mayo on the spicy rolls, which could be a good or bad thing depending how much you like sriracha.  Spider rolls here are huge- so big you may have to take two bites for one piece, but so yummy.  Next time we come we have to try the sashimi- that's the real test when it comes to these kind of places.. . SERVICE:. Our waiter was so nice- almost abnormally nice.  We came in when it was still fairly early so they were very attentive to us and the sushi came out pretty quick.  When we got the bill, they also gave us a complimentary dessert!  I have no idea why, but it was very yummy and just a nice gesture that makes me want to come back for their friendliness.. . AMBIANCE:. It's a really tight space, but still very chic nonetheless.  It reminded us of a London restaurant- posh but all the tables are so close, you're pretty much eating with the people next to you.  Even for the time we went, it was still fairly lively in there.  Because the back space was a lot darker than the front (just because there's big windows at the front) the ambiance does seem to change, though probably unintended, but it's a nice variation.
