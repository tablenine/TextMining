If you're schlepin': worth the drive!. I've only been once, but it wouldn't surprise me if you can't go wrong ordering anything off the menu.. . I got the pull pork sandwich that comes with caramelized onions, a red cabbage kinda slaw and north carolina style bbq p-pork....The NC style sauce is legit, peeps from the south will surely attest. Its got the vinegary kick. They got extra bottles of it to just make everything all extra moist and delicious! The bread is whatever...the sandwich is so drenched in savory juices it really wouldn't matter what kind of bread they use. . They claim to serve Belgian fries. I lived in Holland &amp; Belgium for extended periods of time. These aren't Belgian. Nor do they stock the array of sauces the a Belgian Pommes Frites stand would have...but, the fries are good...Their special mayo is garlicy as hell, but i'm sure most people dig it...I stuck to my usual euro ketchup/mayo mashup! . . Oh, and they have a pretty nice selection of brews both on tap and bottled. Just a well done place...nice service. Its open late so if you live far, just wait out the smog huffing on the freeways and go later in the evening!. . The Oinkster is where its @!
