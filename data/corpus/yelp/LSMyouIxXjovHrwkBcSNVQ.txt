I don't like diners in general, but I really like this one. I usually have the BLT with mac and cheese and a milkshake...that sounds really gross all typed out in a list like that...but it is quite tasty. The servers are friendly, and I've never had to wait for a table, even during the brunch rush. . . I had a really fun, random night here with my fiance where we brought the redeye crossword (practice for when I graduate to the real Sunday paper crosswords) and ate and sat until we finshed. The food and the crossword. And my milkshake.
