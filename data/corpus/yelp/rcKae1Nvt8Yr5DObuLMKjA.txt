Came here to celebrate a month ago, and forgot to write an review. Small restaurant, very busy so make sure you make reservations. We were late by 20 min, and waited for our table to be done by the bar for another 10. Service was great, and the food was just delicious. . We had two bottles of wine, 4 appetizers, 2 diff pastas, 4 entree and dessert. Bill was paid by a friend total of about $600. Not too bad for 4 people. Pizza Mozza is right next door and I heard that was pretty good too. Sorry I don't remember exactly what we ordered, I believe we all had different entrees which consisted of duck, beef, lamb and chicken.
