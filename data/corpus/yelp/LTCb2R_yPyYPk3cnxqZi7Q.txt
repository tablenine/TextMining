Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I'm still trying to figure out what my five-star is. This place is really close, but not quite there yet. I LOVE dumplings and Din Tai Fung is the best I've been able to find around here. The juicy pork dumplings are definitely my favorite. Bight the skin a little, suck out the juice, add a little black vinegar and ginger. Mmmm.... good stuff! The pork and shrimp dumplings are good too. The noodle dishes and fried rice dishes are good, but this place is really all about the dumplings. Make sure you order drinks at the beginning of the meal as it's a bit hard to get a hold of servers after you order because it's usually really busy. I got there at 2:30 and there was a wait. They close in the afternoon at 3, but I'm not sure what time they open. They also offer take-out, which you can take home hot or cold, but it's not as good as the fresh stuff.
