This place is awesome.  My friend and I used to go there all the time.. The owner is obsessed with comics so there are a bunch of old school toys all around the hole in the wall restaurant.  . If you want unique and tasty...this is the place.. They serve beer too.. It's also located in the very hip Lil' 5 Points.
