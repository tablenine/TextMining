Seriously, they could've served me liver and onions on that back patio last night, and would've claimed it "awesome." . . The patio is a gem. Hidden, backyard style, with some Spanish music on a cool late summer evening in the company of delightful, bright and unique people. . . The food was good. I was starvin' like marvin, so I can't complain as long as it arrives hot and fast. Ok, so it was pretty warm and not so fast, but I digress. I had the kabobs (chicken and shrimp) accompanied by a funny little black bean salad on a lettuce leaf with a cucumber. Kinda fancy? I was expecting a large slop of pico de gallo and refried beans, which would've been just dandy, but the black bean salad was a cute touch. The chicken kabob was in an odd BBQ like sauce, but it tasted fine. Shrimp were large and lovely...much enjoyed. . . Corona Light, mmmmm. A summer evening in Logan Square....quite splendid. The patio is a sure hit, but the inside is really quite nice for a Mexican joint. Great little date spot, the upstairs lounge area is set away from the crowds and quite intimate with candles and such. (I apparently took the long way in finding my way back to the patio, ha!). . Go. Before summer slips away...it's quintessential Chicago patio living at its finest.
