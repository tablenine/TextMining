Well after my second time coming here... Nothing much has changed. Different location in Orange this time, STILL behind a bar. The whole time there were just drunks yelling about. Some guy walking around was being REALLY racist to my friends and then a group of hispanic people. Really surprised he didnt get jumped..... . Anyways i got the short rib burrito again but this time NO lettuce! Well... this time the meat actually tasted a LITTLE smokey so that was a plus. Otherwise... The whole thing was just a greasy fat mess. It was good in a VERY guilty viewpoint but just good... The cheese once again was only half melted which imo is pretty gross... Either dont melt it at all or melt it all! what the hell is this half melt BS? trying to make everyone happy? not working... Also... Did they always have egg in it? It was dark so i couldnt tell for sure but i am pretty certain there was scrambled egg in there too. Jeez it was like i was eating a tablespoon of grease from the meat followed by REALLY fatty meat followed by eggs. Killer! haha it tasted better this time but i have to minus one more star for the grease and also the continual choice of sketchy locations. Sure drunks with come out and buy a bunch of food but what about us non drinkers? A man came up to the van while i was ordering and snatched a cupcake without paying, he thanked the cashier and took off???.... Another one was also walking around saying Kogis was recalled for Â using meat from asia or something.. Ugh so weird. . OH one last think. I remember seeing a bunch of news stories talking about Gourmet Food Trucks and how Kogi's founded all that. I DEFINITELY would not call this gourmet. A little different from the norm? Yes. Gourmet?? dont kid with me please. Just think of it as fusion fast food at a slightly premium price
