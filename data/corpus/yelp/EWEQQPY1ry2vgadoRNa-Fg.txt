Category: Pizza
(Insert snarky anti-Chicago comment, reminding you all why NY is so much better, here). . Are you done?  Good.  Shut up.. . Santullo's is tight.  Is it authentic NY pizza?  No.  That's because NY pizza sucks.  I'll stop by here late at night so I can pretend that NYer have a claim to the world of pizza.  I'll humor them and enjoy a slice of faux NY pizza to give them a fighting chance.. . Do I really hate NY pizza?  No.  Actually, I love it, but I love Chicago-style more.  My apologies for kicking NY style in the nuts, when I should have reserved it for the NYcentric douchebags and their hate rants.  Santullo's is actually pretty good.  Again, it's not authentic NY style, but we pretend to not know any better, because hey...it's not NY.. . NYers know they will not find good NY style in Chicago, so why bother?  That's just stupid.  I had a crappy Chicago-style pizza in San Diego, but I'll give them a pass because it's in freaking San Diego, not Chicago!  So think twice about setting your dining experience up for failure and don't send the nukes over when you get home.
