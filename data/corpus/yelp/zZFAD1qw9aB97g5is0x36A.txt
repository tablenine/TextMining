Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
Growing up in Southeast Asia, I love bowls of delicious noodles that can be found everywhere as street food. Since moving here, I definitely crave and miss those flavors which can hardly be found in any Asian restaurants in the city. Urban Belly has fulfilled my cravings with their amazing fresh ingredients and flavors. The kimchi soup and the short ribs are my favorites. I highly recommend this place if you are simply looking for authentic and delicious food.
