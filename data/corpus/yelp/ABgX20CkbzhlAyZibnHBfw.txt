I FINALLY MADE IT TO THE OINKSTER. . i was tossing a coin between going there or the TACO SPOT accross the street and this place one out b/c of a past review i read about their fries. . first, i'd like to point out, it's Valentine's Day and I made a U-Turn to go to the Oinkster. I felt like a loser-ster. . ANYWAY...i ended up NOT getting the fries, but roasted chicken with black beans, rice and fried plantains. really, really good. gross mayo dressing, but it was on the side, so i opted out of that one.. the price was good. something like $8 for what would have cost $15 at the PIG on la brea. admittedly though, i could only make it through about 1/4 of my meal before i had to call it quits. the food's good and filling! plus i have a meal for lunch tomorrow. . would i go again? heck yeah! i have to eat that angus burger and fries folks are bragging about.
