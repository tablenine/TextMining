I had to give it one less star bc of the Patio experience.  We were luckily seated outside (or I thought) but once we had gotten comfortable we realized that with every warm breeze when the trees above us swayed, little dead white flowers or mini leaves? Continued to sprinkle us and our meals/drinks.  This was a little uncomfortable at first but you get used to it. . . Ambiance is huge for me and I feel even though yes its not the most modern place, thats the charm! The look of the courtyard is very inviting, and I absolutely loved how it perfectly connected to the indoor seating and visible kitchen.  Although they were all separate, the set up was seamless so you felt connected to each room there. Also the crowd was perfect too, no "touristy" action. None of the "scene" people from LA who were looking for the next cool place to be were there, which was excellent. Everyone seemed like regulars and that gave it a warm  vibe.. . The food definitely lives up to his reputation, the skin on the duck was glazed to perfection! My sister ordered the halibut and hers was just as tasty a very interesting layer of flavors in that. Portions were perfect too not too much and not too little, so you don't end up feeling you've wasted so much or that you've only eaten the equivalent of one pea. For dessert I strongly recommend getting the banana benye (sp?), it was amazing.. . One thing that I think is important to note is that I had been coming from a friends fashion show and wasn't the way I'd like to typically be dressed for such a nice restaurant so I was very hesitant given the fact sometimes staff at any restaurant can be snobby for this. Well trust me I was wearing a funny outfit for the place and they were still exceptionally polite and still treated me very nicely :) That is something that I can definitely appreciate!
