The dish that will have me coming back again is the Spicy Crispy Shrimp appetizer! It's like the rock shrimp app at Nobu. It's delicious and crunchy and flavorful and spicy. . . The food is excellent. Good sushi rolls, fresh sashimi, fun apps such as the braised ribs and the chilean sea bass was very good. . . The desserts were solid, not awesome, but not bad. The molten cake was unorginal but tasted good. . . The prices were a bit high but the vibe is lively and the food is great.
