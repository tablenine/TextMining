Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Service sucked first of all. There salsa tasted like marinera sauce.. The green salsa was chopped up pickled jalape√±os. They only have one kind of meat from what I saw on their menu. Shredded beef or horse I think it was or some type of mystery meat...with no flavor. I went with four other coworkers. We all said the same thing. Titos Tacos is weak! I could've got better tasting tacos food at Tacobell. Oh...and CASH only...WTF? Thats my review, stay away from this place!
