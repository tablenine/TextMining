Oh DANG, this place is tasty! Granted, the insane lines are somewhat intimidating, but once you get your food (for oh, so cheap!), the good times... oh, how they begin. I got the beef sandwich with blue cheese. It was DELISH. Crusty warm bread cradling juicy tender beef with just the right amount of blue cheese = happiness on a paper plate! I'm automatically suspicious of french dip type sandwiches- I have issues with soggy bread- but this place definitely did not disappoint! Plus, it gets major points for being a block away from Union Station. I was told that the place used to be a brothel and the second floor is haunted, but alas... no ghost prostitute sighting with my sammich. Maybe next time!
