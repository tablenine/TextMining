I used to pass by this place on Hollywood blvd and wonder what the crowd was about.  I was assuming it would suck once I got in.  . . I went in for dinner with a friend and had a blast.  It's very nice.  We looked like ass (me looking like a bum) but they let us in for dinner at around 10p.m.  ONce we got in, I realized it was fancy cuz every one else looked nicely dressed.  We got a booth table on the side (waiter was nice enough to ask what kind of seat we wanted) and my friend and I talked away and people watched.. . THe sushi was above average.  You'd think places like that actually have crap food.  It was good.  But for the price of their sushi, your money is better spent at Katsuya which is pricey, but got real quality sushi for your money.. . I'd go back to have a nice meal.  It's very posh and modern place to go to for dinner with friends.
