Red velvet cupcakes!  That's all I've had there and that's enough to keep me coming back.  At $2 a cupcake, that's a bargain compared to the fancy, pricey cupcakes out there.  They're extra generous on the cream cheese frosting which is special and tasty.  Another plus is that they're open later than the average bakery so you can get a late night sweet fix.
