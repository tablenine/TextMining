Great Accomodating Service, Above Average Food.. . I came here with a group after being downtown for an event on a Wednesday night.  The dinner at 8pm was originally set up for 8 people and turned into a dinner for 11.  The menu was prepared by the chef, so it was great that they could accomodate.. . I really liked the effort put into each dish, though the execution was not always there.  I can say the clear gazpacho was a big loser, but maybe the only one amongst several different bites of other stuff.. . The Ribeye Steak was delicious and prepared medium rare over potatoes, but the portions were small.  Soft-shell crab was good with a great trio of sauces including a sweet and spicy red pepper sauce (awesome).  The other like a spicy aioli were not to my liking.  The flan for dessert came out really well and would highly recommend that.. . I did not see the bill, but I'm sure it was tough to look at.  I would eat here again, but probably be not be something that I recommend on my own.  It is a convenient location for downtown for some of the nearby buildings and hotels.
