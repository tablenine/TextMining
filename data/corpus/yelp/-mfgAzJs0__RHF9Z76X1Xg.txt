This is an izakaya-style (Japanese pub) restaurant and it has awesome chicken wings, delicious and greasy croquettes, yakitori, and other tasty, not so healthy things. Very lively as well- its usually packed from Wednesday night onwards through Sunday, so if you don't want to wait for a table, its best to come with either Â a small party, or just arrive very early. Everything is served small plates or tapas style, so while each individual plate is cheap, I usually end up dropping $20-25+ whenever I go here. Most dishes are best washed down with a cold glass of the Japanese beer on tap. The menu is extensive and I have barely scratched the surface, so I will need to come here for repeat visits.
