Great location.  Otherwise, it's Willy's.. . I'm not really gonna bother reviewing this place because they sell a product, not food.  Margaritas from a machine are available, just be sure to have those ID's ready.. . I'd say this place is a notch above Taco Bell - I will actually eat here if I am forced to.  But I in no way enjoy it.  I would rather eat my canned tuna. bleh.. . 3 stars because it's clean, you know what you're getting, and it's not inedible or anything.  just nothing to write home about.
