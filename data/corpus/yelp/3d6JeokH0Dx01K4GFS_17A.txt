Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
At the take-out window, once I asked for the price of the large horchata ($2.99), I felt it was high.  A large horchata in this location should be $1.50 to $1.80 max.  But then I asked for the price of a small one ($2.55), I decide not to order ANYTHING.  Being a businessman and a good mathematician, I smelled a very greedy man behind the operation.  Here's the game theory for this.  You see $1.99 would have been greedy enough for the location but smart enough to hide under the 2 dollar mark.  But the guy  is not  only asking over $2 but actually over the 2.50 mark at 2.55 not 2.45.  I smelled the heavy stench of greed.. . I refused to have any food here because i know it cannot be better than all the good mexican food I have had in this town.. . I guess I am used to tacomiendo which despite being on the west side is both good and inexpensive.  I also don't believe in paying %30 more than what a meal is worth.  A $200 dinner at Valentino is well worth it and an $8 burrito in Boyle Heights is not.. . This place is a rip-off, especially for its location.  What is this Beverly Hills? . .  Every item was 30% higher than Tacomiendo which is in Culver City and not the gang-ridden Boyle Heights.  This place is too popular...
