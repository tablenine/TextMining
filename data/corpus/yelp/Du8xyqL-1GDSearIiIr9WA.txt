Category: Pubs
The good: in the summer the outdoor beer garden is great. The bad: the service is mostly nonexistent with surly waitresses and the food is horrible. I may be back for a beer on the patio, but no food for me. Overcooked meat smothered with cheese and skimpy french fries don't cut it. The only reason they received two stars is because the patio is a nice place to relax and escape the city.
