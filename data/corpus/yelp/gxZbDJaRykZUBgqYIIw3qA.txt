Agua Frescas - Jamaica - Sweet Hibiscus Flower Tea. Tacos - Beef Barbacoa - Brisket &amp; Salsa Verde. Empanadas - Mejor Pollo - Marinated Chicken. Tamales - Tamale al Angel - Shredded Pork with Tomatillo sauce. . Surprised to see that Vortex is involved, though it should have been a dead give-away since the skull theme was so prominent. I just figured it was a "day of the dead" theme, though that probably isn't ideal when you're talking to a bunch of Caucasians about food. Last meal anyone?. . Overall the food was tasty. The disappointment came when I held the empanada in my hand. Puff Pastry... If I can make a empanada dough at home, I imagine they can make it here... C'mon people!. . That aside, the tamale was moist and tasty, as was the taco. My favorite was the drink though, a great blend of tart and sweet that just hit the spot given our hot days.... . Definitely a place to go back and check out... Next on the list is the Elote, the corn on the cob with chili powder, queso fresco and butter.
