Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Are people serious about this place?!. . Fuckin disgusting.... . ahem, excuse me..... . Really fuckin disgusting.. . Yes, I have some sort of New York bias and I honestly realize that nothing in LA will live up to stuff I can get at home. However, I'm over it.  When a friend brought a pizza over to my place (it's her favorite place and I HAD to try it), I decided to shut my damn mouth and give the place a try.  Upon opening the box, I set my eyes upon the most tragic looking meatball pizza I have ever seen. It looked like frozen pizza that had been cooked in the microwave, but somehow had burnt pieces of crust, with meat from taco bell spread all over the top.  And, what do you know, it also TASTED like the frozen pizza I cooked in the microwave when I was ten.  At least those pizzas only took three minutes to cook whereas we waited 45 minutes for this shit. My friend loved it. My roommate loved it. And I hated it and am still searching for a tolerable pizza place in LA. God help me.
