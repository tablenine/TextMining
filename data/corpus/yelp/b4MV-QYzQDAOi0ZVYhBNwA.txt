Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Pretty good. I could go there and just have two or three portions of the burrata and pane bianco. AMAZING. However, I think pizzas are so-so. I don't like the way the crust rises - it dries it a bit and makes it hard to eat. Some mains aren't great either. Lasagna (on Saturdays I believe) isn't great. Just imagine how good the burrata is to make me give the restaurant four stars!
