I got the banh mi and the sticky rice.  The banh mi was pretty good, though I don't think it's as spicy as some have said it is.  I'm not an expert on Vietnamese food by any stretch, but for $5, I thought it was a pretty good deal and a spot worth coming back to check out to try the other dishes.. . The sticky rice was decent as well, though I would say the banh mi would take priority especially since the sticky rice and meat was $8. . . Overall a good value and decent food that will definitely have me coming back for more since it's a quick and easy take out spot.
