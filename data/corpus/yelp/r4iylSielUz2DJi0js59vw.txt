Loved it! Living in the area, I have walked by many times and it is always crowded. Finally went for lunch one day, and it was great! They make your food right in front of you, and mix all the salad pieces together ( always a plus! ) A little pricy for the salad, but next time I think I will share. It was pretty big. Overall, great place and atmosphere. Try it out!
