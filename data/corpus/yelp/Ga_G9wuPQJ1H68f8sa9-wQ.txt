A california Roll made with real crab. need I say more. The shrimp tempura roll was delicious. Perfectly crunchy tempura with the most delicate, finely cute veggies all rolled into one. Im not a big fan of the raw fish stuff (insert gasp here!) but my guest did order the rainbow roll which looked fantastic. Went on a saturday night around 9:30, the place was busy, put the hostess sat us right away. Bring a coat, its freezing inside. and be sure to order some delicious mochi for dessert.
