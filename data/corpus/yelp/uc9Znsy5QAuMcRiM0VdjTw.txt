Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
i love the sage fried chicken at hash house a go go and we have had two different waitresses there tell us that the chicken was like roscoe's...so we had to go the next time we were going to be in LA.. . let me just say this:  the fried chicken was great.  it gave me a feeling of being back in the south.  i don't think it was better than the sage fried chicken at hash house and the tractor room, but it was damn good and i never really expected it to be similar.. . the waffle on the other hand was....nothing to write home about.  for being the "house of chicken and waffles" i feel a little disappointed.  . . but what the heck!  four stars because the man that seated us was RAD!, the chicken was rad and i would go back.  i'll just make sure to pass up the waffle and go straight for the chicken with candied yams, mac and cheese, greens and corn bread!  yuuummmm.
