I'm not sure what all the hype is about. Just because your father has been going there since the '60's doesn't mean it's a great spot (he may just not be that well traveled) and they may have been charging real world prices back then. After waiting a short while we rolled up to a couple of stools and perused the short menu of items. Can it be true? $6.50 for a hamburger $6.50 for a tuna salad sandwhich. Is that Kobe Beef and Albacore Tuna? Nope, just plain stuff that wasn't anything special. With our $2.00 small fries and tap water to drink, our total was near $17.00! Had planned on a piece of pie, but $5.50 a slice???? I would, but this is not a place to slowy savor food as pie should be. Will I be back? Not in this lifetime.
