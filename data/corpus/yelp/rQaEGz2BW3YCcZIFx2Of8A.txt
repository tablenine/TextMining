Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
My tour of trendy brunches continues with Toast.  I was very smug and thought I wouldn't have to wait for a table at 10:45 on a Friday, but I did.  Only 15-20 minutes, but you have to understand I'm practically allergic to waiting for food -- and I had my 12 and 9 year olds with me.  It is not exactly a child-friendly place, (no kids menu per se) but everyone found something they liked.  I really enjoyed my crepe with apples, pears and brie, and my daughter ordered their breakfast potatoes which were nicely browned and flavorful.  The boy demolished his eggs benedict.  Service was very cheerful, and it was conveniently located near Oz Park, so the kids could romp around afterward.   . . Some people notice the decor of a restaurant, I notice the music playing.  As I was bopping along to the lively '80s pop music, I realized that most of the people in the restaurant with me were in diapers when this stuff was popular.
