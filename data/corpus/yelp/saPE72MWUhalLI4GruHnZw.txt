Aileen V and I came here one crazy hot morning before our stroll down Melrose... . . Their pancakes are the size of medium pizzas! Pancakes come in one size, and 3 to a plate... there is no way you can finish them! It's meant to feed a family of 6! I ordered the golden ticket and it was oh so good. bananas, walnuts, streusel topping, whipped cream, brown sugar = yummy! I couldn't finish it... I didnt even make a dent. Aileen V. ordered the Strawberries and cream waffles which had fresh, sweet strawberries and this really tasty sour cream topping. They have really good coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. It's a popular place, so put your name on the list and wait. the wait is not too bad... maybe 10-15 minutes on a week day... I don't know how it is on a weekend though
