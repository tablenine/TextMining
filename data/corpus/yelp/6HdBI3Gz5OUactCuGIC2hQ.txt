Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
The top 5 reasons to go to Pinks.. . 1) Hanging out with family and friends.. (You will wait in line forever). 2) To be a tourist. (It is cool to be able to say, "I've eaten at Pinks!"). 3) To watch people walk over to Pinkberry, pick up fro-yo and walk back eating their fro-yo all while you are waiting in line.. 4) Meeting new people. (Trust me, you get to know the person in line in front of you... and in back). 5) To have someone walk across the street to Winchell's donuts Â so that you have something to eat while waiting in line.
