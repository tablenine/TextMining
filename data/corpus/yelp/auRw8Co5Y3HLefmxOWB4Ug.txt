Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
I have very good friends who are Cuban and they love Porto's.  Having tried quite a few restaurants with them this is one that consistently produces high quality food.. . I have not found anything at this bakery/cafe that has not been good.  During lunchtime expect a bit of a wait in the line.  They move through it quickly but it is THAT popular.
