I've been here a couple of times before, but for some reason i had an urge for juicy pork dumplings yesterday. The juicy pork dumplings is their specialty! they are so good but just be careful when you put them in your mouth... Theyre really hot. As soon as you bite them, they explode with juicy goodness. Its like a parade of yummy goodness in my mouth!. . Apart from the juicy pork dumplings, we also ordered crab dumplings and shui mai. The crab dumplings also had the soupy juice in it but the taste was not nearly as good as the pork ones. As for the shui mai...They were aiiiitttteee. Theyre not your typical ones that you get at dim sum. They are wrapped in a thicker dumpling skin and are much bigger.. . Just daydreaming about the juicy pork dumplings is making my mouth water.. yum! and the best part..you can see the mexicans in the kitchen making the dumplings!. . pros: very yummy juicy pork dumplings, decent service. cons: get there early, it gets packed quick. Most waiters dont speak english, if they do its broken.
