Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Tried the "Special #2" Challenge: eat a full bowl of their spiciest ramen in 30 minutes, and get your picture on the wall. . . The stuff wasn't too spicy, but it was so much damn ramen. I threw in the towel with a couple cups to go. . . Maybe it was because of the challenge, but I didn't really enjoy the food here. I've had much better ramen and fried rice. Fail.
