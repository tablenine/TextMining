Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
I've never been a vegetarian, nor do ever I plan to be. Ive always been a been a voracious carnivore.  Burgers, steaks, roasts, and BBQ, I need my meat fix.  However, I've never been against the idea of having a few meat free meals a few times a week.  I've always considered myself as a highly experimental eater, always willing to try the new and unusual at least once.  That being said I haven't been really impressed with my forays into vegetarianism, until I came to Veggie Grill.   .      The ingredients are all high quality, with great flavors and a great selection of teas and juices.  But what really astounded me, was their chicken.  I can't believe its not chicken!  The texture, the bite, its really really amazing, I highly recommend it.  Tthe Veggie Burger is also amazing, with  the best texture and flavor I've ever tasted in a meatless burger patty.   The Carne Asade  and Chipotle BBQ sammys both had great flavor, however the texture of the meat substitute was lacking.  Don't miss out on the fries, they are simply amazing and round out your meal perfectly.  Don't worry they aren't too sweet either.  .       The only thing that bothers me is that the Veggie Grille is just an upscale fast food joint.  Sure everything is made to order, and the interior is a few monumental steps up from your local Mckie D's but the price is pretty high. It will probably set you back 12-14 bucks a head for a burger or samwich, fries and a drink.  In this economy, I can't really justify spending that much everyday for lunch every day, but it  does make for a great meal every once in a while.  If you never been I highly recommend it!
