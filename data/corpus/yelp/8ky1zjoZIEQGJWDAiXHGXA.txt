I ate at the bar here 2 nights in a row while attending a conference at the Hyatt across the street.  It was a great experience both evenings.  The bar tenders were friendly and attentive.  The CraftBar menu was interesting and diverse.  The crispy brussel sprout leaves are really unique and are a salty delicious start.  The brazed rabbit tortellini was the best item I tried on the menu.  I was not a fan of the burger (I let them know on the first night and they offered a free try the second night) - I just did not love the pickle.  . . I will now head over there for every Kelsey Group conference in LA!  Having Geoff from Yelp speak at the conference encouraged me to write the review...
