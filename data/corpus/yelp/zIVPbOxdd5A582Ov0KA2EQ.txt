Restaurant: Six Feet Under
Category: Seafood
If fried food or mediocrity is your specialty, then you might find that Six Feet Under is your type of place.  If you're someone like me, who grew up on the coast, eating that which was caught that morning... well then, there's really no comparison.  The two stars are for the upstairs patio area, which is nice to get a couple of drinks and enjoy the warmer weather.  As for the food, skip it... order a pitcher for you and your friends, and call it a day.
