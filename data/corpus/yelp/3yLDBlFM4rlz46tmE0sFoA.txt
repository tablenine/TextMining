I'm usually the first one to say, "Waaaait a minute...$9.00 for just a freaking sandwich??  RIIIIGHT."  But my boss convinced me to try it for lunch today.  Holy shit.  The chicken panini with pesto and mushroom was seriously one of the BEST sandwiches I've ever had.  I can't even begin to say how good it was.  Sadly, I must admit that it was well worth the money I shelled out for it.  I can't vouch for the deserts, but that sandwich still calls out for me from the great stomach beyond. . . WOW.  WOW.  WOW.   Naughty Milk...I am addicted.
