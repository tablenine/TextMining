Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Awesome place, a cornerstone of Culver City.. . I live in the aby area now and people I meet from the West LA area still rave about Tito's Tacos. Great Everything, fresh beans and rice, mild salsa thats more for flavor than spice, fresh cheese you name it.. . Overall great food. Park in the back , in the lot, on the side or wherever, its one of those places that started out as a hole in the wall and now pretty much has long lines inside and out for most of the lunch and dinner hours, but so worth it.
