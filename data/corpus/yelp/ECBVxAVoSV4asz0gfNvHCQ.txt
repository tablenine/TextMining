My next girlfriend is going to be Korean/Mexican because I'd be eating the following almost every day .... . . Tacos or Burritos:  galbi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, tofu. Kim Chi quesadillas. Hot Dogs with kim chi sauerkraut . Korean Street Style Baby Sesame Roasted Potatoes. . Only thing missing was Horchata Soju, but they did advertise that they have Korchata (Korean Rice Punch and Horchata ingredients) but I prefer alcoholic beverages.. . I'm a fan of different ... and this concept is definitely different.  The food was good, but personally it just didn't live up to the hype.  If I ever go back, which I probably will ... I know how to order next time, which will probably improve the experience.. . Just like in a relationship, come in open minded and don't expect anything so you won't be disappointed.  You learn from each one so next time it will be better.  . . Be ready for anything, especially waiting to eat for 1.5 hours because the truck is late. And don't expect them to keep their schedule in case they are busy making money at their other spots, would you leave?
