Restaurant: Native Foods
Category: Vegan
The people are so wonderful! I ordered a bowl but they accidentally typed in that I had ordered a pizza so they gave me the absolutely delicious pizza for free. I am a vegetarian so I'm not quite a vegan but I've never been disappointed at Native Foods. This would be a great place to take someone who isn't vegetarian or vegan to introduce them to the lifestyle and how great the food is!
