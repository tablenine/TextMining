Liz and Donna truly offer up some down home comfort with Feed.  For family style home cooked food search no further.  The chicken is always fresh and moist, the sauteed spinach is amazing and the decor is warm and relaxing.  Great deserts made fresh daily add the final touch to an already wonderful experience.  My only criticism if I had to offer one would be the cash only aspect.  Other than that it's all good!
