I've been here a bunch of times and love....However CAUTION:. Try to go on a slower week night or even for lunch because this popular spot can get pretty crowded. . My favorites:. Garlic bread (not much garlic but that's fine by me). ALSO: Make a reservation!. Squid Salad (amazing). Hummus with pita bread. BBQ pizza. Vegetable platter grilled (if you like your veggies)
