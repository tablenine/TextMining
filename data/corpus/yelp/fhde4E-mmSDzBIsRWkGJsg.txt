Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
the pook has been craving roscoe's for months now and with work being so busy we haven't had a chance to visit. finally.. this weekend we were in the area for the glee live concert. yay!. . we came on a friday around 6pm. there was no line. we were greeted quickly and sat down. i've been to a roscoe's once before and i ordered the same thing. #19 with dark meat. it comes with rice and gravy and a biscuit. there is plenty of rice and and gravy. the dish came out lukewarm but it was still good. the chicken itself i thought was a little bland. i felt bad for eating it with ketchup. the biscuit was kinda gross... and had no flavor. even the pook can agree with me on that one. . . the pook ordered the smothered chicken. it came with a waffle. the waffle was simple and tasty. the smothered chicken came with the same gravy used on my rice. it made the chicken taste better but i feel like for a chicken place.. the chicken should be good on its own. i ordered a side of mac n cheese and for over $4 it did not disappoint. in fact... we have leftovers and i may go heat it up right now!. . overall it was a good place. i would come back and get the smothered chicken and the waffle. its not amazing but it's a nice spot to share with good company.
