Food is good, no doubt about it.  However It feels like your eating in a garage, and the service is HORRIBLE!!!!!!  THe Service is very Rude!!  I feel bad asking them for the stuff they forget cause they make a big deal or they act like your bugging them when it is their job to get you more hot sauce if you want.  THE food is good that is the only reason i keep coming back and i give this place 3 stars. Everytime i get ignored or the servers forget something, i also forget to a couple bucks on their tips, so their loss.  THey are probably pissed because they dont get tipped well there, but if they provided better service they would get more money simple as that.
