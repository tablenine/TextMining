Restaurant: Blu Jam Caf√©
Category: American (New)
Another successful brunch spot! We took a gf to Blu Jam for a birthday brunch and we all walked out of there quite happy. There was a 20 minutes wait, but for a Sunday morning on Melrose, I guess that has to be expected. As usual, I could not decide between salty and sweet, so I ordered two entrees - a make your own scramble (with ham, onions, green peppers and sausage) and an order of french toast topped with an assortment of fruit and berries. Mmmm.... heaven! One of my favorite parts of a good breakfast is the quality/taste of the potatoes and Blu Jam's potatoes did not disappoint. Though, I must say, the coffee was nothing spectacular. Boohoo. Service was excellent and the manager stopped by our table several times to make sure we were doing okay. Yes we were! . . Next stop, Cafe Vienna across the street.
