This restaurant is located across from my office on West Paces Ferry, and it has the absolute best apple martinis!  The food is great as well.  If you want a steak in Atlanta, you know you will get a good one here.  Also, their lobster macaroni and cheese is to die for.  It's a good thing I run a lot!  It is never a disappointment.
