Category: Burgers
Yum. Goodness-gracious, get thee to Counter. . . Things I learned at Counter: . . 1. 2/3 of a pound of hamburger is more than I ought to eat for lunch. Although 1/3 might have been too little. . . 2. Sweet potato fries are better with lots of salt. Counter serves a lot of them. I recommend sharing. . . 3. Counter cooks burgers properly, meaning, if you order medium rare, you get a proper medium rare. Warm pink middle. Drool. . . 4. Onion strings are difficult to eat without wearing quite a few bits of them. You've been warned. . . 5. When presented with a practically unlimited choice of burger toppings, I cannot be creative, I am simply bewildered and fall back on an old favorite. In today's example, bacon, blue cheese and mayo. . . 6. Do not attempt to work on your laptop while eating lunch at Counter. . . 7. Its *not* a vanilla malt. Its a vanilla SHAKE. Meaning, no malt powder but, bits of vanilla beans at the bottom. My disappointment was all but gone by the halfway point though this not-at-all-insignificant drink. Which I ate with a spoon. So is it really a drink? Hmm. . . 8. The wheat buns are loverly. . . 9. The seemingly-manager-guy and the staff in general, is quite nice. . . 10. Apparently there are five or six other locations around the country. Neat. Not that I'm going to visit them or anything. I prefer to think that Counter is a uniquely Chicago thing.
