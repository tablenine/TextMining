It was around 11 PM and my girlfriend mentioned Fred 62.  She ate here numerous times before and since we were in the area, decided to grab something to eat at this place.  Breakfast sounded really good.. . When you walk in, the booths remind me of '70s muscle car seats pulled from their interiors and installed here.  Muscle car HP, V8 rumble, raked stance, four on the floor, type of feel.  I felt like I should be buckling my lap belt when I slid into the booth.  We ordered the Eggs in the Hole and the Strawberry Beret - French Toast.  The Eggs in the Hole are basically two pieces of toast with eggs grilled in the center.  I like sunny side up eggs and how the yolks just spill all over the toast.  Yummy.  It came with hash browns, bacon, and sausage.  The Strawberry Beret French Toast were really good.  Cooked well, not gooey.  The powdered sugar may have very well been crack, they were that good.  Have no idea why it's called Strawberry Beret - does that mean I should wear a beret like I'm in Paris?. . Affordable, good diner food, and good service.  I have yet to try other items on the menu other than breakfast.  Another joint to add to our places to eat for breakfast.
