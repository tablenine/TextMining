Went here for brunch on Saturday and LOVED it! Cannot wait to go back for dinner and also when it is nice out, as they have a cute outdoor area. . We started with the chilaquiles, but did the eggs on the side. I enjoy when places allow you to change things a bit, as I am a little picky :) This was delicious and I would have loved to just eat this for my meal. This and a mimosa definitely helped cure the hangover :). Next we shared the prociutto pizza and the asian salad. The pizza arugula salad comes on top of the pizza and it was amazingly tasty. Â . The asian salad was just ok. Needed more dressing in my opinion.. Overall, really cute place and the waitress was very attentive with drinks and our orders. We did not feel rushed at all, which is nice because I sometimes feel that way at brunches. . Loved it and will be back!
