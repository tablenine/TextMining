I have been to Spitz several times now considering my husband is a HUGE fan and we live close by.  I want to be a fan and I try and be a fan but after going several times, I just have to admit it and say this place it just okay for me.  For me, I just don't think the meat is that great as compared to the mouth watering Zankou.  I have tried the Doner Meals, the Doner Plate, the Doner Salad and all I can conclude is that the meat is just not for me. The sweet potatoe fries, the seasoned fries, the hummas and the falfal are for me and are pretty tasty.  So that leaves me with an okay rating.  I come here for my husband but its not a favorite.
