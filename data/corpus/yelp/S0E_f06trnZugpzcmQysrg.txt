Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
FOGO DE CHAO.... WOOO HOOO! A vegetarian's nightmare!!! (lol). . Great Salad bar, but you didnt come here for that, you came for ... MEAT! They have every type of meats imaginable, if you can't find the one you're looking for - well it probably doesnt exist!  Every meat there is mouth watery - the filet and sirloin is really unbelievable.. . Aside from the wonderful dishes, this is probably the only restaurant that I've been too where the service exceeded my expectations.  They all work there as a team, so you really dont get an exact waiter or waitress. It always cool when you see the manager helping out hands on.  I respect that!
