Am I the only one who doesn't come here for the hainan chicken dish?  . . Must be.. . I come for many, many other things, but the hainan just tastes standard..of not overly oily to me.. . I love this place, except the actual size and seating arrangement, they really need to expand, and it would be nice if it wasn't cash only.  You're practically sitting in other people's laps.  The owner is very sweet.  My mother told me the back story to Savoy's success; back in the early 90's they were also Savoy...just a block down at what is now some sad cafe that changes names ever year.  She ran Savoy with her husband, and when they divorced, she took him for all he was worth, and to spite him, she opened up her own Savoy down the street...where she laughs happily to the bank.  The end.. . The food here is really rich and dramatic, as in aromatic and pleasing to the taste buds.  Although the menu is small, there is something for everyone.  My personal favorites are the seafood curry, shrimp egg rolls, seafood salad w/ house dressing, and their baked seafood over rice.  Their lunch specials are also ridiculously cheap, as if they could get any cheaper, but change daily.  I believe it was a Monday...I had their baked pork chop with rice; cheese oozing, red fried rice (YUM), and a very hefty portion for $6.95.  I also like that their iced tea comes with sugar syrup rather than packets; even their tea is delicious.  It's places like this that make me wish I still resided in the sgv...but all I need is a tumultuous drive in to the wild to get me grounded again and thankful to be close enough in Pasadena, ye far enough in Pasadena.. . And come on people, where else can you get a filet Mignon with black pepper sauce for under 10 bucks?
