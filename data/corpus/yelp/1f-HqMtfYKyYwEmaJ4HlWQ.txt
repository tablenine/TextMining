Wanna "Eat Real"?. Then eat somewhere else. This place is a joke. Crust specializes in pretentious, artsy-fartsy "pizza" with fancy-sounding but bland-tasting ingredients. I mean, really, how the hell can you so royally screw up pizza? Its such a simple recipe. . . Me and my girlfriend shared two pies and both were boring and unsatisfying. We left hungry and craving actual pizza. Ya know, the kind with sauce and cheese. So if thats how you like your pizza then steer clear of Crust.
