Back from another wonderful meal @ Watershed. Just happen to be raid the cellar night, so we drank two bottles of Turley that you can not buy @ the store (this wine is only available to wine club member's) less than $40 a bottle, Great food, good service, excellent wine @ a ridiculous price...what's not too like? And for all you kid's that complain about the drive, hello I have lived in ATL for a year and know my way around. It's 15'mins down Ponce de Leon!!
