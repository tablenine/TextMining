Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
I've been coming here ever since I worked for the Studios in another life time.  I should describe Katsu-Ya as Japanese with a California fusion creativity, which explains why this restaurant has become so successful and opened so many new locations.  The Studio City location is still the best.  I was excited about Izakaya by katsuya that opened in my neighborhood which serves the signature Katsuya dishes, too bad it's not quite as good the one time I went.  My favorites are similar to other yelpers: baked crab hand rolls, spicy tuna crispy rice (more soggy than crispy in the LA locations), Albacore with crispy onions,  yellowtail sampler...etc.  The items consistently on the white board time after time are the safe bets.  Sometimes I venture into new creations, but rarely find something I'd want to order again.
