I know I know Thai and Vietnamese are close and i'm always getting them mixed up. But really, i know there's a difference, just know i love them both equally.. . The Bo Sate, Shaking Beef are great,  Gingergrass Rolls &amp; Basil Lime elixir are my favs.   They have sandwiches, but who cares? I am not interested,  it's not what i come for when eating Vietnamese.. . The specials are tasty and anything made with a coconut broth rocks moi like a hurricane...oooomah mow mow papa ooooww mow mow mow.. The sweet and sour Canh Chua will make your panties twisted.
