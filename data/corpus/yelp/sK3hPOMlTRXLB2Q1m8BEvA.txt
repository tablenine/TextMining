This place has some seriously good pizza. The dough is really fresh!. If you're like me, good dough counts for a lot.. . The only reason I won't give more than 3 stars is because it is so crowded, has very bad acoustics (I couldn't hear the person talking across from me) and parking is a hassle (valet was mandatory costing around $10).
