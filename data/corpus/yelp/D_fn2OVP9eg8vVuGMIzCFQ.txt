I went to Fogo's about a year ago for a friends birthday. And although it was very good, it's not the kind of place i would go to visit again and again and again. . . The food was all really good. Waiters walk around with platters of meat. Some they carve right there for you. I am definitely a carnivore so I really enjoyed all the different cuts. I like the salad bar options as well, so you're not just eating only meat. And those little cheesy doughy balls and the polenta cakes they put on the table are delicious.. . I left feel really really stuffed and my wallet was definitely quite a bit lighter, but definitely a place to try at least once.
