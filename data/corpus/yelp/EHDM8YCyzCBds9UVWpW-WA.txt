I went there on a sunny afternoon and eating outside was very relaxing. It wasn't too crowded since it was around 2pm. The service wasn't that great but it's good enough for this type of place. I had the fish tacos which were excellent. I didn't get a chance to get any drinks but the drink list was very appealing.
