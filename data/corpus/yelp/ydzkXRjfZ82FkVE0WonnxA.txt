Hands down one of the best ramen shops I've been to in Los Angeles, and not just for the ramen! Especially because it's only a few dollars more than the base price of the ramen, I always make sure to get a Â combo. I've tried most of the combo sides, and my particular favorites are the eel bowl, shredded pork bowl, tuna sashimi, and chicken and egg bowl.. . The wait is usually quite long and requires standing outside. About a month ago, my friends and I had to wait outside in the rain for about 45 minutes. However, in my opinion the ramen quality and portions are well worth it. Plus, if you put your name on the list and it looks like your party won't be called for a while, you can just stroll around Little Tokyo for a while.. . I was a little disappointed with the kotteri (special back fat) broth ramen; it didn't add too much flavor beyond the regular broth and it seemed like a lot more fat. I enjoyed it, but didn't really see what made it a "speciality.". . That aside, Daikokuya is definitely my default choice when in Little Tokyo, and a definite 5-star restaurant. And for the price you can't go wrong!
