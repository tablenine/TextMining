Restaurant: Perennial
Category: American (New)
Overall:  My girlfriend and I went to Perennial on a Thursday night and were more than impressed.  The ambiance was great - it was quiet enough, but still had energy.  The food was extremely tasty, especially for the money.  Lastly, service was outstanding - attentive but not intrusive.  I only give a 5-star rating on rare occasions, at restaurants that are truly world-class.  Perennial is spectacular for being just down the road in Lincoln Park, but I wouldn't say it's world class.. . Environment:  Perennial is very nicely decorated.  Tables have enough space between them, allowing for private conversations.  It's not too loud, even though this place is definitely hot right now.  The trees inside the restaurant are a nice touch.  Tables by the windows are the premium seats - but keep in mind that lights from cars driving south on Lincoln Ave can actually be a bit annoying.. . Food:  Great contemporary American food.  I had the scallops with braised meat ravioli - excellent!  My girlfriend had a fish dish - very fresh.  The portions and taste are perfectly priced here.  Entrees range from low $20s to about $30.  Oh yeah, get the pineapple cake dessert - I forget the name, but it was a must-have!. . Service - our waiter was polite, attentive, helpful and full of personality.  Exactly what we look for out of a waiter.  Perennial management definitely  knows how to treat their customers!
