I cheated last night.. . I ventured into unknown territory and it caused me to question my first love. I am normally a gal who stays loyal to the things I love and never stray from the ones I am familiar with, but Hollywood changed all that for me last night.... . *******************************. . I had dinner last night at Ruen Pair Restaurant and was lucky enough to have great company along with a great meal. We munched on the following:. . - Spicy Red Curry with Chicken- my favorite dish of the night, tons of flavor and tons of bamboo! YUM!. - Papaya Salad with Raw Crab- spicy and tasty. if you get get your hands dirty and manage to get some crab, this dish is well worth it!. - Sauteed Clams- i am new to the clam world and these little things were good!. - Spicy Catfish- my least favorite dish of the night because of the bones. . Although I strayed from my all too familiar and favorite place, Thai Boom (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ) I can positively say my evening of yummy eats and even better company made venturing out to unfamiliar territory all so worth it.. . Tons of laughs, new adventures and great Thai food gave me every reason to believe that leaving my box on the Westside might bring me new and exciting surprises. All in all, a great evening!! :). . P.S. Thai Boom- although there may be others, you will still have a special place in my heart! . . xoxo
