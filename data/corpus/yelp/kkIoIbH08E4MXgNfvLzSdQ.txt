Bozu has been on my "to try" list for quite sometime and I finally visited it a couple weeks ago.  I was pretty excited considering all the ratings, but I have to say that I wasn't as impressed as my fellow yelpers.  It was definitely good, but the sauces and creams and stuff overpowered the fish.  I'm all about simplicity when it comes to sushi, and I guess I should not have been in that same frame of mind, since Bozu is more like "tapas".  It's definitely a place I would go with a group, the servings are pretty generous and too much for only two people to share if you want to try lots of stuff.  If you're looking for your traditional sushi and sashimi, you may want to stick with your fave sushi spot.  If you want to try something new with a different twist to sushi, this is the place!  I think this is also a good place to introduce sushi to new sushi eaters.   The fish is very fresh, don't get me wrong, but I wish there was less sauce so I can taste it.
