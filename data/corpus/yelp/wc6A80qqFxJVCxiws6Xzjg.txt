Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
I like nice people at bars and restaurants. That's why I love living in the midwest and why I love the service at Uncle Julio's.  It get's a bit slow towards the end of your meal, since it's so crowded, though.. . As far as the food goes, I love the choices on the menu. Above and beyond the basics and lotsa veggies if that's your thing (it's mine and I'm not even a vegetarian).  The taste of the food is nothing out of this world, but I like it.. . The frozen margaritas are super delish, but my complaint is that Uncle Julio's can't make them calorie free and hangover free.  I girl can wish, can't she?
