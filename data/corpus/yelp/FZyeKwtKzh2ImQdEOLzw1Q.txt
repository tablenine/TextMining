i love this place! Its definitely one of those places (depending what you order) where you walk out not feeling bloated. I ordered the bacon spinach frittata with a side of potatoes and a single pancake with bacon bits on top which I shared with a couple friends and it was plenty!. . well priced, well portioned and cute people hahaha..
