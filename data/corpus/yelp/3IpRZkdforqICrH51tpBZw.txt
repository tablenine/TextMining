Restaurant: Twist A Tapas Cafe
Category: Tapas Bars
I'm a huge tapas fan (or maybe just a bacon wrapped dates fan) and this is my go-to tapas place.  Their bacon wrapped dates are pretty amazing, second only to Bullehdias, which are also stuffed with goat cheese (in my opinion, cheese rarely ruins a dish).  The escargot is pretty darn good, even if it's not served in the shell, and their baked goat cheese blows Ba-ba-reeba's out of the water.. . My only complaint is that Twist is not even close to authentic Spanish tapas.  Bullehdias and Ba-ba-reeba are much better for that.  But the food at Twist is definitely great, even if it is very Americanized, and it's a short walk from my apartment, so I'll be back... again and again.
