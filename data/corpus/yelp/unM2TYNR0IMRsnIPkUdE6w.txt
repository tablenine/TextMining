SO I was very excited to join in on all the hype of these kogi trucks. I waited all day to eat from one of them...................... Come to realize it's just another notch on the belt of l.a.'s shitty food trends. Being in the business as a Chef I thought of this as an exciting idea if done right. Tradtional but played off the culture of taco trucks. When arriving was blown away by line. First two thoughts in my head. Awesome food, or people want to be seen eating here. The wait was about 45 mins(so you better bring a friend, I brought my girlfriend) When we finally got to order, I just about ordered everything on the menu.(When arriving to the window they had 7 cooks. I work in 4 star restaurant and we have 4 cooks who pump out about 600 courses in 2 and a half hours. So anways a little annoying for me. The food was far from korean and more like a regular taco truck the short ribs were marinated like carne asada. I was expecting a little sweetness with a touch spicyness. I cant even remember the rest thats how exciting the food was. My observation was people were more into taking a pictures of themselves in front of the truck instead of the food. Also took a look at their website and laughed at how douched out there PR is. Yes you have a good idea but no execution, and as far as you changing food your more likely be be another pile of bones in the food trend grave yard.
