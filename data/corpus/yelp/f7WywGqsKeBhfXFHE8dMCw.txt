Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
We were excited about going to this place. We always end up at Big Wong, or Wing Wong so we really wanted to try something new.. . Hated it so much, we had to leave.. . Ordered a wonton noodle soup with bbq pork and a pork &amp; preserved egg congee. The noodles were decent. A bit over cooked, and the wontons fell apart. The congee however was not edible. I tried really hard to just eat it but it was bad. Watery,like super runny with barely any pork or egg. It looked like prison or orphanage porridge. Hell they probably get better food in prison. . . Luckily, I was starving and I had to eat....so we walked down the street, turned right and chowed down at Big Wong. Still undoubtedly my fave for noodles and congee.
