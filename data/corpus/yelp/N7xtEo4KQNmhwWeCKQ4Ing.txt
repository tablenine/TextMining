Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I've been to Manna twice for birthday parties. I didn't really like the taste of the meat the first time around. Perhaps, it just wasn't very fresh that day. The second time around, it tasted a lot better. Even though Manna is sort of outdoorsy, it still feels stuffier than the completely indoor ones like Mu Dung San and Tahoe Galbi, so I prefer going to the latter two due to tastes and better ventilation. On the bright side, the side dishes here are good. I have no complaints. However, if asked where I would prefer to go for all-you-can-eat kbbq, I would choose Mu Dung San.. . Cool factor: they pop a bottle of champagne (free) for you on your birthday.
