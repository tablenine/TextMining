Category: Tapas Bars
This is my first time back at Cobras and Matadors with the new chef. While the food is not as mouthwateringly fantastic as when the last chef was around, it is still pretty darn fantastic. My favorites have always been the eggplant and roasted tapas spread on slices of baguette (not as good as it was before) and the sweet papas fritas (still perfectly fried and delicious). The skirt steak and dates wrapped in prosciutto are also very good. But no matter what, make sure you save room for dessert...the french toast and churros are the best part of the whole meal.
