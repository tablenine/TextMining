Restaurant: Alfredo&#39;s Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
What can I say that has not been said about Alfredo's?  The out of date wood paneled walls and terrible lighting definitely look like something from the set of Sopranos.  I've been going for years and have always had the same waiter, though I can't  remember his name.  I love his fake Italian accent- he's actually Cuban or something.  But the food is great.  The muscles are so good that I use an entire basket of garlic bread to dip in the sauce.  I do indulge myself with the signature dish- the Padrino- 3 medallions of veal done three different ways.  And I always end with the tiramisu which you can always count on to be deliciously creamy!
