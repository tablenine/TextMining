I didn't drink or eat much here.  So why am I writing a review?  I went with British people who kept telling me how authentic and good it was. They would make their case as they grabbed my shoulder and gave it an awkward squeeze.  It did something to me, something unnatural.  So here I am saying that this place I barely know rocks.  Its authentic and good.. . The sweet potato fries served in those cute little shopping carts are an obvious star.  And they're not loaded with cinnamon and sugar like diners like to do.  I don't eat burgers but, again, the Brits say its authentic and good and to their credit they looked awesome.. . The asparagus and the beet salad are overpriced, but if you have a veggie in your party they'll be more than happy at the balanced flavors and delicate cooking of both options.. . The only major quarrel is the size of the place.  Before long, the barbacks pushing you frantically out of the way while they whiz past with hot plates, the people ogling you while you eat waiting for your table and the cacophony of people talking over each other make it hard to enjoy an otherwise great establishment.
