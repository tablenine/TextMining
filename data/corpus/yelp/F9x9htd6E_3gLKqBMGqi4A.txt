Great breakfast/brunch spot.  Yes, it's Urth-esque but without all the fancy sunglasses and the valet-parked Escalades and SL's out front.  I rather like that you're not pestered by waitstaff and can just focus on your eating partners (or your newspaper) and the food.  The staff that do work the counters and take your order are very friendly.. . Admittedly the steak salad was less than stellar - bad dressing choice, too many grilled onions, too little meat.  But my friend's chopped salad was absolutely delicious - I'd definitely choose that next time.  Also got the side of bacon, which was a good thick-cut variety.  . . Didn't get to sample the sweets/desserts, but they looked tasty.  . . More than anything I loved the atmosphere here - cheerful, well-shaded outdoor seating, a wide range of customer-types.  Definitely worth the drive from the westside.
