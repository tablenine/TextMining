a great place in the loop to grab a greek salad, spanikopita and a beer. discovered this place one time when my parents were in town and my mom and my sister and i were going crazy in the then Marshall Fields on State St.--my dad had to escape and watch sports. he ended up at Miller's and i'm glad he did, because i probably would have never discovered it otherwise. . . it's an old staple in the loop with obvious regulars. great food and besides the greek salad, the greek burger that they make with feta, 1/2 hamburger meat and 1/2 lamb is so damn good. throw some greek dressing on it instead of ketchup and mustard, and it's unreal.. . if i'm in the loop i definitely try to stop here for lunch.
