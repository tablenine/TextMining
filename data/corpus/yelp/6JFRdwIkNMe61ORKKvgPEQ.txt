Cuban deliciousness!! The line looked really long and intimidating however once we got in line it went by really fast. The top part of the menu is like try everything for cheap menu. Then there were a few cuban main courses/sandwiches and deserts but everything else was pretty much americanized which is still tasty. The deserts and baked goods are delicious! The potato balls where our least favorite, still ok thought. We had the chicken empanadas, the guava cheese pastry, creme brule, fruit tart and croissant all to die for. We literally were moaning and groaning about it and people around us were entertained. I would give it a 5 but the majority of the menu was not Cuban. We are totally going back to try every desert though. The service was really great and they explained everything nicely and patiently.
