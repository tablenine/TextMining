ahhh, Manna. My usu K-town house of gluttony. the food here is pretty damn tasty for AYCE and while the service is not so great, nor fast, I can't really complain when I'm busy stuffing my fat face with tasty salad, meats grill to perfection and dipped in sesame oil with S&amp;P, and warm sticky rice. quality of the meats is pretty good AYCE and the sides are good as well. nothing high quality, but not terribly low either. also, its got decent ventilation as its not completely enclosed, so you don't have to look through a thick haze of smoke to see across the table at your party members. they take cc and have a valet lot, though I can usually find street parking within a block or two. i love buffets and AYCE for under $20, so if u do too, this is the spot.
