We went on Saturday night.  We paid $25 for entry to a Tequila tasting.  Our friends meeting us there had apparently gone the year before so we were excited to be there.  So, this is not a review of the normative experience.  . . The place is about the size of an average bar with one side situated with table seating and the other lined with a full bar.  It's a visually stunning place when you dig into the details of design.  The obvious accouterments are the felt paintings of Luchadors along the wall, all done by the same artist.  Then there's the booth in the back paper mached with Latin porn cartoons.  . . The tequila portions were small, about 1/4 of shot which was fine by me.  They had about 10 purveyors there and it was neat to sample all of them but it was nothing particularly earth shattering.  They had free (well not reall) chips and guac on the bar throughout and waiters tray passed 1 inch sized bites of quesadilla, flauta, and shrimp.  My girl and I didn't eat pretty much the whole day so assimilating tequila into our blood was more than efficient.  The rabbit food was no match for the (estimated) 5 to 7 shots of tequila we ingested.  . . The bartender (Davey) was understandably bored (or pissed).  A bunch of people who paid at the door, order nothing from you but water, and make a total mess of work station without tipping would probably produce a bad reputation for this event among the EC staff.
