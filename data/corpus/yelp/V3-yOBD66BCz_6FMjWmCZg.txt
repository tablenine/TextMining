I'm not a huge fan of  TV, and especially not a huge fan of being surrounded by TV screens, so Yard House is definitely not my favorite place to spend my free time.  I do realize this is a sports bar. However- the food is surprisingly good, and the beer selection is good as well. I am a Guinness drinker, and a neophyte to the 'beer tasting' scene- so my knowledge is sparse, although I do know what I like once I get a taste.  Compared to other local pubs, the selection of top shelf beer is light, however heavy in domestic IPAs and so on. Do not come here to get the Belgian experience. Do come here with diverse groups. this place would be safe for just about anyone.. . This was another birthday celebration for me, and we ordered the fried Calamari to start. I was surprised at the tenderness. The dipping sauces were meh.. . I had the summer salad (which I had before when I met with Bahati Foundation- the only other time I have had a meal at YH) and added chicken.  This is a wonderful salad from the starter menu, and is plenty of food. Not too much.. . Likes:. -not too loud. -comfortable seating in the booth. -food good. -good for groups, diverse menus. . Dislikes:. -seriously. TV everywhere. It is mind numbing.. -servers changed shifts in the middle of our experience, which caused a few unsavory delays.. -nothing special:. -it is a chain. ad as such has zero personality. Sterile.. . We had a great party, I wouldn't mind going here once in a while, but it is not on my list of favorites.. . ~mtbchick. . http://www.mtbchick.co.... . @modmtbchick
