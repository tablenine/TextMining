I made the ridiculous 40 mile round trip trek from LA to the SGV for some hainan chicken rice after work yesterday.  I walked into the tiny room and grabbed a seat at the counter and placed my order.  I was pleasantly surprised with how friendly the staff was and with how clean the place was.  There was even an A in the window.  Wait...clean, friendly, A...was I in a Chinese restaurant.  The menu was pretty limited, compared to other HK style cafes, but it didn't matter b/c I came just to eat the hainan chicken rice (just like 90% of everyone in the restaurant).  I noticed the guy next to me was really gross, he was literally shoving his food into his mouth, huge chunks with bits of rice flying everywhere, pausing only to send text messages.  It was pretty disgusting.. . Then my food came out.  I dipped a nice piece of chicken into the ginger sauce.  Holy crap!  That's the best f'ing hainan chicken I've ever tasted!  Moist, flavorful, boneless...pretty soon, I was in a shoveling contest with the gross guy next to me.  I literally inhaled my food and paused only momentarily to take a sip of my chrysanthemum tea.  At the end, I cleaned my plate about 30 seconds before gross eater guy.  Am I really that much of a little piglet?  I don't care, it tasted so good.. . Total:. Hainan Chicken Rice $6.25. Iced Tea $2.00
