Restaurant: Daddy D&#39;z BBQ Joynt
Category: Barbeque
I can't believe the hype around this place. I lived up the street from Daddy Don'ts for over a year and ate there periodically trying to figure out why there was so much hype about this sub par BBQ. The service was always terrible. Â The meat is no good, the sauce isn't either. The fried okra is usually rubbery rather than crisp. I would not recommend this to any true BBQ lover.
