YUM!  The ramen sure is good here.  But the wait, the sticky seat, and the amount of salt in the end made it 3-stars for me.  The broth is super flavorful but I still felt like it had MSG or salt or something.  When I got home, I must have drank a gallon of water and that usually doesn't happen unless there was a lot of salt intake.  The service was super quick and the quality was really great.  The egg was perfectly cooked!  I would go again if I were in the area again.
