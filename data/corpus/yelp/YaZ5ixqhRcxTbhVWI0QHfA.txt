Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Always wanted to eat here since I saw this place on the way to Royal/T... it looked like such a cool place to just chill, watch games on their TVs above the bar, drink some cold beer and eat a nice juicy burger.. . The thing about this place is that there is NO waiter service.  You order at the bar and they bring out the food and that's pretty much it.  I kind of like that because you don't really have to wait until some server comes to you and you have to wait even longer to order... if you're hungry, you order it yourself.. . I heard about the "Father's Office Burger" so I ordered that and had some of the sweet potato fries... freaking delicious.  I loved the sweet potato fries with the aioli they serve... Mmm.  I'm not a blue cheese person, but it totally worked with the arugula and burger was cooked perfectly... loved the medium rare... all the juices soaked in the bun... the bun kind of fell apart, but I didn't care because it tasted awesome.  . . Need to go back and see their selection of beer... and another burger to go with it.
