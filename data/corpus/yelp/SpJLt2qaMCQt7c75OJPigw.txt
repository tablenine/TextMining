Very very good.  . . I walked in fully expecting to feel the wrath of hipster service and attitudes, early on a chilly Sunday morning, and was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case at Highland Bakery, at least not with our waitress.. . It was a splurge meal and I was craving pancakes, add to that the fact that said waitress recommended them and it was a match made in heaven.. They came out and were delicious, moist and not overly sweet.  The syrup was perfect.  Garnished with a few toasted pecans and life was good.  . . They service was great throughout.  The waitress made sure the Batdorf and Bronson kept flowing but she was not overly intrusive.  A friendly smile and the occasional check-in on us.. . I got a mini peanut butter "tophat" on the way out.  It was pretty good, but not amazing.. . We got there early and were able to find parking in their tiny lot.  I can imagine parking being a bitch when the place is packed.. . End of review.
