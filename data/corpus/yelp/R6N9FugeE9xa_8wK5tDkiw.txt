Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I really reserve final judgment til they get their act together and have the actual veggie burger on the menu, but the Umami Burger sans-meat was incredibly tasty, the fries are truly fantastic, the onion rings lovely and crunchy, and the pickle platter is unreal.  So many amazing flavors, textures.  It's really a home run.  And Cake Monkey treats!  . . The day they have their veggie burger on the menu is the next day I'll be there, with a nice bottle in order to take advantage of the BYOB.  Incredibly promising, nicer decor than it needs to be, really friendly and intelligent staff, a little out of the way but definitely worth it.
