Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Good place to meet up with friends for dessert. Their ice creams are smooth and creamy with some creative flavors. The pastries/cookies also looked quite good and had that homemade touch. Of course, you gotta chug some milk to make things go down nice and smoothly. Â Staff is quite friendly and accomodating (they moved our tables around so our group could sit together). . . Bad: Finding street parking is annoying.
