I went a long time ago and remember not liking it, but I went last night to give it another shot.... . Full disclosure, here: I'm a "roll" kinda girl, so if you like "real" sushi, you can stop reading this review.. . I had the tuna sashimi salad - the dressing was good, but the tuna was too thick for me to enjoy.  Too much fish in your mouth at one time.  I DO like sashimi, but I prefer it nice and thin. . . We got a shrimp and salmon special roll which was just ok.. . Finally, we got the grilled shrimp and squid.  Usually love grilled fish, but it still had that "fishy" taste to me that raw fish does.. . I won't be back - you'll find me eating the Mexican roll at Rise or the Volcano at Coast.  . . So, again, if you're a sushi purist, take this review with a grain of salt, but if you're like me and look for the words "crunch" and "cilantro" in your sushi menu, then go elsewhere.
