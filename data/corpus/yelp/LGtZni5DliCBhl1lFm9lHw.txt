Restaurant: Sura Thai Bistro
Category: Thai
I haven't been back to Sura since the Yelp event last year and last Saturday seemed like a great time to go back in, especially since I saw they now had sushi on their menu. That's a good enough reason for me anyway. . . I had a crispy roll appetizer or something like that and it was really good. Shrimp, chicken, and lobster just can't be wrong ever! Then I got two rolls. Hey I was hungry! The sushi was really good and the rolls were well proportioned for the cost. My dining companion got a Thai dish and I tried a bite but it was too spicy for little old me. She said it was good but not the best she'd ever had. . . We had the most.Bizzare.Server.Ever. I think I got his whole life history and the restaurant gossip while sitting there. BTW he does legs on Friday at his gym and someone was getting ready to quit without giving two weeks notice. Like I said totally random! . . They also offer a $22 all you can eat buffet Monday-Wednesday but $22 doesn't seem like that great of a deal to me. I'm still up in the air about wanting to try it.
