Category: American (Traditional)
The very first time I went to Buckhead Diner I thought it was going to go on my all-time favorites list. One of the managers noticed us and we got a ton of service. Maybe this colored my memory of the night. . . The second time I went was drastically different experience. It was right before dinner rush, but food came out room temperature, wasn't that tasty, service was slow... Goodbye, Buckhead Diner.
