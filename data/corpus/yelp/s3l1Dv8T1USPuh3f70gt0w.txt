Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I drive from Santa Clarita to Culver City 5 days a week for work. If any of you know the 405....then you know that it takes 4 or 5 hours to get anywhere using that damn freeway.. . However, Titos Tacos makes that all worth it. Its the only saving grace to working here.. . Personally, everything on the menu is great, because you get exactly what you pay for. Titos doesnt pull any punches. Either you like the taco, or you don't.. . With that being said, 2 tacos and a drink is THE way to enjoy titos. Don't eat too much, because it will become bland. Â Eat too little, and you'll still be hungry. And make sure you get it with cheese, because it melts just enough to keep all of the lettuce in the hard shell.. . This place is a must for anybody remotely interested in solid, no punches pulled Mexican food.
