Okay - beer, drinks are nice, setting is nice. Pizzas are pretty good, veggie burger is good but, way too big. Here's my real beef with this place - all their "healthy" options come totally swimming in oil. This includes the fish, any veggie, and the salads. I am eating the remaining half of my wrightwood salad right now and my lips are still greasy dispite mixing in a ton of fresh lettuce. Bottom line, go here for the drinks, locale, and ALWAYS ask for the dressing on the side.
