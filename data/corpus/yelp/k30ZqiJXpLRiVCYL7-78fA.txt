Part of my review is based on the fact that I was expecting a totally different kind of restaurant.  I was very surprised in the fact that it is a bar.. . That being said, the valet at the door was nice and the atmosphere is perfect for a bar setting.  It has a rustic-y hole in the wall feeling, which is what I personally look for in a bar.  . . The wine we chose was great, it was called The Slammer by Big House.  It was a good price and very smooth.  . . The food was, well, mediocre.  I had the shrimp and grits.  The shrimp was fine, even though I am not a huge fan of BBQ sauce on my shrimp, and the grits were runny and not very cheesy.  . . Over all it was an okay dining experience.  Unfortunately it was cold outside so were didn't get to experience the upstairs patio that overlooks Atlanta.  I would go there again, but maybe just for some beers and a game, not a dinner.
