I swore I wrote a review for this place already but either way, here it is.. . If you been to the other locations like Gower, Pico, Long Beach, for some reason this location does not compare. In fact, it was matter of convenience that this one is here. I rather drive down to the one on Gower and wait 2 hours before I come back to this location.. . I'm really particular about my chicken where I will not eat it if it's like saw dust. Guess what? Sawdust, dry as hell, where's my milk. I need the Heimlich maneuver in case I choke on this thing. Maybe I'm just a harsh critic but I do like the waffles. Maybe it's just an off day for me to come here. The waffle was soft, not crunchy or toasty. Remember when you used to heat up Eggo waffles in the toaster, then you forget about it and leave it in there for a while? You come back to it and it's like soft and limp? Yeah, not a good thing, right? . . I wish not to come to this location again. Even to keep someone company, I would suggest another place to eat like CoCo's down the street on the other side of the freeway on Lake.
