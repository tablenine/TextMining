Being a Huge fan of beer. This place was great I could try a boat load of new beers i have never heard of or one I totally forgot existed. The food is pretty good as well, but I mainly go for the huge half yards of delicious beer. Not that once I have 2 or 3 of those I'm not hungry. The wait is pretty bad sometimes for a table but you can usually just wait it out at the bar if there is a spot. Last time i got the pastrami with grilled jalapenos sandwich and it was pretty good. Like I said i mainly go for the beer but end up eating and am never disappointed with the food.
