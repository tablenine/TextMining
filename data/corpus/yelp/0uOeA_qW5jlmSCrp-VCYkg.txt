We decided to hit up this place as we had a 50% off Scoutmob coupon.  The drive from Buckhead was somewhat painful but the place was pretty cool.  . . We sat in the patio area that is somewhat covered and a little cooler than just sitting outside.  The setting and the whole vibe is pretty cool.  We went for a really late (3:30PM) lunch so there weren't too many people there, but it's not hard to imagine that this place can be a great place to hang out for dinner and/or normally timed lunch.. . As far as food...  The bread was pretty damn good.  As was the garlic butter that came with it.  Pretty nice selection of drinks that showed some creativity.. . For appetizer we got the calimari.  It was very nicely flavored but the calimari itself was on the chewy side.  I'm hard to please on my Calimari.... . For my entree I got the Hawaiian Ahi Tuna (which on my trips to Hawaii I probably consumed 10LB of Ahi Tuna).  This was seared Tuna.  With a very interesting sauce, small portion of seaweed salad and mashed potatoes.  All in all it was good.  I like my Ahi Tuna to be cold (much more refreshing that way) but this wasn't quite there.  The sauces while very good, were a bit too overpowering for the tuna in my opinion.  Mashed potatoes average, not sure if it was properly paired in this case.  My wife got the Georgian Trout.  I liked her dish probably a little better than mine.  Nicely prepared trout.  Good sized portion.  Some grits and green beans on the side.  Much better ensemble in my opinion than my dish.  . . The service was pretty good.  Our waitress was a little quirky but nice and continued to check up on us periodically.. . So good place, nothing extraordinary and quite a long drive.  If we're in the area again, I would give it another chance probably.
