My friend lives next door to this place and we come to rodan when we can't think of any other place to go.  It's for the sake of convenience.  The place itself is rather neat.  Although the video mirrors in the bathroom serve no functional purpose whatsoever.  I've never had the food here, which I've heard is pretty decent.  The table service for drinks is rather unimpressive.  The girl that we usually get is inattentive and forgetful.  Not to mention that each time I've ordered a drink here they've managed to mess it up.  Examples...I order a lemon drop martini...she brings me a lemon drop shot, I reinstate I wanted a lemon drop MARTINI...she brings vodka with lemon on the side.   Another time at the bar I order a "tom collins" he gives me a gin and tonic, ask for a 7 and 7 get vodka and club soda, ask for a champagne cocktail get I don't even know what.  The list goes on.  In the future I think I will stick to beer, even though I know some how they will manage to mess that up to.
