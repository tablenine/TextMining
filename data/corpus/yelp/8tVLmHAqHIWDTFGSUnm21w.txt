Kicks ass.... . 'Nuff said...ok, not really.. . If you want swanky sushi, tasty cocktails, great service, and an awesome location for people watching in the warmer months.... . Run, do not walk, to Bob San.. . On the pricier side than many other sushi restaurants...but never have we been disappointed.. . Skip Rise...and head on over to get your fill at Bob San.. . And get the House Crunch roll...or the Beef Roll app. with perfectly cooked asparagus wrapped in thin layers of perfectly cooked and seasoned beef.. . YUM!
