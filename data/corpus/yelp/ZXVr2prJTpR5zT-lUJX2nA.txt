We went for the $19 all-you-can-eat deal.  The appetizers were really good and the sushi was pretty good.  If you're looking for straight up sushi, probably not the best place for that, but if you're looking for a little bit of everything, Sura's a good choice because they have tons of options on their all you-can-eat-menu.  I will probably go back.
