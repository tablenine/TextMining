Mighty fine subs. Not sure they're the absolute best in the city, but along with a place on Taylor St. (ack! what's the name?)  and L'Appetito, we're lucky.  At Bari, the price is right, the subs are fresh and tasty, their homemade roasted red peppers are delish, if a littlle oily, and the people who work there are friendly and helpful!
