Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Nothing better than a hot weenie between a soft bun. And hot dogs are good too! Ba dum dum...The legendery Pink's has its foes and its fans. I'm a fan. And while I haven't consumed one of these lovely links in a while, I've certainly eaten enough to write a credible review. And at it's 536th review, Pink's has obviously filled the frankfurter niche in LA. My fave? The guadalajara dog with tomatoes, sour cream and add cheese. Served with those yummy oven baked fries topped with chili and a side of difibulator....heaven on La Brea Avenue. And to the "long line" complainers....Oh Boo Hoo! You see the line! Don't get in it! DUH!! Go home and get your friends Oscar Mayer and Wonder Bread together and quit your crying! I wonder if I could get a Pink's link FedExed....hmmmm....
