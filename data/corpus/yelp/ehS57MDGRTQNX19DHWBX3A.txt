Great spot for a small group! Tasty tapas without an overdose of garlic (as some tapas places tend to do). Our table's excitement over "no corkage fee" led us to drinking about a bottle of wine per person. The wine shop next door is very convenient (and dangerous). Definitely make reservations. Definitely drink water between glasses of wine.
