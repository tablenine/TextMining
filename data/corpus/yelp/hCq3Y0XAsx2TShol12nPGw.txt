You ever been in a mosh pit, where you're bouncing around people, jumping over, on, up, and around them, basically just inundated by the mass of people around you?  Well, being at Porto's is a little less dense, but not by much.  There's HOOO--UUUGGGEE amounts of people milling around, fighting to see who's next to order the incredible food and pastries that Porto's makes.  It's somewhat of an effort just to get to the front when your number is called.  You're gently pushing people out of your way, trying to be polite about it when all you REEAALLLYY want to do is shout, "MOORRTAAAL COMBATTTTT!!!!!!", jump in there and start flailing around until you get to the front, do a stage dive off of the pastry display, and then toss out the devil's horn sign with both hands.  What makes people want to go through this you ask (I personally like very large, claustrophobic crowds, but maybe not the wait)?  It's the incredible food they have there, that makes it all worthwhile.  The potato balls, guava cheese pastries, and pear pastries are awesome.  We even order birthday cakes there that kicks ass.  Heck, everything is good there from smoothies to sandwiches.  What's even better is that its all CHEAP (relatively so of course).
