Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I've been so used to the Pico location, I just assumed the food wasn't the greatest but I still loved it anyway because well, it's Roscoe's.. . On Labor Day, I really had a hankering for Roscoe's and my friends went along with that desire. The parking lot was...empty so it was very easy to get a spot. Wow, this is already an improvement over the Pico location. . . They gave us a table off to the side since we had a baby with us. Our waiter spent a lot of time playing with him throughout our meal. It was very sweet. Service was awesome. They gave us more than enough syrup without being asked. . . I ordered my usual #4 (1/2 chicken smothered in gravy and 2 waffles) along with a side of greens. I hadn't been to Roscoe's in a while and don't recall the prices being around $15 for that combo and $3 something for the sides. Hmm...maybe it's the area or maybe prices just have gone up.. . The chicken was great! I could have actually used a bit more gravy as I don't eat my chicken skin (gave that to a friend). And the waffles seemed better as well. They were actually crispy around the edges and flavorful. I didn't think much of my greens though. They could have used a little salt (as in cook 'em in more ham hocks).. . I'm going to start coming to this location from now on.
