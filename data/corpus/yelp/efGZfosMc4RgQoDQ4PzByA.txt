Lobster is soooo good...and the clams..beansprout, beef..mmmm. everything i tried so far was so tasty!! When I first ate there, there portions were so big and colorful and tasty! Â it reminded me of the movie "Spirited Away" by Miyazaki Hayao; the food in that anime looked so good because of its portion and the color! And it looked so juicy! . Anyway, it satisfies me cuz it makes me feel like I'm eating the anime's food LOL It's good to go with a big party... . The lobster is expensive and everytime ago we spend more or less than 200, but always above 100. I don't like the fact that they don't take credit cards when you have to spend a lot of money.... But oh well..afterall the food it's really really good!
