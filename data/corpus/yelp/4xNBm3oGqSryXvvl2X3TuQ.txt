I thought I was done writing reviews for the year but I've got to fit in just one more, because Glorias is delicious!. . I ordered the Crab Soup, which comes with half a large crab . http://www.yelp.com/bi....  , scallops, squid, octopus, fish (watch out for the bones,) veggies, and warm tortillas which I didn't use.  It is awesomely delicious! . . I ordered it based on this yelp pic . http://www.yelp.com/bi....   and didn't even look at the price... With the amount of high quality seafood in it I was fully expecting it to be about 25-30 dollars.  Nope!!! only about 12!  . . That's simply amazing.  I'll be back again, and again, and again, and again. It's no wonder so many people love this place. With corkage only being 5 dollars don't forget to bring along your favorite spicy wine!
