after reading all the raving reviews, i had to come with some friends. . mneeeeehhhhhhhhhh. . the wait is not worth the food// the ramen is however pretty good. but i also bought the same type of ramen from the japanese grocery store in the plaza for like 1/3 the price and they tasted almost similar... . . service is good, nice and friendly servers. . honestly, I don't get why this place is so popular.
