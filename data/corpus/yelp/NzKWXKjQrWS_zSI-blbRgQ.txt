Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
came here, ordered to-go, big mistake(seafood isn't good for to-go, duh).  Since it was my first time, and was ordering for 3 people, I pretty much ordered everything just to get a feel of everything and I hate people telling me "you should have ordered that" so just to play it safe I ordered little of everything .  It was around noon, not too many people there yet.  I had the whole shabam which wasn't as good as expected.  If you hate trouble, skip the crawfish.  Shrimp was just ok,  the crab was just soso.  I am crazy about crab and so far I still prefer for it to be steamed, and have ginger/vinegar for sauce.  The tab came around $90, and my favorite was the cries, go figure.
