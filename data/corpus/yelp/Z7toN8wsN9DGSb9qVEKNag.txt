Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Alright, so I am clearly in the minority on this one.  People love their Phillippe. . . You walk in and it's wall-to-wall people, waiting in endless lines to place their orders.  And it's one of those establishments that sticks to one thing.  They make French dips, and that's pretty much it.  These both seem like good signs, right?    . . So after waiting in a huge line, I finally ordered a turkey sandwich, wiggled my way through the crowd to the upstairs dining area (that looks a lot like a dormitory), and I waited to be impressed.  It never happened.  Maybe it was my mistake to order the turkey instead of the beef, but it just wasn't anything special.  . . Also, when they say hot mustard, they aren't kidding.  I have never had anything hotter in my life.  The fumes went UP MY NOSE it was so hot.  My eyes teared up and my lips went numb.  It did not add to the overall experience.
