Restaurant: Fado Irish Pub
Category: Pubs
Great place to go to sit down, relax, watch the telly and drink a nice glass of the thick beer known as Guinness draft.  Speaking of Guinness, does anyone else ever feel like they ate an entire loaf of bread after drinking one or two glasses of that beer? Unless I don't feel like eating that night, I usually avoid drinking the stuff before dinner.. . The inside of the pub is dimly lit with wooden floors and tables.  Really a different place to go in an area of Atlanta that is traditionally known to have dance clubs and trendy bars filled with Buckhead regulars.  . . I wonder if all of the Buckhead regulars are all going to migrate to this place now that most of their coveted nightlife hot spots have demolished.  Nah, it  does not really seem like their scene.  The environment at Fado's is way to laid back and tame for creatures of their nature.  If there is not an individual giving belly shots and dancing on top of the bar, then the scene would probably be considered way too lame for their taste. They will probably just all become regulars at Club Europe or something.. . Andy H. hit the nail on the head regarding the precision and excellence that the bartenders achieve every time they pour customers a glass of Guinness.  Believe me, you have to be an expert to pour that beer with a minimal amount of foam on the top. I did it for a year and was never able to perfectly execute this art.
