NY corner slice review:. . Finally, a place that sells "NY Style Pizza" that actually comes close to tasting like it!  I think the quality has recently slipped, but still pretty good.  Rosa's has a great crust although a little thick on the end crust, good zesty sauce, and the cheese pulls nicely and isn't piled high and deep (yes...you are actually SUPPOSED to taste the sauce!).  Too bad they close early.  . . I give it my second highest sausage and pepperoni rating....from the NY Pizza Guy.
