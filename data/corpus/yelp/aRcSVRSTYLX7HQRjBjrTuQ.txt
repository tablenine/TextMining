I don't mind paying for quality food, but I feel like I get way less than I paid for at Tank. . . They've raised their prices since the last time I was here, and now I'm paying more than a dollar a piece for each rubbery, blah-tasting  bite of the shitake maki?  No thanks. . . I love baby bok choy when its done right, but if you order a side of it here, they just boil it til it is beyond lifeless.  Who wants to eat limp, flavorless bok choy?  Not me.  . . They are really good about giving you more than enough wasabi &amp; ginger, but unfortunately, the ginger they use is the opaque white kind that does not taste or has as good a texture as the pinker variety. . . I've never actually eaten in, so my only staff interactions are for placing the order over the phone and picking it up in person, and I've got to say that as far as that goes, they are friendly and efficient.  Last time, my order wasn't ready on time, so I went back outside (I had a dog tied to the parking meter) and they brought it out to me.  . . I would really rather walk a little farther to get better tasting, less expensive sushi.  I don't see myself coming back here any time soon.
