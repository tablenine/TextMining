Restaurant: Antico Pizza
Category: Pizza
Not a huge fan of the lasagna pizza, which I found to be good but disappointingly average (3 stars).  The ingredients are excellent, but the toppings seemed sparse.  The crust has also gotten thicker and dryer.  I preferred the thinner  and wetter crust from Antico's opening days.  . . San Gennaro pizza with its sweet peppers (4.5 stars) is still my favorite.. . Antico still has the best Neopolitan pizza in Atlanta, but there are not many places in America that serve this type of pizza.
