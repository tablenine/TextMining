I come here for their happy hour specials (4-7 PM and 9 PM-12 AM weekdays) once in a while, but  the menu is very restrictive.  The items that are available M-F for $5 are calamari, mussels served two ways, shrimp scampi, and goat cheese bruschetta.  Crab legs are $10.  You can get a burger with fries on M only, and 1-lb. lobster at cost on W and Th.  They also have a daily martini for $5.95 and a 3-course pre-fixe dinner for $35.
