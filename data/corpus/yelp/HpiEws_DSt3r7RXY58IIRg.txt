Delicious sushi? YES. A stylie scene? YES. A decent cut of fish? Not so much.... . PRO: Rice. The reason this place is great is actually the quality of the rice. You can feel perfect definition of each rice grain rather than a mushy blob in your mouth. . . CON: Skimpy slices.The slices are so narrow, that you cannot dip nigiri fish side down. This is pretty sad. I did actually get a mediocre piece of hamachi that was slightly chewy. Also, thumbs down on pink ginger. Authentic places have it undied. . . The sake/wine list is way overpriced. You cannot get a glass of anything but beer for under $10. They are selling a $6 bottle of Nigori for $22. Seriously? . . Cheers~
