Restaurant: Grand Lux Cafe
Category: American (New)
Actually 3 1/2 stars, but I can't figure out how to mark 1/2 a star.  . . Grand Lux Cafe is a great solid place to grub if you are hitting the Beverly Center to power shop.  No one ever wants to shop with someone on an empty stomach, aka grumpy customer!. . The food is good comfort food.  Mashed potatoes are yummy, the mash sweet potatoes are super yummy and if you are trying to watch your figure the simply grilled fish is very good.. . This place doesn't claim to be the next gourmet hot spot, doesn't try to be the hipster hangout - and it's not.  It's in a mall.  It's owned by the folks that run Cheese Cake Factory, so there you have it.. . Portions are extremely large (why are Americans so large??), so sharing could be a good thing.  Service is solid and attentive.  The place is large and a bit noisy, but all the better to invite more people to the party.. Later.
