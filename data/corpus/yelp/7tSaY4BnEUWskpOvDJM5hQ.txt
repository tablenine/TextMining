I always come here when I visit from San Fran. My fav is chicken wings, hanpen cheese and the fried fish.....All fried, make sure you drink lots of water, at home, too. The mexican guys can even speak Japanese. hahahaha...This place is always pack, wkends are worse. Be prepare or come earlier, not dinner time. Fast service from the servers.
