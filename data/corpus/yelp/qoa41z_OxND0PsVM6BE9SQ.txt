Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
I started going to this place in the late 60's, and have gone there pretty regularly until a few years ago...it was always great, loads of tasty food at a decent price, definite 4 star material...the last two times the place looks the same as ever, but the food has gone waaaay downhill...my favorite was the freshly made machaca dinner, even for breakfast...these last times the food was not fresh, the machaca burnt on one side (I mean black and sticky, ugh!), and even after slathering the only medium tasting salsa on, it was bland and tasteless...its not just my taste buds are fading with age, my friends all found the food unacceptably boring and just not worth the trip to the barrio any more. Unfortunately Manuel (who is still tottering around) has let the place go foodwise....an example of universal entropy? Anyway, I have regretfully stricken this once outstanding restaurant from my favorite's list.
