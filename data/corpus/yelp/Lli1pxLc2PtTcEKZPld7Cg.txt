Rodan in one word: CUTESY.. . Everything from the contemporary decor to the plating of the food. Speaking of food, here we go: . . 1) Tempura Green Beans (4 stars): A MUST. The green beans have very light tempura batter so the tempura:green bean ratio doesn't spoil the flavor. . 2) Spicy Tuna Maki (4 stars): What can I say -- I'm a sucker for sushi anywhere I go. Although the tuna was mulched, it was well done here. I did miss my side of unagi sauce though..... 3) NY Strip Steak (3 stars): Â This was the fiance's dish. It was average. You could taste that the meat was previously frozen. It was cooked well (medium-rare) though. The tempura onion rings were a nice touch, and the shallot vinaigrette dressing on the side salad was excellent. . 4) Chef Special (4 stars): My dish. Very innovative. It had prosciutto, sweet sausage, and some other pork dish that I'm unfamiliar with, but it was all very good. The side of a deviled egg was a nice touch. One star off for the pate. It was way too mustardy and sinus clearing (in a bad way). . . Overall, I thought the food was cutesy, innovative, and very good. Not bad for $42. Even better with our $40 Groupon. I wouldn't mind venturing back someday. . . The only thing that weirded me out was the amount of guys that were wearing skinny jeans in the area, including employees and patrons of the restaurant and people walking by the window where we sat. LOL. I'm sorry, I'll never be able to wrap my head around why guys would opt to wear skinny jeans. Gross.
