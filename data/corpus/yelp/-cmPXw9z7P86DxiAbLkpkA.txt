Met up with my friend Steve here for a much-needed glass (or two) of wine. I had a glass of their Rose wine and one of their white wines (don't remember their names but both were quite good). I liked that they give generous samples of the wines if you are unsure of what to order.. . We did not try the food but everything looked yummy. I'll have to try that some other time.
