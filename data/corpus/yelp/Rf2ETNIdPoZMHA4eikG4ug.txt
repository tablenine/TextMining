**UPDATE**. . This place got bumped from 3 to 5 stars...why you might want to know?  I decided they rocked.  (just avoid the wrap). . I went here again today, and although completely packed and a bunch of people waiting - they sat my friend and I rather quickly.  I liked that.  This is also a good time to mention that most of the staff today was male, and most (okay, all...cept one..just not my type) were GORGEOUS. . . Anyways.... . I got the half salad/half soup.  Tomato Basil soup was a tad too saucy for me, but still really good.  Toast Salad was yummy...and even as a half was huge - I took half of my half home.  . . My friend got the same thing - cept she got the Vegable soup - she said it as good, not fantastic but zero compaints.  For her salad she got the cobb and said it was yummy - she also took half of her half home because it was still really big.. . Mocha for me, fantastic today. Capp for her - she said it had great foam, really enjoyed it.  . . All in all, awesome lunch...cost about $28...so fairly cheap too.  . . Hooray!. . -------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------. I really wished I had liked Toast more then I did.  It looked so promising, with cupcakes in the case...and a great set up.... . I got the breakfast wrap...it was....okay...bland I guess..I'm not a huge fan of meat, and an even less fan of bacon - but this I dont think was bacon it was so stiff - felt like beef jerky..is that normal?. . Wrap in general was just "eh".    My friend got the protein plate, and absolutely loved it, maybe I just ordered wrong.  I'll give it another shot. . . I got a mocha (really?!?! noooooo) and it was pretty good - kind of generic tasting, I have yet to find a place (Le Pain....came close) that makes as good of mochas as Lemon Moon...I'll keep looking...mocha not bad, just not really "great" either. . . Overall...place was nice, wish I had tried a cupcake, wish I hadnt gotten the wrap....i'll go again...and update.  . . :-)
