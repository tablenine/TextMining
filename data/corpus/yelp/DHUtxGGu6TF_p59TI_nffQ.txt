wow - I was slightly bothered by having a beer here - so the thought of eating raw bar here just creeps me out.  this is a dive - and like all dives, you stay away from food and tap beer.  darky, dingy, smoky and odd - things that I am usually ok with, but somehow this place pulled it off 'Bitch Stewie' style.. . no thanks
