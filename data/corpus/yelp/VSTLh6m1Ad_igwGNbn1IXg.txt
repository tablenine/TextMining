Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
My friends and I are broke;  no moola! =(. . With our economy in a financial crisis and having to live on a budget, this place is  CHEAP!  You can have dinner for under $5!  No kidding!  I ordered 2 fish tacos for $3, and a drink for $1.The shrimp taco sounds good and run for $2, but I'm allergic to shrimp.  =(. . When you get your order, it'll just be a piece of deep fried fish on a tortilla.  They have a salsa bar where you can build your own tacos...like  salsa, lettuce, sour cream, quacamole, etc.. . They only accept CASH, so make sure you bring a few buck.. . Cons: The tacos fell apart, since I piled so much condiments on my tacos...they only gave me 1 tortilla.  Rubio's and Wahoo's have 2 tortillas!  I can't complain, it was good tacos and cheap!
