Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
The Alcove is a great breakfast/brunch spot; charming atmosphere, largely satisfying portions (both in size and taste), and a wonderful coffee/tea selection.. I am extremely fond of the crepes, esp the peaches &amp; cream number - which is phenom.  I've been to the alcove a few times for lunch, but have to admit the salads are a bit disappointing.  Way too leafy; and a bit overwhelming size-wise.  Also, the parking situation isn't fun - although there is a valet service if you are so inclined, the street parking is limited as it is located on a relatively busy (fast-traffic) street.  Also, on the weekends, seating can be hard to come by.. Great brunch though, perfect for a breakfast with visiting family/friends.
