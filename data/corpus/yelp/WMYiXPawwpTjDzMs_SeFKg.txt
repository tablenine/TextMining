From my Twitter: . "NARANJA: 10:30PM-Midnight@Super Auto Toyz - 12645 Beach Blvd, Stanton." (Naranja is one of 4 trucks they have now! The others are Azul, Verde, and Roja.). . Ah, Kogi Truck, we meet again. My first experience with Kogi did not go so well - 2 hours in line just wasn't worth it. Last night I had a different experience thank goodness! We showed up at 11:15pm and total wait time from beginning to our first bites came out to be 40 minutes. YAY for shorter lines!!. . Kogi Sliders: The Kogi name in my mind has been redeemed! Two hawaiian rolls, korean short rib, chili soy vinaigrette lettuce, and some delicious sauce made these fantastic little "sliders". This was better than the tacos and the burrito! I think $5 is too much for just 2 sliders.. but when you're waiting in line you don't really care how much you spend once you get to the truck.. . Short Rib Tacos: At $2 each taco, they're okayyyyyy. The flavor is all there and I enjoyed eating them. I just know there are better things on the menu than the tacos!. . Skip the lines and head straight for their restaurant - Alibi Room.
