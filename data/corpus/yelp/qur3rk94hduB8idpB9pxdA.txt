If you happen to have a Monday off from work, I suggest you check them out at midnight the night before.  Walked right in and had our pick of seats.  We sat up at the bar and admired the simplicity of the place.  Plain jane decor.  Small menu.  Good music.  I likey very much!. . We each had a drink and nibbled on a fish tostada and a poblano taco.   The pork belly taco totally had my name on it....I'll be back to taste test it!   Also next time, forget the alcohol (did I just say that?!?) I'm going to get the dulce de leche milkshake.  . . I can definitely see how this tiny spot can get obnoxious quickly with the lack of seating.  However, if you are craving a fancy taco on Sunday at midnight, go here.  You'll find a seat.
