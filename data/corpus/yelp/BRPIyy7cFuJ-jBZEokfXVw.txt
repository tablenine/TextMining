Real Food Daily serves one of the only strictly vegan menus in the entire city, and is the best at it by far. None of their dishes contain meat or dairy, which is surprisingly rare in L.A. But that doesn't mean you'll be choking down tasteless hippie chow - quite the opposite. Â What you'll find here is a full-flavored celebration of natural ingredients crafted with care. The menu offers a vegan take on American classics and Eastern dishes alike, using only the freshest organic ingredients possible. With rotating monthly and weekly specials, the menu stays fresh week after week. The ambiance is comfortable and cozy, with the added benefit of a peaceful and friendly staff. If you know a special vegan or vegetarian someone, take them here for a meal they won't soon forget.
