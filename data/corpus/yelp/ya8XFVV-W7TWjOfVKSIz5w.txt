The prime rib is good, and comparable to what you'd get in the steakhouses around town. I typically don't go to Houston's for dinner, it was more of a lunch stop for me when I worked nearby. The lunch service was quick, and it was certainly a step up from the junk I would normally eat. I think I've had every sandwich on the menu at this point, can't say there were any that I was disappointed with...
