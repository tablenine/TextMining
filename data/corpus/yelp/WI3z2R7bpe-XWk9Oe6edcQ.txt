Fantastic new addition to DTLA!  I think it's rare for one, nice establishment to be suitable for breakfast, lunch, dinner and gourmet goodies to take home but B. L. nailed it!. . Before our server got too busy and we never saw her again, she suggested we order lots of sides to share.  So, my group of four split the following.. . -Modena salad:  My fear when I see a salad with candied walnuts &amp; goat cheese is that it'll be too sweet, but this was not the case...very light and savory...butter lettuce is heaven, ain't it?. . -Napoli pizza:  Veggie was probably not the best choice for pizza but the crust/bread was fantastic!  However, it was one of those pizza's that you bite into and take the whole layer of cheese with you...bummer.. . -caramelized green beans:  I'm torn.  The garlic and seasoning were fragrant and delicious but they were a bit charred...not a crowd pleaser.. . -meatballs marinara:  These were a lot milder than I expected.  They don't have that "packed tight" meatball quality, instead they sort of fall apart when you cut into them.  I found myself scooping these onto my veggie pizza, hah!. . -portobello fries:  Crunchy and flavorful--the favorite!  It's rare to find a tempura fried dish that doesn't have the life sucked out of it with batter.  These little guys were goood and the dipping aioli was yummy.. . -burrata &amp; grape tomatoes:  Delicate, pretty side dish.  Unfortunately, because of our pairings, I think its soft flavor was overpowered by the rest.. . My plan:  their awesome coffee in the am, a fresh 'n tart Arnold Palmer in the afternoon and a bold cocktail in the evening!  My only complaint is that the high ceilings and stark interior make for one very looouud dining room.
