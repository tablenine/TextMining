Lot's of Smiles here. . Five stars for offering many, many different and exciting non-dairy frozen treats!!. . This place has been on my mind for a couple of years...  I'm happy to report that it hits high marks on my taste buds.  I went for the cashew/coconut drumstick and quietly licked up 'n down, around 'n around without offering to  my mate until little left was acceptable. . . Cold, creamy, sweet with a cone crunch. Ingredients here are top notch using cashews, coconut milk , soy was just clever --definitely made with LOVE.. . Oh SO Many Flavors that rotates:. Espresso, CookieDoughMix, Peach, MapleWaffles, Blueberry, Drumstick, BirthdayCake, Lemon, CookiesNCreamVanilla, Strawberry, Chocolate, Peanut Butter Fudge, Caramel Marshmallow, CookiesNCream, Lemon, MintChip, CaramelGingerCookie, Drumstick, MapleWalnut...
