This is the first time Yelp has disappointed me. Conversely, Food Network continues to prove me right that you cannot trust what they claim is good eats. I wonder if Oinkster's high ratings is more a good advertising effort than legit pastrami sandwiches.. . Don't get me wrong. It's not bad, it's just not great and worth driving out of my way for. You get a decent serving of meat but it's dry to the taste. The coleslaw does not provide much flavor or contrast to the sandwich. I like the caramelized onions, which was the most moist asset to the sammie. It did taste better with the house mustard - I'd stay away from the honey mustard. The latter is super pungent and just bitter, if you're into that. The belgian fries were ok. Meatier than McDs. Crispy but borderline hard too - and not from being fried-in-oil-hard, just hard. . . I will not be making another trip back. Did I mention there is such a huge price discrepancy between the pastrami and the burgers? The sandwich is not worth the price. If you want a good pastrami experience, try Langers. They've got the good bread, thick cut pastrami, and tangy cole slaw. If you want something closer, try chasing the Pastrami Sandwich truck. Even their pastrami is much more tasty than this place!
