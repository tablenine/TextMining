Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
This place is terrible. I'm from San Diego where good Mexican food comes from. This place charges $9.00 for a burrito, and it took 35 minutes for us to get our food on a Tuesday afternoon, what a joke. It might taste good if your fresh off the plane from Iowa, but if your a true Californian, I would pass.
