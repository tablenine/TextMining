Had an after dinner drink &amp; desert on the wrap-around deck.  Great little hide-a-way type of place.  The table behind me was having oysters - they were large and according to the diners - tasted delicious.  Prices are very reasonable.  1/2 dz oysters only $6.95 - a dozen for $8.95.  They have a raw bar sampler for $29.00 - great idea for more than one couple. One word of caution - don't park in the large parking lot behind the building - you will be towed!  Either park on the street (good luck) or valet at the underground parking.  Bon Appetite
