I have been dreaming about going here since I moved to  LA a year ago, and have been trying to make it through the door since then.  While, it happened the stars were all aligned, or something like that, and the connections were made.  . . Most of the time when I have such high expectations for a place, I am disappointed, sine I have had plenty of time to figure out what I think it should be like and it never matches up.  . . I had no idea what the Magic Castle would be like, but it was an amazing experience.  Dinner was fine, nothing spectacular.  I had their mac 'n cheese and it was quite good.  . . If you are going on the weekend the key is to get there early and line up for the shows much earlier than you would think necessary.   The  shows we went to were great, and the best part is, is that even if you don't make it into a show there are magicians all over in the many rooms and bars.
