Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
After our dinner at Tender Greens, we wandered over to Ugo for ------- GELATO!!!! . . The cafe was very busy and we couldn't get a table, so we just ordered from the counter and stood at one of their free-standing bars. The Gelato case was AM-A-ZING! I felt I had died and gone to Italy. Seriously, Banana Gelato! Hazelnut Gelato! Raspberry Gelato! Yo Momma Gelato! OMG!! . . The coolest part was when the kid behind the counter offered to let me TASTE EVERYTHING! I love you man. I tried just about 75% of the flavors and went with my ultimate concoction; Banana &amp; Hazelnut. . . They also offer coffee drinks, other pastries, wine and food. But I would just come here for the rich and creamy Gelato.
