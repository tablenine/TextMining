Restaurant: Buona Terra
Category: Italian
Buona Terra has become my guilty pleasure since I moved to Logan Square 9 months ago. My boyfriend and I probably frequent this place at least once a month. . Our favorites- the Ravioli con Vittelo(veal ravioli with a delicious brandy cream sauce), the Spaghetti ai Gamberetti (spaghetti with rock shrimp, spinach, tomatoes and fresh garlic), and of course the incredible complimentary bread and garlic spread they give you at the start of your meal. The mussels, Proscuitto e Mozzerella, and Calamari are fantastic appetizers. However, we were disappointed in Carpaccio.  . We have had many of the desserts here as well- and trust me whatever you choose, you will not be disappointed. . The ambiance is great and so is the service.  I can't say enough about Buona Terra- I simply LOVE it!
