Restaurant: The Bluebird
Category: Wine Bars
If could create my idea of a perfect bar, there would probably be several different visions in my head, but The Bluebird would be pretty close to one of them. The classy-yet-not-snobby, dimly-lit, brick-walled, nice kind of bar. I can't comment much on the food -- we ordered a cheese plate and wine -- but what we had was fantastic. I'll be coming back.. . They even had a little note in front saying "seat yourself". I appreciate it when a place doesn't take itself too seriously to let you know its protocol up-front, leaving you guessing what to do so you don't have to ask and blow your cool points. In other words, leave your cool at the door and enjoy.
