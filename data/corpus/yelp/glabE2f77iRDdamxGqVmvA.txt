hands down the best pizza i've ever had......2 slices of pepperoni....red pepper flakes....a dash of oregano......DO NOT dab the grease off...fold....take a bite......almost as good as sex when the grease drips off yur slice and runs down your arm......ok maybe the sex I'VE had hasnt been THAT Â great....hmmmm... but Santullo's Pizza is.....grab a bottle of Sprechters Ginger Ale and im in Wicker Park Heaven....... is that a possible place?
