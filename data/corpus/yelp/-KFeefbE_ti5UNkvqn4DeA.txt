About 7 years ago-I was making out with one of the hottest boys I've ever dated here (later that weekend I broke his heart)!  B Bar on Wednesday nights use to be the "it" model/beautiful people night.  Not so much anymore.. . Since then, I've been here numerous times, randomly.  Its good for a drink or 2 MAX-then move on.  Its fairly a large place, so there many lil' spots you can chill and have an "intimate" conversation.. . Goooooood memories.......
