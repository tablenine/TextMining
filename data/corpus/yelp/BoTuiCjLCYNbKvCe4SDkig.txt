Believe the hype, this sushi is to DIE for!!!. . I would skip on the appetizers, they were not bad by any means, but the sushi is soooo good you don't want to waste your appetite on appetizers. The fish was extremely fresh! The Star of the night was the Creamy Salmon roll, you have to try this at least once in your life! Make sure to make a reservation in advance or expect a super long wait!
