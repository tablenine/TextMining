When Pim visited from the Netherlands, he asked to go to Gibson's. He wanted to eat the biggest, rarest steak on the menu, and he was going to do it with gusto. Who was I to say no?. . I'm not a steak eater, so I watched him as he downed what was indeed the biggest, rarest steak I have ever seen. We had a side of mushrooms and spinach, which were both steak-house tastic. I think I had chicken (I can't remember, minus two stars for not being memorable). . . The people viewing was excellent - big hair, lots of leather, a healthy portion of plastic surgery and big mercedesesess with tinted windows. . . And Pim paid. Thanks Pim!
