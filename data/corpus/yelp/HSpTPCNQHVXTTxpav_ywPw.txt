In fairness, I have to admit that this place is a sentimental favorite: I had my first (blind!) date with my man here.  For that reason, this place will always hold a special place in my heart.. . The wine flights are great, and I generally think that the wines selected are a bit more interesting than your average wine flights, so good choice on whoever is making those choices.  The food is also very good.  The flat iron steak with fries was outstanding and perfectly cooked.  On a later visit also had the cheese plate, which was thoroughly enjoyed by both parties.. . Here's my overall advice on this Bin: It makes wine approachable and fun, and any place that can do that already is a win in my book.  The general vibe is laid back, which I think is a nice addition to the "wine bar" scene.  Throw in some very solid eats and you have a great neighborhood joint that is equally well-suited for getting together with girlfriends or for a (first...blind...) date.
