Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
With a menu even simpler than in-n-out and food that is perhaps even more fresh, Best Fish Taco is my go-to spot for cheap eats in my neighborhood.  The frequently replenished salsa bar is a perfect complement to their elegantly simple cuisine.  The horchata ain't bad, either. . . Love it love it love it.
