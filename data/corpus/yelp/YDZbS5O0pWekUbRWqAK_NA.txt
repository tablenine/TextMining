Went today for lunch. This for sure is one of the best sushi places on the westside for the prices they charge. I took advantage of the free valet parking out back with a validation. I had yellowtail, unagi &amp; tuna and it was HUGE pieces and so tasty. Can't wait to go back. Oh the service is great too.
