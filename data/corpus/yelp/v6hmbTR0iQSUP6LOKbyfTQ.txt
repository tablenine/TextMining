Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Ramen: Hakata Ramen w/ Spicy miso paste. Sides: gyoza, chahan. . 3 1/2 stars.. . I like their ramen.  I do.  But its not my fav.  They probably have the best noodles here because you can get it the way you like it.  But aside from that, I find their broth not as flavorful as I would wish.  The added spicy miso paste kicks it up a notch, but its still on the bland side for me.. . They gyoza is average and.... well, tiny.  I can have 10 servings of their 6-piece gyoza.. and I will be hungry.. in 10 min... I do not like their way of cooking it.  Too crispy to the point of being almost burnt, while the top side is limpy and loose.  The ratio of meat to veggies is too veggie-esq.. . Chahan here is the type I do not like.  I love the chopped veggies and bits of chashu style but they have their own version and I simply didn't like it.
