Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
I have a soft spot in my heart for little family restaurants. Las Palmeras has a cozy feel, very interesting art on the walls and a crazy, little gift shop. . . The lime pork reminded me of carnitas, which I love, so it was a happy choice. Tasty crispy bread, tangy beans n rice, and maduros are always good. . . The sangria is dangerous, I kept looking at the bottom of my empty glass. Mmmm, red cheeks.... . Cheers~
