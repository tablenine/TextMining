I'm still baffled by the magnificence of the sushi I had here two weeks ago.. . My friends and I sat at the sushi bar on a MONDAY NIGHT because it was so packed, we were going to have to wait 45 minutes. That right there should tell you something!. . We decided to try new things, and after every bite, we all looked at each other in astonishment. EVERYTHING was unbelievably delicious.. . The price was a little high, but we did order quite a lot of food.. . I highly recommend the crispy rice with spicy tuna. My vegan friend ordered it without the fish, and they were happy to serve her.
