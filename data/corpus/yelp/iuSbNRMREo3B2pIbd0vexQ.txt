Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
As with all Los Angeles restaurants, you take the good with the bad in terms of the Hungry Cat. Yes, it's weird to eat next to a Border's, in a mall. Yes, the douche sitting next to you talking loudly on his iPhone is probably some Hollywood poser. But to me, it's worth it, because I love the food and the drink here. And, believe it or not, I love the service.. . I am not a fancy Hollywood type. I don't dress correctly, I'm not svelte and disinterested, and I don't dine at 11 pm. And yet I have always had excellent service here from attentive servers and bartenders who are friendly, answer questions about the menu without eye-rolling, and don't ignore me for hours at a time.. . I love the excellent, creative drinks, especially the crazy Orange Julius and, on the nonalcoholic menu, the limeade. I had a splendid Greyhound as well. I have also never had anything off from the menu, from the peel-and-eat shrimp (have them peel it for you and pay the extra five bucks...the herbs will be that much more potent) to the octopus to the intriguing seasonal salads to the paella. Even the nicely balanced cheese plate, with marcona almonds and a slab of honeycomb - and huge slices of oiled, grilled bread - is a satisfying conclusion to the meal. I've never had the burger - generally, at a seafood restaurant I'll stick to seafood since it's such a rarity for me to eat - but I would absolutely try it based on my experiences with the menu.
