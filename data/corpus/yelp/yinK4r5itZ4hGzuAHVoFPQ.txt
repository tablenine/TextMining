Wow!  I just learned about this place today and I have to wonder why I never knew about it before.  I usually go to Kool Korners for Cuban sandwiches, but my co-worker convinced me to go hear instead.  I was not disappointed.  The sandwich was delicious and huge!  The black beans and rice were good really good too.   I hope to try some of the other dishes next time.  I saw the daily special- Ropa Vieja- after I ordered- I will be back next Wednesday to try it.  If the other food is as good as the sandwich and beans, I'll bump it up to 5 stars!
