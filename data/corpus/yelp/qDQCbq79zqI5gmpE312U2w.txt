I have to say I really enjoyed Feast.  Everything was very strong.  We started with the crab cake appetizer which is delicious, I actually thought ths roasted corn salsa and sauce was the highlight.  Very tasty dish.. . We then ordered our entrees.  Two of us got the BBQ Salmon one got the panko crusted chicken.  The chicken was definitely the better of the two, extremely plentiful and tasty.  I really did enjoy the salmon, I felt the amount of BBQ sauce was overwhelming and worked better with the hotcakes than the salmon.  Still, if you ate this the right way it was lots of delicious flavors.  We ordered a nice Chardonnay and for 3 of us with tip that bill was only $130.  I find that more than reasonable for the outdoor seating and great food.  will definitely be back soon.
