Pretty much exactly the same as the Santa Monica location. I only went to this location once and it was before a concert at Largo down the street. The restaurant space is a little less interesting than the SM location, but the food is still decent for non-vegans and apparently great for actual vegans. Still suggest the nacho app as a meal. Sometimes dishes you think should be hot are not because they believe in moderate temperatures, so check with your waiter. This one loses a star based on location/set-up and an unhelpful waiter.
