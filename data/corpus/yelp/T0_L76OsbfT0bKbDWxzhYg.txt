This is my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant!!. . All of the staff here are very nice.  Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays, they have 1/2 price house margaritas-amazing!! . . I always get the spinach quesadillas-they are sooo good!. . It looks small on the outside, but there is a back room with a bunch more tables.  They also have a couple tv's back there that are usually have sports games on. . . I definitely recommend going here!
