We went here because of the positive Yelp reviews and were not disappointed!. . The food we had was very tasty and pleasing.  I had the cheese enchiladas suizas (yes, a heart attack on a plate) and it was delicious.  My husband had a shrimp something with chipotle and he enjoyed it quite a bit.  I think his complaint would be that he would have liked more food, but he said it was good.  We also had a side of guacamole and it was very good.. . In addition to good food, the service was excellent, for the most part.  The wait staff was friendly and kept our glasses filled.  Our waiter was a little slow, but I think he was also fairly busy, and he was definitely friendly too, which was great.. . I'm not giving them five stars for two reasons.  One is because of the acoustics!  The place was pretty full, though we didn't have to wait for a table, which was great.  We could barely hear each other across the table, though, and it kind of sucked.  I did notice on the way out that the front room, where we were not seated, seemed about half as loud as the back room, so given my choice, I'd try to get a seat out there instead.. . The other reason is the menu was very small.  Oddly, they didn't have burritos, which was a bummer, because I like to fool myself into thinking I'm getting some kind of nutrition when I eat and burritos allow me a little of that, whereas cheese enchiladas suizas, not so much . . . .
