I remember seeing this place on the show Man vs Food and I had been Dying (note the capitol D) to come here ever since. Then, one day, I was in the area and looked up and saw the sign....and I opened up my eyes , I saw the sign! Â It took a while before it dawned on me that THIS was the PLACE!!!!!!! I was sold before I even went in. . . I got to the door and I had to step down some stairs as if I was entering a basement and little by the little the scene of the restaurant emerged the further down the stairs I went. I started stressing out because there were LINES of people EVERYWHERE. But, they had a system and the lines actually moved pretty swiftly. The order clerks actually take their time with you. They don't rush or make you feel rushed in any way. I really appreciated this as this is a quality of service you dont get many places in LA. Its something that sorta died with the ages, good ol' home-style customer service :) Its the patience in the people and the preperation that really makes this place stick.. . Alas, I orderd the Orignal sandwhich with Lamb. I enjoyed watching her carve the meat fresh off the bone and onto my plate...then she takes the bread and dips it ever-so-gently in the sauce or the "debris" as they call it. What a piece of art this was! and I couldnt wait to tear it apart!! I also took the liberty in ordering a side of slaw and a slice of custard pie. I sit down and notice the spicey mustard and had to try it. Pretty potent stuff. Go easy with this stuff, you don't want to embarass yourself! . . This place was a great experience and I look forward to coming back!!
