Restaurant: Maggiano&#39;s Little Italy
Category: Italian
I took the inlaws there for dinner.  Got a table right away.  They kept the bread coming while we waited for our food.  The appetizer came before the main courses like it's supposed to.  We all ordered something different, everything was delish.  I wouldn't say that it knocked my socks off, but it was pretty darn good.  I have eaten there before and last time I was much more impressed with the food.. . Anyway, the food is very good.  The service is good.  There is self parking in the back for those who don't want to pay for valet (i.e. me).  It's a fancy restaurant type atmosphere, but they don't have a dress code or anything.  Good place for taking someone on business, or for a date, or even for a family night.  There is also a full bar, and I noticed some expensive whiskey in a glass case in the front.  So if you want to watch a Braves gave and have a glass of 100 year old Remy Martin, you can do it here.. . Here's the bottom line -- you can spend a boatload here if you want to, but six of us left more than satisfied for a bill of $90 after tip, and I'm a good tipper.
