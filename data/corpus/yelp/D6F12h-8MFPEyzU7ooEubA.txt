I like these type of places.  It's the type of place where you can get coffee and dessert.  They also serve tasty sandwiches and salads.  It's great for people watching.  We got our food pretty quickly considering how packed it was.  We had the thinly sliced mortadella sandwich, the prosciutto de parma sandwich, a mushroom pasta salad, and the coconut cupcake.  All items were great.  I really liked my mortadella sandwich because the baguette was nice and crisp but not overly hard. (I hate when the bread is so hard that it hurts the roof of my mouth!).. . If you like places like Dean &amp; Deluca where you can get different types of cheeses and other gourmet foods, then you'll definitely like this place.  . . The only drawback is that parking is kind of tough.
