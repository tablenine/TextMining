OK, let's be clear here - I'm being generous in my rating and most folks are *way* too easy on this place.  I guess it's part of a chain, but I'd never heard of LA Mill (is that L.A. Mill or La Mill or what?) before they opened up on Silver Lake Boulevard in my hood.. . Now maybe I'm just being cranky because my fave old hangout, the Back Door Cafe, was forced out by its landlord just prior to LA Mill opening up.  I mean, LA Mill doesn't have the casual vibe and real neighborhoody feeling that Back Door had.  What it does have is really nice decor - although distinctly on the cool side - and the promise of better things to come once they get all of their serving issues worked out.  . . In the first couple of weeks, it generally took me about 15 or 20 minutes to get a cup of joe (OK, maybe it was a latte), which is ... kind of sub-par.  Good coffee, and interesting choices.  The food is a little fussy and pretty pricey, but I thought the muffins were nice.  But, seriously, none of this calls out to me to hang for an afternoon.  And the whole vibe in that area has changed drastically from hip casual to "I'm a screenwriter" (not that this is always a bad thing, as my screenwriting other half will remind me).  Maybe it's your kind of place - it's just not mine.
