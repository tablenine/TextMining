5 stars becuase the roastbeef sandwich was delicious! The menu was Inexpensive and the atmosphere was really laid back. It took about 10-15 minutes of waiting in line to order our food but it was definetly worth the wait plus I arrived in the middle of lunch time rush. I'll definetely be back...again and again.
