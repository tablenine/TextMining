Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Every time I visit LA or even pass through LA, I have to stop at Porto's. . . Everything thing they have on their menu is freakin' delicious. They have beautiful/delicious cakes, yummy pastries, amazingly flavorful sandwiches (that come with banana chips), and good drinks to drink all that food down with.. . If you have never been here before, you have to try their cheese pastries, potato balls, and a sandwich. Also, if you tell them its your first time visiting they will usually give you suggestions of what to get, will give you some samples to try and sometimes even throw in a few free items :) . . The only down side to this place is that it is always super packed but luckily the line tends to move fast, and trust me folks, after one bite you'll realize the wait was so worth it.. . Why are you still reading this, go to Porto's already!
