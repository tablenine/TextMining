Good Dim Sum selections.  Came on a weekday where we were given a picture menu and circled our choices....big mistake.  We were over excited due to complete hunger and ordered WAY too much.  Ha, ha!  . I guess the weekends are when they go around with the carts.. . The only dish that I would say to skip is the short ribs, other than that have fun!!
