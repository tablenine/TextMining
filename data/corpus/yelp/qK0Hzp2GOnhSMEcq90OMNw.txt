Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
Very solid, reliable, always good Brazilian (ish) food.  Their pizzas are really yummy (especially the Arugula one, and the Margherita one aint bad either.  The best app is the Fried Yucca Root, which basically just tastes like fried, but is mighty tasty.. . I always get Aurelios Favorite Sandwich, which is basically a South American take on a Caprese.  Absolutely delicious.. . I end up ordering from here a lot when I'm in Hollywood or West Hollywood.  It's good for sure.
