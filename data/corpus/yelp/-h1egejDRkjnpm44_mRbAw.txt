Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
If you are a garlic lover, I would have to say that the stinking rose would be like heaven to you. I personally love garlic myself and I ordered the filet mignon, it came with mashed potatoes and some vegetables, which was cooked with garlic. It was a good dish, but it's not like I would go out of my way to go get some more of it. Personally I would rather go get some steak at Outback. . . The ambiance is nice for couples, besides the food, I guess this would be a nice place for a first date. I don't really think it would impress your date much though.
