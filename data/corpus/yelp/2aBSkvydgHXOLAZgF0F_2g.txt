This place is cool as can be.  We went for New Years Eve, it was a blast seeing everyone dressed up and enjoying great food and fantastic entertainment.  I've wanted to go for a long time, and it definitely did not disappoint.  If you find yourself lucky enough to be invited, head on down and enjoy the magic.
