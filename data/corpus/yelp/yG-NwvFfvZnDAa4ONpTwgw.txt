Restaurant: Spice Market
Category: Asian Fusion
I went here with a friend of mine to attend the Gavin Degraw concert that was for event planners to see what the space was like as well as be entertained. I was.. . However, we had dinner first in the Spice Market. The service was ATROCIOUS! We walked in and no one greeted us. When we did get someone to notice us they were ambivalent to our presence. We sat down at some of the tables in the bar area and had to flag down a waiter. While he was quite nice and personable, he disappeared after he took our order. Our food finally came and was placed on the tiny bar tables which were not big enough. Inevitably plates fell to the floor. We moved to the bar on our own accord. Again, no servers or even bartender.. . Finally, we had to ask several times as we waited for the bill. It came, and surprise, it was incorrect. Fifteen more minutes to wait and they returned with the correct bill. . . It seemed like the staff didn't want to be there or care about the customers.. . The food was ok - but I just remember the poor service and don't recommend returning.
