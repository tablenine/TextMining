Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
Sometimes, I'm just so lost for words that it takes me 15 minutes just to think of what to write in one of these reviews. . . So here is a list of some things I love:. 1- Street Food. 2- Grilled Cheese. 3- Mac &amp; Cheese. 4-Pulled Pork. . Today, I felt like Jesus, Buddha, and Allah all came together and created this thing known as the Cheesy Mac and Rib Sandwich and said," We know Jordan is going to love this.". . This sandwich was a combination of all the things mentioned above and grilled to a satisfying crisp. The first bite was so immensely delicious, I almost cried, which is remarkable because sometimes I wonder if I still have tear ducts. My friends and I Â  just sat there, speechless, with the same stupefied look of "How the HELL have we never thought of this before?" Needless to say, we all thought it was f*!%$g amazing. . . I really am shocked that this only has a 3-star average. I guess we caught them on a good day. Our trip, from the second we got in line to our last bite, was only 45 minutes (We went to UCLA). It was well worth the 1.5 hour drive and the blissful food coma afterwards.
