Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
This place is legit.  I've been going to Porto's since they were a tiny little bakery in Glendale.  I love how they grew and built a place in Burbank.  It's great to see such places make it and continue to grow as the years go by. The Porto's family is great and always welcoming.  Great Job and keep up the excellent work.
