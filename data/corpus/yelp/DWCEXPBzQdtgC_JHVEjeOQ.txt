Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I really don't understand WHY WHY WHY, someone tell me WHY this place is the hip place to go, yea, its great when you have a group of people, and sure, we all want unlimited amount of bbq stuffed in our bellies, but this place is byfar, SHITTY... . . the meat tastes like rubber.... . i swear, i'm korean and i'm telling you, its so yucky!! . . DO NOT GO, . . VALET PARKERS ARE ASSHOLES, &amp; THE FOOD IS GROSS! . . BOTTOM LINE: DON'T GO. . . OMG, I have friends who come from all over the world and this is the first place they wanna go! i can't even give it one star, but YELP is making me, so FINE, there! i give it 1 dinkin star, only because it's REQUIRED but if u ask me, i'd rather wipe my butt.
