Okay.  I heard there's usually a CRAZY wait for this place, so I walked over at 4:30 to get a table for 2.  I still had to wait 20 minutes.  The hype was affirmed.. . We ordered the Daikokuya ramen, of course, and the broth was tasty, as was the chau siu.  I liked that it wasn't as salty as Katanya in SF (which everyone RAVES about).  However, there was something not very satisfying about this place....kinda like an over-hyped movie.  Can't put my finger on it though; I guess I wouldn't mind going to the closer Shinsengumi for ramen.  . . Overall, I'd come back for more...but not very often.
