Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Since they already have almost 700 reviews, I see that Mastro's does not need my 5 stars, but I'll give them anyway.  The food was excellent, wine selection was excellent, cocktails excellent, service really excellent.  I love the clubb-y atmosphere in there.  The main negative of course is the price, but you're not supposed to eat at Mastro's every day (unless you wanna weigh 300 pounds, that is).  Also, the average age does get a little bit high later in the evenings (come on, what do you expect?  It's a fancy steak place in Beverly Hills!).. Bottom line:  if you have a chance to go there (especially on somebody else's dime) - do it!
