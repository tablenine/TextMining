I love this restaurant! The main draw, for me, is the wide selection of Belgian beers.  They've got a great selection, and the bar tenders really know their stuff.  I've only ever eaten the mussels and frites, because they're so good that's all I ever seem to want to order!  It's a nice atmosphere too.
