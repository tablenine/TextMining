I don't particularly enjoy being the lone voice of dissent...but I was pretty disappointed by my visit here. Part of that is our fault, having ordered just one seafood dish out of three at a restaurant with the word "Seafood" in the title. That dish, the fish filet with basil, was actually pretty delicious and bold-tasting as was the hot and sour soup served before the meal.. . The mongolian beef and cashew chicken were very very bland, even though the mongolian beef was listed as "spicy." Neither dish ranks well in relation to similar dishes I've had elsewhere.. . Now, walking out of the restaurant, I spotted a whole fried fish which looked and smelled delicious. And of course a good deal of the raves here center on the lobster. So I realize we clearly ordered the wrong things.. . I was willing to extrapolate from the fish dish and up the rating to three stars, but I had a pretty intense stomach ache after eating there. Not being one to deduce trends from a sample size of one, I wasn't convinced it had to do with Newport Seafood. That is until I had some of the leftovers the next day for dinner, and had the same intense stomach ache soon afterward.. . As much as I would like to return and try out the seafood, I would also like not to have stomach pain. I suspect the latter sentiment will win out.
