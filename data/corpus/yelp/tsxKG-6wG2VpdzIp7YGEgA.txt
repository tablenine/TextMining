Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
WOW...WOW.  I have never been to Korean BBQ, but this place made the first impression phenomenal.  The hostess was so attentive and, even though we were not waiting long for a Friday night dinner, she was extremely apologetic.  Then when I scoped out the place, every table had its own grill.  That meant for me, "Playing with my food when my mom wouldn't let me!"  YAAAAAAAY!  When we started our meal, all these little dishes were brought out to us as appetizers.  I didn't know what a whole bunch of them were, but it was exciting to try every dish!  The BEST part was the meat, lots and lots of meat.  I was in heaven!  GO TO THIS PLACE WHEN YOU ARE CELEBRATING A SPECIAL OCCASION (because it is pricey).. . The only complaint I have is, I understand it is a Korean restaurant, but it's a Korean restaurant in L.A.  Come on.  The waiter has to minimally speak and understand the English language.  We would ask the waiter what we were eating and he explained through sign language.  Uuhhh, thank God I don't have a certain food allergy.  Yikes.
