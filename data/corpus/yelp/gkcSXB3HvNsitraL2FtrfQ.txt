The reason I give this place 1 star is very simple.  I called to make a reservation here for some evening in the middle of the week.  They basically told me there was nothing available between 6 pm and 10:30 pm.  I had to show up to this place before 6 only to find ONE other couple eating there.  We were there for probably an hour and half at least and this place was about 3 quarters empty.  I don't like being bull sh$tted and forced to eat at 5:30 so you can appear to be a busy restaurant when I call to make a reservation.  Don't you think I might notice there are only 3 couples in the room???  . . I could go on forever about how bad that pisses me off, but I won't.  Their food was bad.  Plain and simple.  I ordered the duck confit and was greatly disappointed.  It was tasteless and bad in texture.  . . I have always had great experiences with the pizzeria next door.  Don't bother with this nonsense.
