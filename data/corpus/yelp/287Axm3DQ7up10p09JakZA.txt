I almost want to say this place is more of a novelty food establishment than a place with really good food. First off, let me say that this place has SPICY ramen. You can choose from level 7 to level 1 (7 is nonspicy). Then, from there, they have Special 1 and Special 2, which are supposed to be insanely spicy. If you can finish a Special 2 (soup and all) within half an hour, you get a polaroid photo of you to put on their "Wall of Bravery".. . I gotta say though, I didn't think the ramen itself was that tasty. The broth, though with a spicy kick, doesn't actually have much flavor, and noodles are a little firm for my taste. I think the portion of actual solid food is probably the same as any other ramen place, they just give you tons of broth.. . Another gripe I had: I ordered the extra green onions for $1.25... what came out was a small plate with maybe one stalk's worth of sliced green onions. Seriously?! I can buy a bundle of 7 or 8 stalks for 25 cents! TOTALLY not worth it.. . Pros:. The servers were really nice, and around sunset and dusk, Weller court gets really pretty with lots of nice lights.. . Note: They only validate one hour worth of parking.
