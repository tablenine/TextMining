If i could offer 4.25 stars, I would...... . My lady and I wanted a nice place that we hadnt tried before for our anniversary, and I'm definitely glad we tried Devon...... . Lobster bisque - reaaally good. creamy with great lobster flavor, although a few chunks of lobster in there would have made it as good as it could be.. . crab cakes - no bs and i loved em. tons of lump crab meat, just a little bread crumb to hold it together..... awesome. . oysters - i ordered a few cape cod and a few discovery bay (WA) oysters, and they were fresh, briney, and delicious. i liked the discovery bay oyster better- cleaner tasting and salty.. . mussels in white win sauce - this is one of my favorite dishes, so i was happy to try it here. i asked the waiter to take the half eaten dish back to the kitchen so he could put the sauce in a glass for me for direct drinking. i love me a white wine sauce. mussels were fresh and perfectly cooked.. . as for entrees - i had the center cut with fried shrimp and my girl had the lobster tail. center cut cooked perfectly, alongside asparagus and 4 fried shrimp. the shrimp was butterflied to allow as much breading as possible - it was delicious, but just a little too much breading for me. the lobster was great.....fresh.. . creme brulee wasnt as warm as it could be, but it was nice too..... . i would definitely go again, but i rarely spend this much on a meal. you definitely feel treated, the quality is there, and our waiter, matthew, was fantastic. thorough, polite, knowledgeable Â - and was around just enough.. . like i said, i'd go 4.25 stars if i could....but just so you know, get ready to spend $100 per head.
