Wow I thought I reviewed this place already.. . I love this place and  am making it my mission to try almost everything on the menu. . . I've had the oysters.... The scallops and grits...mmmmm. The Blueberry vodka  lemonade...dangerous. The Tombstone lemonade w/ Kentucky Bourbon. The catfish. And on my recent visit the best burger ever, the Blue Burger (that's not what its called but its the only burger with the word BLUE in it..lol). . This weekend we had the opportunity to enjoy the new upstairs patio on a beautiful day.  ... Yeah it's fair to say that I love this place.
