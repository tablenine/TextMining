We arrived a little before 5, so of course there was not a problem getting a table.  We ordered the Angel Wings for a starter...those were quite yummy...Of course Charley knew what he wanted straight away, while I, the ever indecisive one could not decide what to eat.  I asked for help and nothing jumped right out.  So....I thought I would order the Shrimp Fried Rice until someone at a neighboring table had something I just had to have...Oh and Charley ordered the bbq beef.  His was very mundane..nothing special and a bit chewy.  They did keep coming back asking me if I was ready to order...who says you have to order a ton of food and not eat it...I was actually quite happy with what I had.  I loved the cold beer, just wished I would have gotten to see ELvis...hear he left the building!  Fokker!
