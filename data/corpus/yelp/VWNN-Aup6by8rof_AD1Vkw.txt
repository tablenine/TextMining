Don't eat dinner the night before...cause the breakfast portions are HUGE! Not much to say that hasn't been said. Once you walk in...it definitely feels like Hollywood. Grungy atmosphere...beautiful patrons...hip waitresses. Get the french press coffee...pancakes feed 3 to 4 people. Food was actually pretty good...would definitely go back...fun for outa towners and such.
