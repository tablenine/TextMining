After all the hype i was pretty excited to check this out on a whim tonight. Sat at the bar which was no wait, and thank god because the food wasn't worth waiting for. The decor and the vibe inside were terrific, however the bartenders made me feel like I was doing them a favor.. . The goat cheese and sweet potato croquettes were way to heavy on the sweet potato, I was hoping it would be closer to half and half. The salad was okay but didnt seem to have much dressing or whatever was there was lackluster. Finally, the ribs weren't very good...like at all. The meat fell off the bone but I didn't like the flavor and parts of it were rather dried out.. . The popovers were pretty good. My companion didnt really like his cocktail but thought the pickles were really good. Also the cookie plate was nice.. . Usually I like restaurants like this, and I'm really disappointed.
