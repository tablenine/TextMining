Short and quick because there's already 200+ reviews for this place:. . Expect a wait. We (a party of 4) were seated in about 40 minutes on a Saturday night.. . Come hungry. The combination (ramen and rice bowl) is more than enough, even for tubbies like myself. . . The restaurant has an awesome old school "feel." Maybe it's the layers of grease caked on the ceilings and awning. Can't blame them, all that airborne pork fat that gets cooked out has to go somewhere.. . I wish someone would make everlasting gobstoppers in daikoku ramen flavor. Equally salty, oniony and rich with braised pork fat.. . ***EDIT 3/31/08***. I went yesterday to stuff my face silly with that yummy ramen and it didn't taste as delicious as the first time I had it. It's still a fantastic bowl of soup, but I really do think that Santouka's is better -- there's something a little more rich about their broth.. . On the flip side, I got to sit at the bar this time and watch the cooks put everything together. Cute Japanese guys with dinner -- that's still a winning combo in my book. 4 stars.
