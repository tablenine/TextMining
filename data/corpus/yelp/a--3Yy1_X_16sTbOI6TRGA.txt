Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
We arrived about 10 minutes before the restaurant opens, and were surprised to find a line waiting outside already.  We got in at the end of the line and were seated immediately, but from the looks of it we were one of the last groups that did.  Definitely need to go there early and make it a brunch if you don't want to wait (this was on a Saturday when the restaurant opens at 10:30am).. The pork dumplings and crab dumplings are the restaurant's specialty, and they are good.  They are small and juicy, and especially delicious when steamy hot.  We also had the sticky rice shui-mai, which I didn't really care for, they were a little too bland and dry for me.  The sizes of all those things are pretty small, so we (like most tables) also ordered some noodles, rice cake, and veggies.  All are pretty tasty.  We ended with the red bean dumpling, which I've never had before, but it tasted good too.. If you like pork dumplings, you should try this place.
