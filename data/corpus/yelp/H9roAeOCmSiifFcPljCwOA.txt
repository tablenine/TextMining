ENJOYED IT!. . Small town-like restaurant with an out-door seating area that's great for dining in good weather. I went in for brunch with 2 other people and were seated fairly quickly. Service was fast and food was great!! . . Parking is a little difficult since It's in LA. But on a nice day, a walk outside makes it worth it. . . I'll be going back again during the day for some brunch.
