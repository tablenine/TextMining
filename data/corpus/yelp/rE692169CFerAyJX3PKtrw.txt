Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
My BF and I love Top Spice.  The only issue is that most of the food on the menu is too spicy for either of us.  But if you order the right thing, you'll have a great meal here.  The chicken satay is awesome -- they have the best peanut sauce in town.  I love the "pork jerky" appetizer, too... caramelized strips of pork with cucumber and little starchy fried chips.  They do not have the best basil rolls in town, in my opinion.  The Malaysian menu is interesting... the Honey Butter Shrimp is fabulous, though not what you might expect... it's fried shrimp in a green sauce with lots of broccoli.  I love the ginger chicken (or shrimp).  Oh, and if you order tea, you get lovely little jasmine blossoms that expand in your cup!
