Everytime I come here there's a huge wait. Even on a Tuesday afternoon. But it's worth it. The desserts are sooo beautifully made and DELICIOUS! Each time I come I try a different kind, but so far my favorites are the Opera and Mango Mousse. The sandwiches are decent - nothing to write home about. But the bakery side is always packed and for good reason.
