I do NOT get what all the fuss is about.  It's a burger.  It's juicy.  If that's your thing, you'll enjoy it.  It's very messy.  The fries were ok, but the lack of cutlery and the PLAID PLAID PLAID all over the place are fairly annoying.  The atmosphere is very over the top in an old time way, and if you like gruff service and no frills, you'll be in heaven here.  It gets very busy --if you're hungry, I wouldn't wait.
