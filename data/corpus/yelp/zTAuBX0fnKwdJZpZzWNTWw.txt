Love this place. I lived in Spain and have had a hard time finding good Spanish restaurants, especially when we lived in Detroit.  Luckily, when we moved to L.A., this was one of the first places we tried. Huge points for BYOB and no corkage fee (makes me forget I can't get Sangria...but the low bill helps make up for it).  . . Our favorite tapas here are the Sugar Chile Prawns, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Asparagus &amp; Manchego Cheese (best preparation of asparagus we've ever had), and the Churros con Chocolate are the best 'true' churros that I've had outside of Spain.  A lot of Spanish or Mexican restaurants try, but it never is quite right.  . . So you know, the Tortilla de Patatas is much more like an omelet than real "tortilla" that you would expect at a Spanish restaurant.  Its good, but definitely like a simple egg omelet.  Not what you're probably going for.  Also, the Paella is unfortunately like a soupy risotto.  After we ordered, the table to our left received theirs, and we were slightly concerned.  The table to our right received theirs, and sent it back. We received ours, and it was just the same.  I'd just avoid it.  Unfortunately. I'd wish they would work on getting two such signature Spanish dishes right.  . . Reservations definitely suggested.  The restaurant is small and cozy, dimly lit and can get loud, which is just fine for us, but might be dificult if you're trying to have a larger 'table' conversation or take older people there who may be bothered by the noise, making it hard to hear.  For the rest of us, it is one of our favorite places.
