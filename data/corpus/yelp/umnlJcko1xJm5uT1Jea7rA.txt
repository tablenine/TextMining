I have been to this joint many times, including last night... I decided to check out the reviews to see if I agreed with all the comments. One thing struck out - someone below mentioned lipstick stains on the glass. I had to change my glass twice yesterday to get rid of the pink wax on the rim of the glass. Other than that, it's a good place to just hang out with good friends over a good bottle of wine (that you bring in, so you know it's good)
