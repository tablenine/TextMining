This is slowly becoming a favorite place of mine to sit back with a sandwich and fries for under ten bucks. You can't do that at too many restaurants other than the ones that have a drive thru. I like the Big Easy feel of the decor and the Hurricanes and other assorted aperitifs aren't bad either. Sitting on the porch enclosed porch in front of the fire you can easily feel like you are in your friend's mountain cabin. . . In the spring, summer or during any major sports season this place can get packed. You can catch a glimpse of a television from just about every corner of the restaurant. The construction of a condominium on the corner that was formerly home to Vision Nightclub will undoubtedly bring an influx of foot traffic to this and other nearby businesses.
