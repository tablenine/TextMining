We drove all the way downtown for a nice pizza experience!  What we got was lunch in someones kitchen with beautiful Italian ovens and mediocre pizza.  I have had better pizza at Pizza Hut but loved being in the middle of it all and watching our pizza being cooked.  28 dollars for 2 cokes and a pizza...not worth it!
