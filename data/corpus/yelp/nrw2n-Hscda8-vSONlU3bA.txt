I can't believe this place has an average of 4 stars?!?!?!  what's up yelpers, what's going on?!?!?  i usually do not disagree with fellow yelpers but i must inform all the future yelpers to well, not avoid this place, but to help them understand that there are better options out there.. . Food is alright and the seating is "outdoors" meaning there is some amount of ventilation but thats where all the "good" stops.  . . The service is terrible not because the waitresses are terrible but because the place is UNDERSTAFFED (and trust me, it will always be understaffed.  koreans love to "save" or cut out expenses).  Sometimes the wait is just WAY TOO LONG.  They have a parking lot but they STILL have to valet it for you.  They only have those long skinny tables, so if you have a large group of people, you better figure out which 5 people you dont mind eating and talking to for the next hour cuz everyone else will be unreachable.. . from all the years i've been going here, i really think if they just employed two more people, this place wouldn't be so bad.  the level of service might just help me readjust my rating to 3 1/2, 4 stars, but it wont ever happen.  . . I'd rather go to soot bull gurim or tahoe bbq anyday
