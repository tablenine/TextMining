Wow.  Classy digs.  Not your everyday sushi joint, that's for sure.  Upon entry, you are greeted by a man at an unmarked door, who whisks you into the darkness and up the stairs into what feels like a secret Yakuza hangout.  What makes the setting unique is the extreme intimacy of the seating.  Every table is separated by a wall, and a bamboo curtain is pulled down for privacy.  It is lifted when the server comes, then lowered again for you to enjoy your food in complete privacy.  . . The servers are clearly well trained and friendly.  They explain right away that the menu is Japanese tapas, and suggest the Omakase, which at $88 for two, is not cheap, but not terrible either, considering the amount of food and the fantastic service and atmosphere.  . . The sake tasting, at $18 for 3 small cups, was a bit of a let-down, but then again I don't appreciate sipping fine sake - I guess I'm more of a guzzler.  . . I loved the black miso cod, the chicken, the rice ball in broth, the homemade tofu with sauce, the tuna carpaccio - in fact, there was nothing that wasn't incredibly yummy.  Once you finish one dish, the server is there right away to clear your plates and bring the next dish.  Very impressive.  And if you ever need anything at any time, each table is equipped with a bell so you can call your server to the table when you need them.. . The dessert was unexpectedly unique and refreshing - grapefruit gelee and black sesame ice cream.  Strange combo, but a nice cap to the meal.  Not indulgent or filling, like traditional Western desserts. . . Certainly a place to bring guests and loved ones.  Very romantic, as well.  And yet another example of why I hardly ever leave Brooklyn any more these days!
