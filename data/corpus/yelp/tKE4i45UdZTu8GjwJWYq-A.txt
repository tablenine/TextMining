YUMMMMM! You know a place is good when you see all sorts of people here. Luckily parking wasn't too frustrating and the lines weren't too long-- The BF and I had their famous beef and turkey French Dip sandwich (double-dipped!), side of potato salad, and chili. Everything was amazing! The sandwiches had great flavor; don't forget their hot mustard! The potato salad was one of the best I have had-- so light, crisp, and tart. The chili was off the hook! I LOVE this place and can't wait too come back. . . P.S. I came here after the Laker parade and it was packed with fans. Laker approved = Yelp-approved! :)
