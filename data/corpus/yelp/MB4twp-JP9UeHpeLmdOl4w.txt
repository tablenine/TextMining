Bright sunny spot for brunch, whether indoors or out.  Enjoyed the vibrant oil paintings of surrealist fish on the wall.  Didn't sample the baked goods but they looked scrumptious.  The Sunday brunch menu offers a delightful hybrid of American and Mexican dishes, and you can be as healthy or unhealthy about your order as you want, though I believe that brunch is by nature an indulgent, hedonistic meal.  The blood marys were tangy and not too spicy--they use high quality vodka and fresh horseradish.I was fortunate enough to bask in the company of  Max F., whose vast expertise encompasses the cuisine of the Spanish-speaking world.  He ordered us the breakfast burrito and the chilaquiles casserole.  I preferred the latter.
