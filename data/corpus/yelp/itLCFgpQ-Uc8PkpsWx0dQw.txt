Versailles is everything I could want in comfort food. It's delicious, plentiful, affordable, doesn't look too pretty on a plate, and makes you stinky afterward. I arrived in the mood for a paella, but was a little sad to read that it takes 45 minutes to prepare. So instead I opted for the squid and rice, which is described on the menu as "squid in black ink cooked with white rice and embraced with other herbs and spices." And that's exactly what it was. The squid ink kind of seeps in and bonds the rice, forming an almost paella-like black mass. Score. My craving was satisfied, and I liked the dish so much I was already looking forward to eating the leftovers. I also had an eye on my friend's roast pork, which was so tender and zesty that it really makes the case for pork overtaking chicken as the best white meat around.
