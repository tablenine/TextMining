Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
Three words:  Blue. Cheese. Chips.. . This is just one of the highlights in their ever changing menu.  I don't think I have been disappointed in a meal yet.  Of all the Buckhead Life Restaurants, the Buckhead Diner is by far one of my favorites.  One tip though would be to NOT order the hamburger.  Why?  There are so many other better options on the menu besides the hamburger.  You can have a hamburger anywhere.  When are going to be in a place that serves a Fried Egg and Grilled Cheese BLT?  Explore your options and enjoy an Arnold Palmer as well.  . . Is there a rating in between Casual and Dressy?  If so then this place would be in that category.  I would say you wouldn't want to walk in wearing a T-shirt and shorts but you certainly don't have to be wearing a three piece suit.  Go somewhere in between and should be fine.  Don't forget tip money for the valet as well.  . . THE BOTTOM LINE -- Did I mention they have homemade blue cheese chips??
