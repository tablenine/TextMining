this. place. dominates.. . all of my favorite big-eatin' italians in my life start drooling at the very whisper of its name, including this lil ital-a-pole right here. . . aw man...their italian sub is heaven...with its crumbly crunchy d'amatos bread, delicious meats, fantastically fresh mozzarella, hot giardiniera, spices and oils...top that puppy off with some of their morroccan pitted olives and some fresh basil...i'll marry it!. . and their ravioli! where do i begin! i heart heart heart those lil fluffy pillows stuffed with chez. their regular sized are far better than their jumbo for some reason. heat up some of their homemade sauce and you're golden.. . don't miss out on their fresh italian sausage!!! great quality, great prices. . . i honestly don't know what i'd do without bari in my life. . . Ti voglio bene!
