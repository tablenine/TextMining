i went here randomly when crawling around the slope and i was pleasantly surprised.. . i had a pretty solid veg burger, which includes the option of a pretty big list of fixings AND a choice from 5 (!) sides, fries, cole slaw, chili, salad, etc.. . the veg patty was off-the-shelf but huge, grainy, and grilled to a blackened exterior, nice.   good pickles, lots of sauces on the table, and really solid salad with big tomatoes, olives, etc.  we got a order of large fries for the table and they were decent too.. . although i didn't have it, this is possibly the only place in NYC i've seen with a halloumi sandwich(!)   friend of mine loved his.. . oh yeah and amazing beer selection for what's basically a diner.. . service is snappy with a bunch of energetic young guys running the place and keeping things moving, no slothful crap here for your late night eating needs.. . recommended!
