Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I won't be going back to Bottega Louie's anymore and thought an update to my earlier review is needed.. . While my earlier review still stands, please keep in mind that they do not take reservations and the wait for a table can be longer than an hour (even though the host always says, '15 minute wait')!  So you ackwardly stand (checking your watch and asking, 'how long have we waited?') with dozens of other eager eaters and wait for a table. And what an ackward wait since there isn't really much of a holding area.. . And just because you are seated does not guarantee good or quick service.. . Enough said.. . Go once to give it a try but Bottega Louie is just not worth a repeat until they begin taking reservations.  . . (Note: don't expect more than 5- raviolis when you order the dish)
