I eat out quite a bit for work and I think I have pretty realistic dining expectations - I live here and I've eaten at many hyped up places in lots of different cities in the US.  Maybe I've just had incredible luck for the last 18 years, but this meal was simply the worst I've ever had for any price - and, it was WILDLY over priced and the food was mediocre at best. -really (the pasta is fine, but there are so many place in LA where you can get something better).  First, our wait (WITH a reservation) for dinner on a weeknight was over an hour.  To apologize the waiter gave us a plate of calamari that another table (right next to us) turned down because they didn't order it.  The service was the worst I've ever experienced.  The wine is seriously over-priced.  We couldn't get the wait person's attention to save our lives - it was the dinner that would never end - just because we couldn't get order, couldn't get served, couldn't get the check.  Can you tell that I am just completely MAD?  Don't eat here - or, at least don't take anyone you care about here - it's embarrassing.  Culver CIty is gentrifiying - that's great.  But, eat someplace else.
