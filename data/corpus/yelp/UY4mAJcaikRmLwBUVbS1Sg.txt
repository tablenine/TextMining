Restaurant: Thaicoon &amp; Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
Thaicoon is a very unassuming restaurant that sits in a strip mall all the way near the end. Ive driven past it many times always wondering what it was like. . . After hearing about a sushi special they run on Mondays and Tuesdays all evening, I decided to come in and check it out. . . Once I walked in the place is very cool atmosphere and it was packed on a Monday. I saddled up to the sushi bar and ordered some items off the sushi menu. . . Sure its not the absolute best sushi you can get in Atlanta, but for the money it really works. . . The sushi was awesome, the wait staff was super friendly and the bill was unbelievably cheap. I think we cover all the bases there so this place is tops for me and I cant wait to come back and try some of the thai dishes. If those are off the hook too I will most definitely be moving up to a 5 star :)
