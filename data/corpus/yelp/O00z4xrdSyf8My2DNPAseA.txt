Great rooftop bar. Very European and VIP feel. The roof is nothing extravagant but the views and the crowd are beautiful. Make sure not to go too early or on an excruciatingly hot day. The sun can be blinding and turn that white button down into a wet shirt contest before you can say " where's the AC?"
