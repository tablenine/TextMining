I came here for the gelato, but after inhaling a classic donor wrap, I had no room left! My friend also got the chicken wrap but I thought the donor was much better. The sweet potato fries were good by themselves. We really wanted to get some gelato (bavarian mint!) but we were STUFFED. Next time... . Oh and they give student discounts. How cool is that. Even though I'm long out of school, I still carry my handy college ID with no date on it. Whoot!
