There's a Johnny Cash song that goes to the tune of... "I've been everywhere, man" and I probably have in the catagory of popular vegetarian restaurants in major cities....and nothing compares to Cafe Suflower. . . This place is consistantly great, inventive and always a crowd pleaser. I have brought many of meat eaters here and they have become some of the biggest frequenters to this fine restaurant. . . If you come here you have to try one of the specials of the day. They are always the best thing and will not disappoint. And, if the lemon chicken is available, GET IT! It is one of the dishes that I compare every vegetarian restaurant's food to. It's light, delicate, and big enough for Â leftovers the next day (as is all the dishes). . . This place gets 5 stars and deserves all of them. Just trust me. You won't regret it.
