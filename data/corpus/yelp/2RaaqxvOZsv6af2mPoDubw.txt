Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
"I'm not a fan of roast prime rib and I don't think I ever will, but they deserve five stars for everything they keep doing right.". . THE HYPE. An LA dining legend since 1938. It's THE go-to for roast prime rib. The famous stainless steel silver carts make the rounds and carve the orders of meat by each table.. . THE PLACE. Elegant and classic dining pieces with abundance of wood. Dressing up is encouraged by the restaurant to complete the atmosphere. This is fine dining, so reservations is a must.. . THE FOOD. Prim Rib dinner, of course. Includes Your choice of cut for the meat - thin, thick, with rib bone. Each diner includes mixed greens salad (once again famously prepared tableside with the "vintage" dressing poured onto a "spinning bowl"), pudding, mashed potatoes, and that unbelievable whipped cream "can I have some more" horseradish. Get a dessert tasting plate and anything that contains C.C. Brown's Hot Fudge Sauce.. . THE SERVICE. Flawless, attentive, and no pretentions. Need I say more.. . THE TIP. Take home a bottle or two of Clarence Clifton Brown's Hot Fudge Sauce (that's C.C. Brown's to you who went on to invent the hot fudge sundae!).
