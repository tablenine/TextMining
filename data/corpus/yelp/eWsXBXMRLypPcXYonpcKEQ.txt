Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
Stopped by here one rainy Saturday and got exactly the dishes (sauteed greens with garlic, barbecue duck and pork over rice, salty fish congee, preserved egg and pork congee) that warmed my soul, filled my belly, and tingled my taste buds. The service here is lightning fast and the food is fresh and delicious. As a congee connoisseur, I can attest to the quality of Great NY Noodle Town's congee offerings, as well as to their authenticity. Don't be daunted if you don't speak Cantonese or don't know what congee is! This place has English menus, friendly waitstaff, and an area in the front where you can see barbecue/congee/veggies being prepared so the ole point-and-pick method will serve you well. If you're ever in this neighborhood on a snowy/rainy/chilly day, this is a fantastic place to get a bite to eat and warm your extremities (not to mention your heart! congee does a heart good :D).
