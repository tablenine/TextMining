I went here several times hoping it would turn into a 'go-to' spot for me, but ultimately I have to put this place in the 'never had a good experience' category.. . The food here is non-remarkable.  They have a medium-sized menu of pretty standard panini and pizzas, most of which are heavy on the bread and light on the fillings.  I felt bad after dragging a vegan friend here because there really wasn't much on offer for her, which surprised me. . . The baked items look enticing, but my one experience ordering from the sweeter side was a disappointment.  The cookie I got was unpleasantly dense and gooey--nothing I'd want to taste again. . . The service can be disorganized and slow.  The counter staff mainly seem more interested in talking with each other than taking the customers' orders--the kind of people who need you to remind them what you were waiting on.  The last time I was there, the girl at the register forgot to give me my change, and the manager kicked us out of the backyard garden (which really is a nice space) so they could power wash it in the middle of the day.  I left there saying 'I will not miss this place.'  And I don't.
