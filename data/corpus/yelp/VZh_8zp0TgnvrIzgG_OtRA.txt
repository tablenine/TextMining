Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
I have this notation that fusion restaurant are not as good and 'authentic' as a mom&amp;pop owned restaurant. After trying Roy's, (first fusion restaurant for me) it  gave me a good impression that fusion is 'good' in it's own way. . . I came here for a friend's birthday party with a group of 20. The ambiance was great, the decor and lighting very romantic and modern. Great date place or a place you go with friends when u want to get dressed up.. . I ordered from the Spring Prix Fixe Menu - "the fixed priced menu". It comes in 3 entrees: appetizer, main course, and dessert. . 1. Thai Curried Shrimp Salad appetizer: OK but I'm not much of a salad person.. . 2. Tender Braised Beef Short Ribs. Creamy Mashed Potatoes, Natural Braising Sauce. So good and so huge! I was so stuffed after eating. The beef was braised to the point that it falls right off. So moist and succulent. It paired deliciously with the  mashed potatoes and Chinese broccoli hidden underneath.  . . 3. la pièce de la resistance: Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé! . Chocolate cake with molten, melting chocolate oozing out once you cut into it. Absolutely divine. Pairs merrily with vanilla ice-cream on the side. I wished I had finished it but my stomach would not allow it after that enormous beef entree. . . Definitely would try Roy's again for another occasion. I'll make sure that 'I have my cake and can eat it too!'
