This is like your cool little neighborhood cafe......but it is way too easy to drop a lot of money here.  Maybe it's because we can't seem to pass up anything. . . We always get the parmesan artichoke dip to start - seriously, if you get nothing else here, get the artichoke dip.  We've been eating this stuff for 6 years and although it often changes slightly, it's far and away the best dip I've ever had.. I'm also a huge fan of the veggie burger - totally handmade, (not the nasty freezer-burned patties you'll get at some restaurants) fresh, and extremely filling.  . . In the winter, make sure you get one of their big hot chocolates with liquor.  Although the first time I brought my husband to get one, the server asked what he'd like in his hot chocolate and he, not knowing what kind of booze goes best with chocolate, replied, 'Vodka?'   . Thankfully she steered him toward something a bit milder.  Although that would've made a hell of a drink.
