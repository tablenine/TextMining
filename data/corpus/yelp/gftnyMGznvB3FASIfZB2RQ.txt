I've been all over the world, eaten at the finest restaurants, and I must say that Craft is in my top 3 favorites.. . My wonderful experience began before I even walked through the doors.  The valet's were extremely friendly (which is rare in Los Angeles), and once inside, the matre d' was very nice, and immediately confirmed the reservation, and sat us in what I would consider, the best table in the restaurant.. . Now, here's where the experience REALLY began.  The first person that we met was our server for the night.  He was really friendly and most importantly, he came off as extremely knowledgeable of food pairing and an expert in the menu (unlike most aspiring-actor types here in LA).. . Next, we met the Sommelier, whom was a master of his wine list.  I love wine, collect wine, and really KNOW wine, but this guy I must admit, gave me a run for my money.  After we loosely decided what we wanted for dinner, he came back, and discussed our pairing options with us.  We opted for a couple of great glasses of white that paired well with our Hamachi starters.  After the starter wine, we had a bottle of fantastic French Bordeaux decanting in the bull-pen for our main course.. . Now, on to the food.  This menu was far from amateur.  The food was delicately prepared, and with the help of our server, we chose just the right combinations that were harmonious.  From the Hamachi starter, to the New Zealand Blue Bass to the NY Strip...don't even get me started on the sides, but the wild mushrooms are a must have.. . All in all, this place was amazing.  I really give credit to Chefs Colicchio and Accarrino for one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  Well done, gentleman!
