Went last Saturday on a family trip before seeing the Terracotta Warriors at the High Museum (conveniently next door). It was a gorgeous day and we sat outside. They have a nice outdoor area if you can get a table, and there were 7 of us and we fit just fine and didn't wait to sit down. But after that, service was awful. Took the dude 20 minutes just to get us our drinks. My "Original Sin" cider was really good..but maybe that's because I was thirsty waiting for the better part of half an hour? . . The food was meh. Entrees were pricey, I had a Waldorf salad which was okay, but nothing special. I have had better for sure. Fries were meh. Â A friend of mine's hamburger was way too rare. The Mahi sandwich looked good though, and I heard no complaints about that. Portabello sandwich also got good reviews but I am not a fan of giant mushrooms.. . I probably would try somewhere else before going back. I was even more disappointed because I've loved every other Concentrics restaurant I had been to in the past!
