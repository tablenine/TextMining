Located a few blocks from Olvera street, this sandwich place has been in Los Angeles for over a hundred years!  They say that they invented the french dipped sandwich after they accidentally dropped a french roll in a pan filled with beef juices.  I'm glad that they served that roll, because these sandwiches are great!. . I like to order the beef sandwich double dipped and with jack cheese.  The double dipping makes the bread a little wet, but the sandwich holds together fine and I feel that it is worth the extra shot of flavor.  What gives the sandwich an extra kick is their house mustard, which can be extra spicy.  Put too much mustard and your sinuses will clear instantly!. . On the side, I like to order two small glasses of their fresh-squeezed lemonade (75 cents each) and a side of potato salad.  They have a lot of desserts available as well, but I haven't had any desserts that I would recommend.. . There's always a crowd here and it's nice that they have two parking lots available.  I think the atmosphere of the location is also extra cool. When you eat here, the dining area is setup like a cafeteria.  They also have an old-style candy shop and the floor is full of sawdust.  It does have the feel of a restaurant from the 1900s.. . I love it because the sandwiches are good, the atmosphere is cool, and it's just fun.
