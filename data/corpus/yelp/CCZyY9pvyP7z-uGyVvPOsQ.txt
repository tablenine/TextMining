Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
Yamashiro has gorgeous views and a beautiful interior. It is extremely pricey with sushi that is just good, not great. The crab cakes, however, are the best I've ever had in my life. I would go back for the crab cakes alone. Parking is valet-only.
