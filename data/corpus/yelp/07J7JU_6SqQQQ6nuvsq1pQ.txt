My husband and I came here because of all the great reviews and we were not disappointed. The staff very very friendly and helpful, they gave us both food and drink recommendations since it was our first time there. I had the strawberry margarita and it was very good, I dont like a strong tequila taste, and this one was sweet so you couldnt taste how strong it really was. The food was great, my husband normally hates veggie quesadillas but loved them here! At a lot of mexican restaurants the food comes out all greasy and soggy, this was not at all the case here, we cant wait to come back.
