The legend is true...this place really serves the BEST french toast on the face of the earth, no, UNIVERSE. . . My friends and I agreed that we could eat this all day long...for breakfast, lunch, dinner, after party, whatever. We killed this entire order knowing fully well that we might produce "food babies" at the beach an hour later. LOL. We did not care. It was THAT good. . . My other orders included Cape Cod for my bev o' choice...it's a mix of cranberry juice and jinro soju. It went perfectly well with the Gone Shrimpin' platter, which included egg whites scrambled with shrimp, basil,  and topped with capers and garlic toast. . . We polished off all of our plates...food babies be damned!!!
