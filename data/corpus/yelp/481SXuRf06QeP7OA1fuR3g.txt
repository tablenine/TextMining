Nothing better than beer gardens on a warm summer evening in the city!. . If it were the middle of winter, I certainly wouldn't come here and sit inside though. It was dark and smelled of grease. We immediately ran outside to the beer garden.. . The Sangria was ok - I've definitely had much better but for under $10 for a pitcher, you get a lot of alcohol for the money. Yay!. . 312 on tap! Love!
