I'm not a fan, I have to say, but I'll try the one in Hollywood...may be that'll be more enjoyable.. . Don't get me wrong - I like the choice of burgers (I got the juicy lamb burger), and the sides (I got the double-fried chips/fries and a friend got the plate of pickles...seemed hardly like a half portion! The onion rings seemed a better choice, but I'm the guy who'll take pickles our of my burger.). . Here's what I didn't like about Umami. Since we were a group we were sat at the back in the outdoor area. It was cold. And not having any booze kinda took the wind out of my sails. Being offered Mexican cola didn't really replace the need for a beer! The desserts also seemed like a mis-match to a burger joint. So may be I'm being harsh, since the burger was actually good (although not like the first time I had a F.O. burger)...it's just the other stuff about Umami annoyed me. Not even seeing DJ Daedalus dining here could save this review ;). . Umami doesn't need my custom, but I'm hoping my comments will be more upgraded after a visit to the Hollywood spot.
