I went here for the first time after seeing a show Friday night at the Pantages (it's right around the corner).  I picked it after reading the reviews on here.  I was looking for a seafood place and I specfically wanted cooked crab legs.   Since we were eating on the late side, I was very lucky to be served the last 1/2 crab they had for the evening!  And it was excellent.  Messy and a lot of work to eat, but that's how crab legs always are and I think it's fun.  I had been anticipating it all week, and it lived up to expectations.  . . My mom order the Pug Burger, and although I didn't have any, she said it was really good (although too tall to eat without some modification).  We also ordered a blood orange cream soda...mmm.  . . I was concerned about the atmosphere after reading that some thought it was cold and industrial.  But I thought it was very warm and pleasant.  True, there isn't much decor, but the overall design is modern and sleek.
