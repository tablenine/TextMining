In this modern age of eating, the labored journey food takes from the wilderness (or processing plant) to our plate can occasionally skew the very essence of what we are doing: we are eating organisms and creatures.  We tear at the protective covers and exoskeletons, honed over eons of evolutionary pressure, and gnaw at the flesh below to fuel our bodies.  I am the first to admit I do not grasp this fact every time i cook a perfectly-kneaded hamburger patty on the grill.. . There is no such skewing of our biological imperative at The Boiling Crab in Alhambra.  And this is a joyous thing, trust me.. . There is no immediate warning of the visceral eating experience you will enjoy when you are partaking in $2.50 domestic beers at the bar while waiting an hour or so for your table.  The warning only comes when you are finally seated and the waitress puts a plastic bib on you to shield you from the splatter.  . . What splatter, you may ask?  The splatter from perfectly seasoned crawfish that you rip apart to suck out the insides.  The splatter from the gigantic king crab legs doused in a delectable butter sauce.  The splatter from the sausage and corn on the cob that has been soaked in the very spices and seasoning used to flavor the dungeoness crab.  The splatter from the just-out-of-the-fryer cajun fries and fried oysters.. . The Boiling Crab is a perfect place to fill your stomach and simultaneously remind ourselves of our rightful place on Earth's food chain: the very top.  And let's hope it stays that way.   Life is too tasty for it not to be.
