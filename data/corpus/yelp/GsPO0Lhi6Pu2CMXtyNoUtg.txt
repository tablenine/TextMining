Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
Hipster joint in the Los Feliz neighborhood.  It goes for the retro chic, uber cool vibe.  Lots of people seem to go there to sit in the booths and be seen in their trendy gear.  It's been a pretty good place for a nightowl like me to hang out at with friends, while we get good breakfast and comfort food.  Tonight was a miss though.  I'd normally give it 4 stars because of the fast and attentive service and the pretty tasty food.  They were downright rude to me and my friend today though.. . I know it's not a study place and they like to maintain their subtle coolness, but my friend and I had wanted to have a working dinner.  So, we ordered, we ate, and then we tried to do some studying/working.  It was like we'd broken some unspoken rule, and our server became this annoying presence.  We had finished our two full meals and then were going to wait on ordering a dessert till later, but he pressed us about paying our bill.  We figured he was going to get off his shift and just wanted to close out his tables, so we paid.  But, he hung around, tapping our condiment caddy visibly every time he passed by our table and giving us a look.  Then he would stand at a distance and stare at our table, as if willing us to leave.  Both he and one of the busboys made things so awkward and hostile that we left.  It's enough to not make me want to patronize their snobbish eatery again.  . . So, the food is okay, but I'll pass if it has to come with the attitude.  For the record, there were 3 empty booths around us, so it's not like our server was frustrated at us for taking up needed space.  I think "Fred 62" should have the guts to post a policy about not staying after one's meal, or the servers should stop harassing the patrons of the restaurant.
