Category: Mexican
Love the Tacos!  What else can you say about a place that always has a line no matter time of day.  And the prices right too.  . . If you decide to eat there, you need a tag team process - one person orders while other person claims a space/table.  Also, parking is not always available so street parking is encouraged. . Enjoy:)
