bf had the chefs cut bone in. he loved it. i tried it and i loved it.. i had the lamb chops.  they were delicious!!. . this place is def pricey (it is in bev hills) but if u love meat and great service this is an amazing night out. also had raw oysters... amazing! . . if you are looking for a quiet evening out than reserve down stairs.  Upstairs has a live pianist singing and sometimes even some older folks dancing.  It is def fun to hang out up there.  There are also balconies upstairs with a few tables but I am sure they are hard to get cuz there are very few.  You are also pretty much assured to see some celebs (esp upstairs).. . all in all: loved this place, amazing service.  expensive but sooo worth it!!
