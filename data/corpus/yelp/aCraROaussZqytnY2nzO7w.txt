Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
Pros - food was ok.. Cons - the wait for the food.. . I've been to Gloria's Cafe twice for lunch during the week.  The first time, i went with a group of four.  The food took so long (over an hour) that we finished our drinks, ate our chips, and one of my group had to call the office to push back a meeting because we were still waiting for food.  Plus, there were only a few parking spots allocated for the cafe, so I parked on the street and had to return to my car to put money in the parking meter.  The food itself wasn't bad.  Was it worth the wait?  No way.. . A week later I decided to give the cafe a second chance.  Maybe they had a busy day the first time, maybe they had staffing issues, who knows.  I went with one friend for lunch.  This time, our food took 45 minutes and it just tasted ok.  Not much flavor.  Sorry, Gloria, but I gave your place two chances and it failed both times.  I won't be returning.
