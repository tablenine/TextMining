Let me preface by stating that I am not the biggest sushi fan in the land.  About every 8 months I get a craving for it, other than that, I can take it or leave it.  I have heard that Mirai has the best sushi in the 'hood which is saying a lot cause there is a sushi joint on every gd corner round these parts.  But, what I love about this place is their fish soup.  I forget the name, but it is a large bowl of hot, spicy and sweet goodness loaded with fresh salmon, crab, octopus, shrimp veggies and more.  Highly recommended if you are 1) sick 2) hung over 3) cold 4) just looking for some delish soup.  Also service is consistently good.  Would recommend sitting upstairs.  P.S Get some gelatto next door for dessert.
