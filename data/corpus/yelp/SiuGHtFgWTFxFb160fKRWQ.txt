i've had the pleasure of meeting the owner several times at where I work at, so I knew of this place a few months before it opened, but didn't actually get to go until a couple of weeks ago. Had a slice of BLUE VELVET CAKE and it was yummmmmmm.. turns the inside of your mouth, your tongue, and maybe your teeth blue. but just a slight warning, the next time you go to the bathroom to do #2, it's gonna be about the same color as the cake.. . 1.19.09. they also make ice cream and ice cream cakes there. The owner brought a Banana Dulce de Leche Ice Cream Cake to my work to celebrate his mother's birthday, and the cake was AMAZING. i don't even like banana that much but it was really really good! they also have ice cream bars. they make Strawberry Shortcake, which is really good. They have the orginal DrumStick which is really good too. oh, and they have an Oreo ice cream bar. Â man, you cannot go in there and leave unsatisfied!
