i miss this place.  a lot.  reminds me of some good times in la.  the food here is amazing.  easily the best tapas i've had outside of spain.  great ambience and service.  great for date night or just a good time with friends.  . . byob.  make sure to get your wine at the wine shop next door (hopefully it's still open).  . . make sure to order patatas bravas....
