This is my second visit to Tru - The first time was for a special cheese event - but this time I was able to try the Chef's Collection. . It goes without saying that the presentation was nothing short of  spectacular.   The food was very flavorful of course - Every course was well built on the last although I'm not a big quince fan- everything else was great.   Tru is always a great experience and the service has been A+ for me on both visits.   . . I'm still a little more drawn to Trotters.
