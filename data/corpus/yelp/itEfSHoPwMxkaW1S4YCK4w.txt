A tad pricey for mediocre food. The veggie sandwich was eh. Â I guess the veggie sandwich's saving grace was the fact that it was stacked with goat cheese. If it weren't for the goat cheese I think I would have no other choice than to give this joint a one star rating. The spattering of leaves doused in dressing they call a salad was deplorable, to say the least. I also ordered a side of mac n' cheese...pretty gross. It is as if they nuked a piece of velveeta and threw it atop a mound of macaroni. I definitely had the Kraft blue box blues after eating that crap.. . Dessert was decent. Ordered a mint n' chip ice cream sandwich, and it almost hit the spot. I say almost because all I could think of while eating it was the Tollhouse brand they sell at the University vending machine. I'd recommend people try it for themselves, as for me I think I've had my fill of milk. Turns out I may be..... LACTOSE INTOLERANT
