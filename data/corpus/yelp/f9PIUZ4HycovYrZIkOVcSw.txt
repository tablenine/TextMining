love this place. super tasty on a saturday or sunday morning. i've only ordered off the breakfast menu and both times it was delicious. the pressed egg sandwich on the brioche...mmmmm, i'm getting hungry just thinking about it. . . another reason to love these guys is that they try to get their food from local, organic farmers that are practiciing sustainability. this is one trend i really want to catch on in this city...and in restaurants in general. . . at the end of the day, if you only care about taste then you'll like this place because local food is fresher, and therefore tastes better. if, however, Â you also care about where your food comes from and what kind of crap is being put into it, then supporting businesses like square one, whose mission will only do well by you, encourages positive change in the food industry. . . and you thought you just wanted to have breakfast....
