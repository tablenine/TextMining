seriously people...somebody needs to explain to this bloke what's the big deal about this place. this is perhaps one of the most hyped about shabu shabu restaurants in la so i decided to take my cousin (from canada) to check this place oot. being a friday night and raining, we showed up an hour early so we could be the first party on the waiting list. we both ordered a large beef plate that included: . . -pot of _plain_ boiling water. -a small plate of veggies. -large plate of meat (15 slices). . okay, here's what baffles me about this place that has 300+ reviews averaging 4 stars. i get that their sauces are kinda good, but where's the hype? you can't rave about a plate of raw beef, uncooked veggies and a pot of boiling water. i get that you can be creative with how to prepare the soup base and perhaps even marinate the beef, but i can do all this at home _without_ having to wait hours at a restaurant the size of a shoebox. was the quality of the beef and/or veggies worthy of the high ratings? i'm afraid not...
