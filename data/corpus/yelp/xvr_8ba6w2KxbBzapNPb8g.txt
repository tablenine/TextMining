I was pleasantly surprised by this place; I was expecting overpriced trendy patio dining and an uninspiring menu, but found otherwise.. . 1) only come here on a day you can sit outside.  The majority of the tables are on the large patios, and the dining al fresco is very enjoyable. Plenty of heat lamps outside. . 2)  Don't be deceived by what seems to be a small, wine-bar menu.  In addition to tapas, there are several dinner specials and regular pastas, entrees, and paninis.. . 3) Food is very reasonably priced. Paninis are 9.95-12.95; I had the lasagna for 12.95  (came with small side salad). Lamb shank and 1/2 roasted chicken specials were 16.95. Filet mignon was 16.95. . 4) Food is well-prepared, well-seasoned, and fresh.  Fairly large portions, particularly the roasted chicken, which seemed the size of a whole small chicken, not a half. Lasagna was smaller than I'd expected, but still enough for a meal.. . 5) Service is not particularly great, but not terrible. Prompt.  Hosts were very personable, seems like a lot of "regulars."
