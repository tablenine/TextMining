Location, location, location. That is one of my favorite things about Yamashiro, that and you feel like you've stepped into a crazy Hollywood movie set when you are there. You have to drive up a windy slope in the Hollywood Hills to get to the top of this Japanese palace replica. I have frequented Yamashiro for over a decade and have never been let down by the service there or the food.. . If you want to impress someone special with a great meal, drinks and a breathtaking 360 view of Los Angeles, take them to Yamashiro.
