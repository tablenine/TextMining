I miss Porto's!  That was a daily staple when I worked in Glendale.  The best part about the place?  Everything is absolutely delicious, from the potato balls to cakes.  You get so much for your money at this place.  I'd be willing to move back to So-Cal just for Porto's. . . The lines are uber long.  You have to take a number, but the build up and anticipation is well worth the wait. . . If every neighborhood had a Porto's I would not be on my constant search for yummy desserts!
