Just a quick update.. . SERVICE, friendly but not all together efficient.  It takes a really really long time when it is busy.  Do not come here expecting quick service.  Just prepare to wait.  And good luck with the parking lot too.   . . BUT I STILL LOVE THE BURGERS and SIDES here!  Even got a free dessert for our patience today.  . . The pork burger, STILL AMAZING AS THE FIRST TIME.  And a new offering since my first time, the MANLY BURGER with beer cheddar, fried onions and lardons.  Delicious.  The triple cooked fries were actually really good and much more plentiful than the first time ordered.  The onion rings were great again as well, with their tempura batter cooked to a perfect crispness.    . . I am willing to overlook the service hiccups cause your burgers and sides make me go, DAMN, that's GOOD!
