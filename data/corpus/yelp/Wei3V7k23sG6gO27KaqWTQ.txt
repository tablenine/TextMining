this is my new pho spot it taste as closest to the real thing and they aren't cheap on the meat. plenty in the bowl with juice to spare and meat. always get the pho tai gau bo vien. not too many people like gau cause all it is fatty brisket,so people dont like the feel of fat in their mouth. but hey its the flavor of the soup. not to bad on the refill of water. anyways since pho bac i always get 2 glasses of water for myself . also the com with the chargrilled pork slices,fried egg not the baked one and is a hometown favorite,so is the vermicilli with the same options but add grilled shrimp and extra nu moc Â yummmmmmmmmy.still cold in atl good time to have some pho anyone anyone?
