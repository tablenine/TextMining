Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
After living in the 'hood for over a year, we finally gave in to the trendy white-walled Ping Pong.  Our party of five adored it, hands down.. . My partner and I joke that this stretch of Broadway restaurants (Ping Pong, Wakamono and Adesso) has become "too gay to function" (lame 'Mean Girls' reference).  And I can now confirm that part of what makes dining at Ping Pong so exciting is the experience of being in the hippest restaurant on the block. . . It's the satisfied feeling you get as people walk by and see all of the pretty people (you included) sitting at the simple white tables, surrounded by white walls and perhaps random videos flashing.. . The music is pumping, sometimes forcing you to yell across the table at your mates, making you feel like eating in the middle of a club.. . There's something to be said for atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong, the food is great.  But this place is more about how good you feel just being there.. . The occasional wait for one of the right-next-to-your neighbor tables just makes the whole experience seem even more VIP.  . . You gotta give into the trendy hipness.  It's worth it.
