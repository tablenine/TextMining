I love that this restaurant is tough enough to hold it's ground in the Buckhead area, dominated by Buckhead Life.  . . The service is good, and the food quality is good, but I just wasn't impressed by the menu or the food in general.  The flatbread, which came highly recommended was 'dainty' at best.  It definitely couldn't feed a man; at least, not as an entree.  I got the salmon salad, which was...fine.  The other entrees ordered were decent, but a bit overpriced.. . I think this restaurant has a great concept that appeals to the health-conscious or 'on a diet' group.  At the same time, when you're going on for a good meal, why are you counting calories??  You should enjoy your meal and get on that treadmill if you're hung up on caloric intake.  Eat up!
