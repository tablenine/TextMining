My favorite place to get Hainan Chicken.  And the hot sauce they give you is the best!  Their Wednesday lunch special, Crab Noodle Soup (or something like that), is pretty good too.  Actually, I'm a huge fan of the menu over all but I mostly go there to get the Hainan Chicken and Wed special.  Beware: the lines can get long.
