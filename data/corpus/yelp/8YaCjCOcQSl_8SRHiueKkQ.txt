Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
I really want to be positive about the Hungry Cat. The food there is delicious. Everything was cooked perfectly and the restaurant sources local and organic produce etc. They are very creative with cocktails as well.. . The big problem with this place is the service. Especially out on the patio, the staff are really good at just forgetting to come out and check up on tables. We had to go and fetch our waiter multiple times. Our main course was served to the table before our first drinks even arrived!. . This is not a cheap place to eat so better service is expected. I've had two poor experiences now. I think the food is good enough to give them one more chance. Or maybe I'll just to to the Bowery or Magnolia around the corner.
