Restaurant: Clarke&#39;s
Category: Diners
It's a 24 hour hour diner that can also serve beer until 4 I think.  That's really all you need to know- you'll get your guilty pleasure greasy food here any time of day without dropping a huge chunk of change and you'll like it.  . . The menu had a kind of cutesy 50's theme going which gives the place some character.  It seems to be the future battleground of guys with giant belt buckles and ironic facial hair and dudes in baseball caps and hollister shirts.  Several older local drunks will mostly get caught up in the crossfire.
