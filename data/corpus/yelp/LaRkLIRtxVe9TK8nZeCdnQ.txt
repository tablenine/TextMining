Damn. This place is GOOD. The service is great albeit a bit slow during peak times. It's a cozy little spot, nothing fancy but the food is terrific. I highly recommend the tortilla soup and the sopa de 7 mares. The bistec encebollado is yummy too. Overall, come to Gloria's if you're craving some mexican or salvadorian food. the place is legit. too legit to quit. yes, i actually wrote that.
