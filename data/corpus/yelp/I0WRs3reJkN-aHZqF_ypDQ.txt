great burgers (fav is the blue cheese on the rye bread), good drinks, and you can eat outside. What more can I say!. . I have never waited for a table longer than 10 min (and that's a busy Friday or Saturday night with 8 people).. . If you are in the neighborhood I would check it out. The other locations in the Chicago land area are similar, but this is my favorite of them all.
