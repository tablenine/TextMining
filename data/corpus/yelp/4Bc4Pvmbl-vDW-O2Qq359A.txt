Bottega Louie! How I love thee! Downtown LA is so lucky to have you. The moment I arrived, I felt like I was instantly transported to a bustling Manhattan bistro. Your dessert and deli cases, your open kitchen, your floor to ceiling windows and all that damn marble....I was breathless at hello! . . I was part of a party of 14...Tony (who is THE MAN!!!) was our server and he took excellent care of us by ordering everything for the table....from apps, to wine, down to dessert. His patience and professionalism with our group was appreciated and definitely noted. . . His selections for our table were impeccable. Everything we tried was tasty and delicious (the dish i nicknamed "bacon peas"...instantly comes to mind). The lasagna was delicate and not heavy at all. I'm not a mushroom fan, but the portobello mushroom fries were a hit with everyone in the party. . . The only reason I am not giving you 5 stars, is because it took 20 mins to get a glass of champagne from your bar. You have plenty of bartenders filling drink orders at the service bar, but only one tending the actual bar (and he wasn't all that nice, for the record). That's gotta change, Louie. . . I know you're still working out the kinks, so I will forgive you this once...but I hope to see that bar situation rectified upon my next visit...which will be very soon! . . Kiss kiss! Love ya. Mean it.. Stace
