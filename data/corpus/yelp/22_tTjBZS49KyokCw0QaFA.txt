On a beautiful summer night, Moody's will put you in a good mood with a delicious burger in hand. It is like sitting outside in a huge, tree-covered backyard... very casual and plain, but so serene and wonderful. The only downside would be that people smoke and I am so used to smoke-free areas now that it is a bit disturbing. . . I have been to Moody's in winter where I sat inside and it is just not the same. It is smoky and greasy and dark... but the fireplace is nice. I would only go back to enjoy the great patio. It is the perfect place to go with a group of friends and enjoy some burgers and beer. I tried the blue burger for the first time. (From reading about it in the latest Chicago Mag) I was a bit hesitant since blue cheese can be way too overpowering but this one wasn't at all. It was the perfect flavoring and really mild. Two thumbs up if you like blue cheese. It was a deal, too... $8 for a 1/2 lb. burger with fries. I split it, along with a salad (huge.... and includes bacon!), with my boyfriend. We were both stuffed. It was well worth breaking my healthy kick diet. Would definitely recommend it on a nice night.
