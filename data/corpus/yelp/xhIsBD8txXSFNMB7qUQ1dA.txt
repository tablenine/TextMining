Ok, I was turned on to this place by a co-worker and we'd ordered it to-go, picked it up and divied it up back at the office. The kicker here is...we worked in El Segundo! Yep, the guy had it down to a science...fax in the order, jump in the carpool lane, pick up the food and book it back. I think the record was 45 minutes...no sh!t!. . SANDWICHES:. I'm a fan of the Pan con Lechon sandwich. Roasted pork with onions on one of their rolls with the garlic sauce. That's IT! Oh my. FABULOUS! And even holds over well for a day or two later...I just wrap it in foil, pop it in the oven and bam...yummay! But yes, undoubtedly better if you can eat it right away...but when you're stockpiling you kind of don't have a choice. Either that or have a belly ache. I opt for the former.... . SNACKS:. -- The potato balls you see mentioned on here are yum too! They're called Papa rellanas and they can be consumed in a bite (if you have a BIG mouth) or a couple of bites is more "refined". Actually, you'll only be eating them with your hand if you just walked out and they're not that hot. But if you stockpile (like I have before) you'll want to reheat these and the microwave is fine...but they get hot so you eat 'em with a fork...or burn your phalanges!. -- Their banana chips are incredible too. If you order a sandwich to eat there, you get some on the side. If not, you gotta order a separate order to go but that's worth it...trust me!. . DESSERTS:. Never had their desserts or cakes...but it's a spectacle to look around at what they do. Clearly they are good because they're always packed as they do an amazing decorating job!
