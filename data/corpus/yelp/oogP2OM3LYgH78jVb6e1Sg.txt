Easily one of the best restaurants in Wicker/Bucktown.  The prices are reasonable, and the food is amazing.  I highly recommend the tempura green beans.  So yummy.  I always had great service.  It's very laid back, you could go casual or dressy and fit right in.  Monday and Tuesdays are $10 wine flights, and it's a perfect way to kick off the week.  It's a fun place to go with friends or on date night.  If you have friends in from out of town and you want to take them to one of those "great Chicago restaurants" this is it.. . I'm adding this because I was just there the other night.  I had made reservations and they couldn't seat us right away -- no big deal, it was a Friday night, stuff happens you know?  They sat us at the bar back where they made the food and we were fine just hanging out.  Man, they felt so bad, they gave us complimentary glasses of champagne and a mini cheese flight.  The general manager personally came over and apologized.  We weren't even mad or anything, but they really went out of their way to apologize.  Just adds to the fabulousness of the place!
