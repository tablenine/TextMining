I first got a taste of Kogi's during finals week @UCLA of Dec. 2008. We had to follow this truck every where because it kept getting moved by the cops, but eventually, after, yes, the long wait for about 30 mins to order, 5-10 mins for food, the short rib tacos were deeeeeelish! I love the OG Mexican carne asada tacos, but the fact that this was Korean-fusion SHORT RIB tacos, it was definitely worth the long waittt (good study break too!) With some sriracha sauce on your taco, it is 10 times better! It is a kick of tangy &amp; spicy in your mouth! 2 bucks for a taco and 5 bucks for a burrito isn't so bad, especially since the truck doesn't come around the area so often; thanks to Twitter, I was fortunate enough to catch the truck tonight in Long Beach at the Queen Mary! Those lines are never-ending, but why not try the hype? You don't know until you've experienced it yourself! Don't forget the sriracha!
