Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
When I lived in Silver Lake I used to venture to this lil cafe all the time.. . It's good food at a good price. I would alternate between Pho Cafe and Gigergrass (which is also in SilverLake) but Gingergrass' high prices and bad service swayed me to this lovely little cafe more and more. . . They're so good, they dont need a sign to indicate that they exist... Word of mouth and yummy tasty dishes is their formula for success!
