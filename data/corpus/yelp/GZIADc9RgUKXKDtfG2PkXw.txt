What can i say .. I LOVE THIS PLACE! . Being an avid breakfast eater, i love the sound of breakfast at anytime of the day. I went here awhile back, but i would surely go there again. The only problem is that it closes at 4pm x( Try their pancakes .. I believe it's their specialty .. they're delish and HUGE! If you can finish it all .. I will be amazed ..
