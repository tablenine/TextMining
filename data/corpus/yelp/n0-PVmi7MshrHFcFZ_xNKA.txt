I had heard of this place via GQ magazine. Apparently GQ was claiming that they had one of the best burgers in all of the US. . . After a long day at the beach, my friends and I decided to stop by and give this burger a shot. . . We walked in and were surprised by how fancy the place was. The hostess was sweet and said that she had a lot of people come in wearing beach attire since they are located on Santa Monica Blvd. . . The tables were adorned with white linens and fancy tableware. I was very pleased with the presentation but did feel a little bit out of place due to my laid back attire. . . Finally, we ordered the burgers. The prices are a bit high, so don't be surprised. . . The cheeseburger was a good size and the patty was nice and juicy! One bite into it and I realized why GQ was ranting and raving about it. The meat was cooked to perfection and the cheese tasted like a sharp cheddar!!!. . The fries were nice and crunchy but the portion was rather small for the price. . . During our meal, one of our friends accidentally wandered into a couples booth without realizing the couple was sitting there, enjoying a meal together. Once he heard our entire group laughing hysterically, he looked over and realized the couple were staring at him in shock. Luckily they were nice enough to let it slip and did not complain to the waitress.. . So yeah, the burger is pretty outstanding. I highly recommend it but be prepared to break the pocket book a bit!!!
