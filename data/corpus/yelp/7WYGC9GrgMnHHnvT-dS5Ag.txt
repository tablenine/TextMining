BEST food truck. Absolutely.. . Thank goodness I recently discovered the Alibi Room--they serve Kogi from 6:00-midnight Monday-Saturday. I used to stalk the Kogi trucks and happily wait in a ridic line just to get a kimchi quesadilla (so spicy but so delicious) or the yummy tacos (I prefer the spicy pork or the chicken...and the slaw on them is so good!). But don't get me wrong. The line is worth it.. . Other things I've tried: the breakfast burrito and the blackjack quesdilla. But I think the tacos and the kimchi are my faves.. . Definitely follow this truck on Twitter. Definitely hit up the Alibi Room if you're not in the mood to find out where the trucks are. And DEFINITELY don't settle for any of the other Korean BBQ food truck impostors out there. They don't even compare.
