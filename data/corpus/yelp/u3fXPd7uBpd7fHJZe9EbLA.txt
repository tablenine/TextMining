YUM! I read the reviews before checking this place out, so my boyfriend and I were there right at 5:00pm on a Thursday afternoon to avoid the crowd. They definitely picked up within 45 minutes of being there. We ordered the fried tofu as an appetizer. It was good but I've had better fried tofu. It's all about the sauce that they serve it with and theirs was just ok. The sushi was another story. It was so good! We ordered the Trixie roll and another roll that I can't remember the name of. The other roll was good but the Trixie...amaaaaazing. I love soft shell crab and tempura shrimp and usually order a roll of each. But Toro had a roll that included both of them! And it was soooo good. The roll was really tall so I was afraid that it would come apart, but they had made sure that I was able to eat it all together. I also ordered the Yellowtail nigri and they give you a very generous portion. This will definitely be a repeat.
