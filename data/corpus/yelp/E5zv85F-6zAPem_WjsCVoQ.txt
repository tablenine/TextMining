Restaurant: Taco Mac
Category: American (Traditional)
TACO MAC!  I live extremely close to this place, so when I do not want to cook, it is a taco mac night.  There are so many HD tv's your head will spin, the place is always extremely clean and the service is friendly.  Oh yea andddddd they have about 500 different types of beers.  They also have a club(Brewniversity) that you can join where you get a point for every new beer you try.  It is a great way for them to take all of your money, but make you into a beer snob.. . The food is very good.  I have never been disappointed with a meal and all of my friends I have brought agree.  The bar area is a great place to hang out and watch a game with friends.  The one negative is the beers are typically pretty pricey.  Sit at the bar and drink 3 beers and you'll be dropping 20+ dollars.  I don't think they really have any great drink specials, but I still love this place and will continue to go there time and time again.  Plus, once you drink 125 beers you get a TM mug to drink out of(20oz rather than the standard pint glass).
