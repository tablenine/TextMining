Absolutely the worst bagels I ever had in my entire life!  What else can I say...The Mazzaball Soup was not bad.  The few times that I have been there, I found the place to be all that is described above: interesting people, grumpy waitresses, etc....but lets face it, there was a big 'C' on the door for a reason.  Nuf said.
