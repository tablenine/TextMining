I agree that this place is great to check out once, but most likely not a repeat, except the Latin Lunch sounds like it's worth it.  We were on their patio on a wonderful night and the music and service were both excellent.  The chef was there when our food was delivered and two different managers came to check on our table.  The tapas and bread were great to start, and I ordered the fish of the day, which I found to be excellent, but most people agreed something on their plate was a little too salty.  Dessert,  the cuatro chocolates, was only ok and could easily be passed.  And I almost never pass on desert.  We spent 45 with tip, each, but I felt it was worth it to try once.  I had a great evening.
