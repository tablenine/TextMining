I was pretty excited to go to this place after reading all the reviews.  My girlfriend and I had a $10 off coupon from the 52 deck of cards so we said let's give it a try.. . We ordered the caprese salad first which was good.  The ingredients here are so fresh.  The mozzarella just melts which is awesome.  Then we ordered the Prosciutto e Rucola pizza which comes with prosciutto (obviously) and arugula.  I was very anxious and extremely excited for it.  When he put it on the table the first thing I noticed was there was a lot of black char on the crust.  I fully expected to have a nice crispy crust after it being in a fire hot brick oven and noticing the char.  Unfortunately the crust was soft and the middle was soggy.  The char taste was very overpowering, to the point where it was almost inedible.  My girlfriend could not eat more than two pieces because of it.  The tiramisu was unbelievable though!. . Overall the service was very good, the ingredients fresh and delicious, the dessert amazing, but I just can't get over the fact that the pizza was soggy and the char taste was way too overpowering.  I will not be going back.
