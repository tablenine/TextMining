The Schindler's List of Meats. If you want to get your fill for high quality meat, this is your place. Don't mess around with the salad bar, that is just a clever decoy. Real meat eater will not fall for that trick, they put their card to green and go! (do not collect $200) The service is incredible and by the way, the palenta and cheese bread are delivered to your table. I personally like the garlic beef. This place is to die for. Don't worry about the price...if you're a serious eater you can do some major damage.
