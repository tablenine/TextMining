I really liked this place. I'd go again.  Although I wasn't daring enough to order the exotic: Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit, I settled for the Sun Dried Tomato &amp; Mozzarella with Smoked Chicken &amp; Turkey.  It was DELISH! Also tried the Belgian Fries with the bleu cheese, walnut &amp; bacon dipping sauce - hands down! YUM!  It would've been good with beer, but because it was lunch time with the co-workers - can't drink &amp; work.  I will definitely be back after work :)
