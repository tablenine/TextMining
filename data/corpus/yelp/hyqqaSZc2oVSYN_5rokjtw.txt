Restaurant: So Kong Dong
Category: Korean
Is this place named after the token Asian guy from "Sixteen Candles"? . . Well anywhoooo, So Long Dong stands out enough to get my business once every other month, and that is saying something. . . But, they still struggle like most Korean restos, Southern BBQ Places, and governments---with consistency. . . One dish that stands out that hasn't been mentioned in other reviews is the Octopus. Just look for the most expensive thing on the menu and order it--- but only if you are feeding 3 or more. I can say that the tentacles were divine and not over cooked into Korean "Bubble Yum.". . The bancha is solid and the service is hit in miss. There is this one "Krageee Bitcheee" that just gets underneath my skin, but the other gals are good at bustin' a move with a smile. . . For all the "Wide Eyes", practice this pronunciation for when you greet them and your experience will be better: (Ha-ran-say-oh) or something close to that. They will know what the F'''' you mean. . . Always in my top four Korean Dives. 4.0002 Stars . . Don't forget they are closed on Tuesday for whatever reason. . . Chef Invisible-OUT
