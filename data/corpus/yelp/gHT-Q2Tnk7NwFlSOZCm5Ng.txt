Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Had the pleasure to finally check out Umami Burger, and sadly to say I was not all that impressed with the burger. The portion as mentioned are not worthy of the premium price, and I was not very impressed with the oily onion rings and fries. The Asian ketchup was subpar as well. Too sweet and it reminded me of Prego spaghetti sauce.. . I will admit that my truffle burger was tasty, however just not as great as everyone made it out to be. Service was descent, but nothing noteworthy to speak about. . . Unfortunately, this place was forgettable for me. I was still hungry after my $15 burger and fries and I don't even eat large portions. One word to sum up my experience--- Oily.
