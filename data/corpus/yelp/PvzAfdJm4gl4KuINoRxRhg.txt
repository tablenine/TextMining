This place was awesome! Had the mango jalepeno sausage which was amazing topped with caramelized onions and sauerkraut! The fries with all the dipping sauces were sick! And they have many German and Belgian beers that you just can't get anywhere else. I recommend the Reissdorf Kolsch - forgive my spelling if it's off :)
