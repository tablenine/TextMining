I have been a fan of Bin 36 for a number of years now. I was quite saddened when the Lincolnshire location suddenly closed. It wasn't for lack of enthusiasm by the community. According to the bartender at Bin on Milwaukee in Wicker Park. Todd said "the suburbs just couldn't support the weekdays."  In the suburbs you have driving "issues" that you just don't have to deal with  in the city.  Since moving to Wicker Park I understand this more than I could ever have imagined. . Tonight I'm having the lamb meatballs. In a nutshell - incredible!  An explosion of flavors that would make my Greek Grandmother (yia,yia) reconsider her recipe. Sorry Dad. I might here about this one.  Although we didn't grow up with Windex as the cure all we did know that every word had a Greek origin.
