My wife, oldest daughter, oldest son and I have been here several times. This is another cute and adorable breakfast place in Chicago. I love the decor, with their reference to eggs. It's another small breakfast place in Chicago with huge crowds. I have actually turned some friends on to the place and they have even said, "they have replaced their old breakfast stop for this one." It is clean inside and well kept. The food is really outstanding, you have to try the specials. The only down side is the next time you go your favorite special will probably be gone. The staff was very friendly. It was not pricy at all. I know the next time we are in the Ravenswood area we will definitely battle the crowds for more Over Easy.
