Restaurant: The Boundary
Category: Sports Bars
There have been many-a-nights where I end up at The Boundary and I have never had a bad experience. The bottled beer selection is one of the best in Wicker Park, but it may take you awhile to get up to the bar to order one when a big game is on the tube. Brian the bartender is one of the friendliest guys around, and he makes the place seem a lot more like Cheers than Applebees. If you are planning on eating here, I would definitely plan on lunch or an early dinner, as it gets pretty packed once the sun goes down.
