Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
There are a lot of celebrities on the wall. There is a wait every night from what I hear. If you ask how long the wait is, the girl tells me 15-20 minutes. Expect double that because that's how long I waited and I was dining by myself. The salad is good, the pasta was a hot dish. I eat my pasta with a lot of garlic and a lot of seasoning so I thought it was bland but I was still hungry and it got me through the night and that's all that matters. The dinner comes with a salad or soup with the pasta and desert. I liked the cappuccino crunch.. . Went next door to meet fellow Yelpers at Chalet, very nice place. Then came back here for pizza. Open till midnight, sweet. Pizza looked fantastic. I should have gotten the pizza but everything was good.
