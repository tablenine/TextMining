this is a fun little spot. however, you will not leave without at least one spot of seafood goodness on your clothing. you may not even notice it til it's too late. throw your manners out the window. this place is all about stuffing your face, soaking it all up and leave smelling like garlic and all kinds of other sauces and things. the one thing that i wasn't happy about was the rude server i had. not fun. food wise, it was really tasty...and HA! I am allergic to shell fish...but i had a lil just to taste.
