I've been here 3x now, and was happy to find out that while Sura is getting their liquor license, it is still BYO on week nights.. . We came here with a party of 7 on a Fri night, and were greeted happily by the bartender named "O".  He greeted my friend who made the reservations with a delicious shot on the house.  It was fruity, but had a lot of vodka, and was like a double-shot.  We asked him what it was, and he said he just made it up.  He was very friendly.. . For dinner, we decided to order our own thing.  We each ordered the pad thai dish (yummy!), and I had the plump glazed shrimp special ($5 only), duck crepes (love it), lettuce wraps, cocktail shrimp and chicken wings.  Everything was so cheap (we ordered mostly apps, which was priced at $5 each), and we ended up paying about $15 - $25 per person.  . . The food here is consistently good (even though I'm not sure it's all authentic Thai), and I look forward to the Yelp event!
