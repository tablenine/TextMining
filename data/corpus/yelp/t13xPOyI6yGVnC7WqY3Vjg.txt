Have been wanting to go here for a while despite the initial mediocre reviews (yes, I too am a Top Chef fan).  I would say that I wasn't disappointed, but also not "wow'd".. . Our waiter was very good, even though sometimes hard to find.  I have a nut allergy and wanted to ask about the topping on our appetizer - couldn't find anyone to ask.  When my wine took too long, he handled it well by acknowledging it and topped off my husbands class.. . The hamachi appetizer was very nice (grapefruit, hamachi and finely crumbled bacon - nice combo!).  The rabbit pasta was ok (not super tasty, but good).  My memory of the braised short ribs is making me hungry right now - absolutely delicious.  My husband was very happy with his pork 3 ways (too much pork for me) and dessert was tasty.  I loved the little coffee cake you get to take for breakfast the next day.. . Overall, would go ahead.  But, I agree with the others that the price point seems high for for the experience.  I'll have to find a way to expense it next time...
