Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
I was thinking I would have to intentionally go to a restaurant that sucks soon, since my reviews have become impossibly cheery and the 4 and 5 star recommendations a bit ubiquitous. . . Never fear, Langer's Deli managed to disappoint at every turn, with lousy service, high prices, and bad food.. . I ate here yesterday with a friend, and ordered the #10, a pastrami on rye w/russian dressing.. . This place was supposed to be amazing, but it really wasn't.  The pastrami was tough and cooked too long, and had ample fat on the sides.....UGH.    The bread was good, I guess, but it's just bread.  It should be good.. . The dressing was uninspired and applied unevenly.  It wouldn't have mattered anyway.....the pastrami was so gross it could have been the best dressing in the world, and it wouldn't have saved this disaster of a meal.. . As an added bonus, this place doesn't take AMEX either, so I had to pay cash.  Oh well, I won't have to worry about coming here again.. . Next time I want decent pastrami, I will try the chain, the Hat, instead.
