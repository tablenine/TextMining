Yes,a bit overrated but its an L.A institution that is a must try.. PROS:. OPEN 24 HRS. Large portions. accommodating for large groups. . Cons:. a bit pricey. service can be iffy. dark atmosphere. . My favorite sandwich is the Avocado Melt- avocado, sauteed mushrooms, cheese, alfalfa sprouts on white bread =D
