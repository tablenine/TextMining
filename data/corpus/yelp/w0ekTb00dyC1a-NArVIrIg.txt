my brother brought home some blueberry muffins (not quite sure if they have a specific or special name for them) after dining @ Bottega Louie. . the muffin was perfectly baked, with plenty of blueberries. The crumb topping was hands down the best part of the muffin. But if you are in LA i suggest it JUST for the muffins, because they are that damn good.
