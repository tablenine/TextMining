I went back AGAIN, and I can't say enough nice things about the Chicken Kabob (great with feta cheese-  stolen from the top of your side salad, wrapped in some warm pita-like flat bread, drizzled with cooling tatziki- the taste of the grilled onions and peppers contributing to a quadrophonic symphony of flavor transcendent enough to get The Who back into the studio.  Rock it Papa Cristo.
