My brother introduced me to this place few years back, and I have been eating at this restaurant at least once a month.. . Once you get to Little Tokyo, parking is a little annoying because you have to hunt for a meter parking spot around the area (though it's free if you go after 9 PM or something), or you have to park in one of the parking structures/lots that are ~5-8 dollars. After parking, you'll usually find people crowding around the yellow banner outside of the restaurant, and who knows how long they've been waiting there for. . . After you get to the restaurant, go straight inside and find the clipboard with the list of people waiting for seats. Just write your name down and wait patiently because the food here is SO good. . . Even when the waits are so long sometimes, the broth and the pork chasu inside the ramen is so tender and delicious, I think it's definitely worth the wait. I haven't ordered the combo meal before, but my friends tell me that the chicken egg bowl is really really good. . . If you're ever around downtown area, YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE!
