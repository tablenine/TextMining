Restaurant: Toast Bakery Cafe
Category: American (New)
Ate here for lunch last Friday.  Been here a few times before for lunch and they seem to always be very busy which is a good indication.  They have a diverse menu and everything from the salads, to sandwiches, to deserts are good so you can't go wrong.  Service was good as well but I tend to eat here with a regular customer so I know we always get good service.. . Since they are a 'Bakery Cafe' anything baked/bread related is good.  . By the way, breakfast is served all day for those of you (like me) that enjoy breakfast items in the PM.  I had the Eggwich on this visit which is like a bacon and eggs place but in sandwich form.   The red velvet cake looked good but I did not save room for desert.  I also heard the French Toast is very good but will have to try that next time.
