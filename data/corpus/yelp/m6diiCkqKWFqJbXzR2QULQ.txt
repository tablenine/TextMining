Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Kitties, sunshine, hearts and rainbows, I love Joy's. Another fab find in my neighborhood. The food is inexpensive and yummy. Good selection of things. I almost always get the golden noodles, but the other things I've tried haven't disappointed. BYOB with no corkage fee, which is a plus. They even let us BYO fifth of vodka (We're classy, whatever. At least we're fun.). I've been many times and will undoubtedly be back many more. Go, Joy's, go!. . The service is fairly quick. I always seem to have the same server who I cannot hear for the life of me. Oh well. It's a restaurant, I know what to do.
