Hot and Spicy. That's the key phrase here. If you love spice I highly recommend this hyped truck service. It is almost 4 am and I am suffering from heartburn. Can't sleep. Went last night to Amoeba site and they assured me that the short rib and chicken were not spicy. Very pleasant service guy, but he lied.. . Sorry, I can't eat spicy stuff. Be forewarned that at least on this night they couldn't offer anything to someone who specifically said that he (and someone else I was ordering for) could not handle spicy food. . . I went in denial that a popular eatery could have an all spicy menu. If the chefs would offer non-flaming alternatives they should do even better, because the flavors were really nice and prices very cheap. Â Once again, If you are into spice- enjoy. Others beware.
