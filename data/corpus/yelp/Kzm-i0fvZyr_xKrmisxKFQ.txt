This place tastes good, yes. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 is that I've had better chicken and waffles. Jennifer Murse (an elite yelper) claims the Pico locale is better. That's insane. She's wrong!!! That one only gets a three 1/2. I don't think I can do 1/2 stars though. Oh well. I guess it'll have to get a three to distinguish it from this better locale
