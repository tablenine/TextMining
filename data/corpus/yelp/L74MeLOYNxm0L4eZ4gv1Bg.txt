Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
I truly starting to feel like an Atlantan now that I have hit places like MJQ, The Local and now add Taco Cabana to my list of tour duty. . . I hit this place at 5 am Saturday night/Sunday morning and OMG!!! it's quick, good and extremely filling. Mexican after a night of heavy drinking and dancing fill always fit the bill. The place was busy with late night revelers but not to busy as it took no time to get our food. . . We had the chicken nachos to share with the table and then some quesadilla to round it out. The salsa wasn't to bad...... from what I can remember but then again, what is bad after you have had 5 kamikaze shots and 8 beers. HA!!! . . Taco Cabana would get 5 stars from me if I could remember much more about it. But seriously guys, I don't. . . Respectably low prices and quick service makes the list of must hit joints after a heavy night of bar hopping.
