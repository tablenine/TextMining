Restaurant: Kevin Rathbun Steak
Category: Steakhouses
If Rathbun's wasn't already my favorite restaurant, this would definitely take the cake. I love it [almost] equally as much, especially since they still serve my favorite sides! the charred gouda corn and macaroni tart are RIDICULOUSLY delicious, but at Kevin Rathbun Steak, you get the added bonus of steaks delicious beyond your imagination...I would definitely recommend getting a dry-aged steak, and the cowboy ribeye is big enough to share. While steaks are definitely the highlight at this restaurant, the lobster tail is still a very tasty entree; the combination of the two, however, is beyond heavenly!
