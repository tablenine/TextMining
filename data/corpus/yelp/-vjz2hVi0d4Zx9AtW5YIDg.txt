Used to live a couple blocks from there.  Not only is this place habit forming but there are three of them right next door to and across the street from each other.  . . I have only ever gone to the one on the west side of Ashland that is furthest north.  The one just to the south seem to have table service and the one across the street is a little dumpy and isn't much more than a counter.. . No nonsense traditional tacos and burritos with onions, cilantro, and their house red or green salsa.  Whatever spices are in the marinade are what make them great.
