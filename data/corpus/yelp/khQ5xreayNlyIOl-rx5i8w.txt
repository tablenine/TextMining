What I've learned at Big Star:. . -A $7 cocktail in Chicago is soooooooo refreshing.. . -Pork Belly tacos, ain't nothing wrong with that.. . -I haven't had tortillas that fresh since Texas.. . but. . -Hot damn it was dark in there, and cold.. . -Loud too, I was expecting some sweet classic Honky Tonk music, but the music was both too soft and too slow.. . I'll be back after I dig my cowboy boots and western shirt out of the closet, and then I'm taking over the turntable with some Hank Williams, Waylon Jennings; and Conway Twitty.
