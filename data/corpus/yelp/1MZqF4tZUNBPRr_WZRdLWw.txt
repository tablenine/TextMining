I've been going here for quite a while now. Good atmosphere and good food.. . As a vegetarian, I usually go for either the enchiladas or the veggie tacos. The quesadillas are pretty good, if you're looking for something lighter. Start with the corn nachos and some of the best margaritas in the area. For a side get the home fries (covered in cheese and jalapeo peppers). If you're still going strong by end the, the table can split the fruit cobbler a la mode.. . The brunch is great, but it's usually pretty crowded, so unless you have two people or are willing to sit at the bar, you're probably in for a wait. The coffee is good and the food has a nice flavor to it that sets it apart from other places. The flo white is probably my favorite and the fruit cup is always and excellent choice. The french toast is good too. If you're up for it, the Bloody Marys or mimosas are a great way to start a Saturday.
