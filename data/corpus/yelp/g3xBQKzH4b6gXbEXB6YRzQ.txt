The Griddle is more of a craving then an every day breakfast spot.  You have to be ready to gorge, atleast if your going for one of their more famous dishes, such as pancakes or french toast.  Here's a tip  that the servers and the menu don't tell you, you can order a 1/2 order of pancakes, and trust me it will be enough, . Their french toast is seriously amazing and is for right now the best I've had.  I'm not a pancake person so I only sort of like their pancakes, a little too sweet and doughy for me.  But I guess thats what a pancake is.  Actually, my favorite dish is Kicking and Screaming, two delicious breakfast tacos with eggs avocado and a delicious sauce.  Their coffee is also great, imho.  Price is, well its what you would expect from a place on sunset with this kind of hype.  Be ready to wait 45 minutes on weekend mornings, but the croud is noisy and fun so its not so bad, plus theres lots of room outside to stand and wait.  Parkings in the back and while its crowded, its never too difficult to find.  Other than that, enjoy, but like I said this wont be your every day breakfast spot, unless your 300 lbs.  Oh and lastly, they allow dogs outside, you'll see me with my german shepherd puppy.
