Chintzy as hell on the meat!   Noodles are fresh and broth is tasty though.. . Servers are generously attentive, on the other hand.   Tip them well. . they have three (3) types of broth flavors and 10 levels of spiciness.    You can choose to your heart's desire on the spiciness, but I suggest you get the Salt or Miso broth, as the Soy Sauce broth is a little too salty.  . . Orochon Ramen will put you on their Wall Of Fame board if you can finish their most 'spicy' ramen bowl - but that includes devouring the whole bowl, broth as well, in order to qualify.    That is almost infeasible, since you will have to quench down at least 8-10 glasses of water as well!  . .   Overall, a nice experience if you are visiting Little Tokyo.
