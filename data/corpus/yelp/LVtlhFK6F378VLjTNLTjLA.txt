FINALLLY got to come here after seeing it numerous times on the food channel, travel channel, etc.etc..... . when we got in at around....2pm on a saturday, the lines were longggg, i think we waited about 20 min in line? so we had plenty of time to think about what we wantd to order..and our choices were:. . 1 beef double dip with american. 1 beef double dip with swiss. 1 pork double dip with jack. 1 coleslaw. 1 potato salad. 1 chili bowl. 2 dill pickles. 2 lemonades. 1 iced tea. total= about $32. . thats alot of food for pretty cheap in my opinion.... . now..the sandwiches, were pretty good. i liked how the aujus wasnt too salty, and the bread was reallly good. not to hard on the outside, and perfectly chewy and moist inside.. the meat was pretty good, a lil dry, but not bad....and that hot mustard..is REALLY hot. haha but it was good~. also, i love the cheese slices, they arent those meesly thin slices of cheese, but a nice good thick slice so that i could SEE and TASTE it in my sandwich.. the pickles were crisp and juicy, and i really like the coleslaw...it was refreshing after all the meat and bread and cheese.. the potato salad was also pretty good, but i think it was overshadowed by the potatoes. . the chili, was also pretty good, a little too salty, and it reminded me of the chili at pinks :D. all in all, it was a deliciously satisfying meal for not too much money, and i will def. be coming back here!
