Thank you Ian's Pizza for being quick, clean, and filling my belly with delicious pizza during our St. Patrick's Day celebration last weekend!. . I'm very rarely in the neighborhood and boy have I been missing out.  Macaroni and cheese...cheeseburger and fries...on pizza?! Amazing.  . . Two slices were $7, which is pretty expensive for this East Coaster used to $3 for two slices and a soda, BUT...the pizza you get is definitely unique and worth it.  . . I'll definitely be back, but in the meantime will have to try out delivery!
