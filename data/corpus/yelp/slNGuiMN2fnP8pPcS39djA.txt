Alright... I was really excited after reading the 5 star review on yelp so I called up my relatives to come join me to try this place out. They have all read the reviews and maybe we were too hyped up about it because of the great reviews that I didn't find it 5 star worthy. 1st off, the service was definitely not 5 star worthy, they were so rushed and understaff that it took them 15 mins to get our water refilled, along with both the waiter and waitress were so... how do you say it.. "stonefaced" that we felt even if we were to drop $100 bill for tip, they wouldn't know how to smile or say thank you. We were all trying to be really polite, including my little brother who raised his hand quietly for attention from the server to refill our waters, instead he got scared because the server looked pissed. Because they were in such a hurry, it totally ruined our mood because we felt rushed to finish our dinner, they would try to cook our food but because they were in such a hurry, they would knock our food off the skillet and onto the table, woudln't apologize and put it back onto the skillet after it had already touched the table. Another thing I don't understand is why you can't order the pork neck meat outside of the combo. After reading all the reviews on the pork belly, I must admit that I have definitely had better. The shrimp and the beef were amazing though, so I would definitely give 5 stars on that. But due to the service, the clogged bathroom, and the luke warm soup, I am going to give it a 4 star. p.s. the kimchee and the radish were excellent though, along with the salad. I would go there for the food, but definitely not for the service.
