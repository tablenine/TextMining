I had the silver dollar pancakes and those things were a-MAY-zing.  A coupl'a the other girls at my table had sandwiches which tasted and looked great too (the vegetable as well as the tuna melt).  And those fries are great.  I like fries that have more potato and are a bit more of a wedge than the skinny ones you get at in'n'out (i probably just committed california-heresy).. . We ended up sharing the bossa nova: make sure they put enough ice cream over that waffle cone, and as my friend so wisely put it, "the dulce de leche makes it IT."  It *is* as good as they make it to be.. . Parking might be difficult, try to get street parking in the nearby suburbs and walk over.
