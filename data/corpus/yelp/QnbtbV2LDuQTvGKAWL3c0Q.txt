What this place lacks in menu items it more than makes up for by the coziness inside.  . . A friend and I went and grabbed burgers a beer the other night.  I highly recommend the bleu cheese burger (but ONLY if you REALLY like bleu cheese).  The fries were limp and soggy, but I'm not a french fry fan anyway so no love lost there.  . . Great place to go in the winter with their fireplaces, and I hear from my friend that it's great in the summer also because they have a HUGE beer garden.  . . My only major issue with the place is they don't take credit cards.
