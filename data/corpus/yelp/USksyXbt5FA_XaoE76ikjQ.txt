I have tried to get a table at this place on several occasions, but the wait was waaaaay too long when I tried to go for brunch over the weekend. I ended up having a day off and went in the middle of the week just to see what all the hype's about. Honestly I didn't think the food would be that good, but it really was great food. I ordered the tijuana omelette (jalapenos, cilantro, onions, cheese), a side of potatoes and coffee. The coffee was excellent, didn't really need cream or sugar (though I added a little). My omelette was tasty and light. The potatoes were really good, reminding me of the potatoes my dad used to make - red skin potatoes, nice and soft, with onions. Yummy food. I will go again, but NOT on a weekend. I don't think most places are worth an hour wait, especially not hungover or sleepy!
