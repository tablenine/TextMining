Restaurant: El Myr
Category: Mexican
I hear folks saying good things about the burritos, but in my opinion the chicken quesadillas are one of the true highlights of the El Myr menu. After the first time I ordered them I've never looked back, and the service wait-time never really bothered me because I somehow always end up going with people who are good for conversation.
