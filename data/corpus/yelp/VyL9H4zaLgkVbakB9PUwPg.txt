I love the diverse crowd.  Artsy fartsy, not pretentious at all.  You can roll out of bed with bedhead and rumpled clothes and NO ONE will care here.  In fact you will fit right in.  I heard they just installed a BS detector at the door.  If you are wearing designer clothes, too much hair product or cologne you will be seated at the counter in the ejector seat.  A trap door opens in the roof and you will be sent back to Weho the hard way.  Turkey meatloaf was awesome, so is the pot pie but I prefer a bit more pot in mine, I was only high for 4 hours instead of the customary 8 hours I get from my magic brownies.  The staff is friendly and WHERE ELSE in town do the bus boys wear T Shirts with inscriptions like "Lesbians eat out more often" ???  I love this place.  If you don't see it spilt on the table they are not serving it that day.
