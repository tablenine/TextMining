Restaurant: Bhojanic
Category: Indian
I love reviewing restaurants that have scores that range between 2 and 5 -- it gives you such freedom to review -- and yet never feel out of line!. . Well, the strengths of Bhojanic is it's atmosphere.  Cozy, dimly lit and plushly upholstered, the candles and live music add to the sense of a local community joint.  . Relaxed, and chill, it must bear some resemblance to the other side of the Atlantic where slowly but surely, traditional British fare is being replaced by S Asian verve.  This is such a place.  It's like a British pub... Kingfisher, Taj Mahal, and other indian beers are available with requisite domestic selections.. . But what about the food?  It's decent.. . That's a good start.  But that's as far as I can go.  If it weren't down the street from a couple other Indian joints, (Though this place is N. Indian -- no Dosai here!), it would probably get higher marks for food... but it is next to such establishments.  In that light, the food is not so hot (no pun intended).. . Here's the difference.  If you're bringing a date -- that you don't know really, really well yet -- this is a good place.  Shi-shi enough and intimate enough so that you can enjoy each other's company.  The food doesn't distract you with intolerable flavours -- leaving you to enjoy the evening.  . . On the other hand, if food turns you and your date on, I'd rethink the plan.  It's competent, not brilliant.. . 3 for food.. 4 for ambiance.
