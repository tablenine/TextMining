Make sure you wear your meat pants. (e-l-a-s-t-i-c). . This place is great for the meat lover. If you love meat and want to eat a lot of it, come to Brazzaz. It's menu is very similar to other brazilian chop houses but it's salad bar is superior. . . I just ate there last night using a 2 for 1 coupon. What a great deal. I recommend this to a group or if you are going with friends. FIrst dates might be a mistake. You don't want to eat that much in front of someone you just met.. . Other than that. It's awesome.
