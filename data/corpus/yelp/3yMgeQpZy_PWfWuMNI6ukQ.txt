Living and working downtown, and being a lover of brats and other sausages, I thought I'd give Wurstkuche a try.  . . I had the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage.  The sausage was tasty.  However $3.50 for a small bag of "Belgian Fries," and another $4.00 for a bottle of imported English cola (they don't offer any american sodas for drinks), made this dining experience a bit pricey for what was basically sausage, fries, and coke ($15.00 including the $6.50 sausage).  For the price, I can think of a few better places to eat downtown.
