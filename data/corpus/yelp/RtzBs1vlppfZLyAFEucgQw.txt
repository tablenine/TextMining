One bad meal is all it takes for me to say I'm never going back. And yet again, I was very disappointed. Being from the Midwest, I was looking for a good gyro and when I googled the best gyro place in the Atlanta area, somehow Marietta Diner came up. I don't care about atmosphere and how lovely a place is if they're food is no good. When I'm spending my hard earned money to go out, all I want is a place that's clean and has good service and good food, not chandeliers, cushy seat, and soft music. So my mom and I went here around Christmas time. We both ordered the gyro plate, a pretty large portion of french fries and thick slices of dried up, overcooked lamb with some type of yogurt for topping. The fries were like steak fries and they actually pretty good, but I was more interested in the gyro with dried up slices of lamb on a cold pita. And this place has the best gyros in town? Ok..... I will say that the dessert bar look very good with big pretty cakes, but I wasn't really willing to spend any more money. The service is adequate, the place was clean and actually crowded, but I won't be going back.
