Your breakfast will never be the same again! Nothing could have started my day better than gorgeous men serving me massive amounts of food. The guy next to us ordered the pancakes and my friend and I could not stop laughing when the 12-in wide, 5-in high stack arrived. He offered to share it with the entire restaurant - it was hilarious. The food was incredible, really hit the spot. The omlette pomodoro comes highly recommended. It was very crowded, we waited about 20 minutes to get a table, but well worth it.
