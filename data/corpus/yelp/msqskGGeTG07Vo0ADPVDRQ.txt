Delicious is the first word that came to mind!! I was here so long ago, but it def. left a lasting impression!! One of the few and first time's I actually tired ceviche and throughoutly enjoyed it and my entree was so good!! I think it was also the first time I tired sake, not a huge fan!! Anyhow, the place is really chic and the food was excellent!!
