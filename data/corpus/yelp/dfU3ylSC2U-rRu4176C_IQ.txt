i'm giving it 2 stars to balance out all the over-ratedness this place is getting. wut a disappointment!! :( a waste of a cute space. i really love the layout of the place. with the rustic tables &amp; chairs on the patio, but just about everything else about the place is soooo not worth it. mediocre food and bad/no service. i mean they messed up their *oatmeal*! how r u charging 8 bucks for oatmeal and mess it up??? i've had multiple things there but the only thing i ate there that was memorable was the godiva chocolate cake. holy shit that was good!
