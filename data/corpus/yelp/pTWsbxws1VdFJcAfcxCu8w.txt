Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Japanese Tourists:  "Excuse me? Where is Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles? This way?".                    . Jackie Chan w/ a bewildered look: "I'm sorry. I'm from out of town.". . Well, Jackie thats no excuse because Rosoce's is a LA landmark and anyone willing to put up with the LA traffic, smog/smug and the smirky ostentation, deserves the #4, 1/2 Chicken and 2 Waffles with their special recipe gravy.. .  And Jackie, please keep in mind the #4 maybe spectacular at Roscoes but not everything with a #4 is gravy, aiit  (i.e Rush Hour 4- you have been fore warned).
