Great.  One of the best meals I have had in Los Angeles in years.  . . We sat at the Mozzarella bar &amp; had an assortment delicious cheeses prepared in a very creative way.  We next had one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.  The cheeks with the Bucatini in a spicy tomato sauce.   I could eat this every night.  The wine was also very reasonable.. . Mozza is my new favorite restaurant.
