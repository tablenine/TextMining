WHAT'S UP, DUCK?. . So I finally get the chance to try Osteria Mozza, after hearing all the rave reviews.  With family/friends/Yelp recommendations, I'm excited to have some deelish food.. . We brought our own wine, and I was glad we did once I saw the wine list.  Okay, I'm not a total moron when it comes to wine, but looking at that wine list was like trying to read hieroglyphics without a rosetta stone.  I'm sure the sommelier would've been helpful...if she had bothered to come around.  No matter, I came here for the food.. . We ordered the grilled octopus and the burrata with bacon.  YUM!  Definitely a great start to the meal.  Next came our pasta dishes:  BF ordered the Agnolotti (meat-filled pillow pasta) and I got the Maltagliati (flat pasta with wild boar ragu).  OMG!!  Every bite was like tasting the clouds of heaven.  Mmm-mmm-mmm!. . And for the grand finale: Duck...or did I order rotisserie chicken?  Cuz it sure tasted like chicken.  Based on brother's recommendation and Yelpers, I was expecting some crispy goodness.  But what I got was, although good, no better than Chicken Cafe chicken.  There was nothing crisp about it.  I'd rather have me some roast duck from Sam Woo any day!. . In summary, 5 stars for apps &amp; pastas, minus 1 star for the chickenduck, minus 1 star for the so-so service (no sommelier, waiter never filled our glasses, not very informative).  I would definitely go again, but next time I'll save room for the olive cake.
