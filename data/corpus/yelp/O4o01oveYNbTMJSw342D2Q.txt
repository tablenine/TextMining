I thought this place was Â fun and cute. I drove all the way here to this town to meet up with some friends. The one thing I didn't like was the long ass wait. But what made the wait bareable was to people watch the crowd in the waiting place outside. Interesting people...but the wait pretty much sucked the big nut. Plus I was so hungry. I think we probably waited a good 1.5 hours or more. . . The food however was yummy. The spicy was really spicy. I had running nose by shrimp #3. We had the whole shabang. It was good enough to feed 5 people...so that was good. The sauce that they steam it in is very garlic-ky, which I love garlic. The place was fun to eat in a very informal way...no plates, no utensils...sort of barbaric and "medieval times" style. Just grab from plastic bag and use paper towels. You have to get both hands into the action and just start peeling. The crab we got was pretty good too. They also have sweet potato fries which I love. I would definitely go back and try something new. . . I had a big urge to write stuff on the walls since that was what other people did. So next time bring some sharpie markers to leave your mark. Oh...and the parking is not so great...so thats why I give it 3 stars.
