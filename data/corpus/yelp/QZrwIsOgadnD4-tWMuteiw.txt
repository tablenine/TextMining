I have been here four times.....All though the menu has a lot of amazing options, I have gotten the same thing every time....A stacked turkey sandwich on Rye Bread. I HATE rye bread....Yet for some reason, every time I walk out the door, I find myself missing it.....Oh my God...Im dating a sandwich...
