Worst. Service. Ever.. . One time I went here for my birthday with four other people.  They ordered burgers and I ordered the fish.  After 45 minutes of our waiter totally ignoring us (and us dehydrating in the August heat with no offers to refill our drinks) he came over to us to "apologize" that it was taking so long and proceeded to blame it on me for ordering fish.  I corrected him and let him know that I cook fish everyday and talapia takes 10 minutes tops to cook, so I know it wasn't the fish holding up the order.  He then offered to make it up to me by offering me a complimentary dessert for my birthday, for which I thanked him but informed him I was allergic to dairy and wouldn't be able to take him up on his offer.  I counteroffered w/ a free drink instead and he said "oh yeah, I'll bring you a BIG bloody mary."  So I excused him for blaming the birthday girl for the delay in the food but then became enraged to see that he actually CHARGED me for the "free" bloody mary...and charged me DOUBLE for it being a "BIG" bloody mary.  Happy Birthday!!. . Another time during Pride, we stopped here for some pre-Pride action.  The place was surprisingly empty for the Friday before the festivities, so we thought we lucked out and would get fast service.  Wrong we were!!!  We sat at a table for what seemed like an hour but was probably twenty or so minutes w/ waiter after waiter walking by us and ignoring us.  We tried to make eye contact several times to no avail so we finally displayed our discontent by filling up their sugar containers w/ the ketchup and mustard left on the table, and then we left vowing to never eat at Joe's again...that was several years ago and I still refuse to eat there, even if they were giving the food away the service would still suck balls.
