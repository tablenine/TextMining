I am satisfied!. . Drink:. Rose from recommendation.. The wine complements my main dish. I usually don't like rose, but the flavor is crisp and refreshing. It is not too sweet yet fruity. . . Sampler:. Oyster on the half shell ( 1/2 dozen). Very fresh. It's a perfect size for 2 people.. . Main dish:. Tempura Soft Shell Crab/black rice, sliced green papaya, crushed cashews, a bit of pork belly.. The dish is flavorful. I enjoyed every bite. I sometimes tasted curry flavor,too. As well as the soft shell crab, the crispy pork belly was perfectly cooked! . My friend had Lobster roll. The bun is so buttery and sweet, and it complements marinated lobster.. The dish comes with a big portion of french fries.. . The service was great.. We didn't make a reservation, but we were seated promptly to the bar section, the seats didn't bother us at all. In fact, we kinda enjoyed watching cooks(chefs). If you want to get a proper table, making a dinner reservation is highly recommended!
