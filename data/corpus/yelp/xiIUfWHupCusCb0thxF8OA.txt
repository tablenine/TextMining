I really liked the whole place, food, drinks, atmosphere.  Went for the Atlanta TweetUp event and tried some of the tapas, salmon and green beans were my favorites.  Comfortable, friendly feel to the place.  Feels spacious.  Seems non-smoking, so I'm a fan of that.  Definitely a place to return for a relaxed meal.
