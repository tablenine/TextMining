on return trip from a chinese doc, who charges WAY too much for a nose balm, a delightful little lunch had redeemed my day of being ripped off.  In a wrinkled hand-written address that my friend brought, was the address of Savoy, Alhambra.  "their Hainan chicken is really good, trust me"..and my untrusting thoughts were "it's chicken, how good could it be?" and my mind wondered off to eating sushi at Miura as we drove to the location.. . Small place, packed at 2PM on Monday, single/double/crowds of various backgrounds were dining in the joint.  Quick service, got our. chicken in 10min. not the best looking dish, what's so good about this? skepticism till the END! and I took few bites out of the chicken, dipped it in different sauces, repeat process........5min.later......where did my food go?  So you see, I of little faith in fowl, sparked a new chapter of respect....chicken, you're fxxxing good.
