Let me start by saying the only reason someone should come here is if they have out-of-town guests whom they wish to impress with what non-New Yorkers will view as "glamorous big-city dining.". . The decor in Buddha Bar is slightly impressive but also made me think of a gigantic buddha (like the one in the back) vomiting numerous smaller buddhas. Here a buddha, there a buddha, everywhere a buddha!. . The food at Buddha Bar, for lack of a better word, sucks. I had previously been under the impression that the only way to ruin a filet mignon was to overcook it. But Buddha Bar has discovered a whole new way to do so - slather it with a coating of "Asian spices" and serve it in a lake of gelatinous brown sauce - YUM!!. . The one good thing about this overbuilt monstrosity of a restaurant is the music. Oh - and the glass smoking room is kinda cool if you're a smoker.
