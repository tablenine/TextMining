Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Yes, there's a line to get in. But I take that to be a good sign. It often Â means great food awaits and luckily, at the The Boiling Crab, it also means getting great service.. . This place runs like a well-oiled machine serving up the tastiest seafood around. The staff was on top of things ensuring they got the details of every order correct. You can't beat the prices either: $7.99 for a half dozen raw oysters, $8.99 for a pound of cooked shrimp bathed in your choice of seasonings, and $2 beers.
