Restaurant: Panes Bread Cafe
Category: Sandwiches
My roomates joke that I keep Panes in business because I literally eat there 4-5 times a week. I am a firm believer that the bread is the most important part of any sandwich, and Panes delivers! The sweet french is to die for and the garlic rosemary is a close runner up.. . The feta chicken salad is delish with roasted red peppers, artichokes, feta cheese and this really yummy dressing that ties it all together. All of their sandwiches are great, but the specials are the best! I go for the curry chicken salad sandwich (with whole grapes and a smooth curry cream sauce) while my boyfriend craves the blackened tilapia.. . The bacon-cheese scrambled eggs are a must on Sundays!. . The staff are totally un-friendly and sometimes borderline rude, but the food is so superb that it doesn't matter. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
