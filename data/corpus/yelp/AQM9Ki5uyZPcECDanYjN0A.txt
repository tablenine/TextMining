Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
I've visited this place on and off for over 15 years -- the food remains solid, and I keep ordering the same two dishes.  Cantonese styled beef chinese broccoli fried noodles, and braised tofu.  Okay I lied, I occasionally mix it up with Kuey Tiao and Wonton noodles.. . Fast service in a crowded environment amongst claustrophobic seating is standard here.  But the food is well worth the crowding at the prices offered.
