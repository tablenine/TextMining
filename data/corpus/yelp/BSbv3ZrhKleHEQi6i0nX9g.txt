Restaurant: Francesca&#39;s Forno
Category: Italian
As a regular diner at the other Francesca's locations throughout the city, I have to admit that I held pretty high standards for Forno when I ate there the first time a couple nights ago. While there was nothing really wrong with the restaurant, I don't quite feel like it deserves to be a part of the Francesca's family. . . Here is my main problem: Francesca's restaurants update their menus almost daily. Forno uses same menu all the time. What this means - The chefs at Forno are not using the best ingredients available depending on the season.. . This is a REALLY BIG DEAL to me. So big I felt the need to capitalize. The reason I love Francesca's is that they always make the best meals with the best options given the time of year. I have never, ever had a bad meal at a Francesca's restaurant. Never. This is why my mediocre pasta at Forno the other night really let me down. . . The waiter was great, the bread was amazingly fresh, and the atmosphere was warm and lively. That being said, I'll take mediocre pasta if I'm expecting it (see reviews for Noodles &amp; Co and Zen for proof), but mediocrity and Francesca's should never co-exist. Forno, I expect you to do better.
