I am giving Gibson's the nod as my favorite Chicago Steakhouse... the atmosphere is awesome, the staff is great, and its where the celebrities flock to for a steak when they are in Chicago. Everything here is perfectly done, and the bartenders make great dirty martini's. Â If your not sure about dropping the cash to try it, go to lunch here, it is heavily discounted. . . I would take any visitor I had to Gibson's if they came to Chicago looking for a classic steakhouse and I would tell anyone reading this review to do the same.
