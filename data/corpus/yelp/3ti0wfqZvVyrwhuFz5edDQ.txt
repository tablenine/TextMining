Ah yes, another Here To Serve restaurant.  I think that some of these reviews are kind of harsh.  I'm a big tapas fan, and while the tapas here don't compare to Spain, they're definitely not horrible.  . . I think the best time to come IS the Monday night $10 all-you-can-eat tapas (ahem and $3 margaritas).  At least with this option you get to sample what you want, and order it as many times as you would like without ever going over...$10.  It's a high-energy, fun environment.  Generally though, the menu is pretty weak in terms of quality.. . I've tried the queso fundido, spanish fried potatoes, fried green tomatoes, hummus, mozz and tomatoes, calamari, spanish cheeses, potato crusted salmon, mini crab cakes, hmmm ok most of the menu when I've gone with large parties.  Nothing is spectacular, but it's certainly not bad.. . Great for a girls night out (on Monday).  Get drinks and just go to enjoy.
