Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
one star because I liked the salsa...kind of. I have heard people talk about these tacos for years so now that I moved to the area decided to taste these great tacos. But sad to say....awful. Its just a step up from taco bell! The ground beef is over seasoned....and that makes me wonder how old it must be. It was nothing at all special......Does anyone know where they have real great hard shell tacos?
