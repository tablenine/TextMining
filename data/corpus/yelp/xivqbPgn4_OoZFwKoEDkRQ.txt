Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Boisterous and cheerful. . . Even tough the quality of meat may not be as great as other (pricier) places, Manna does the trick. The meat is flavorful, the sides are plentiful. This is a favorite with penny-pinching pals. Â Not high on my list, but I won't complain if someone else suggests it.
