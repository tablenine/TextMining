You know, I'm starting to realize I don't mind vegans anymore.  In fact, I'm starting to not mind them enough that I'll actually go out and eat their food once in a while to feel healthy about myself.. . So this place has some great tacos... with some nice crunchy shells like I used to eat all the time at Taco Bell, except, they weren't Taco Bell shells, they were VEGAN shells, and STILL GOOD!  Despite the fake cheese and everything, I'd eat these tacos again!. . The Reuben sandwich is delicious as well... with nice flavored fake meat, a bunch of sauerkraut, and oil drenched toast - just how I like it!  I mean, when you have a toasted sandwich, you've GOTTA have the bread nice and crispy and dripping in oil or it's really not worth it.  . . The only thing I did not like about this place was the maple walnut cookie.  If you do not enjoy having a chunk of inedible dirt in your mouth, do not buy this cookie.. . But other than that, I'm definitely coming here again!
