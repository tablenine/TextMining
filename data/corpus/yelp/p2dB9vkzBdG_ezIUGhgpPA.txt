The dishes here were great. My family ordered a whole bunch of stuff- quinoa and vegetable soup, borscht, salad, sandwich-everything was delicious. I try to eat vegan as much as possible and I was in heaven here. My family also thought it was delicious. Coffee was delicious. Do your body good and eat here!
