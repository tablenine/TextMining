Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Yes, this place can be overrated since there's a line out to the door (sometimes out to the neighor's door). But it's worth a try once. (you might even see a celebrity!). . They have awesome onion rings, and their hotdogs aren't bad either. Basically, they have hot dogs topped with variety of toppings. They offers drinks and cakes. The peach soda is the best! The hot dogs cost around $5-6 depends on your order. . . *subject to change
