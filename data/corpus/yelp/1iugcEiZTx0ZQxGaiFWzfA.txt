This is one of my favorite places to eat at the Farmer's Market.  I've eaten here a few years back and every time I'm at the Market it has always been good.  . . It's not the traditional taco shop, but it's pretty good for being different.  I guess you can say the black beans put a healthier spin on things.  The lines can get long, but it's worth the wait.  I'm excited to hear about the second location in Hollywood!
