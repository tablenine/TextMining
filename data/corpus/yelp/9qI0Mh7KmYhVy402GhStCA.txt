Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Mastro's has to be my favorite steakhouse. period. I went with the BF a while back and look forward to the next time we'll be dropping in.  We both got the filet (i think i got the petite filet.. but...) and it was amazing. The meat was so tender and flavorful.  To go with the steak, we got some of the mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  Both were delicious but the mashed potatoes need to be eaten quickly because if you are anything like us and like to talk over dinner.. then the heavenly-ness of the mashed potatoes diminish quickly as it cools down. The mushrooms though were lovely throughout the entire meal. We ended the meal with the much raved about signature butter cake and it was exactly the perfect finish to a perfect steak meal. And this is coming from a girl who actually doesn't like desserts. hm.
