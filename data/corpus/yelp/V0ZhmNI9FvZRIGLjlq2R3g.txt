Restaurant: Coobah
Category: Latin American
Coobah is very good, but not great.  The first problem is, this place isn't really Cuban. So that's disappointing. . The bar is a fun scene, they play great music, clean attractive restrooms.  The food is above average, service with a smile.  Long waits and small menu.  Wine list leaves a little to be desired. Great drinks, good appeteasers. Pork entree is tasty, the cuban sandwich is a lousy version of a usually great sandwich.  Nice night out, but inconsistent kitchen.  Take a chance..if it sucks, go drown your sorrows across the street at SoPo.
