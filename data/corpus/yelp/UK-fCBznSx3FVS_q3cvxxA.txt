CASH ONLY!  Just so you know before you go, they don't accept any type of card, so have cash on hand.  I wish I had known before I met my sister there yesterday.. . The bartender wasn't very nice and told me she needed to keep my i.d. since my sister started a "tab" with a coke and some guacamole and chips.  They also card you as soon as you walk in, which I found strange for a restaurant, at 6 p.m., on a Tuesday.  . . And the tacos?  I enjoyed the fish taco, but for $3 per taco, it was TINY.  I really love living near wicker park, but I don't think I'll be going back to big star anytime soon.  A lot of annoying factors and hipster waiters who don't have customer service skills, get over yourself you're still a SERVER!
