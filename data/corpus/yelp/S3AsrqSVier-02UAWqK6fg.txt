We've been here once with some friends and had a good time and and so my husband and I decided to go again. I called to make reservations and the front desk clerk was very rude and abrupt but I didn't let her stop me from making the reservation anyway. Â When we got there it was still pretty empty so we were seated right away but had to change tables because the area we were at smelled like piss (not a good sign) when we did move tables we had another waiter, Ryan, who's service was the worse! It took forever to get our food and we had to practically stop him in his tracks to get any kind of service! It was like a completely different place! And too top it all off this waiter actually changed his tip amount to 10 bucks more once it cleared! I remembered because I purposely tipped him less than 10 percent and it ended up over 20 percent when it went through on my account! It is very sad because it's a nice place, the DJ is great on Tuesdays and the food is good but (very expensive)! Other than the parking situation it was okay! But because of that waiter we are never going there again.!!! They don't even deserve 1 star!
