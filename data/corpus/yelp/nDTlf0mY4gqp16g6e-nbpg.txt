Restaurant: Ciudad
Category: Latin American
Caution: it's been four years since I've been to Ciudad.. . I dined there with a Microsoft PM on a Sunday night while attending a conference.  I was probably under-dressed, but the chic hostess and waitress didn't give me any shit about it.. . The restaurant's decor was quite attractive, but more importantly, the food was yums.  Our ceviche was fresh and piquant, and the lark rib + sauce special to die for.  I would definitely go again (especially since I tend to stay across the street).
