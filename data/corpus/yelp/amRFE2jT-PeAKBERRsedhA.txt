I've been curious to find out what all the fuss is about this place. When Lauren S invited me to join her and a few others this past Thurs for the 10:00PM Burger, how could I resist!? . . My verdict....I was pretty impressed! . . H&amp;F has a lot of charm to it! It's a pretty small space so be prepared to stand the entire time or fight for a table. The drinks were probably the BEST I've ever had in Atlanta. The bartenders really know their stuff and I fell in love with the Piedmont Apple. . . Let's get to that burger...best in Atlanta???...ummm...yeah! The simplicity of this burger...two patties with two slices of cheese, grilled onions and pickles on a freshly baked bun...was what made this burger so awesome. No fluff, no gimmiks...all delish! The best part is that it only cost ya $10.00! . . This will definitely become one of my favorite places to hang out and I look forward on going back often. The only down side...the "REAL" Housewives of Atlanta, or shall i say the Buckhead Betty's hang out here too with their sequence shirts, overdone hair and mac makeup galore. Seriously ladies...money does not buy class but it does buy me to be your personal shopper and adviser! Oh, and please apply makeup in the bathroom, not at the bar!
