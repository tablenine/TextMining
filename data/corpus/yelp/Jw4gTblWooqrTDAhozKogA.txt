Well, first off, let me give a great big shout-out to my fellow Yelpers who've gone before me, to this place; I felt like a seasoned veteran walking into this place, knew what to get &amp; how to get it. I scored the extra side of hush puppies, and was glad for it so, thanks, everyone! . . I was in the mood for shrimp tonight, and went straight for the 10-jumbos boiled dinner. If Hieu could ever get his hands on some really, truly fresh shrimp, he'd be downright dangerous.  Of course, I'm not going to dock any stars for that , because nobody else in Atlanta can either; I've yet to hear of anyone flying a learjet down to the Gulf daily to fetch shrimp from the docks every morning at 05:00, and I probably couldn't afford dinner there if they did.  One of the trade-offs of living in a landlocked city...I still love ya though, ATL! Still, these were cooked perfectly, and were the best I've ever managed to find here in Atlanta.. . Hallelujah for a guy who actually delivers jumbo shrimp! I always hate it when a restaurant sprinkles a handful of 26-30s across a plate &amp; tries to pass 'em off as jumbos...these were nice, big mamma-jammin' shrimp. I got them boiled, which is a classic low-country shrimp boil, with a nice touch of heat that definitely piqued my interest. It has a bit of a flavour twist, though, the result of a 'secret ingredient.' I'm not going to shout out to the world what I think it is, but I will try adding some to the next batch I make here at home, to see if I'm right; the red ring around the edge of the sauce gives it away, though. ;o). . The service here is very informal &amp; relaxed, but friendly; definitely a come-as-you-are kind of place. It's a bit of a drive from where I live, but I will be back, definitely!
