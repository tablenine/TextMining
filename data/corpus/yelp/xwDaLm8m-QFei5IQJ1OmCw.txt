Food= Good. Service= Questionable. Ambience= Crowded. made reservations and still had to wait 30 minutes trying to dodge ppl leaving+ entering. I just stared at the fish tank giving nicknames to pass time. Finally seat opened up by the bar and so I had a mojito listening to the music after I no longer had fish left to name...then came the seating and a friend and I ordered crab and garlic noodles...by then the hunger sort of went away... the crab was good, and rave bout garlic noodle was indeed true... Good but really greasy... :) I would give this place a 3 star for inattentiveness/disorganized hostess/es Â however an added star for a friend who loooooooove their noodles. :P
