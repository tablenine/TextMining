Yes, I have experienced much better for those prices. I have not been there for a couple years, the remodel job looks real nice. Had the Joe's scramble was not to thrilled. My order of toast came out a little late and the quality of the bread for the price of everything not great.. Service was o.k I wasn't a regular so they ignored me a little. I will try again when I'm in the hood. I do love John O's.
