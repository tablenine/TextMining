While the food itself is good, the pricing and team attitude is pretty poor.  I ordered 2 cheese enchiladas with mole a la carte.  The total came to $5.45, whcih seemed about right.  My order came out with just a single enchilada, which most certainly had to be a mistake!  Nope.  The cashier said that she only rang in one, the price was correct.  I looked up at the menuboard and realized that prices aren't listed anywhere in the place.  It is as if they are looking for a blank check because it is in the Farmers Market.  I noticed that they were voted "best in la ciudad" back in 2007.  Nothing since, no surprise why!
