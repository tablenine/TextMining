Dessert is a MUST. I don't know about the food, but I had the New Orleans beignets, and they are worthy of the New Orleans title.  Soft and fluffly on the inside.  Crunchy on the outside.  Served WARM.  They came in a huge basket, so they were definitely a meal itself.  The buffalo chicken rolls were also good. I can vouch for those two menu items.
