To be fair, I waited until after my second visit to offer a review of this place. I know that they just opened recently. Based on my 2 visits, this place is consistently bad. The concept obviously has a lot of potential, but they need to get their stuff together soon if they want to stay in business. Our waiter was nervous and jerky. It took 25 minutes to get our drinks. The waiter explained the delay by saying that it was the bartender's "first time making that drink (the bacon infused manhattan), so he is trying to figure it out". Wow... that's reassuring. . . The food was OK... you can get much better BBQ elsewhere for much cheaper. For a place that charges a premium, they need to pay more attention to detail (no croutons on the salad as advertised, no salt on rim of margarita as requested, dirty silver taken and not replaced mid-meal, salad plates too small to hold the salad etc.) . . In the end, it took us nearly 2 hours to finish lunch and no one in our party of 6 was very impressed. In fact, a couple of people are feeling sick now after eating the beef brisket. . . It just feels like this place opened in a big hurry and now they are trying to figure out how to run a restaurant. Great concept. Poor execution.
