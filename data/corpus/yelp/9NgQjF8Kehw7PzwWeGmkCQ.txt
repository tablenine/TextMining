Am I about to give a restaurant a 5-star rating based on their cheeseburger and fries? YES, why not?! I can't stop day dreaming about its amazingness.. . I went here last Friday before my hair appt at the Double-O Salon down the street. I was famished and a burger and fries sounded like just the ticket. I am so happy I ended up at this burger heaven housed in the unusual red A-frame.. . While waiting in line I began to experience anxiety as I quickly approached the register. What the heck should I order - everything sounded so good. As I was wondering what in the world an UBE shake is, I noticed that they offered gruyere cheese on the menu. DONE. I ordered a cheeseburger, medium-rare, with gruyere cheese, a side of Belgium fries, and a large Diet Coke (I mean really, is this not the perfect meal?) Register girl asked if I wanted garclic aioli for the fries and I succombed to the upsell (glad I did).. . I took a seat outside, it was a most lovely day, and eagerly anticipated my lunch. WOW - this burger was cooked perfectly to order and was so flavorful and juicy that I think my fantasies of it border on naughty.The gruyere cheese was thinly melted over the patty and the bun was soft and supple. Â Now to the fries. They had a real potato taste similar to In-N-Outs fries, but were much crunchier and larger in size. The garlic aioli dipping sauce was legit and I am surely safe from vampires for a few more days. Poor hairdresser.. . Oinkster - I love thee. When can we hang-out again?
