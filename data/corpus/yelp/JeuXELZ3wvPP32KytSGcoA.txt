sweet tooth paradise. kind of an old school set up in a clean environment. no moth balls or funky smell like some places that try to be retro. to my surprise they have their version of red velvet but it's blue!! Â fantastically delicious..very moist and not overly sweet. the ice cream sandwiches are aite...but i'd prefer chomping down on a few good humor strawberry shortcake bars (on a side note i can scarf down a whole box in one sitting). the shakes look good but have never tried them. nice place to get a quick sugar rush but parking sucks donkey.
