Ambiente: cool *****. . Service: a little pretentious and wanting to sell, barely ****. . Food: barely **. I would like to see the chef himself eating what we were served! I was not satisfied at all and my stomach hurt the whole evening. I felt like going for dinner to a real place afterwards. . What did I order?. - Lobster &amp; Pork Sui Mai with Roasted Chili Pesto, Scallion-Ginger Sauce: I could not taste any lobster and it was tasteless in general. . - Muushu Duck: It was simply a huge pile of fried tortillas with a few of duck strips and covered with something like BBQ sauce and mayonaise. This was simply average sportsbar food. . - Chicken Chow Fun: This dish was completely without any taste. For whatever reason there was too much sugar in it and my wife felt bad afterwards. . . Menu prices: in this case just not worth it. Even for lower prices I would not go back. . . Sorry - can't give more than **, even with that kind of cool ambiente!
