Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery

This place is so overrated it kills me.  I've gone here more times than I want to admit and each time I think it's going to be better.  . . It's not.  . . The food is consistently mediocre, maybe the only thing The Alcove really has going for it is the coffee.  You're pretty much just paying extra for the nice outdoor patio and hipsters talking in their cell phones.   . . p.s.  Don't eat the giant marshmallows for sale at the counter.
