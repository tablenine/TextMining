charming little place that has a contemporary feel to it. Happy Hour was pretty cool- they had musicians playing some great songs like Hotel California.  Drinks are $4 each during happy hour- Sangria was weak. Mojito was tangy but not much alcohol.  Didn't try the house margaritas.  All tacos were $4.  The carnita tacos had a massive portion with a huge dollop of guacamole. Too oily.  The potato taco was deep fried with this chipotle cream sauce. Wasn't very good.  The fish tacos were flaked fish pieces with a tangy sauce- pretty good. The chicken tacos had tomatoes on them.. nothing spectacular.. . In general- that's the whole happy hour menu in a nutshell. They have HH from 4-7pm and reverse HH from 9-12pm.  Give it a try- it's something new and fresh from the rather stuffy and now pretentious downtown crowds. Enjoyable!
