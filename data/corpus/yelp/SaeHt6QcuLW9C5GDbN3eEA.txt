Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
As I turned off Franklin onto the narrow drive up the hill to Yamashiro on the dark rainy night, I hoped that it was worth it.  . . Yamashiro is on top of hill on the edge of Hollywood.  Once you reach the restaurant you immediately know the drive was worth it.  The restaurant on the outside is a magnificent sight, but nothing compared to the inside.  Inside there is a beautiful courtyard room with tables surrounding an amazing garden.  The design, is wonderful, since it cuts down on the noise and makes a great romantic dining spot.  The food is amazing.  Wonderfully presented and prepared, and the drinks are nothing to scoff at either.  Off of the courtyard room is a lounge area that offers amazing views of the city.  A great place to come to enjoy the view and have a drink.
