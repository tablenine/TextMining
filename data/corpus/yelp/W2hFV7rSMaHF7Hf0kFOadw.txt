Canter's--I really want to like you. You've been in LA for decades. You've even been on "Curb Your Enthusiasm". Unfortunately, I've eaten with you dozens of times: sometimes drunk; sometimes sober. Yet, every time you seem to disappoint me. Your food is uninspiring, boring, and your meats are always dry. I know it may be hard, but please improve! I really, really want to like you!
