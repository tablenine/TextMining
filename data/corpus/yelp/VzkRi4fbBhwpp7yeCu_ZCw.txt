Went here last weekened with a friend. I didn't know anything about it ahead of time, and I am surprised to see so many good reviews on yelp. Perhaps we were there on an off day. On the plus side, the wait was very short at 1030 on a Saturday morning (about 10 minutes). Probably because the only place to wait is outside and it was freezing! The restaurant is really cute, all decked out in eggs. Between the name and the decor, I was ready for some delicious eggs. Imagine my surprise when I opened up the menu and found more pancake/French toast choices than egg dishes! Eventually I found the specials list, and there were more egg options there, but I still thought this was really weird. I ended up ordering a special - the egg sandwich. I was really unimpressed. I love a good egg sandwich (I dream about the one at M. Henry) but this was just not that good. The bread was dry and unflavorful. The eggs were scrambled up with bacon, onions, etc. They were okay, but nothing I couldn't make at home. Evenutally I ditched the bread and just ate the eggs inside. Also, the menu said I would get "potato hash" as a side. But it's not hash at all. It's just red potatoes that are also just okay. My friend didn't seem blown away by her pancakes either. . . Since I'm a decaf drinker, I have to review the coffee, and the decaf was nothing to write home (or yelp) about. My friend (who also ordered decaf) didn't even drink hers. Plus, they kept forgetting that I had decaf and trying to refill my cup with regular. A big no no in my book. All in all, the theme of the meal was "it's okay." I might give this place another shot...maybe we ordered the wrong things, but I'm not in a rush to go back.
