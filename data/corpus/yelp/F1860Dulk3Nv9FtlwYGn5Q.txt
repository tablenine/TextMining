Restaurant: LA Mill Coffee Boutique
Category: Desserts
Super friendly staff and the donut I appropriated from my friends' dish was a little taste of heaven. I otherwise didn't think the coffee was anything spectacular. We had Chemex with Mexican beans and I also had the Caramel Corn drink. Great presentation, but the coffee was bitter and acidic. I like the style of LA Mill in theory, but when you're actually seated inside it feels noisy and chaotic.
