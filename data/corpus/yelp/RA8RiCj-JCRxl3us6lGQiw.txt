If you want to meet Wolfy, then go here on Friday for lunch, but don't expect a booth or the best seat in the house cause you wont get it unless you are a who's who of who's in Beverly Hills. This is the day old Beverly Hills Social people come and dine here. And if you are a popular person in the Beverly Hills scene, you can go from table to table seeing your friends. Yes, it's that much of a click, but a good click. And of course Wolfy is their greeting all his best customers, after all, he caters these peoples private parties and weddings. They put him on the map. . . And the food is very inventive. sugar with your sushi? Yes, the best sugary, waffle style crispy cones filled with spiced tuna. Not your typical ice cream treat. . . And for desert try Wolfy's hand made chocolate chip cookies with a latte or milk. . . I actually can't stop eating when I'm at this palace of a restaurant with a court yard and trees. I feel like I'm in a dream and the new Wonka Factory is now Spago's and I got a golden ticket. . . Dress to impress, and be on your best behavior.......
