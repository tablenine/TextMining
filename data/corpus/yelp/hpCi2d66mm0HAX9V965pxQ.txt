Love this place.  Food is always good, atmosphere is always great.  People are young and attractive.. . The only thing I do NOT love is the wait.  We made reservations (for my birthday!) for 8pm, we didn't get seated until 8:45!  After nicely complaining about 5 times, the waitress said the manager was going to provide us with free appetizers, they brought out 3 kinds.  In terms of apps, nothing was too spectacular.. . I always get a pasta dish and am never unhappy.  Portions are good, but not so big that I feel wasteful leaving a few bites.  Last time I got a pasta dish with seafood - very good.  . . The manager also said we'd get free dessert, so we got 3 of them.  All were very good, my fav was the brownie with vanilla ice cream (no one ever does this dessert wrong).  After all the discounts, our meal was quite reasonable :)  I suggest if it ever takes more than 20 minutes for your seat, make sure to complain so you get something comped.
