Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
Tired of battling your way through a throng of strollers, diaper bags, and screams to get to brunch? Look no further- Stella's is here to help.. . Now, I'm not sure if it's the neighborhood or the restaurant itself, but I've enjoyed several serene, tasty breakfasts here that haven't ONCE been punctuated by Â the now par-for-the-course cries of an angry child or a burp-up (and by "burp" I mean projectile vomit) breakfast incident.. . Now, I don't have anything against kids or their 'rents. I know it must be tough to go out and eat like you used to or, for that matter, as a family. Yes, I know you parents still want to enjoy the same foods you used to pre-birth.. . I guess I just wish that I, the single, child-less diner, didn't have to be punished for your sins. Yes, you heard me, you dirty fornicators.. . And, at Stella's, I'm not punished. At least, I haven't been yet.. . (btw- the food is delish. order the fruity french toast. amazing).
