Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Bottega Louie is opening April 6, and a couple of my co-workers and I went for the sneak peek lunch yesterday.  The food was awesome.  We wanted to give the menu a workout, so we ordered the pizza, ravioli, chicken parmigiana, and ribeye steak to share along with some asparagus and green beans on the side.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The pizza crust was thin and toasty with good flavor and the sausage on the pizza was excellent.  The ravioli was flavorful with spinach and ricotta cheese.  Chicken parmigiana is not my favorite, but this was flavorful and balanced.  The ribeye was great, very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Joe, our warm and smiling waiter, suggested that we get a chocolate souffle for the table., even though it required a 25 minute wait.  It was worth the wait. It was "molto cioccolato" or very rich with strong dark chocolate flavor.  We had a cup of coffee while we were waiting for the souffle, and the coffee was almost like dessert, it was strong with great coffee flavor.  We thought the prices were fair, a lot of dishes are $14.95, but it is an a la carte menu, so the prices can add up.  What we most loved, though, were the friendly and gracious management and staff.  They made our dining experience special.
