If only everything here could be as perfect as the french fries.. . Overall, Oinkster accomplishes it's mission, which is to provide slow cooked, high quality food quickly.  The price is a bit higher than a typical fast food joint, but is more than worth it for the quality.. . Top marks go to the french fries, which are some of the best anywhere.  Made from scratch, fried right, these potatoes are light, crispy, and filled with goodness.  The garlic aioli provides a nice dip.. . The burger scores top marks as well.  Thicker than a typical fast food joint, thinner than fine dining, it reminds me of a good back yard cookout.  Juicy, and served on a nice bun, this one scores.. . Slightly less than top marks for the pulled pork.  I am a pork-loving Jew, and my standards are high.  The only marks against are for the lack of smoke, which I find necessary for my full pulled pork enjoyment.  The elements of the sandwich, while lacking as individual elements, work together perfectly.  The BBQ sauce, leaning too much toward the vinegar for me, cuts the fat of the pork and cream of the slaw nicely, when used in moderation.  The slaw itself is average on it's own, but provide nice balance in the sandwich.  The caramelized onions add the right touch to the finish.  The bun is good, but would be better if more of my sandwich stayed in it. (EDIT: On my next trip, I kept the sandwich partially wrapped.  Success!) . . Sadly, the pastrami misses the mark.  The meat is slightly too peppered, and way too fatty.  The texture is not very nice.  Skip it, and go to Langers.. . Parking and seating are both ample, especially on a nice day, when you can take advantage of the outdoor seating.  . . Worth a try, and worth going back.
