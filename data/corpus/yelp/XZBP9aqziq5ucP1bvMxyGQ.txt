So after hearing the hype, I finally made my way here. . . The beer selection: Awesome! If they carry Russian River's Pliny the Elder, then they must be good. I tried a few others (mostly Belgians) based on the bartender's recommendations, and they did not  fail.. . Office Burger: It truly is one of the better burgers I've ever had. Very juicy patty that was complimented by the sweet caramelized onions. And balancing out that rich, sweet taste were the gruyere cheese and arugula salad, thus giving it a bitter tang. Definitely a complex burger that was a lot of fun (I paired it with Pliny).. . Sweet Potato Fries: Although served in a very Crate and Barrel looking shopping cart, they were very delicious. Very crunchy and not overly sweet like I've had at other places. It also kept it's crisp texture  throughout my entire dinner, fries rarely are able to do that. Went well with the aioli they served with it. . . Regular Fries: Definitely not worth the try. They seemed limp with not too much taste.  Definitely opt for the sweet potato fries if you can. This was also served with a good aioli, but it was not able to save the day.. . Bone Marrow: Definitely something to try if you haven't had before. I've had it a few times and it's always the same, fatty goodness scooped out of a hot bone onto a baked, buttered crostini then sprinkled with parsley or salt. I will say these were smaller than the ones I've had before, but still good. . . Service: Everyone seems friendly but very busy. I was lucky to beat the rush, but once it started it became quite the wait to get help. Not improving the situation were all the first-timers asking a million questions about everything on the menu. So my advice is to get there early, order quick and don't be afraid to try some atypical bar food.
