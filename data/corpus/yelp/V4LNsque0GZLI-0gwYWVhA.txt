Everyone loves Chinese food because, if you go with a group, you can try a little bit of everyone's dishes. But whenever I eat here, I really don't want to share with anyone. One of their downfalls, to me at least, is that the menu was not quite as extensive as I would have liked, but you'll get used to it and you'll definitely find something you'll like. Huge fan of the chicken and forest mushroom stir-fry. I'll eat anything with asparagus, though. Speaking of, their beef and asparagus is unreal. I need to go back asap.
