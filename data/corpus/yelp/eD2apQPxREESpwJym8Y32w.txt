Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Just the sheer number of reviews of Pink's is a testament to how famous this place is.  This hot dog stand is historic, and oozes character.  Even if the food isn't exactly what you're looking for, it's still an experience that should be had by all.  Even into the wee hours of the night, this place still has a long line...and it's by all means worth waiting in.. . I knew I was in the right place when the old guy in front of me told me he'd been eating here since he was 14, so that's what, 95 years of hot dogs? :). . I ordered the Ozzy Dog which was piled high with toppings and it was flat out amazing.  I wish I visited LA more frequently so I could try more of their menu.
