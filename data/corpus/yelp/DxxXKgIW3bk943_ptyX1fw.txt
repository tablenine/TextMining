LOVE the sunshine salad!  The first time I did take out here, they packed a huge salad into the small container.  The last time I ordered it, they weren't quite as generous with the portion, but it was still tasty.  I also really enjoyed the portobella mushroom burger.  It was quite tasty with the red onion and aioli.  This place is a little bit pricey for lunchtime, but when price is no option (i.e., when work is paying), its my go-to restaurant for a great lunch when I'm up in Rogers Park.
