Restaurant: Cameli&#39;s Gourmet Pizza Joint
Category: Pizza
Proximity alone justifies my regular attendance at Cameli's, but I don't think there is another pizza place I would prefer in walking distance. It's never too busy, it's comfortable, and it's consistent. I have the same waitress 90% of the time, and the Karaoke is low key and enjoyable.. . I've tried a good portion of the menu, but I usually wish I would have stuck with the slice. Topping aside, I would rate their food in the following order:. . 1. Monster Slice. 2. Panini. 3. Pizza Luna. 4. Salad. . One recommendation would be an improvement in arcade choices. Add Big Game Hunter, and I'll increase my attendance by 2x.
