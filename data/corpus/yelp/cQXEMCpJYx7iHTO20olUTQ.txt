I wish I could give this place five stars, as the food was amazing and very reasonably priced. However, I've never dealt with a worse restaurant for seating arrangements. This place is PACKED. You'll be squeezing your way between tables to be seated as if you're at some middle-school cafeteria. We placed reservations weeks in advance, only to be seated twenty minutes AFTER our reservation time, even though we arrived twenty minutes BEFORE. Once seated, it was absolutely impossible to have a conversation with my girlfriend seated across the table. We just wanted to eat and get out of there ASAP, which I'm assuming is the intent. Also, the waitress was incredibly rude.. . It's a pity, because I must reiterate that the food was excellent. We had the caprese salad, the meat-lovers pizza, salumi salami, and the pizza with prosciutto/rucola. All of it was excellent.. . Still, such a disappointing dining experience for such great food.
