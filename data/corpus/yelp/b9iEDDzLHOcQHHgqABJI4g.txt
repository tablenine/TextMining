Restaurant: Fellini&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
Have been to this Fellini's several times and their pizza is better than the Buckhead locations. I always have to ask for extra sauce on the side, since I feel they don't add enough initially. Â Stick with the thin crust, my friend got a slice of the thicker crust and it was....ummm, just not that good. . . Service is excellent and freindly.
