My wife and I went here for dinner tonight.  The sweet tea is very good, as others have mentioned (tastes like there's some rose syrup in there, maybe).  The falafel was very impressive -- crunchy and browned on the outside, with great chickpea-herb dough inside.  The hot sauce really was hot, and she reports that the grilled chicken kebabs were tasty.  We managed to finish an order of the oven potatoes between us -- not for any fault in the food (to the contrary, they were little nuggets of soft creamy potato jacketed in thin crispy exteriors), but because you get so darn much of it for $2.29!. . Our cat turned her nose up at the one piece of leftover chicken kebab, but cats are like that.
