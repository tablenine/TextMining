Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
I've passed by here quite a bit and finally decided to venture in this afternoon. I've always liked the fist on the outside, and once in awhile (when I'm drunk) I think it's amusing to yell, "STELLAAAAA," as I'm passing by. So, yes...a visit was a must.. . Reasonable prices and excellent food. Stella's was very packed at around 1pm on a Sunday...but service was still very efficient and personable. I was impressed....and the place looked clean too.. . I like the comic-book art that's spread throughout the restaurant, as it adds a little something to help differentiate this place from other nearby diners.. . Get the blueberry pancakes. Very awesome --- lots of berries. I would skip the bananas next time because they filled me up and prevented me from coming anywhere close to finishing my meal. Yep...blame it on the bananas.
