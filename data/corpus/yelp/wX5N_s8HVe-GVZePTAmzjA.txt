Maybe it's because we went at 11 am on a tuesday morning, but the service was quick, friendly and over all pretty okay. Grilled Chicken Sandwich, - grated hard boiled egg + Avocado. Good freakin sammy. The goat cheese made it a touch too rich for 11am, but i enjoyed it again 5 hours later. Will return...hopefully not to the crowds everyone else seems to talk about.
