The owners of La Casita in EAV have expanded to Decatur with El Tesoro, and it was an excellent move on their part.  This place is a little more upscale than La Casita, and serves tacos a la carte and full meals.  We started with the brisket taco and the duck taco.  The brisket is served with a red mole, so the taco is delicious and messy.  The duck taco was good too.  For the full meal we shard the pork carnitas.  They had really excellent flavoring, which was especially crucial since they used a very lean cut of pork.  The best part of the meal, however, might have been the salsas.  They have a red salsa that had a heavy touch of heat, and a tomitallio salsa that was freaking awesome.  I never knew I could get so excited about salsa. Salsa!  Finally, the most importnat part of the meal-- alcohol.  They have a full bar, and the beer selection is adequate and interesting.  The margaritas range from classic flavors to a ginger infused margarita.  I had the ginger one, and loved it.  The bartenders were knowledgable and friendly.  The space is decorated in lots of warm colors, interesting folk-y Mexican knick-knacks, and lots of nooks and crannies to have an intimate dinner.
