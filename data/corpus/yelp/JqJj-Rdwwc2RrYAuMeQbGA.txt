Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I get cravings for their French Toast stuffed with mascarpone cheese and with mixed berries on top.  It is absolutely delicious.  DE-LI-CIOUS.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's the best brunch dish I've ever eaten.. . Previously, I'd tried the Eggs Benedict, and that was good too, but from here on out, the mascarpone toast is the only thing I can order.. . Yes, this place is small, and yes, you're going to have to wait outside until a table is available.  However, it's worth the wait, and a quick walk down the block for a pre-brunch drink at Starbucks makes the wait go by pretty quickly.
