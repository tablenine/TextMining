This is one of those places that would be a 10 if it weren't for the hipster trendy fucktards that go there because it's the new hotness.. . I love the look, the feel, the location, the size, and the attitude at this place, with the exception of the preppy's that ruin the place on such a regular basis.  Once the newness of this bar and grill wears off it shall settle in to being a really really nice place to take a man-bud to let him vent to you about his terrible work conditions.. . The burgers here are fantabulously stellar, and the fries are legendary.  The brews they pour are cold and refreshing, and the bar isn't quite old enough to get that skunky taste in the taps just yet.  Enjoy it while you can, kids ;). . I will again suggest this place on weeknights because the weekend nights are going to be filled with the latest and greatest in frat-boy technology and obnoxious drinking.  Of course there is the 20-something tail that comes in with these frat boys, so it's love hate.  Still, stick with the weeknights and call your own 20-something hottie to come join you.
