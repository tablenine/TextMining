Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
this used to be my favorite japanese sushi restaurant back in the day a few years ago.  i had stopped going when i heard from my sis (who was the initial person that tipped me off on this place) that it wasn't as good as it used to be.  well, also,  it wasn't just on her word, but also cuz it was so freaking far from where i used to live and it wasn't as accessible as it is now.  . . well, when i went back this last weekend i was surprised it was still open and going strong as it was last time i was there.  the fish isn't as good as i remembered it, but the dynamite is still hands down the best i've ever had.  not too mayo-ey, and the scallops are biiiiig.  i remember when i took my friend one time i had to stop him from licking the dish.......only because i wanted to! gosh darnit that's good stuff.... . . oh yeah - but the glasses of water tasted like, "what i would imagine toilet water to taste like" per my friend.  "sure Arthur.  what it WOULD taste like.....uhuh.". . i'll definitely go back though if not for the toilet water, but for the dynomiiiiiiiite
