This review is only for the ******Macarons***. . I came here on Memorial Weekend-Sunday Afternoon, was able to find a parking space steps away from the entrance. . ************************************************** ***********. ************Meters seem to be free on Sundays only... ************************************************** ***********. . It's a very spacious and cavernous place inside, showered in whiteness.  Very trendy!  Their dessert counter is in the front and very large.  They only have a selection of 6 flavors of macarons, it seems on any occasion.   My sister and I opted for the $9 packs, 2 of them.  These are more expensive than either the EuroPanes or the Pauline's. . Verdict: Macarons here are "nice"  They lack the punch of flavor of the EuroPane and the polish of the Pauline's.  The package is very nice, but, I would have hoped for a little more, even, if the package is nice..  Style without the Substance to back it up...  I guess, you can say I was let down, or felt misled by the "pretty packaging."  Humm, does it sound like I am talking about food?  or dating?  ^_^. . Verdict: Pass.. on the macarons with the pretty packaging; also, I have heard that the parking is rather bad in this area of Downtown, also, be careful of vagrants and the such in this area.. . Sorry... No fireworks here, please move along...
