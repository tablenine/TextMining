Food was okay. Portions were a little small. Crowded as all heck. Service was decent. Vanilla gelato w/ espresso was awesome. Macaroons were nasty and overpriced. Â . . Way too loud. . . Was definitely a new experience ,and a great evening with friends but will not be returning. EVER. . . Go here if you can get there early, and have never been.
