Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Canter's is a vintage delicatessen in the heart of Los Angeles. A friendly serving staff with a classic sandwich/diner menu that will almost overwhelm you once it is opened. . . The good thing is that everything on the menu will bring your tummy to full hunger, even if you had eaten a big meal not too long before settling at Canter's. Glancing the menu from left to right, you'll see dishes such as Corned Beef and Cabbage, Monte Cristo, a variety of sandwiches, meatloaf, soups, etc. The never ending menu makes you go, "Whoa, is there any other menu I've seen that's this insane (in a good way, of course)!?" . . I decided to try their pastrami/corned beef sandwich on rye bread and coleslaw. Delicious! I also got to try their meatloaf with mashed potatoes and boiled string beans. Very rich and creamy. It almost tasted like the food was carefully cooked in their kitchen with extra love and care; very yummy in the tummy! . . I give Canter's 5 stars for tastiness and 5 stars for good service. I would definitely visit again!
