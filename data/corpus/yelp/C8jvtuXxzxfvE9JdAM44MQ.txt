My boyfriend and I went here because Frontera Grill was closed and it looked good. The atmosphere was really nice but there was a 30 minute wait to be seated. We were hungry! So we sat in the bar, no one came to us so we ordered from the bar and they brought it over. The bar area itself consists of windows so it was very cold and we ended up moving table for that reason. I ordered the tangerine chicken because it sounded great and they were out of it. So, in place of that I got the cherry-Chili chicken and it was gross fried chicken with gross sauce, it never said in the menu it was breaded. My boyfriend got 7 flavor chicken and I also was nothing special. The entrees took a very long time to come out. In total, we spent about an hour and 45 minutes there (not by choice). . . The pot stickers and crab Rangoon chop sticks were essentially just items no better then what you can find in the frozen section at the grocery store. The only good thing I ate was the fried calamari. I would definitely not go back.
