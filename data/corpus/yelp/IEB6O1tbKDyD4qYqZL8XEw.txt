I meet with a group of friends every Monday that insist on going here....why???? I get sick EVERY time I eat the food...everything is loaded with salt. Now I'm just reduced to eating the fries or the blintzes...BUT I still feel like crap afterwards. I gave it two stars only because of the service and because it has parking.
