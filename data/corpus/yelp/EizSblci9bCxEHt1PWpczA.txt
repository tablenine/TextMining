I have been meaning to review since I go all the time.  I find that the eclectic collection of toys, clothes, soap, and food is an ideal combination  Someone bought the paparazzi action figures right out from under me ...  F!!  I also like that the clocks from around the world hanging on the wall are missing hands, dont have batteries, or are losing the grip on their maps.. . Anyway, I like vegan so this a great place for me.  They have a black bean burger that everyone must try...  it has this spicy chipotle mayo that is just fantastic, i wish it was sold in a jar.  They also have vegan chili and great coffee.  Everyone there is nice whether dine-in or to-go!  see you there!
