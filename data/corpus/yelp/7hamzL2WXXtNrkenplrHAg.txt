Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Somewhat decent pastrami. The day I went, it wasn't fatty enough. Yes, there is such a thing as too lean when it comes to a hot pastrami sand. . . They lost a star for their high prices. The Hat and The Varsity (q.v.) do it better for less.
