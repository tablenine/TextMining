Eventing Dinner at Bottega Louie. . On a random night downtown we decided to check out Bottega Louie. I was a little be suspicious of the all of the hype but I have to admit that I was very surprised and happy with the experience. . . The atmosphere reminds me of some of the Italian cafeterias I've been to. Clean, well lighted, with beautiful displays, well dressed patrons and a relaxed environment that is classy but not stuffy. . . The food was excellent and surprisingly well priced given the almost upscale atmosphere. Keep in mind that the family style portions are "European" family style portions, not American so you may need to order more than what you're expecting. I went with a group of five but I think each entre is better suited for 3 people or so. . . The service was excellent, friendly, attentive and relaxed. The servers knew the menu well despite only being open for a week and were engaging and unpretentious. . . Overall, excellent food, great atmosphere, friendly staff with good service. . . Bonus, much like at 7 Grand, the bartenders are genius' and know how to make a real drink. Personal favorite was a perfect Old Fashioned.
