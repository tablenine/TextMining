The view says it all... honestly this is the place that I thought I would take my parents when they were in town visiting, but the more times I ate here, the more I realized the bar is sufficient. No need to eat, just hit it up for drinks and conversation. . . The lowdown:. It costs $6 for valet (&amp; you have to valet), the food is over-priced, and the staff is all over the board. I've met the nicest of servers to the bitchiest of hostess', just depends on the day I guess. . . The highlights:. You can see the entire city from this spot. I prefer the view at night, but would recommend going in the early evening to catch a glimpse of the sun going down, and the lights of the city coming up. It's definitely worth the trip up the mountain to see this sight!. . Update: November 2006.... I just ate there with my family this past weekend... the food is much better than I remember from times past! We started with the 20-piece sushi box (favorites) and fried oysters with ginger sauce and wasabi cream (wow). Dad had the Grilled Seafood Platter, stepmom had the Miso Salmon, and I had the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna (damn). We finished with the Peanut Butter-Chocolate Chip Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich, Cheesecake, and Pumpkin Brulee (geez). I have never been so satisfied with a meal like this. We cleaned our plates... all of them, and it was oh so good. I retract what I said before... the food is worth it.
