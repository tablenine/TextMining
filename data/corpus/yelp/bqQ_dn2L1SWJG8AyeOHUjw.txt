Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I went on Saturday night. The place was packed. I really don't understand what's the big deal about this place. I ordered a small cheese pizza with pineapple.  It was too salty and the service was soooo slow! It took 45 minutes before I got my pizza. Seriously?!? . . Additionally, we were in the corner of the restaurant and the waitress failed to acknowledge my table or refill my drink until my pizza came out. It was ridiculous.  Very disappointed. Glad to hear that people love this place ... just not for me.
