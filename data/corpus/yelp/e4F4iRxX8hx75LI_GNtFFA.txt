Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
Probably the most authentic Thai food in Illinois besides my mom's kitchen! I love that they can please my knack for spicy food! I recommend this place to people that want good food. I love that they have Northern Thai cusine one the menu as my family hails from Laos, where sticky rice is a staple as jasmine rice is in Thailand. mmmm yummy! I think I'm going to go there now...
