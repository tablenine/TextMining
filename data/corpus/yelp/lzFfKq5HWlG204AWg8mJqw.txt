I give this place a 3 star rating...for now... I will definitely be back to this place to try out some more of the food that everyone recommends.. . The reason for my 3 star rating is either because the place was so overhyped by the time I got around to it that I found the place to be merely okay or I didn't actually have the time (or the stomach) to enjoy a full course meal.  Regardless, the last time I came we only ordered an artichoke chicken dish and the portebello fries.  I thought the chick was merely okay - it was a little bland for my tastes and a little dry (basically not as good as the lemon chicken served at Buca).  And as for the fries, well the waiter forgot about it until we asked him 20 minutes into the meal.  Thus by the times the fries came out I was already kind of full and found them to be okay.  As for the décor, well its very deceiving when you are walking by it, but the inside is very spacious with high ceilings and very cozy in the actual restaurant area.  I really liked how they have a section for pastries and desserts, a bar area, and another section as the dining area which has a view of the kitchen.  Plus, even though the place gets pretty packed at night, they got us a seat in a matter of minutes.
