You just can't believe this tiny food booth turns out to be one of the best taco stand in the town.  These are real mexican tacos that use the soft tortila shell instead of the cruncy one that we eat in Del-taco or taco bell.  This place does have a few of small tables and they are always full during lunch time for the local's munching.  It closes very early and closes on Sundays.
