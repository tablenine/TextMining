Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
I have to tell you this was quite an experience.  A good friend invited me to be their guest.  Had dinner in the restaurant, had an OK  NY steak and some killer friend Artichoke hearts.  Overall not the greatest culinary experience but wait...The Magic show and people watching made up for it!  So weird but a really fun experience.  It was wonderful to see men in suits and ladies in evening gowns enjoying an evening of magic.  You have to do it at least once in your life.  A surreal night.
