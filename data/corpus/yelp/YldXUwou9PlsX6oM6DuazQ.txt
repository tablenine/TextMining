The Allure Is "The Contest.". . As mentioned in some reviews, the allure is going for your picture on the wall for eating the spiciest hot ramen they make within 30 minutes.. . The ramen is decent and you have a few choices of broth and spice levels.  I prefer ramen on some days, but there is not much substance to the dish.  Also, there is an inconsistency to the spice levels depending upon the chef.  Despite ordering the same level of spiciness, it can vary quite a bit.. . The gyoza are a good accompaniment, but nothing special.  This is a place to go when it is convenient (ie - you're in the area) and you're in the mood.
