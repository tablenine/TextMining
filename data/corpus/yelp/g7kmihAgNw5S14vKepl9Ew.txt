Restaurant: Spoon
Category: Thai
Spoon is one of my fave Thai places in Atlanta! I came here last night before the Black Eyed Peas concert at Phillips. I thought the restaurant was very dark. It was hard to see our food. The candlelight at our table helped a little. . . Apps: . Basil rolls - 6 bite size rolls - yummy. Fried cream cheese rolls - didn't try it, but everyone else liked it . Tom Yum w/ tofu - fresh tasting broth . . Entrees: These are the entrees that I tried. . Pad Kee Meo - noodles in a basil sauce - very good . If you just order the noodles, that is basically all you get. So, I added veggies for $1 and tofu for $1. I thought it was odd that they didn't add the veggies in already, but oh well. . Green Curry - delish - it was spicy for my taste. Talapia - melt in your mouth good . Pad Thai - one of best pad thai that I've had . . Dessert - We went a little overboard on dessert! :) . chocolate caramel mousse with green tea ice cream- my fave . chocolate blueberry spring roll with coconut ice cream - coconut ice cream was good, wasn't a fan of the roll . sticky rice with some kind of tart, maybe apricot? (can't remember)- 2nd fave- sticky rice was really yummy. I probably could of eaten a bowl of it. . fried bananas with ice cream - I didn't try it . . Overall, the service was very good and the food was delicious! Â I've been here several times and it never disappoints me!
