I have to give this restaurant thumb up for the ambiance and interior decoration. It's pretty darn good. Aside from that, the food is not as good as their original restaurant (Thanh Long in SF). If you think SF is far, then you can give this place a try. I recommend the garlic noodle and roasted garlic crab.
