I went there last week for my buddy's Bday party.    Reservation for 12 people was a nightmare.  Thanks to American Express consierge service,   they made it happened at 730 instead of 10.   . . Dishes we ordered:  . Escargot (It's GREEN !!!!, but buttery and yummy). Bone marrow and oxtail jam  (sooooooo heavenly). Squid (uhmm.....only few pcs??). Duck confit (a little bit salty). Skate (yums! ). Coq au Vin (it's.....different). Sole (D-licious). Pork Belly (tender and tasty). Steak pomme frites (yums!!  mayo for the frites is sooo addicting). various different desert: creme brule, chocolate cake,  apple tart, etc etc (can't remmember). . Atmosfere was nice.   service was good and attentive.   Toilet is nice  (wtf...it's clean.    Don't you love clean toilet?)   . . Hey,   our server looks familiar.   hmmm...
