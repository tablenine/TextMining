Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Let me get a Lord of the Rings dog with a Yoo Hoo please.  A hot dog and a yoohoo, just bring me back to... the last time I was here at 1AM.  Yum!. .  Avoid anything with "guacamole" cause we all know that ain't guacamole they're squeezing on.  The onion rings are magnificent with their super crispy skin.  . . I miss you LA.  I know I'm up here in SF, but it's nothing personal.  It's only business baby.  I still love the sustenance you provide too.  . . Other things I love, but hate are the Burritos with Chili and hotdog in em.  I love it going down, but hate it otherwise.
