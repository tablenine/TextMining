Restaurant: Kogi

I asked my buddy Luke Whiteside, "Galbi Tacos?" and he said "OMG FUCK YES.". . And that is why Kogi is successful. A taco truck with Korean BBQ is universally intriguing, isn't it? . . So, I had previously read that the chef, Roy Choi, worked for Iron Chef Michiba as well as working at Le Bernadin in NYC, one of my most favorite restaurants ever. Thus, I actually had pretty high expectations for this little taco truck. Fortunately, my expectations were met! It's not just galbi on a tortilla. There was actually quite a bit of depth. It tasted fresh with veggies tossed in some sort of Asian vinagrette (like the salad served at KBBQ), hints of both sesame and Mexican flavors that I can't pinpoint but they were good! Nothing too overpowering. The meat was great. Galbi, predictably, was my favorite (perfectly caramelized) but everything was devoured quickly, even the tofu! (which should obviously be the most boring, but it's not.). . Honestly, even though everything was great, I really don't want to wait in line for an hour again. On the other hand, I want to go back and try their specials, like kimchi quesadilla! (Weird, right?) Maybe I can catch them on a slow night. Can't really see that happening any time soon, though.
