We went over  downtown this Sunday in order to check this place out.. We had to wait 20 minutes before we could be seated , since they were in transition for the dinner. While we waited, we checked out their counters, their bread display and their pastries. I was ready to order some for after the meal.. Finally we were seated and a very amicable waitress helped us out. We started with a pizza baked behind us in a "Digital" oven with open flames.. It was a good pizza. The main course  were mussels and clams and some pasta dish. The clams were delicious. The side of asparagus ordered was way over boiled and had lost all its crispiness.  (lightly steamed would have been better). Then the desserts..... Of the eclairs offered , I chose the pistachio one, and I also ordered 2 macarons. All apparently made in the restaurant (unlike the bread).. Although the eclair price ($2) was inexpensive, it was simply put horrible, with some kind of greenish topping. The macarons although were very colorful , which in itself was a bad indication. Was I right, they were so dry, and insipid. The decaf coffee was below average too.. Our waitress kindly discounted  our asparagus side from our tab.. This is a good place to go for lunch or before a concert or the opera. But this is definitively NOT a destination place.
