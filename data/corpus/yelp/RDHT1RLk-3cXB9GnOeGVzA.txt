Once a month I eat a burger. A real one- not turkey or veggie style.. This month I tried Oinkster. . Next month I'm going back.. Unfortunately I did not get to try the famous Ube shake- they ran out. But they did have a perfectly refreshing Mexi-Coke for me. And for about $6 (Oinkster Happy Hour- Mon through Fri!) my classic American meal was complete. . Bravo.
