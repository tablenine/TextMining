You know that kinda gross feeling you have after eating at McDonald's? I just had dinner at this place tonight and I've got that feeling, sans the cheap tasty convenience of fast food. Here it is: . . Shrimp and Cheese Grits: 2 problems: 1. the deep fried batter coating on the shrimp. deep fried batter on shrimp is NEVER good. 2. the cheese used was parmeggiano. why would you put this particular cheese with grits? I guess it's my own fault for trying it. . . Vegetable Soup: an over salted Progresso or Campbell's . . I will say two nice things: . 1. The waiter was nice and considerate enough to inform us that the dishes we were ordering contained pork, which most of the people at our table don't eat (it's not listed on the menu, but a lot of the items contain pork. i didnt thing to ask about a dish like shrimp and grits, so i'm glad he mentioned it). . 2. the honey butter served with the table bread was tasty.
