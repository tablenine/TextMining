Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
What was ordered: 1 umami burger, 2 truffle burgers, 1 So-cal burger, 2 hand cut fries, 1 sweet potato fries, 1 onion ring, two root beers, 1 beet salad, 1 root beer float... 4 people. It was a great meal.. . Out of that list:. . Must order - TRUFFLE BURGER!!! Get two for yourself. Hand cut fries (order two as well). Root beer... hella goot.. . So-so order - Onion rings. . NO order - So-Cal burger, Umami burger, sweet potato fries, beet salad.. . Or just figure it out yourself like I did... it's a lot more exciting that way.. . Note: everything was quite salty so drink lots of water. UMA-ME Again in a couple weeks.
