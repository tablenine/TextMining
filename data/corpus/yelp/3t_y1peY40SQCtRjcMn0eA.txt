Buyer Beware is my warning about this place. . . Dont get me wrong - the food was great and the beer was tasty - they had a good array of beers to choose from. I thought that on a Thursday night service would have been a bit more attentive (we were drinking after all), but it appeared that the servers were stretched pretty thin.. . I met a friend at this place and we kept talking not allowing us to actually make a choice for dinner. I got super hungry and asked the server what app would come out quickly and she said the guac and chips. My fellow diner was reluctant and the server offered to put some queso and salsa on there too. And so we agreed. . . When the bill came: . 1. The Guac and chips became Gauc and Chips (7.99), cheese sauce (1.00) and salsa (.50). Considering our server told me that the kitchen was backed up (thus we opted for something that would come out quickly), I thought this was pretty low. . . 2. My beer that I chose from the summer 2010 menu rang up as $6 . not $5 as it said on the menu. I asked the server about it, when she came back, she said there was an error on the computer and while its been on there for months, I was the first to bring it up. . . So I walked away feeling like this place was more focused on making money than repeat customer business. And, Â well, that's fine with me. There are plenty of other places that want my money.
