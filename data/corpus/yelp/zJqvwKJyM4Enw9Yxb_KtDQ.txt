Went on a Wednesday morning, there was no wait.  Food was tasty, not too greasy like your typical diner especially the ham and egg scramble.  There was nothing outstanding about the muffins.  The waffles were light, cooked to perfection and just enough with the eggs. The weekends gets real busy, so be prepared to wait and enjoy the breeze, nothing beats the fresh ocean breeze.. . Food Ordered: waffle and eggs with sausage, ham and egg scramble, hash browns, and muffins (blueberry and corn)
