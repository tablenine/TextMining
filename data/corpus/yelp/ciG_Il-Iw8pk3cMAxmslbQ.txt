I do miss this place! The garlic bread is soooo good and comes by the basket load - rolls sliced in half and brushed with an unhealthy dose of buttery sop!  . . Don't get the salmon, it's too dry. The breaded chicken is to Americanized. The lechon asado is tender and the calamari steak is Â one of my favorites along with the platanos. But the real treat is the Roasted Garlic Chicken, great for starters! Mmmmmmm!
