I really wasn't in the mood for sausages when my lady tried to talk me into going here, but when she said they had a huge selection of Belgium and German beers, I agreed to go. . . Glad I did, the bartenders were some of the nicest I have yet to deal with in Downtown and very knowledgeable. I will be back.
