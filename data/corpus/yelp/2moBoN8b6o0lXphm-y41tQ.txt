I think the novelty of this restaurant has worn off.  It used to be one of the best and most romantic places to have a date, but I felt as if I was in just another Japanese restaurant.  It definitely needs to be remodeled, the tables and chairs and floor look so old.  The carpaccio appetizer was delicious, but the sushi was average and the steak was below average tasting.  The view is good but not great because the parking lot is between the window and view.  You have to valet and it's a ridiculous $7.50 and the menu prices are expensive as well.  I suggest coming here for drinks only and sitting at the bar, then going to a better Japanese restaurant for food!
