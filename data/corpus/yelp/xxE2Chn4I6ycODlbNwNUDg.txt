One word..."heaven".  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it could get a bit pricey.  But you pay for quality, right?  Their food is by far one of the best veggie places around.  Their "veggie protein blends" are tasty and healthy.  Their "sweetheart fries" (sweet potato) were to die for and let's not forget their chipotle-ranch dressing!  Ralph, the cashier was great and recommended the Santa Fe Crispy Chickin' which I'm now in love with.  Attentive staff, quick service, "green" decor and a satisfying place for a quick healthy meal during your luch hour.
