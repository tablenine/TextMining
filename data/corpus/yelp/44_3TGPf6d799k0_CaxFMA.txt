too my mom and a friend there when she was in town. pretty decent price and overall not a bad place after a long day running around the city. they could use more light around that place though. . ordered Caesar salad its ok, i had the Tortelli di Mele it's suppose to be one of their house favorite. i think it was just ok, it was little too thick and it felt a little undercooked. the other 2 shared Linguine with chicken which was not bad. . overall food above average, place nice, service just average(only 1 or 2 server for the whole place i think) i travel to europe a lot so maybe my standard is a little harsh for this place.
