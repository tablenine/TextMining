I'll start with the negative things. Albeit, this restaurant is a landmark for me. I am not giving this place 5 stars because the service is not the best. The servers were just kickin' it while my water glass was empty. The restaurant wasn't even busy when I went--there was like 8 people total. Also, we asked, clearly, for the check AND box, but the dude did not bring a box. Maybe it was because he did not speak English well. Additionally, it might be hard to find close parking. It's not their fault, but I always factor this into my experience at a restaurant.. . I ordered the:. Alice's Egg Sandwich--pretty bomb, the bread was buttery goodness. Mac Daddy &amp; Cheese Balls--good and worthwhile, but would taste better if I was drunk. . Overall, the experience was good--the best part being the food. The food is the main reason this place gets the full 4 stars. Another positive thing is that this joint is open 24/7/365.. I'm happy I came at a non-busy hour and wouldn't mind coming here at a busy time like after a lounge to see how crackin' it gets.
