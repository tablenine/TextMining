I give this place 3.5 stars. This is based on the quality of the food and the price. This place is definitely overpriced.. . What is all the hype? True, LA doesn't have many authentic Italian restaurants. And my rating is based on my experiences in Italy and in SF's North Beach. But still, I beg to differ.. . Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? I'm sure that my main course doesn't deserve 5 stars b/c I can't remember what I had. But there are two things I remember: One is the octopus. My girlfriends and I all agreed that it was marinated and grilled to perfection. The second was my friend's complaint that the clams in her seafood pasta were too gritty. Did they not rinse or clean their clams thoroughly? I know that there's usually some sand in clams, but this amount was too much. . . Our waitress was really nice and attentive. The ambiance was nice--very romantic. But it bothered me that the entire menu was in Italian with no descriptions in English. That seemed really pretentious to me b/c 1) we're not in Italy and 2) most of the customers don't know Italian. And I hated asking the waitress to translate the entire menu for me. What a waste of time.. . Again, overall 3.5. Food was good but not spectacular. And the taste of the food was not commensurate with the price and the wait. I'm most likely not coming back.
