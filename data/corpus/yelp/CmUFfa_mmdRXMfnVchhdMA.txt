Restaurant: 123 Burger Shot Beer

Surprisingly, not a dive bar. The place still has that new bar feel with glowing flat panels and an actually clean bar. Prices are good, but it's not the hobo cheap experience one would think it is. . . $1 sliders are legitimately bite sized. Didn't try the $2 shots, but they're more appropriately $2 shooters - i.e. mixed candy drinks served in shot form. Though, I guess there's some novelty in asking for a "Blow Job" or a "Do Me Again". The $3 draught beers are probably the best deal. The cup isn't a true pint, but I feel like they are bigger than the $3 mini-bottles which I'm pretty sure is highway robbery.
