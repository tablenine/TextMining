Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Caution! How good Umami is depends on the location. LaBrea location was A+ (best burger in LA is Manly Burger to me); but Cahuenga location was awful. We ordered three burgers and each of them was almost raw. We threw them away. Attention Umami management - fire the cook at Cahuenga. Give a bounus to the cook at LaBrea.
