I wouldn't be stupid and go there again and. waste 50 bucks on infant size portions. . I went with a friend and we ordered 2 tiramiso drinks which were given to us in these itty bitty shot glasses that were then placed on these giant cylinder glasses. I guess they do this as a magnifying effect so you can tell there is an actual drink in front of you.  Rip off drinks were 6 bucks each we also ordered a split pea soup which was ice cold-weird amd ordered a grilled cheese sandwich that I ate in one bite. it was so small  my friend ran out off there she was so mad! I felt like I was in the twilight zone, u know that episode where giant people exist and everything is tiny.  Bottom line, u want to be ripped off and not eat alot of food and NOT get your moneys worth well then heck this plce is for you.
