Restaurant: Spacca Napoli
Category: Pizza
About a month back, a friend who had heard great things about Spacca Napoli wanted to check the place out, so we did.. . I'll start with the pizza, since that's really what we went for. I had the Quattro Formaggi, friend had the Salsiccia, I think. After trading bites, we decided I won at pizza. The sausage was good, but the four cheese was OUTSTANDING. There is no fight Gorgonzola can't win. Â Add Ementhal and Fontina? Pffffft. No contest. . . We also had the insalata mista, tiramisu, and gelati. All very, very good. I wholeheartedly recommend you go, for the Quattro Formaggi alone.. . Miscellaneous notes: . Friday night wait: an hour plus. It would have been longer, too, since a member of my party was delayed (her nana needed summat) and turned up five minutes after we were called, which earned us stink eye from the hostess and an immediate bumping back to the bottom of the list. I can understand being pushed down, but to the bottom? And the attitude? Yeesh. Lucky for us the owner took pity and demanded we get the next available table, anyway.. . Being in the owner's good favor is generally a boon in restaurant land, but here it seems to really make a difference. If not for his insistence, I would likely have been made to wait for my table an extra hour out of spite. As others have mentioned, when the place is packed and people are waiting, he's circulating, passing out samples of pizza (black truffle on our visit--incredibly good) and glasses of Prosecco. That sort of attention to customer comfort alone would have earned this place points with me, food quality be damned. Otherwise, waitstaff was efficient if not initially friendly, and could have lost this place points but for the owner's aggressively welcoming character.. . Go, appreciate the food, but be prepared to wait.
