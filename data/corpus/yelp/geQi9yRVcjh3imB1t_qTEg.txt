Hit-or-miss.. . Very delicious crab rangoon--for some reason it is better here than any other Thai restaurant I've ever been to.  The pad thai is either soooo delicious, or gummy, chewy, and overcooked.  . . Takeout is fast and the delivery guy (he's always been the same man...) is soooo awesome.  He's probably the happiest person I've ever met.  . . Good for cheap, fast lunch or inexpensive sit-down dinner.  BYOB, too!
