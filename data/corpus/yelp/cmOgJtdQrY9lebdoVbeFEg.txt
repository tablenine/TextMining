Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
As others have said before, this is the best pho in Chicago, without question.  I am very happy for the owners, who used to be at that small store front down on Argyle (which I think they may still have).  Their pho should rightfully make them millionaires.  Tank Pho kicks the crap out of the Chinese restaurant that used to be on that corner space.. . Goi cuon, #39, and an orange juice is the way to go.  Grab a couple banh mi across the street at Ba Le and call it a day.
