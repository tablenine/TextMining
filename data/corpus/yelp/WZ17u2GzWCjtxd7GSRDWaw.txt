Oh Porto's, I miss you so.  Without you, I would never have known that the combination of guava and cheese could wring tears of joy from my hardened heart.   One of my greatest memories of high school is how whenever there was a party (or any occasion at all, really) my friend Celia and her family would always have giant stacks of pink boxes from Porto's and the mouthwatering aromas of various meat-stuffed bread products would reduce me to despair as I tried in vain not to be incredibly rude and inhale massive quantities of their food.  I will say that if you go to Porto's intending to eat there instead of taking it home, good luck finding a table (despite the fact that the place is HUUUGE).  But I can't take away a star for that!  Porto's should probably get a 6th star for being SO CROWDED!  Because it's SO GOOD!
