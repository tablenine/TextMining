Went here Friday 1/15, to celebrate the better half's raise. Had cheese flatbread, asparagus, beef stroganoff, Moroccan lamb with cauliflower couscous, and lemon brulee tart. Terrific , sublime, delicious. Expensive given the smallish size portions? Sure. But preparation and flavor. Fabulous.. . My first time, even memorable the next day. A deal for $100? Pretty much.
