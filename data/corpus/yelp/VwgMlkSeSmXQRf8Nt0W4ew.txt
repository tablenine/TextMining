Category: American (Traditional)
WOW! For those of you who have given this or are about this restaurant poor ratings, PLEASE offer up some alternatives for better places to eat breakfast in ATL, because I have yet to experience a better place. . Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and The Flying Biscuit is one of my favorite places to satisfy my necessity for breakfast. . . My recent meals there have included the goat cheese and "all-meat" omelette. Both were outstanding. The grits are the BEST I've ever had. The biscuits are always warm, perfectly-cooked, and delicious. The turkey bacon is grade A. My girlfriend was nice enough to share some of her pancakes with me on our last visit and they are also very very good. Basically, its all good.. . I will say the bloody mary made with sake is pretty terrible. They need to nix that immediately. Stay away from ordering that. Go with a mimosa. . . Overall, this is one of my favs in Atlanta.
