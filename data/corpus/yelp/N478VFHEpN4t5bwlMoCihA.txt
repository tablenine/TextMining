This very quant little place is great, especially on the weekdays when there are less people. The food is fantastic, offering a large quantity of fresh food at a very decent price. The Eggs Benedict is said to be the best in the city there, and it is by far the best that I have had. The kitchen is open to view and the cooks are working hard, putting food up quickly. The owner of the place is usually working the window in the kitchen on the weekends making sure the food is out quick. The tables are turned rather quickly and every wait seems pretty short and always worth it!. Clean. Great food. Diverse menu. Quick to turn tables. Well priced. Huge portions. BYO
