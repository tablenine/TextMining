BEWARE!!! I brought my Mom (visiting from NY) to this restaurant in hopes of an authentic French bistro meal. Â What we got was an average menu, disappointing wine list featuring nearly all Domestic wines (ironic for a French restaurant), disorganized service and most importantly SPOILED food. We both ordered the crispy skate and it tasted like ammonia. After bringing it to the server's attention, he brought us the duck confit but it was almost 45 mins later when our 3rd guest had nearly finished his meal AND we still couldn't shake off the nasty taste of the fish. Need I mention the wanna-be crowd who seemed more concerned with "being seen" than taking interest in the food. Definitely not worth the trip or the money. Highly disappointing!
