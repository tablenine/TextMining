Food was good, but overall not a great experience.  It is a BYOB, but if they are crowded you feel forced to pound a bottle of wine so they can sit more people.  Our food came out immediately and I don't even think I had taken a sip of the bottle that we had just opened.  Also, there were no side plates to split up the food.  We had to eat out of just one bowl that each of us got.  Would only go back for takeout and probably not even that considering it isn't close to where I live.
