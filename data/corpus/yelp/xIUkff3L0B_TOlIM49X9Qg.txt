Restaurant: Buona Terra
Category: Italian
I have found my first wonderful Italian neigborhood restaurant.. . Buona Terra is a fabulous budget-oriented place. I came here last Sunday for dinner and spent under $40. Don't expect the most polished service. Just bring your appetite.. . I recommend the grilled calamari salad and the Spaghetti al Gamberetti--spaghetti pasta with rock shrimp, spinach, fresh tomatoes, olive oil and garlic. . . The portions are generous and the flavors are loaded with garlic so beware. The bread comes with an amazing vinaigrette of grated parmesan, roasted sweet garlic, and olive oil. You'll eat so much bread! I was looking for other ways to utilize this sauce. . . The tiramisu is one creamy alcohol soaked sponge of heavenly goodness. House vino by the glass is $5. I wish Buona Terra was across the street from me.. . Bucktown just earned one very good reason for me to move there.
