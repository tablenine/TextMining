Nothing overly special here. Slightly trendy, slightly pricey, but bottom line is the food was very good. We sat at the bar and ordered some oysters and a Singapore chili crab. I grew up in Singapore so of course it doesn't compare to eating crab at a hawker stall but, it was very tasty and worth all that work getting through the whole thing! They make good drinks too and the bar is lined with baskets of fruit which they use in all their cocktails. Plus, we got a free tangerine margarita. Fresh!
