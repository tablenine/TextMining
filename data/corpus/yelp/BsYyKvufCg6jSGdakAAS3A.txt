I really wanted to like this place.  It's in my hood, I love tacos, I love ahi and margaritas... what could go wrong?  But it was just blah.  Bland.  I shouldn't be pouring hot sauce on everything just so I can eat it.  . The decor was cute, the margaritas were good, but the food was pretty bland.  I was especially disappointed with the ahi tacos, as they seemed to have no flavor at all.  The quality of the fish itself was good, but they didn't do anything with it-- quite a waste.
