This is a solid 3 1/2 star review.. . I enjoyed the food, but found it to be a little over-priced for what you get.  The service wasn't the most attentive, but when I've gone, I have been incredibly hungover so I didn't really care.  . . I've gotten the buckwheat savory ratatouille crepes and the quality hasn't disappointed.  But the prices were a little surprising and I don't think justified.  . . It's almost always crowded, and the quarters are pretty close, the decor hasn't been redone in ages, which I suppose is part of the charm.
