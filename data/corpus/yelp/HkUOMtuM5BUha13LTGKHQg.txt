The service was miserable.  It seemed the waitress was more interested in getting piggyback rides than processing my credit card.  The environment is pretty cool, and it looks like the people at the bar are all enjoying themselves.  The food is pretty good.  My order of onion rings came with exactly 7 rings, and they seemed a little overfried, but the patty melt was good.  I'm still on my quest for the best burger in Atlanta, but I don't think I've found it yet.
