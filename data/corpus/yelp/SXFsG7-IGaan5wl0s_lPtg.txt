Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
My Fiance and I took a trip to LA this past weekend to celebrate my birthday and I was determined to get some of that World Famous Roscoes Chicken &amp; Waffles before I left. And surely, we did just that. We got the #4: 1/2 chicken &amp; Waffles with Onion &amp; Gravy! Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. I savored every bite till the very end. It was divine! I want to go back just to go eat at this place! Parking is kinda limited, but when we went, the lot wasn't too full. It's funny because it's right next door to the KFC and the taste BEATS KFC by 10,000 miles! The service was great when we visited this location. We got our food to-go, but next time we really need to sit down and have a meal here, because trying to eat Roscoe's on the road, is not such a good idea, especially with gravy &amp; syrup! HAHAHA I love this place, and have become a huge fan after one taste! I would recommend it to everyone and anyone. If you visit LA county and do not try this place, you are missing out! BIG TIME!
