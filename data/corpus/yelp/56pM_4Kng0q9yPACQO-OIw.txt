This is it!! The best French-dipped sandwiches...anywhere!!  Cole's is pretty good but Philippe's is on a level all on its own.  The history is rich and all the Lady Carver's are very nice, especially the tall, Russian? lady.  She's real friendly and has a great sense of humor.  She always spots me and my wife....."you guys are here.......again?"  Thank God for Philippe's!!!
