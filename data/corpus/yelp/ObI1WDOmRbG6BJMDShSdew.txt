Restaurant: Mr. Pizza
Category: Pizza
Korean pizza has never really been my thing. When I was 13 and irritatingly bratty about trying unfamiliar kinds of food, I went to a Korean restaurant in Chicago with my family and some family friends. I reluctantly tried some concoction involving squid and kimchi, and promptly threw up all over the table. Ever since then, I've avoided non-Korean BBQ Korean food like the plague.. . Long story short, my review is obviously pretty biased. I thought the food was decent. Like everyone else has said, the potato gold (potato, bacon, green peppers, onion, sour cream?, and sweet potato in the crust) is the signature pizza. We tried it and the bulgogi pizza. Both tasted pretty similar to me, but what do I know? I have to give the restaurant points for for ambiance and service, though. We went on a Friday night and it was pretty busy, but we were seated and served quickly.. . Parking is valet and behind the restaurant; make sure you get validation before you leave.
