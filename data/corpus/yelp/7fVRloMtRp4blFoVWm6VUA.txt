Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Came here randomly one night with a few friends, one of them said it was a good burger restaurant so why not sample a taste of LA?. . -Interior. A small restaurant overall, seating indoors maybe for 30 and another 30 outdoors. They have valet parking for $2 or you can try to find street parking. Can't comment much more on the decor inside because we sat outside, which on that night was on the sidewalk.. . -Service. Supposedly bad service here but my experience here wasn't bad, considering we sat outdoors, out of sight of the workers. Throughout the night they kept wandering about to make sure everything was alright. We didn't wait too long for our food to come out, the side orders also came out at the same time, we had to ask for the side sauce you get when you order a burger though.. . -Food. I got the manly burger which was delicious and very oily, you can see it glistening on the bun. I thoroughly enjoyed each bite knowing that it's going to come back to haunt me at the gym. We each got the side order of fries but I wouldn't say it was worth it, steak cut fries in a small bowl with a spoon full of ketchup. The side sauce I got was the spicy one, which tasted like something you would find at an Asian restaurant that has those jalapeno and pepper condiments. If you don't mind having stinky breath for the rest of the night I would recommend the garlic aioli.. . Overall I would recommend this place to a friend who was in the area and wanted to try a good burger, kind of pricey but it's worth a try. If you're extremely hungry then you might want to skip this place because the burger isn't big since they go quality over quantity here.
