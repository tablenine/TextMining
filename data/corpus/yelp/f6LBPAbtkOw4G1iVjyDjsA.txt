Restaurant: LA Mill Coffee Boutique
Category: Desserts
I been looking for a good coffee shop that's not as busy as Intelligentsia, where I can rub elbows with coffee snobs and other Macbook hipsters (geeks).  So I came across LA Mill on Yelp and decided to try it out.  This place is very chic, spacious, and adorably decorated with comfortable chairs and booths.  Their food is definitely pricey, I wouldn't come here hungry.  I tried the ABLT panini and it wasn't so great, but I think their coffee is worth every penny.  I love their cappucino, it turns my sandwich-and-a-drink meal-with-free-wifi into an amazing experience.
