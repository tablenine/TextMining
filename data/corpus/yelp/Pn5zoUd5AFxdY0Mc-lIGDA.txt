Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
FIVE STARS because omg, we saw Spender and Heidi from The Hills here OMG LOL.. . Okay, for reals. I'm always hesitant when it comes to restaurants in the Beverly Hills area because that whole neighborhood is full of horrible drivers, annoying tourists and snobby shoppers. . . But the service and food at Cut was unbelievably nice. Most of us ordered the steak, all of which was melt-in-your-mouth-to-die-for and a friend ordered the lobster, but I was too busy snorting up lines of steak that I didn't try any of it.. . Our sides and desserts and appetizers--seriously, nothing was wrong with it! Except for maybe having to see Heidi and Spencer but what can you do? They won't stop following me around.. . Seriously, though. This was well worth the bill, and not even as expensive as I thought it would be. Take your parents here when they come to visit, or you just want to gnaw on some delicious red meat.
