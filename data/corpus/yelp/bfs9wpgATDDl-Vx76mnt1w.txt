After moving to the Marina, it's a bit hard to get myself to drive over to Hide and risk waiting an hour with no rezzo, so I've had to find another casual, inexpensive, sushi joint whenever I want no frills and just a fantastic piece of fish.. . Sakura gives you giant cuts...borderline too big!  The fish is extremely fresh and offered at a great price.  Rolls are basic.  Then there's traditional Japanese meals (teriyaki, cod, mackeral, collar, tempura, etc).  Service is decent and when it lacks, receiving your giant portion of fresh fish will make up for it all.
