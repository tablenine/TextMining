Disappointed. Never surprised.  Whomever gave 4  and 5 star reviews to this place has either A) Never traveled or B) Has never been properly introduced to food. . . Real Food Daily is no way to live.  I'm not vegan and not ripping on Vegans.  Whatever makes you happy.  I'm just saying that not only would I conclude after 6 visits that the food isn't good,  I just couldn't eat more than a few bites of anything, since it was as exciting as moistened cardboard.   It's also expensive.  Also, the staff has apparently been trained to believe that honey bees are animals, and not insects. . . Want to experience food?  Real alive amazing food?. RAW - in Santa Monica.
