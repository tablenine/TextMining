The service was very good but the food was just average.  Everything seemed to be too salty.  We ordered the Mozzarella Tasting.  The 3 different mozzarella cheeses were pretty good, but the toasted bread that came with the dish was absolutely over salted!  We also ordered the  Fried potatoes with rosemary, and again it was way too salty.  Our regular dishes that we ordered were okay.  Maybe we went on an off night... but my fiance and I were definitely not impressed.  Would not go again.
