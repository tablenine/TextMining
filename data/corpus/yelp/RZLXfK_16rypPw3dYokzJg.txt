I had been stalking this place when I first heard it was coming to the neighborhood, anxiously awaiting a close place to get my noodle fix.  I believe I was the 2nd or 3rd customer to walk through the door right after it opened on Day One, so I'm proud to say I've been coming here since the very beginning.  The dawning of a new era, if you will (at least in this neck of the woods).  So do I like the place?  Let's just say I ate there three times within the first four days it was open.  My wife couldn't get me to shut up about the place until she was able to come with me and see what all the fuss was about.  . . I've tried just about everything on the menu, and it's all good. Not good in a just-throw-some-noodles-in-a-bowl-and-wow-it's-so- cheap kind of way (e.g. Penny's or any noodle place in Chinatown), but more in a holy-crap-where-have-you-been-my-whole-life kind of way. The flavors and combinations are vivid and imaginative, and aren't what you'd normally expect with a place with counter service. And actually the counter service aspect lends to the charm of this place -- it's cozy yet bustling, busy yet efficient. We've taken countless people here, and all have loved this place. Now keep in mind that good food doesn't come cheap. Even though they do primarily focus on noodles, you can expect to spend anywhere from $10-15 per person depending on how hungry you are or how much you want to try. The BYOB policy does help offset that though. It's a great place to come with a small group, though it's not conducive to lingering after your meal is done, unless you're there at a slower time. Definitely one of my favorites!
