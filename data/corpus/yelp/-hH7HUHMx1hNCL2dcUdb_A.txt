I realized I never had real ramen before until I came to this ramen establishment located in Little Tokyo.  This area in itself brings back fond college memories, especially at the Japanese Garden Parking Structure.  But I digress.  I always get the ramen with the Kotteri broth.  Also, a side of gyoza which is to die for.  They give you a generous sprinkling of scallions over the gyoza, and I happen to give myself generous sprinklings of scallions all over my salads, chicken, fish, etc. when I cook so this was great.  Always a wait.  The ramen and the broth itself is to die for.  Rich and full of flavor in every spoonful.  MMMMMM my mouth is watering...
