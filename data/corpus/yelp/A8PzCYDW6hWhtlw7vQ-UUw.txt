Restaurant: Medici On 57th
Category: Bakeries
The other weekend I took a nice 30+ mile bike ride from Lakeview to Hyde Park and back.  While cruising the streets of Hyde Park I saw the outdoor patio of Medici on 57th and decided to stop by for a quick lunch.  I was immediately seated by a friendly waitress.  The service was quick and friendly, and the chicken breast sandwich I had for lunch was delicious.  If I lived in Hyde Park I would be sure to frequent Medici.
