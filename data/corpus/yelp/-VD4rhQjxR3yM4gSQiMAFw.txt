Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
Savoy's cuisine is like Asian fusion soul food - a blend of Asian and European influences that leaves both your stomach and wallet full. . . The Hainam chicken is cheap, simple, and the best all around. Depending on what you order, they may give you free pizza bread. If I'm feeling adventurous, I also order the buttery garlic escargots as an appetizer.
