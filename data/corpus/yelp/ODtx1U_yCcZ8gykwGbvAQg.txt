Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Other than MANDARIN DELI restaurant, I guess Din Tai Fung is the first real dumpling house I've been to, which was just last week. Overall, the food was pretty good. We ordered the house specials juicy pork dumplings, pork and crab dumplings, pork chop noodle soup, noodles w/ sesame peanut sauce, and red bean dumpling dessert. Although it's not the tastiest food ever, it's still a step above many other americanized Chinese restaurants due to Din Tai Fung's authentic style of cooking, along with their freshly made dumplings that has a taste like no other. I suggest you all try it at least once, since fresh made dumplings are really an experience that you can't get in many places in LA.
