Maybe it was all the hype that surrounds it that raise my expectation to a level that just was not realistic.... . but.... . I felt it was completely overrated.. . I had the short rib taco which was good, but then again... you can never go wrong with Korean short ribs... although, I could have made my own ribs and stuck them in a tortilla and put a measly little sprinkle of lettuce on it myself.... . The spicy pork taco wasn't that good to me.... . The calamari taco... I always read that it's sold out so I assume it's amazing... I couldn't finish it... I thought it was gross... It was so sweet it could have been dessert.... . The black jack quesadilla was the best thing I had... it was really tasty and flavorful... but not worth a 1 hour wait.... . So sorry... I really wanted to be blown away... . . :(
