I love Pho and this place has an A health rating, is friendly, clean, cheap with super fast service. I love that the Pho comes with Basil, Bean Sprouts, Shadow Beni (a favorite herb of mine from Trinidad), lime and jalape√±o. Our waiters are helpful and the customization process is so much fun. . . A squirt of Oyster Sauce, couple squirts of Sriracha sauce, lots of greens and no sprouts please. I can make my Pho JUST HOW I LOVE IT. For $6.95 plus my Sour Sop bubble smoothie, and Spring rolls (with rice paper not the nasty fried thingies) that are REAL spring rolls. Man, I'm in unfried heaven. I'd go everyday if it were closer to home. After meal, stop by for coffee at MTV.
