Came here last night just because it was 50% off. The result?. . I wasn't expecting much to begin with since it's a lounge etc, but I was at least expecting the standards of sushi roku, koi, or katsuya.. But nope.. . The vibe is cool, I'll give you that. It would've been a nice place for a date. If only the food was decent. The food? . 1. Overpriced.. 2. There was a bone in my toro sashimi. A BONE! That's a taboo for sushi chefs!. 3. The $46 kobe beef is so not worth it. Doesn't taste like kobe beef at all. This just reminds me how awesome CUT is .... . $105 for 2 people, that's after 50% off (18% gratuity included).. Even at 50% off it was not worth it.
