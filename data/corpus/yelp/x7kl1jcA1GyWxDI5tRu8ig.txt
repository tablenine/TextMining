Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
I've been to Daikokuya about 6-7 times these past two months, and every visit was worth it. Their ramen is the best I've had so far. . . Try the ramen with a Calpico soda, and 10 bucks should cover tax and tip.. . I've also tried the fried rice combinations and all that, but the ramen is filling enough. The other stuff here is nothing to rave about. Just order the ramen. :). . Be prepared for a 15-20min wait at night.. . Go during the day! You can walk off your full stomach, visiting the shops in little tokyo. Visit the anime figure store. Grab some gelato or mochi ice cream. Take weird pictures at the wanna-be Stonehenge thing outside the community center. Visit Nijiya Market and grab a Nigori Sake for the night. Perfect day.. . *edit - Last two visits, the broth tasted totally different. It was BAD. I think sometimes they screw up on the broth. minus one star from the 5.
