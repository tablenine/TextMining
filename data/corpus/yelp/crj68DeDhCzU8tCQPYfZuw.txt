so i didn't like ramen because it always had a funny taste to me. that is until i had daikokuya. no funny taste! i really like their ramen! although it is the same as the soup ramen, my favorite is the dry summer version of the ramen with the little bowl of soup. their ramen is very flavorful and portions are big. gyoza is good too. if it turned me into a ramen lover, it's THAT good. =P. . get there early since there is almost always a long wait.
