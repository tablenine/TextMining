I really don't know what people are talking about when they say the quality of the meat is poor or below average.  I thought it was just fine.  The meat is no different than all the other places I've been to for similar prices.  Heck, if you're expecting slices of rib-eye or filet mignon, then go buy it at the store and cook it yourself.. . The flavor of the meat is quite good, especially the bulgogi.  The selection of the meats is reasonable so I really can't complain.. . The service was decent.  You have a button to push if you want them to come by.  Otherwise, they don't come by all too often.. . I usually go to these places (all you can eat places) with a bunch of guys so I don't feel like a loner when stuffing my face.  It's a good thing I have friends that are pigs.
