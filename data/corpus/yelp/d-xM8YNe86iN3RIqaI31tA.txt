Love this place. . . Really cozy and intimate, it would be a great "date place." It's low-key with a good selection of wines and snacks, and it's reasonably priced with wines starting at $6.50, and little dessert plates for $1.50 (I recommend the chocolate bruschetta). . . Service is wonderful, and they are very helpful with recommendations on the wine. Nothing bad to say about Krog Bar!
