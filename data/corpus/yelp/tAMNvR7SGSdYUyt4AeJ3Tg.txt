The space is great and I wanted to love the food.  I preferred the sausages over the fries, although I like Alpine Village sausages more.  The fries were very good but not great.  To be more authentic (Belgium or Holland) they need to be larger, more uniform and hand cut.  They should puff on the second frying.  It might be a potato varietal or oil issue.  The two ketschups (curry &amp; chipotle) were tasty - the peanut sauce was lacking - they need to replicate a sate sauce from an indonesian or thai restaurant - something over on Motor.  The tsatsiki wasn't good - closer to french onion dip mixed with plain sour cream - they should source that from Papa Cristos (or try to replicate theirs).  Mayo is not provided or listed as a sauce option - just multiple tasty mustards and regular ketschup are on the table - maybe you can request that as the sauce - they charged me an additional 75 cents for it.  I would go back but it didn't blow me away.
