I know that people are not typically in love with this place but I had such a great time.  I was looking for comfort food and stumbled upon Silver Cloud.  Headed over to Wicker Park and sat down in a booth.  Great atmosphere and music.  Our servier was excellent.  Loved the meatloaf, best meatloaf Ive evr had (except for mothers of course) and I enjoyed the mac and cheese. half price bottles of wine on Sunday and Nip/Tuck watch show on Mondays. Great food, great atmosphere, great service.  Im hooked.
