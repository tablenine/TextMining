canter's is like that uncle who always seems to drop by when you have new friends over. . . is it horrible... no . . is it good... not really. . i can't quite give it three stars b/c of how overpriced it is for the average-below average food.. . to put this in perspective.... . there are many other deli's where you can have a much better meal for the same money. . there are many other diners where you can have an average breakfast for half the price.. . if you are reading this save your tourist money and go to someplace else,. . but if you are drunk and have money to burn at 2am then canters is for you!
