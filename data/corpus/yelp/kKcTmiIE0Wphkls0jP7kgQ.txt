Meh.. This place is mediocre at best. They nickle &amp; dime you for everything too. I never understood the hype or the ridiculous lines. Personally I'd rather go to just about any other Mexican joint but every now then I'm with someone who's just got to have it so I'll roll with. Every time I do it just reinforces my opinion. To each their own I guess.
