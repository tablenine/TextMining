Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Yay! After living in LA almost 4 years, I finally made it to Roscoes. . . This place has bomb Southern style greasyyy food, great for hangovers. :-). . I walked in right away and sat down, and the service was much faster then I thought it would be. I ordered the Omelet with cheese and chicken, of course with a waffle on the side that was delicious. I have to admit the food here is super greasy and gooey, so if you are walking in thinking you can order an egg white omelet - don't even bother! Although most people know what to expect when coming to Roscoe's.. . I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken, ironic I know, but I did taste it and it was very yummy. Tender and juicy! The Louisiana hot sauce on the table made everything taste great. I wouldn't mind taking a bottle home.. . The mac and cheese was also awesome, but I like mine a littler more cheesier and gooey then the kind at Roscoe's. I could however, definitely eat a bowl of it!. . All in all - a spot to Â check out in LA - if you are visiting or a tourist. I don't think I would go back consistently because of the way my stomach felt after-wards, but this spot is one worth going back to for sure... when you are up for it! . . Wear a bib!...or not!
