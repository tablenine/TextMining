Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
Meow meow meeeeeeow meow meow.. . Good seafood. Was it the best I've ever had? Nah, but it was good. Our waiter was absolutely helpful and kind, though, so I can't admonish him in any way.  The sturgeon wrapped in bacon with wild mushrooms, grits, cherry tomatoes was what I ordered. $28 dinero.  I also sampled one of the raw oysters that my buddy ordered, and it was delish. Briny, like what I remember from growing up near the Gulf Coast. Some people don't like the taste of the ocean, and those people aren't true seafood lovers (poseurs).. . Honestly, did the owners think about putting a friggin' sign to denote where the restaurant was located?? Talk about Hollywood pretentiousness. Thanks for meeting my expectations for that. Cheese balls.
