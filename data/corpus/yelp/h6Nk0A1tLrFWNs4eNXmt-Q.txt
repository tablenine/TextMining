Best Burger in Chicago!  I've been to many burger places in Chicago, and nothing compares.  I always order medium rare for burgers and the cooks always makes my burgers perfectly the way I want them.  The fresh cut fries are amazing.  Although, the burgers and fries are $8 w/o the coupon from the website, I like the burger so much that I pay regular price to support Moody's business.  I even travel 45 minutes from the Loop to Edgewater for this burger on an evening of blizzard!
