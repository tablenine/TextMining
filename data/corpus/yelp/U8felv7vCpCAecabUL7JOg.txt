This is in the fairly new Tech Square area.  Nearby, you can find a Mo's, a Marble Slab Creamery, the big GA Tech Barnes &amp; Noble, and a few other eating joints.  The first couple times I went there with my boyfriend, I had the Pad Thai, and found it definitely too sweet and not really to my liking.  Lately, I have got the Singapore noodles w/ chicken, and enjoyed those.  I think the spring rolls are really pretty good for the price here.  They have beer &amp; wine as well, but you can't take it to the outside tables.   Keep in mind, they have limited summer hours, since most of the GT kids aren't around.
