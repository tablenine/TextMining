Dropped by today in doing the rounds of DeKalb Farmers Mkt. and Kudzu Antiques.  I went in around noon and while the tables were full there was no line.  As this was my first visit the counter person gave me a menu and waited patiently while I made my selections, which involved much browsing among the glass display cases of goodies.. Both of the young men behind the counter were very pleasant.. I took home a slice of coconut cake and a slice of carrot cake.  My entire family has been coming into the kitchen, spying the boxes, and drooling.. Both cakes are super rich and moist.  . I've already got orders for my next visit.  And there will be many more visits.
