Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
After eating at Versailles down the street, my friends and I decided to chill out at this cafe.  We ordered nutella coffee which was nutella, expresso, and whipped cream in a martini glass.  It was pretty delicious only because nutella is lip smacking goodness itself.  The tiramisu gelato was so-so, not as thick, but definitely creamy.  Prices were average around $4 for a scoop.  I did like the ambiance of the restaurant as we sat in the patio section under heat lamps.
