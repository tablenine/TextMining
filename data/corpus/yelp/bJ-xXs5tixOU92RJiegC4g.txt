My first time to this location and I love it for the parking lot. I got the last space!. . I ate chicken and waffles of course but this time I got rice and gravy and ate that inside my biscuit. Carbs with a side of carbs please! . . Everything is just as excellent as it is in Hollywood with the exception of the bathrooms. It's time for an update!
