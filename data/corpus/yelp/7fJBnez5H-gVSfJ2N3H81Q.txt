Category: American (Traditional)
Really good pastrami ..seems like whenever i go back they raise the price? :  This place is usually packed esp on a Friday night and not to mention the weekends. They also don't put lids on ur soda so someone always spills their drink ...at night they have Â bonfires setup outside in the patios
