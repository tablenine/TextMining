Great bistro tucked away near FAB &amp; BLT Steak in downtown. Lamb shank tagine was great. The eggplant, calamari and meatball appetizers were top notch. The special course of risotto and monkfish was well prepared and tasty.. . If this place was in walking distance of my house, I'd eat here all the time.
