Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
Went for a party on a Sunday afternoon. There were very few people there, and although the hostess had arranged to have an area set aside for our group, when we arrived nothing had been prepared for us. Luckily they scrambled around and were able to put together the forks and plates we needed for the cake. Service was good and fast (as it should have been on a slow sunday afternoon). Prices were what I would expect in the loop.. . Why only three stars? Because Pops just didn't make me feel welcome, the design of the bar is contemporary but not really appealing with its large flatscreens - were they really necessary to the design? The bubbly selection is adequate - no surprises on the list. Pops meets, but does not exceed expectations. . . I would suspect that Pops would be more enjoyable on a busier night when the less-than-aesthetically pleasing design elements take a back seat to the noise and the company.
