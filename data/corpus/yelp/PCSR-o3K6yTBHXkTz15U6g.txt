Definitely make a RESERVATION!. I must admit I was just a little disappointed with the ambiance as I remember it to be so much fancier ~1 yr ago. I guess people take "casual" to a whole new level (PLEASE, no dirty flip flops and overalls! seriously, who wears that to dinner?). The service as always was impeccable! It's amazing how they manage to Â offer great service while running around like a maniac searching for the green cards. Highly recommend the filet wrapped in bacon and the pork ribs...mmMMM! The salad bar is amazing...stocked with everything and anything one can think of. . Definitely worth trying at least once if you haven't been.
