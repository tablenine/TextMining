I went here last night for the first time after hearing my friends rave about it. It seems like a cool lil' hipster joint when you walk in. Lots of young trendsetters in the dim ambiance of the restaurant. There was actually a short wait--10 min or so before our party of four was seated. . . My favorite part of this place was the crispy shrimp chips they serve in lieu of bread or tortilla chips! I couldn't help myself because it had been so long since I've had these. So I asked for another bowl after devouring the first...and second!. . I tried the spicy wings first. They were not that spicy. Must be eaten with the chili served with it. Also, it was super hot, like hot potato kinda hot. Had to wait for it to cool for a bit before picking up and chomping. . . My friend who loves this place got the gingergrass tofu--she always gets this dish. i must admit the tofu texture is perfectly creamy and just lightly fried. it is serve don a bed of baby bok choy and a tastey sauce.. . i had the blackened clams--yummy flavor and smokey. the last one was not open though! after i pried it open i decided not to eat it. after all, what if i turn into a clam after eating a raw one?!?!. . They also served the Viet beer Tiger. Oh and service was prompt and nice. I would go back to try some other tasty dishes. the mussels and fish also caught my eye...next time gingergrass!
