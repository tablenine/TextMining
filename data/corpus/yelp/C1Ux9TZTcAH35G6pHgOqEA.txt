Restaurant: Taka Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Taka (aka Taka Sushi and Passion) is my favorite sushi restaurant in Atlanta.  While there is less expensive sushi in Atlanta, Taka seems to have the best quality around.  As another person mentioned you should definitely sign up for his mailing list (assuming you intend to return).  Every week you get an email telling you about the quality of his ingredients.  He also includes off-beat stories about Japan, technology, and anything else he happens to be thinking of at the moment.
