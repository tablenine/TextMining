I'll start with the most important part... the beer selection is excellent.  My knowledge of wine goes like this... I can now tell red wine from white wine!  I do know my beers though, and they have a phenomenal selection.  Now that I got that out of the way.. . We got there late friday night after dinner to grab a couple of drinks.  Starts off with a jack ass bouncer who was just rude for no good reason.  He was this big oaf wearing one of those secret service ear pieces... even though no one else working there had one one??? Was he keeping in close contact with his mom?  Who knows... Anyways, we made it in, and it was packed... just as it always is.. . I personally am not a huge fan of the crowd that's usually there... don't get me wrong, they definitely seem to be having fun... but ever since I gave up doing keg stands, I just look for something different in a bar.  The service was very friendly, but pretty slow... that's seems to be a recurrent theme from fellow yelpers.. . Over all... if you're looking for a good beer, and you happen to be on your way to the staples center... this is probably the place for you.. just don't expect much in the way of ambience.
