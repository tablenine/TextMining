The food was good. Everything else? Ridiculous. We had a reservation so we didn't have to wait, no complaints there. However, flagging down a server was impossible. Food was silently dropped at our table. I literally mean both silently and dropped. It was hilarious. We ordered a cheese plate, but who knows what was on it because it was delivered almost in passing and without any kind of explanation. The same applied to every round of plates. They just appeared with a thud as someone dropped it on their way somewhere more important than our table. All of our water glasses had lipstick on them. The atmosphere was terrible. The walls were completely bare and the music was boring pop. Save your money and go somewhere else.
