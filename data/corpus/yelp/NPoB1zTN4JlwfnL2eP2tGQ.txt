Blah blah blah great pizza blah blah long wait blah blah not overrated blah blah overrated.  Yeah that's every review in here.  What else is there to say?  . . It's great thin crust pizza.  They've also got a Sicilian style thick crust, whatever that is.  I went with my friend who's Sicilian and he wanted the thin crust, so I'll give that "Sicilian" crust the stink eye.. . Don't bitch about the wait.  Come during the off hours.  If that's too much trouble for you, go somewhere else and stop whining.  Scarantinos has decent pizza and that's right down the street, although it doesn't live up to the hipster vibe so you won't find them there.. . Eh what else?  Service is fine.  Nice little family shop.  Bring cash or run to the back of the restaurant and use their ATM machine so you can pay with cash.  This kind of place has enough business they don't need your fancy plastic.  Get that crap outa here.. . Decent options on the pizza toppings and the pies aren't too expensive, but the toppings is where  they get ya.  Still, if you're splitting a pie, you'll get out for around 10-15 clams.  Unfortunately they don't have spicy sausage here, so don't ask.. . Parking is lame.  Find a spot on Colorado or a side street.  . . Extra points for good signage and old school appeal.  Good pizza here.  People who don't like their pizza are too picky and cannot be trusted.  Keep an eye on them; they'll steal your wallet.
