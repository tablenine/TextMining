Yo amo a Nacional 27! I used to go here almost every weekend! Great music.. which calls for dancing of course!! I love their mojitos! They are huge too... . I have eaten here once.. A friend had a gift certificate which we had to put to use. We had the shrimp appetizer.. And split a pork dish.. I am not fond of pork but it was tasty. This place serves small portions but.. they are like explosions in your mouth!! very rich tasty food.. . . That being said.. I Â would not bring my man here since.. he would want to go somewhere to eat a burger or something!
