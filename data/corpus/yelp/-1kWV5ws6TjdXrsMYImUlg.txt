3.5 for the pancakes.  If the line weren't so long on the weekends, I'd be 300 pounds by now.  The pancakes are delicious and the size of miami (get the blueberry), the chilis are phenomenal (ask them to let you taste them), and the crowd's great for people watching.  Plus, if you're into that sort of thing (or have friends in town from the midwest), you can always come star-sighting here.  The last couple of times I was here I saw ashlee simpson and one of the guys from 90210.  Come here when you have a weekday off and a gigantic appetite. The food isn't gourmet (you don't get ingredients that are quite as nice as, say, doughboys or toast), but for what it's worth, it's hot, huge, and hollywood.  Don't forget about the chili (and chili fries) and the blueberry with blueberry sour cream pancakes (split them).  You haven't lived until you've eaten those pancakes.  While it's not the place I'd come every day (or every week, for that matter), it's a great hollywood breakfast diner.
