Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
I have always been an outsider to the wonder so Thai food. I never really got what was so wonderful about it. But Urban belly is another one of those places that is making me a believer. . My one fear about Thai restaurants in general is that the portions are going to be skimpy and I'm going to rush to a Burrito joint later that night. But Urban Belly fed me like a king. The Chicken concoction that I ordered came in a huge bowl that was filled with Noodles, spicy broth and Â generous portions of chicken. The noodles were huge and had the consistency of dumplings. It was a heaping, helping of Asian Delight. . The interior is very minimalistic. It's nothing but a counter, and six tables. The tables are heavy wood tables, and there is nothing but wood blocks to sit on, but like I say, it's all about the food. . Urban Belly was wonderful, the food was tasty, and the service was good. The next time I get a hankering for some Thai food, Urban Belly is first on my list.
