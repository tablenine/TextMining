Had to give Langers 5 stars, had it for the second time today. My advice is to definetly get pastrami on rye bread whatever you do. I dont even like Rye bread anywhere else, but this breads texture and taste combined with that meat and coleslaw is a dream come true. I wish it was open later, thats my only complaint :)
