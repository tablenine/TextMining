Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Have you ever been socked with a pancake before?. . That is what it feels like 1/3 in a normal order of Banana Nana. Where some places who serve brunch give you small portions, carefully laid out on a square plate (something which i call "cute food") Griddle Cafe wants you fed... like FED... like a Filipina Grandma who thinks you're getting too skinny and wants you to eat eat eat.. . Aside from the big portions, the pancakes were DELICIOUS! Mine was quite fluffy and spongy and i was quite content with that and the French press coffee.. . With that said, don't be the rookie patron and order the regular order of three pancakes (unless you plan to share.) You can order one.. . Seriously, they are huge. You can blanket a newborn with one... that is if you are that kind of parent.... ahem...
