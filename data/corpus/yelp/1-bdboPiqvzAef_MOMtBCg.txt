Sorry  haters, but I dig Fred's. I gave it four stars because parking can be a bitch, and at night the wait staff takes their sweet ass time to bring you anything (also drinks never get refilled). So if you aren't so thirsty and you're patient you can continue.  . . I don't know about the whole hipster thing- I don't think it's a problem. However, I also realize that it's Los Feliz and the people complaining are going there in the middle of the night. Of course there's going to be hipsters- they're dressed and they want to be seen/scene. Get over it- it's expected at that hour.. . I go here in the day mostly, and I even bring my 52 year old Dad. He digs it because there is a sandwich called the Tower of Power, and it has plenty of other cute and clever names.  The bussers have funny t-shirts too.  The menu has plenty to offer and there's a cute table in the corner bay window where you sit with a bunch of pillows and a curtain for privacy.  Also check out the decor in either of the bathrooms.. . I think it's reasonably priced- Ihop-esque pricing. Food is yummy and portions are perfect- it's always enough so I don't take home leftovers that I'll forget about.. . At the end of the day, I love Freds. Hipsters are everywhere in L.a. so if you're worried about that then I suggest you move.
