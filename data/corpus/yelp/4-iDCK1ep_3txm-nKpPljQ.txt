Fantastic! I have had this restaurant on my list of places to go for quite some time and I wish it had not taken me so long to get there.  We were greeted by friendly staff and the server was excellent.  He was knowledgable about the product and the menu.  We had quite a bit of questions about the style of cooking and ingredients used since my boyfriend just got back from a month in India.  This restaurant didnt dissapoint.  We had the vegetarian samosas, chicken masala, and a lamb dish with basmati rice.  Everything was extremely high quality and prices were not much above Devon.  But for upscale Indian, great for beginners or food connoisseurs, dont miss going here.
