Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
So culver city is the new trendy spot on the westside and lots of these trendy restuaurants are popping up like hippies in colorado.  Fraiche is the first one I tried.. . Fraiche has a extensive wine list and the food wasn't WOW but it was good.  We ordered the beef tartare, which is pretty damn good, a salad that was overpriced, and the short rib ravioli.  I shoulda ordered the pork chops instead instead of the ravioli.  It was too salty and decent, nothing to scream about tho.  I would suggest getting one dish of pasta and one entree to share and the beef tartare.  Lower the price on the salad and then we can start talking about this place again.
