Went here last night because we were looking for something in the West Loop and Mexican.  We made a reservation ahead of time and showed up 5 minutes early and were seated right away.  As everyone says, the taco flight is the way to go.  Eight tacos for $30 and you can mix and match all eight.  Me and my three companions shared two flights and it was more than enough.  Table favorites were the skirt steak, chipotle chicken, duck and shrimp.  The food was great but the reason for the 1-star deduction was the price of the alcohol.  $37 for a pitcher of sangria?!?  I think next time I might try a margarita as it seems more bang for the buck...Hibiscus Margarita sounds AWESOME!!!
