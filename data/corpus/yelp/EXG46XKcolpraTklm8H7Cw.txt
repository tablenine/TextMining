I just don't get it... but I just don't like this place at all.. . A lot of my friends go here for the chinese sausage, which I agree is really good.. it is lean and has just the right amount of sweetness..but honestly that isn't enough to keep me coming because everything else was just mediocre if even that.. . Oyster pancake -- gosh... 5 whole oyster...geez thanks!!  I dunno I really frown on Taiwanese places that can't make a descent oyster pancake and what is decent?  I shouldn't be able to taste clumps of flour.. bleh!  Not to mention the sauce....  part of me just wanted to take my dish home so I could pour my own sauce on it.. . Glutinous Rice --  taste ok, but really someone fix the sauce!!. . Shaved Ice -- I rather just go to Shao Mei or next door to Bin Bin Konjac for some mango shaved ice with mango sorbet....*drOool*. . We also ordered a soup and all I remembered from it was.."are you sure there's no MSG in here?". . Overall, there's other places to get yummy Taiwanese food, this place is good for a cheap meal although I would say you can probably get the same quality food from Lollicup, Tapioca Xpress or Teastation....except at those boba places at least your drink taste better.
