Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Love, love Johnnie's!. . I've been coming here with my family for over 15 years. No, we don't live near here but my parents used to eat here when they were dating and we visited as a family whenever we went to LAX or made trips out to LA and Culver City to visit friends and family.. . Their pastrami sandwich, which I will admit is a bit pricey, to me is SO worth it! Pretty lean, large generous portion and soft fresh bun. Make sure you get it dipped with an order of their onion rings. The fries are the old school steak fries and are quite yummy but their onion rings are scrumptious! They also toss in their homemade pickles which give a great accent to the sandwich and add a bit of "green" to your meal :). The place is definitely old school, it hasn't changed since I was a wee youngin. They have a few indoor booths with table top juke boxes but the best seats are the ones on the patio near the outdoor fire pits. One word of warning though, they don't take credit cards!
