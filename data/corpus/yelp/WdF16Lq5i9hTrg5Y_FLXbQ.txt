Restaurant: Baraonda Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
The restaurant has both an patio/"outside" area and a regular indoor area. The indoor area is a joint bar/restaurant. The outside area is on the sidewalk and you might have exhaust as an integral part of your dinner. Some might like that, personally I prefer dinner without exhaust. . . The restaurant/bar area is rather noisy and can be rather busy. . . The food is traditional Italian with a good variety of antipasto, pizza and a variety of pasta. The menu is limited but overall the food is fantastic. We have tried ravioli, lasagna, and pesce giorno. All of the dishes were really great. . . They have a Monday night wine taster. Stay away from it, the price is good but the wines are not. Other than that they have really good Italian wines. . . If you do not mind the noisy ambiance or sitting on the sidewalk this is a great place to get Italian food.
