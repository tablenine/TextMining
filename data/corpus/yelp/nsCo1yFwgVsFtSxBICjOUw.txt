Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I've never been to Ensenada. I'll probably never go to Ensenada. Movies like "Man on Fire," Â "The Mexican," and that episode of "The Simpsons" where Homer is kidnapped in Rio and forced to ride in those awful sky gondolas have forever terrified me into going south of the border. Seriously. Have you seen Man on Fire? Marc Anthony was totally the bad guy and Mickey Rourke is in on it.. . I just couldn't deal with that on a vacation.. . So TBFTIE is as close to Ensenada as I'm ever going to get. There are lots of things that make this place the best fish taco joint around.. . - It's attached to a body shop.. . - It has two things on the menu - and as we all know, nine times out of ten, menu selection is inversely proportional to menu deliciousness.. . - The owner wears Hawaiin shirts. Constantly.. . - They have an AWESOME selection of salsas. Especially the mango and pineapple. I'm a huge, uh, bitch and it's very spicy so I always bring a couple of bottles of water with me to the restaurant because I'm, uh, cheap.. . - They freshly prepare all of the tacos right then when you order them.. . - Tacos are about two bucks each. I don't know if you've heard about this economy thing but man, it's nice to know you can still eat on the cheap.. . So Yelpers - turn off your MGMT album, take off your ironic tuxedo t-shirt and go have a taco, yeah?. . Oh and bring cash, because that's all they take.. . Deal with it - at least you're not being kidnapped.
