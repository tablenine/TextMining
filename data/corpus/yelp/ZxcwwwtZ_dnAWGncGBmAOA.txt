Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
I've been going to Papi's in Midtown for a couple years now and I've never had any problems.  The food is consistent and the staff is very friendly.  I've pretty much ordered everything on the menu but my favorite is the Bistec y arroz.  I usually order extra platanos because they are good.  They aren't the dry plantains you'll find at other chain restaurants.. . The portions are extremely generous so you will never be leaving hungry.  This isn't the best Cuban food I've had but it's probably the best you're going to get in the A.  The only qualm I have about this place is the parking.  The lot is usually full by lunchtime.  If you live in the Kennesaw area, I highly suggest visiting their other location off of Barrett Pkway.
