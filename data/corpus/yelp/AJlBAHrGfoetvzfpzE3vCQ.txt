The W Hotel recommended this place as a good seafood restaurant. At first our colleague had to actually remember the name of the place but we eventually found it. It's in the Perimeter mall between Hudson's Grille and Cheesecake Factory. . . They have two types of menus, a sushi menu and an American seafood menu. We ordered from both menus. Staring out with the spider roll and a fried appetizer plate with oysters, calamari, and crab spring rolls. I got a mixed green salad but wasn't impressed with the flavor. For the main course I ordered the crab cake entree. It was very good and I had to repack it to take back home. . . Service was good until after the dishes were taken away. I was going to order dessert but our waitress was busy and never came back to take our order. I think the dinner crowd was just coming in so she had to wait on those tables.
