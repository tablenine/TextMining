i was wandering around westwood looking for a place to eat and came across native foods. i am not vegan or even vegetarian, but was intrigued by the menu, so i walked in. i ordered the baja tacos with a side of sweet potato fries and loved it! the tempeh was really tasty and doused with this lemon mayo concoction with capers and shredded cabbage that made it super flavorful. the fries were also super yummy!
