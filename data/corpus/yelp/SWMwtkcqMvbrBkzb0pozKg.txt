Category: Sushi Bars
I hate sushi - but this place made me love it (or at least the non-raw fish/seafood kind).  The soy sauce is amazing, the restaurant is cute and date-like (if you are looking for that).  It may not be the best place to beat the table with saki bombs - but the food is very good and there is a nice atmosphere.  I recommend the AAC sushi &amp; the spinach with peanut sauce. yum.. . And they have a little lunchtime sushi only location across the street from the sears tower.
