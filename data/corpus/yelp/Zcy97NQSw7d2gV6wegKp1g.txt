I'm not someone who is used to fancy restaurants, so maybe that's my personal bias. The decor was fun and crazy, the staff was incredible, but I just didn't dig the food all that much. The potatoes were the best part of my meal (though the berry cobbler martini I had was great), but the only vegetarian item they had on the menu was fried green tomatoes - for $16. We visited because it was right by Steppenwolf and we were heading there for a show; I can't say that I would want to visit again unless it was for drinks. It's unfortunate, because as I said, the staff was wonderful! Also, because it was a Thursday around 5:30, the place was almost empty; I also appreciated the fact that they asked if we were going to be enjoying the theater that night, in order to make sure we were out in time for the show.. . Oh - and the dessert was fantastic!
