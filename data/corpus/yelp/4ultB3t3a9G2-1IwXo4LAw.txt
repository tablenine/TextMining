Restaurant: Buona Terra
Category: Italian
I dine here often. Buona Terra is in my neighborhood and I am lucky to have it so nearby! The Specials are always fresh, they do a great job with fish dishes. I have  rarely had better fish elsewhere in the city. The pork chops are to die for as well.  I really love the tomato basil sauce. I have enjoyed it on many different pastas and raviolis they offer. The servers are  outstanding! They due their best to make you feel at home. The wine list  offers greats values. All in all my favorite Italian restaurant in the city with out the hefty price tag!
