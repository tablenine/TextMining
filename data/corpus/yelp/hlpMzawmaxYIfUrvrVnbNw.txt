I've never gotten around to reviewing this place despite how frequently I visit. I have never once NOT liked anything I ordered from here and the staff is really friendly. The portions are pretty HUGE and the dessert menu is divine. Whether you want to sit-in and dine or just grab a latte to go, this place is for you!. . The only issue I have is that there isn't a free on-site parking lot (there is a valet, though) but finding somewhere to park on the street or in the nearby neighborhoods is not that big of a deal. The place is also pretty packed most of the time but I always get my food or drink in a timely manner.
