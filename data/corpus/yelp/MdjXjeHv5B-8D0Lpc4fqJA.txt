I like the idea of the store, but it was executed poorly.  Bacon...  mushrooms... these things should not be on the add-ons that cost more.  I don't really need a list of twenty kinds of peppers.. . The Chili Cheese Fries were actually disgusting.  Really.  They were gross.. . Burger was good, but not great.  And the place is spendy for two people.. . It's not going anywhere... people will eat there...  but there are far better burgers in Chicago.
