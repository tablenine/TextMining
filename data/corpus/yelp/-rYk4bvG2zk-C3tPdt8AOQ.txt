Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
I'll admit it . I ALWAYS FEEL PIGGY. . . I work down the street. I need someone to deliver me food, b/c I am not able to leave my store while working. . . Every day I think "hmm... I could get Jimmy Johns. Or maybe Potbelly?" and then I remember how their sandwiches are made almost entirely of bread, and they only use iceberg lettuce and mealy tomatoes, and I feel kind of sad. . . And then... BING!. I remember the Bourgeois Pig.. I have been inside before and appreciated the cozy ambiance, but can I tell you what I liked more? The GARDEN PARTY SANDWICH. It has like 8 lbs of spinach. It has the most delightful cheese in the world. It is made with delicious bread. Tomato and red pepper, onion. OH I LOVE YOU SANDWICH. (That may qualify as a sandgasm, I'm not sure). . I've been known to order 2 at once. Granted, they're a little expensive. But at the same time, they are 1) Local (and we should all support local business) 2) Using fresh ingredients, and far better ones than any other sandwich place, and 3) Making me so happy.. Also, the delivery guy I always get is a lovely man.
