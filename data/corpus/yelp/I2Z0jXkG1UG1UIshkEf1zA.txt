Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
Okay, the only reason I am giving Taco Cabana a low rating is due to the food quality, of which it deserves it.  I would like to say that I love the fact that I can get drive through mexican at any time of the day or night.  For instance I had a hankering for some chicken tacos at around 6 am on Sunday morning and behold they were open.  Now it is not top quality but it fulfilled a craving and that is all that matters.  Good place to go when no other places are open.
