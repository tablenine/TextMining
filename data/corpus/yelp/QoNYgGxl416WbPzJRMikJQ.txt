This place sucks! Basically White Castle burgers at exorbitant prices. The veggie burger is a slice of mushroom. For real. Just a slice. As if that wasn't insulting enough, the service is horrendous.  You will leave hungrier than you were when you arrived, and you will feel abandoned and neglected.  Do not go!
