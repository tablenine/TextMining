MmMMM! No wonder there's always such a long wait for this place! I've always heard about this place but never felt the need to wait so long for some seafood.  But finally made my way over here and the wait wasnt as bad as anticipated...got there around 7...was seated around 730! not bad at all...except for the people who apparently could not read the no smoking signs...or the no smoking pictures for that matter.  Anyways once we got in, we were seated near a wall, which was pretty cool cuz you could graffiti up the bricks on the walls..it's already super covered in ink/markers tho so you'd hafta look to find a space to mark your territory.  A waitress came and tied on our bibs for us...not really a fan of that...dont really like it when things are tied around my neck so i usually choose to do it myself so at least I KNOW i wont be strangling myself.  but anyways, ordered 2 lbs of crawfish (different spicyness though so they didnt give us our free corn since it was in 2 separate bags...booO!) 1lb of blue crab = 2 crabs, and 2-3 lbs of dungeness crab = 1 crab.  Of course we got the whole shebang sauce mmM! my friend was drinking the sauce after we were done...she even cracked over one of the shells to use as a spoon haha! Anyways all that food, plus fried catfish(yum!), extra fries, and 5 drinks...only came out to be a little less than $20 a person! good deal! will be back again...as soon as the garlic smell is outta my hands that is...
