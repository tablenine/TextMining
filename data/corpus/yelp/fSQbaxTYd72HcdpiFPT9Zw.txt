What an awesome noodle joint. I come here even when the weathers hot and dry! Try the kotteri ramen for extra kurobuta pork fatty goodness or my personal favorite, the new kichi men. It's a spicier and more vinegary version of the ramen but with the soup, noodles and meat separated. The quality of the noodles are like no other. Perfectly chewy and not sticky, even when it's dry. And for the appetizer the gyoza is a must try. They're rectangular and filled with happy little bits of delicious pork. Service is fast, waiters are nice, noodles are orgasmically good...what more can you ask for?
