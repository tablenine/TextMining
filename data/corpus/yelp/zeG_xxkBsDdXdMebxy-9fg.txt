Dear Management at Portos,. If you read these reviews please consider opening a franchise in the bay area. I promise you will have plenty of customers :). *heart,*. Me.. . K. That aside. This time around I actually got to try their food and it's on the same level of delish goodness as their desserts. My recs: mango and black bean salad, and cuban sandwich. Mm Mm Mm. The salad was full of flavor without having to be doused in dressing. Their sandwiches come with deep fried platano chips. Great alternative to fries and they totally bring out your meal's favor. Sad bc I'm not sure when I'll be in LA next but banking on one day visiting one up here *hinthint*..... . A girl can dream!
