Wow I so thought i reviewed Langer's before..... Best Pistrami in LA, though make sure to ask for it lean... and try somethign intersting they have liek 15 options on what to do with pistrami.. I also think they have the best Challah bread at any of the kosher style delis... their Matzoball soup is eh.
