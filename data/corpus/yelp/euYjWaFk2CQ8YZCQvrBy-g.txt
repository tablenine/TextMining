Best fresh live lobster in town. Order the house special and it will not disappoint. They've kept their food very consistent considering how long they've been open, which is very nice because I can expect to take visitors out to great lobster whenever I come here. I've tried their king crab twice and it was soooo good. We had it cooked garlic style and mannn the meat is sweet. Combine seafood with French beer and you have yourself a feast. Another favorite dish is the clam with basil. Lunch specials here are awesome. Really decent prices for quality food. They give you a bowl of hot and sour soup on the house during lunch. For dinner they give you heavenly oranges after your meal.. . This is by far one of the few Asian places where you'll receive superb customer service. The waiters all speak English and several dialects of Chinese (Mandarin/Cantonese) and Vietnamese. They will suggest popular items if you are new to the place. Over the years, I've seen more and more diverse crowds eat at this establishment.. . They recently moved to their current location and it looks like a 5-star Chinese restaurant. The interior decor is amazing and if you're looking for Asian inspiration for your home, this is a great place to check out.. . When you purchase a lobster or king crab, you can request to take a pix of your meal while it's alive before you eat it. When purchasing the lobster, I recommend getting the smaller lobster because the meat is more tender when you order the smaller lobsters, but if you just want to show off, i suppose the larger lobsters would do.
