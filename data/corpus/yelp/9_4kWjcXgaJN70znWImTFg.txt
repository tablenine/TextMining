Lobster! I'm not Chinese so I've never had Lobster any other way except plain and boiled. And honestly I've given up lobster because I'm allergic. But I remember about a year ago when I decided to just f it and just try it. I was truly amazed. The whole lobster comes out looking magnificent on a huge platter battered and covered in fresh herbs peppers and a sauce.  (I wish i remembered how it tasted).. You're always getting a good deal here, no matter what. We ordered once of those suggested planned menus once and spent less than $100 on all this food. Plates were beginning to be stacked up on top of each other. But we also always over-oder, because someone wants chow fun and then someone wants chicken, and then someone wants the fish. . . . You get the gist.. You can't come here without ordering seafood or the lobster. Just because I'm allergic doesn't mean the whole table shouldn't have any. And I've brought large parties here, and everyone always comes out happy (and mad that they had to eat that much. Hey i didn't force them too).. The  service is still very upfront., "pick one" the waiter tells me as I'm trying to pick a BOBA drink. I also love getting their whole fresh young coconut to drink. But the owner, is very helpful. . Last weekend, we went with the waiter's suggestion of ordering their STURGEON which will come out prepared three ways (deboned too!)...soup, steamed, and fried but my favorite was the fried!. It is battered then drenched in a  sauce that had sweet chilli sauce and basil.. I basically love everything on the menu, even the more famous Chinese dishes are well executed, but go for their Vietnamese inspired dishes..where herbs like mint and basil are used.
