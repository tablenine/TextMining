i absolutely love this place. . . It's healthy, tasty, and reasonably priced. They make the salads/sandwiches right on the spot in front of you so it's super fresh. i'm not vegan, but i had a salad called Happy Vegan with hummus, couscous, and really interesting grains...they also have a cute place to sit outside under the trees. I highly recommend it.
