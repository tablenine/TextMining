Don't bother making reservations here!  I called 2 weeks in advance for a party of 10, confirming twice... asking for 2 high chairs for my friend's children.  They kept assuring me that it would be fine. . . Reservations were for 11:30am on Sat. . . At 11:10am I get a call from them saying that they want to give up my seats if I'm not planning on getting there by 11:30am exactly.  I said I would be 5-10 min late, so she gave up my seats.  Of all the restaurants I've been to, I've never heard of a restaurant calling someone before the reservation time and asking to give up their reservations.  I get that they're busy, but that's just bad business.  . . My friends and I had to wait 40 min outside for a table.  In the end, they only gave us one high chair and a crowded booth.  Probably won't go there again.  . . NOT good for groups, food was just alright... been to much better brunch places.   . . On the plus side, I liked our waiter.
