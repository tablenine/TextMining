I don't know much about Jewish deli but it looked dirty, service was not great, and though now I think I should have ordered something like, corned beef or something, the food was not good at all. I tried their cake and it was dry. Hard to come up with good things to say about this place. Oh yeah and overpriced. I didn't realize this place was so famous. I feel I am missing something, yet don't care to figure out what.
