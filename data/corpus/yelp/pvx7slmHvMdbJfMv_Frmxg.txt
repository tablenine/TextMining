Craving some Thai food on a Friday night, my boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try.  The food was pretty good, but a little bland in my opinion.   The best thing we had was definitely the Tom Yum soup, which I do admit was very good.  However, I was less than impressed by the green curry, or the drunken noodles.  They were okay, but nothing to rave about.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes.  The portions were huge and we ended up taking home almost half of it.  As a suggestion: the food tasted much better after a whirl in the fridge. . . Oh, and the ice tea was amazing...
