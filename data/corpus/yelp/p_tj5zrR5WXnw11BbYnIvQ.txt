3 stars by day, 4 stars by night.. . During the day, this place really isn't worth the trip. . Expensive &amp; none of the food is that great.. . But, if it's late and you want some grub, it becomes a semi-contender though I'd still rather Fred 62s or something (though they don't really have deli stuff). . . 2 things I've found great there:. 1. their philly cheese steak was one of the best I've had in LA. 2. their bakery- obviously, pretty awesome.
