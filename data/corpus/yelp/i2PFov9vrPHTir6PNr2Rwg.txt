Okay, this place was great! At first I thought it was a bit overpriced - $28 for 8 tacos! But...the tacos were awesome and pretty unique so I think the price is justified. Had the guac as an appetizer and it was yummy! We went with a big group and the service, once we got seated, was good. We had to wait for a long time to get seated - despite reservations - but it was okay because we had drinks and talked. Had the enchiladas with basmati rice and black beans - yum! Split an order of tamales and they were awesome too! Can't wait to go back!
