Restaurant: Bob San Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
We had an 8:30PM reservation at Bob San last night.  Five of us wanted to eat here for a before gig/business dinner.  We had to be somewhere by 11:30PM at the latest and thought we'd have plenty of time. Wrong.. . One of us was 10 mins late so they gave our table away.  Fine.  It was his own fault.  We finally sat down at 9:20PM.  We figured we'd still be on time for the show.  Our waitress took our drink order and 25 MINUTES later our Sake arrived.  She then took our food order.  It was about an hour before our first plates arrived.  When it did, it was only 2 of the numerous items we had ordered.  Items came to us VERY SLOWY over the next 45 minutes.  . . The house crunch roll that a friend recommended was good.  Everything else was just mediocre/ not good at all.. . After we ate and were full, they sent over a complimentary COLD shrimp tempura on the house to show remorse for the incredibly slow service.  At this point we just wanted to get the heck outta there.. . I don't care if it was a busy Saturday night.  Sushi should not be a 3 HOUR ordeal.  By the time they finally got us out of there, the whole restaurant was basically empty.. . We left the restaurant at 11:30 and arrived late for the show.  The whole meal was a disaster.. . We won't be back.
