It's unfortunate that the food here isn't very good, because the location is top notch.  You get a wonderful panoramic view of the city.  So make sure that you make reservations for a table by the window.. . I really wish Yamashiro would update its menu/hire a new chef, because the food (which deserves 2 stars) does not reflect its awesome location (4.5 stars).  It's just not living up to its potential.  Imagine a revamped Yamashiro with Nobu quality food.  Now that would be really awesome!
