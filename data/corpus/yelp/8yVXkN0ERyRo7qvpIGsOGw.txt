What a cute spot!  Quite a trek from my home at the beach, though.  . . I had the Crab Cakes Benedict, nothing special.  They were out of cupcakes at 1:30pm, which was the main reason we went.  . . If I'm in the area I would probably go back because it's the only place I know of over that way, but I definitely won't got out of my way to go back.
