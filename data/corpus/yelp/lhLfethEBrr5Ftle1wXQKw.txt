Fantastic food and terrific ambiance.  My friend took me for dinner here and we had a delightful meal.  I need more adjectives up in here.. . We had the prix fixe - I had the tuna tartar and the duck which were both phenomenal.  The duck practically melted in my mouth, it was tender and almost sweet.  My friend had the salmon tartar and the steak and he enjoyed both tremendously.. . I do have to say - I had a "Coming up Roses" cocktail which was....weird.  It was everything it said it was on the menu, but the inclusion of rose petals meant I had to spit little bits of flower between every sip - even with a straw!  This is not very becoming for a lady. . . Luckily, I'm no lady.
