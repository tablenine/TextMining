love wurstkuche (worst cooch?). i love the decor, ample seating, dipping sauces, sausage links, and unique beverages.. . i can't say it's the best hot dog i've ever had, but it's a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy some awesome eating. . . dipping sauce for your belgian fries: curry ketchup was my favorite
