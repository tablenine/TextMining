Category: Sushi Bars
been here twice and for both times, it was for a friend's bday. initially you get overwhelmed by the tacky interior decorations and over-enthusiastic waiters. i do agree with the other reviews that the people who work there try to get you to drink a lot and eat a lot....the first time i went with 20 ppl, the bill was over a GRAND! wat the effin eff?! . . the sushi quality sucks but after a few sake bombs, everything tastes like gourmet food. bottom line, you come here to drink, dance on your chair, and overall make a complete ass of yourself and in the chaos, manage to squeeze in some sushi. . . i'm presently at work and regretting the last two sake bombs i had last nite. yay.
