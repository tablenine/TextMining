Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's is an LA staple. Sure, I'll wait in line for 45 min with everyone toting their pooches. Pink's gets an extra star for having free water available for all the diva doggies. The dog I get is the LOTR dog. Mmm bbq sauce and onion rings on my hotdog! I'm unique in that I hate mustard, ketchup, and relish. Gross! Bbq sauce is about as fancy as I will get for my condiments. Plus this hotdog is the best thing of result from LOTR. I hate that movie. It's 5x as long as the wait time in line at Pink's.. . I like eating at Pink's before a night of bar hopping on Sunset. I like eating at Pink's on a Sunday afternoon. I like eating at Pink's all the time and would if I were in LA. I feel closer to FRIENDS when I'm sitting in the back next to an autographed picture of Joey Tribiani aka Matt LeBlanc.. . In the end, Pink's get minus stars for setting up a lame hot dog stand at the Planet Hollywood Casino in Vegas. It is nothing compared to the LA one. Its a serious downgrade. Close it down or add the same variety as the one in LA. It's just embarrassing. :(
