Today was my 2nd time eating here, and it was as delicious as I remembered it be. I would've never looked twice at this joint walking down St. Mark's place but will definitely associate good taste and reasonable price.. . However, I do believe the breading was a bit much which makes you full quicker. I wanted to eat the original and the BBQ but was only able to eat half of each and took the rest to-go.  Service was surprisingly charming though the restaurant is only conducive to seating approximately 20 people. . . You are able to add how spicy you want your sandwich, and Sriacha sauce is readily available. You can also regulate the amount of cilantro and add a fried egg if you like.  Overall, I'd love to go back and try the pho and other dishes on the menu, but appear to be attached to the sandwiches. $5, not a bad deal at all!
