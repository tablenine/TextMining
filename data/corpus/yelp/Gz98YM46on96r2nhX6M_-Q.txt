1st of all i started busting up, upon trying to pronounce the name.  worst cooch?  ok whatever, my homie calls me up to be his "Wing Man" unfortunately I had a previous plan so i couldn't make it in time for the task,  and by the time i showed up they had bounced already.  . . Anyway when i found out where this place was I couldn't believe it.  For one it was across the street from my old school Maryknoll, in Jtown.  Wow how the neighborhood has changed.  Walking in I was greeted by my friends Steve and Sung who were at the counter placing their order and offered to order something for me as well (how convenient as there was one line about 10 people behind them)  I said I'll have what you're having.  They said the rattlesnake and rabbit, um... ok.  We had friends with tables cause for a wednesday rainy night there were quite few heads up in there.  So getting a table before ordering might be the way to go.    I ordered a Bitburger cause i knew it was light.  And complimented the sausage along with those belgian fries, so yum.  . . The crowd is mixed, the beer is good and diverse variety to boot, it's German it better be.  The sausage is interesting not bad for my 1st visit and decently priced.  I'll go back again and tell my friends.  . . Not that this matters or makes a difference in my review but there was a dj playing some tunes.  . . There's alot of new spots in little tokyo this is another gooder.. . after 8pm plenty of free street parking.   . . I gave it 3 stars cause it's not a 5 star restaurant.  So it's kinda like 3 out of 3.  It's a German Bar serving sausage.  It's has nice design shape, triangular being on the corner it's real easy to find.  The decor is cool and the space is roomy not clustered like some places.
