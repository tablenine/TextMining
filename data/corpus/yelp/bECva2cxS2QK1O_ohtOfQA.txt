Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
I used to blame Fred 62 for feeding (no pun intended) the attitude of all the hipsters who flocked to Los Feliz in the early 90s.  That was years ago and the hipsters who frequent now seem to have mellowed out - or had kids.  I hadn't been to Fred 62 in ages partly of my boycott against hipster tude, but a friend with two kids under the age of 4 said I had to let it go and meet them for breakfast. If I want real-deal diner food I'd probably still go to Norms, but Fred 62 is more upscale comfort food - and tasty.  I love breakfast and there's nothing more heartwarming in the AM - besides strong coffee - than having every breakfast option in the world to choose from. (Well there are more heartwarming options but this is a restaurant review.) There's something kind of fun too to see people who 10 years ago would be eating breakfast here after being up all night now eating here with their kids.  Though my days of staying up into the wee hours are mostly over (never say never) it's nice to note there's a 24-hour place in the neighborhood.
