I'm pretty surprised that everyone here on Yelp is bashing this place.  The pork is incredible, as it's the most tender, flavorful, and moist pork I can remember.  Though the pork skin is a little tough to eat which was disappointing, but if you're really motivated it can be done.. . The sandwich itself was a little small, and pricey since it comes out to about $10.  I didn't try any of the sides since none of them sounded that appetizing.  Maybe next time I'll just have to go for the $15 pork plate.
