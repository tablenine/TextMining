Met a friend for drinks here and was impressed overall.  The decor is inviting - stacked stone, soft lighting, "open pit" fireplace, circular booths that looked really comfy, open kitchen, and a piano inside the bar area.. . My friend was sitting at the bar sipping on a Macallan scotch when I arrived.  As soon as I sat down, I was greeted by one of the bartenders.  I looked over the wine list - note 60 wines are offered by the glass - and per the bartender's recommendation, ordered the Schug Pinot Noir.  Very good I might add.  Also, ordered the Grilled Steak &amp; Cremini Mushroom Flatbread with spinach and Salmon Valley blue cheese.  Scrumptious!. . I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the flatbread which was just a tease of how wonderful I suspect their entrees are.  Definitely, will be back for a full-on dinner.
