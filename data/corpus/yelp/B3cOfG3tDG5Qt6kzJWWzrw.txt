Been here twice now and have no complaints.  you can valet park or use one of the many parking garages that charge a $2 flat rate after 6pm.  . . For steak, it's a combination of tenderness and flavor.  Depending on what you prefer, you'll like one cut more than another.  The filet is the most tender, the ribeye the most flavorful, with the strip somewhere in between. If you're looking for the tenderest piece of meat, it is the filet at this steakhouse.  They even have a bone in filet, which I haven't seen anywhere else.  The bone conducts the heat and the rub on the bone provides extra flavor.  If you're looking for flavor in a filet in expense of tenderness however, this may not be your place (ruth chris has the most flavorful, not as tender piece). The bone in ribeye has perfectly marbled fat and the flavor will blow your mind. order a strong, bold cab to pair with this cut.  This place is one of the rare steakhouse that does medium rare how its supposed to be done. both times, there was no overcooking. the Chilean sea bass is equally out of this world.. . The Warm Butter Cake is a fresh warm pound cake with a thin layer of caramelized sugar (like creme brulee) topped with vanilla bean ice cream and raspberry syrup, with strawberries and the most amazing fresh whipped cream on the side. i don't think they add extra sugar to the top, but they just pass a torch over the cake and the sugar already inside the cake caramelizes the top.. . the service is top notch also. a friend couldn't decide which wine she wanted so our waiter brought out a few for her to try.
