Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
If you serve KFC's (or Ralph's) fried chicken with nicely toasted Eggo waffles, you would have a similar meal.  Maybe try it with some Tabasco sauce, butter, and maple syrup to add dimension and delight to the combination.  I bet my suggestion would even taste better!  Of course, if you are craving it all in one place, then Roscoe's is a convenient one-stop shop for this combination.  I do commend Roscoe's for their good service--professional, attentive, and quick.
