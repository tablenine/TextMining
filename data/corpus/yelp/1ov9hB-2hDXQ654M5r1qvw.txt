Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
The drinks at Lolas were definitely above par, but the service sucked A$$.  We were there for 2 hours and our server (Celeste) only came over 1 time despite our numerous attempts to get her attention.  At one point we were trying to order a drink and she walked away as if she did not even hear us.  Most of the people at our table ended up going  up to the bar instead of waiting for her slow moving self to come back to our table.  The place was not very crowded and there was no reason for her poor service.   Then to top off the evening this heffa had the audacity to add a 20% gratuity to our bill even though only 2 people actually ordered from her.   Despite the good drinks the bad service is enough to make anyone avoid this place.  BOOO CELESTE!
