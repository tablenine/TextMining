When my grandparents first took me to Philippe's, a tradition before Dodger games, I was four years old and I asked my grandma "can't we afford a nicer place?"  Now, 20 years later, I'm taking friends from college and making a point to stop in on every trip home.. . Although my last trip almost started with fistacuffs . . . to everyone that goes . . . there is a line for EVERY cash register, not one line trying to merge like we're on the 405.  The man I passed on my way to the front of an empty line did not believe this to be the case and became quite snippy.  But I didn't care . . . my lunch awaited.. . Double-Dipped Lamp Sandwhich with Jack Cheese . . . Cole Slaw (extra juice) . . . and a Pepsi . . . but we're not quite perfect until we add the hot mustard.  It's the kind of hot you feel go straight up your nose and hit you in the back of the head . . . . ah, PERFECTION.  . . But your trip to this classic LA establishment doesn't end until you stop at the candy counter for dessert . . . vintage, classic, and current favorites make this tempting stop on your way home an absolute must . . . my favorite , , , 5 Caramels for a $1.
