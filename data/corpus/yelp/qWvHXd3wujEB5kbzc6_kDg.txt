I've been here once, it was awesome, and I will be back many, many more times now that my girlfriend is moving down here.. . I got a somewhat "traditional" dog, chili cheese dog. Yummy stuff. She got a dog with guacamole on it. Sound disgusting? It probably should have been, but it was delicious instead.. . Looking forward to coming back here in a couple of weekends.
