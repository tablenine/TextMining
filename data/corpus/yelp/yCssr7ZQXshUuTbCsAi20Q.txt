Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Alcove is a staple of my life in L.A. Enough said. The turkey burger is A+, and some cake and coffee on a Sunday night to start the week reminds one that their life is good.. . Sometimes I branch out and try a different cake, and sometimes I get disappointed - like when I had the lemon coconut cake on Sunday - but the selection is so diverse that I always make up for it with a strawberry shortcake another day.
