Incredible... what a delightful birthday surprise (ok fine..it wasn't really my birthday, but it sure felt like it!)  Introduced by a fellow yelper, Osteria Mozza reminded me how thrilling fine dining on a whim can be.  ;). . Strolling into the restaurant in casual jeans and  *gasp* no reservations, we were lucky to snag a seat at the mozzarella bar right in front Nancy Silverton.  What a treat!. . The waiters were very attentive, guiding us through the menu and offering us endless fresh bread between our courses, which I happily took full advantage of.  . . We started with the grilled octopus, which leaned towards the salty side.  Eat it with the potatoes, it takes away the saltiness.  We then had the goat cheese ravioli, recommended by the waiter... delicious!  For my entree, I had the whole grilled orata, which was pretty yum but paled in comparison to my yelper friend's juicy tender grilled beef tagliata. Now this rocked my palette...  and I couldn't help stealing bites of it between my sips of chianti... what a great pair. Yum yum.   . . Highly recommended.. I'll definitely go again.. next time sticking to the proper dress code and maybe going for my actual birthday :)
