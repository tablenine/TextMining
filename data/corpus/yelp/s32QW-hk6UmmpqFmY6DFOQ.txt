I'm not sure what I expected, but F20 was a pleasant surprise. As I just moved here to Hotlanta, I decided to start with the eating establishments closest to me. I've now eaten here twice, and both times have been very happy with the food and service. My first visit I ordered a BLT on whole wheat and the wild mushroom soup. Both were excellent! On my second trip I really branched out and got the Chicken BLT on whole wheat...and the wild mushroom soup. I loved it both times! Also, I like the casual atmosphere and the terrific service I received. Â  The menu also has a lot of variety to it and F20 somehow found a way to trick me into eating sprouts without complaint! I foresee returning here several times!
