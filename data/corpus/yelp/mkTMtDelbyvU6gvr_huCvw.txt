Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant

I love love love this place!. . I used to go to California Shabu Shabu in HB and Yojie's in Cerritos.. but I'm hooked on Shabu Shabu House. . . The portions are huge! it's around $14 for a Medium and $17 for a Large. No additional charge for extra dipping sauces or rice!. . Best time to go is before they open.. the sign up sheet gets you in at the openining. or you can swing on by around 8.. the wait isnt too bad. Like any other restaurant.. avoid the peak hours!. . The Iced Coffee is yummy too :) . Great for dessert!
