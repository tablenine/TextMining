Category: Bakeries
This place is definitely the best bakery in LA! and if I can only go one place in LA, this will definitely the place!. Love the cheese rolls, guava and cheese, potato balls! Their cakes and cupcakes are awecome! they are much cheaper than in other stores! . I always get their Red Velvet Cupcake!!! everything here is so good and worth the money! Unlike other places that is just totally ripoff. Love Portos!
