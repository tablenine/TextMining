Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
I received an email from my good friends a Yelp about Breakfast spots in Los Angeles. So I chose the closest location which was Square One dinning. It didn't take long to arrive however, the location only offers street parking therefore it took me a couple spins around the block to actually find a parking space. Metered parking is located on the actual street of the restaurant, hopefully you'll get lucky and find a spot if you decide to dine there... Anywhoo!  The place is small and quaint with somewhat a rustic feel. As I entered the door I automatically sat myself because I noticed the menus on the table already, so I just put 2 and 2 together and it equaled seat yourself...LOL!! The waitress was nice and took my order. I ordered the French toast with Bourbon pecan maple syrup topped with vanilla whipped cream...Yea I know, that's a lot!  I also ordered coffee and water. The water came in a vintage bottle (I love Vintage), and a small glass to pour your water into. My coffee was very strong so asked the waitress to take it off my bill because I didn't drink it, besides I didn't want to pay $3.00 for coffee I didn't drink. Inside seating is a lil tight however; there is a nice patio area out back where you can dine as well.  The food was good, and I suggest this place if you are looking for a great breakfast spot. Well that's the low down around town...do you want to be down??....Smooches!!
