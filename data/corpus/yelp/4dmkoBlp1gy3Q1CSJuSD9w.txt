Restaurant: La Fonda Latina
Category: Latin American
For some reason my boyfriend and I thought we didn't like La Fonda for almost 2 years.  I think we went there once and declared it not worthy of our money.  We were wrong.. . We went there thinking it was Mexican food, but it's not.  They've got great Spanish food along with other typically Mexican selections on the menu.  For an app, we got the fried plantain chips with garlic dipping sauce.  Yum.  So good and so cheap at $2.50 for a small order!  We shared the Mango and pork salad and vegetable paella.  The paella I had in Spain was better, but this is Atlanta, not Spain.  I probably won't order it again, but it was good.  The salad was really good.  The margaritas were great (I actually don't love margaritas unless they're frozen, but we ordered them on the rocks because my bf is trying to class me up a little).  A great place for a summer evening out on the patio!
