Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
My boyfriend and I like our Thai food spicy.  But, on most occasions, they will take one look at my pale, white boyfriend and bring the food bland.  Sad to say, this reaction is probably from years of Caucasians not realizing the difference between "spicy" and "flavorful.". . Anyhow, Palms Thai is my favorite Thai place in LA, hands down.  I say "super spicy" and it comes back tasting like they were cooking for the grandmothers, cooked to perfection!  My spicy mint beef is on fire, and we love it!  I took my parents here and they love it too.. . I remember this place back when it was on the east side of the freeway and 1/4 of the size it is now.  Back then, heaven bless you if you wanted a booth or a table for six.  I think two months was the reservation time for a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.  Now, they're bigger than that, and it's still crowded on weekends.  But, can you blame them?  They're tasty, quick, and reasonably priced for Hollywood.. . The food comes quick because everyone working the restaurant is connected, little ear pieces.  Thus, someone in the back is really taking your order when they repeat it back to you and if you ask for water, there's another waiter bringing it to your table, whom gets it there the second the first one turns away or even while the first one is still talking to you.  Their efficient, and it is unparalleled to anything else I've seen in LA.  ...The only bad part to that is, with groves of people at the door, they're pushy for you to leave.  But, take your time and enjoy your meal.  I know the people that sat there before did, and the ones after will too. :). .
