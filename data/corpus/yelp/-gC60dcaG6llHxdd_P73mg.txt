We visited here on a whim Thursday night for dinner.  We'd been here before, but long enough that I didn't remember too much about it.  . . The meal started off with some red sangria.  The sangria was ok, but a bit disappointing.  It was too sweet, and the fruits inside were canned, not fresh.  I'd recommend getting a different drink (maybe a margarita), especially if you're a hardcore sangria fan (do these exist?).. . The salsa and chips, on the other hand, were quite fresh and very tasty.  We finally decided on a meal - we shared the Molcajete Carmelita for two.  Now, I'm from Baltimore and am of Polish descent, so I can't comment on the authenticity of the dish, but man it was good, and the portions were huge.  On the menu, it says you can get either chicken or steak in the dish, but we were given a mix.  It's one of the few dishes I've ever had that has stayed (temperature-wise) hot during the entire meal, mostly because of the Molcajete that it is cooked in.  The flavors were delicious, and overall it was an awesome change from your typical Mexican fare.  If you're making the trip out to Zocalo, I'd definitely recommend getting this dish.  The service was also excellent.  Our waiter was attentive and very friendly, and for me, that is always a big deal.. . Going outside of the meal we got, the menu as a whole is a bit overpriced.  The food isn't too complex (aside from the dish we ordered), but it's fairly pricey.  That, combined with the sub-par sangria we got, was making me really think I was about to give this place a 3, but the service was killer and saved the fourth star for me.
