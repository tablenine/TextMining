This place is Uuuuber crowded on Saturday mornings! your lucky if you can get a table with an hour.  I have one thing to say to for anyone reading this "CREAMY GRITS" . . Yes their grits are dang good! I've had them with various breakfast platters even if I had to order them on the side.  I also like the restaurants health conscious approach by serving chicken sausage, and oatmeal pancakes with peach compote.. . Like I said it's really crowded but it is a MUST TRY!
