Went and tried Espresso a la Mode.  When I ordered it around10 PM the cashier person kindly warned me I might have a hard time falling asleep after having this dessert.  Well...I had it anyway and went to bed around midnight.  No problem!  It was delicious and well worth the try.  Now I need to go back and try one of their all-so-famous sandwiches.
