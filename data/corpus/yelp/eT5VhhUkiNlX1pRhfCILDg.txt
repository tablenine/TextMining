Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I love Kitsch'n! I come here everytime I'm in town despite how my friend Jaime feels about the place!. No matter what I order for breakfast, I always get one pancake with it, because they have good pancakes..  From the retro 70's decor to the imaginative menu, Kitsch'n is a great place to go for breakfast, lunch or dinner.. Check out their Comfort Food dinner specials!
