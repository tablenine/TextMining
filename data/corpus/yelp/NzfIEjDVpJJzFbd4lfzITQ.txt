Heard about a 2lb burrito and it caught my attention.. . As far as taste goes. Its pretty good, but it costs allot. 18 bucks for some but the asada burrito is 23. I mean definitely worth a try. Feeds 2-3 people depending on how hungry you are.. . Place is really small. I guess getting seated depends on how lucky you get. Parking lot is ok neighborhood is... well its not scary but its definitely not beverly hills.. . If your local stop by every now and then, service is good, food tastes good too. But I'm from the OC so the drive here and back is a little out of the way. Probably wouldn't get that burrito again tho haha i mean for 23 bucks you can get like 4+ regular burritos depending on where you go. So that's about the same if not more.
