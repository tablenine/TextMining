Have been on the search for good Happy Hour joints on the east side and I think I've found a special one.  Ciudad offers $4 drink specials including delicious margaritas, mojitos, and wine.. Also have $4 taco plates that come with two small tacos.. . Yummy tapas.  We got rabbit and ham croquettes, calamari &amp; white beans, and lamb meatballs.  Also got 2 plates of tacos and 4 drinks total.  Spent about $60, the food was delicious... stuffed for the rest of the night.  . . Delish!  A great way to afford Ciudad without the $30 dinner entree!. I'll be back.
