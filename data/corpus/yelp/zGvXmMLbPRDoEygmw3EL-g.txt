Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I had a hard time with this review.  I was introduced to this restaurant by some friends last year and now have been here over a dozen times.  The dumplings are the best I have had outside of China.  The dumplings are made with soup in them.  When you bite into them you not only get the great taste of the dumpling but then the explosion of flavors from the soup inside.  The service is acceptable at best.  Good luck getting anything after you order, so order all up front.  The food gets 5 stars but the service gets 3 so I am going to compromise with 4 stars.  Make sure you try the Shrimp and pork shaomai, the pork shaomai and the green beans.
