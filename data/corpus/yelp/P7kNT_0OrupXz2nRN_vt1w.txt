im an avid fan of dirty dogs. i've been to a few hot dog restaurants and usually end up disappointed (price and "me like" factor) since they don't live up to dirty dogs. i haven't been to Pink's either... someday!. . nonetheless, i like this place. it's sort of industrial or actually it does have that austrian feel to it (i came from austria... i hate germany hehehe j/k). . water tasted funny =P ordering was rather simple though the cashier wasn't paying attention to me but he heard my order without me yelling... which i find very impressive. menu is simple to follow.. . ordered rattlesnake, sundried tomato, fries, apple and something. all very delicious. price wise is great compared to some of the other hot dog places i've been too. they do have a bar (not sure if it's full bar but they have beer for sure). i guess they have a spot for a DJ too.. . it's no dirty dog but definitely a place to come back to.
