THE BEST. Just make sure to plan ahead and try to come early for lunch/dinner or accept the wait, and you will be in heaven. . . The ramen is perfect: rich, salty broth, great pork, wonderful noodles that don't feel instant. It's fun to sit at the counter and watch them make it in those big, steaming vats. . . I always succumb to the temptation of the combo deals, which allows you to add things like fried rice (excellent), chicken teriyaki or tuna rolls, but be warned: it's a lot of food. The good news is that I tried taking my leftover ramen to go and it was totally still good when reheated!. . There's nothing that can brighten a cold, gray day better than that yellow awning in Little Tokyo. One of my all-time favorites!
