Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
A great Argentine restaurant on Melrose Ave with some very tasty empanadas--my favorite!. . As a child, my mother worked as a waitress at many restaurants, one of them an amazing Argentine place in Claremont (they're no longer there). For years, I'd been searching for that comforting, savory, delicious taste and then I found Lala's! If the ham and cheese empanadas and milanesa napolitana tastes great and then their skirt steak, tortilla de papa and chorizo taste that delicious--I'm sold!. . They're open late and the ambiance is perfect for a date, casual business meeting, or a group dinner with friends. I love the covered outdoor patio, aside from all them pesky smokers, but indoor seating is also available and always comfy and dimly lit.. . The downfalls? Well, it gets pretty busy at Lala's, so the service can be iffy depending on the day and time that you attend. Nevertheless, based on flavor alone, Lala's is my first choice for Argentine cuisine any day!
