Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Went to Umami Burger last night. Their website and Yelp's page for this restaurant both say it closes at 10pm. We arrived at 8:45pm. We didn't even get inside. The valet attendant of all people told us that the restaurant is not serving people anymore because the restaurant was full. I told him i didn't mind waiting and he said that was what he was told to tell any more customers, Now, i can understand if the place took reservations (which would then be funny in itself for a burger joint) and was full, but its a burger restaurant! Typically restaurants seat until closing time or close to it, but I've never heard of restaurants gauge Â how many more burgers they need to cook in order to close at a certain time. I hope this is not a new trend. So based on my imagination, the burger sucked and the service was terrible. Get there 4 hours before closing time so you pad yourself in case you need to wait or get locked out. Sorry, during these times, customer service is golden. I won't be going back.
