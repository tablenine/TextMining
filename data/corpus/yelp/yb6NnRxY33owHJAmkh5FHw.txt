I hate that some people give this restaurant a bad review because they don't like the way the food tastes. If you're not used to vegan food it can be very... different tasting. For some that can mean bad. For me that means delicious! I am not a vegan but I do eat vegan food fairly regularly and I have to say that compared to any other vegan restaurant I've been to this one is BY FAR the best. It has such a wide range of menu items there's no way you can go wrong! My favorite is the Real Food Meal, followed very closely by any mexican style dishes they make, and of course their desserts... pretty much everything there is awesome! . Even when you don't compare it to other vegan places it's still one of the best restaurants in the city. And best of all, you can eat like a pig and not feel guilty! I bet you can't think of any other spot you can say that about...
