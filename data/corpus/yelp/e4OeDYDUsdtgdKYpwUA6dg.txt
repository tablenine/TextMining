LOVE IT.  Atmoshpere is cute comfy italian, top notch food, huge portions and everything is good. The seafood that was in my pasta dish was so fresh and tasty.  Excellent thick creamy sauces but also fresh and light tomato sauces, something for everyone.  Been there many times and always like everything.  Cute patio for the summer and good prices for what you get.
