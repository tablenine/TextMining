This places makes a pretty hearty and tasty vegetarian burrito for a sober person. The boyfriend got a super beef burrito which was super ridiculous in size, definitely enough for 2 people. We chose to sit down, got the standard chips and salsa, and decent service. Depending on the time of day, the people watching can be pretty good.
