Ooh~  this is a tough one (-_-);. The little finger for my mouse pointer is hovering between 4 and 5 stars.... orange, red, ok orange, no red... what should I do?  Should I do it?  What, I should??  Ackk!!  OK, I did it~  5 stars!!. . No offense Santouka, you're ramen is aiight, but Daikokuya is the bomb.  No wait, it's more like new-kyoo-lihr!  I'd have to say it's right up there with Shin Sen Gumi, but there are a few differences:. - pork broth, a little lighter and saltier. - noodles, more al dente (similar to choosing "hard" at SSG). - toppings, default are bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, green onion, and hard boiled egg. - pork slices, look like they are from the belly with stripes of fat but melts in your mouth (moister than SSG which are just slices of pork meat). . Other items I tried were the fried rice (part of combination) and gyoza appetizer.  The fried rice had little bits of pork, but was not as flavorful as I had hoped.  I prefer the one at SSG which has chopped takana (pickled mustard greens) in it.  The square shaped gyoza is plump, loaded with meat, and juicy (gosh that sounds so wrong, but it tastes so good).. . The wait on a Saturday night was around 45mins, but it was worth it.  I was so hungry I inhaled my food~  Although I reached maximum stretching capacity on my spandex pants, luckily I had a friend who helped roll me out of the restaurant.
