Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Extremely popular amongst the Korean BBQ-inexperienced, loathed by those that know good Korean BBQ.  I am of the the latter.  I'm going to do all you yelpers a favor and strongly discourage you from going here.  The meat is the worst quality of all Korean BBQ places I've been to and service is atrocious.  Try SootBoolGuirim on Vermont and 3rd (my current fav), MuDungSan on Western and just south of Olympic, Tahoe galbi on Wilshire and Wilton, or ANY other place besides Manna.  The only reason to go to Manna is if you have a huge party of like 20 people or more and can tolerate bad meat.  I can't stand when people say they love Manna.  It sucks!  Argh!
