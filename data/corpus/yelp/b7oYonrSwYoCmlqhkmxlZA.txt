I would like to clarify that I do not eat indian food...ever. I'm an asian food kind of gal.I have eaten indian food twice, one of the 2 times was here, and whatever I got turned me off from a whole culture of food.  This time I though I went with people who knew how to order indian food and I really enjoyed myself.  I would like to come clean and tell y'all that my friends knew the owners so we got hooked up but that didn't influence my decision much.  I would also like to say that my friend called this place indian fusion so you traditionalists might be turned off by the contemporary cusine.  Anyways we ordered a ton of different dishes.  My fav was chicken 69 (or some other number... my head is just stuck on this one for now;)).  We also got a scrumptious shrimp dish and some flat bread with what seemed like pico de gallo on top. The flat bread was okay but got soggy quickly.  I also ordered roti canai.  It is a chicken curry type dish that comes with a pancake type thing.  I have to say that I always get this as an appetizer at Penang and I like their version much better.  They are totally different though and I'm not sure whose is more "correct".  The Penang version is more of a pancake with dipping sauce witha piece of chicken and potato in it whereas this version is chicken eaten with the pancake.  Oh well they were both good, I just prefer Penangs.  Lastly I order a Lion Stout from Sri Lanka and it was damn good.  The best thing about this spot is the killer jazz band they had here. I am not sure if it is a Friday night thing but i would come back just for them.
