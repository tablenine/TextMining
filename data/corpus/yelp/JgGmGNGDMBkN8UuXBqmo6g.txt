Geisha House is the epitome of over-rated LA-chic dining.  Just because it's been featured in movies and reality TV shows doesn't mean it's good unless Hugh Hefner and his GFs were getting better quality food and service than we did.  . . I ordered an eggplant dish.  It was literally 5 slices of eggplant the size of a quarter with a dot of sauce on top each piece.  It was cold and shriveled looking and sad.  My man ordered the Kobe beef.  It was like 6 slices of beef the size of a stick of gum and it was about 16 bucks.  I don't exactly remember the price of everything but I know it was ridiculous.  The service was horrible.  Just because I'm not a celebrity, doesn't mean I don't deserve good service.  . . The only high point is the huge selection of sakes and the help of a "sake sommelier".  The only cool guy in that place.  My husband was hooked on the sake and before we knew it we had popped open half a dozen of sake along with friends, setting us back $1600 back.. . Anyway, aside from getting tossed on the best sake I've ever had, everything else was sub-par.  I'm glad I got a chance to check out what all the buzz is about but I'd never go here again.
