I've never had to wait to eat here ... odd, bc ppl are always telling me how they love Versailles but always have to wait for a table ... maybe this Venice location is bigger and the service more efficient (?). . Don't know ... don't care. My mouth salivates when I think about their delicious juicy roasted chicken with onion dressed in vinegar salt and pepper - and I am NOT an onions-girl! In fact, I absolutely HATE all raw onions - except for the ones served at Versailles. . . Of course I don't pay that much attention to other dishes when I dine at Versailles - but their maduros/platanos are pretty damn good - not overly sweet.. . They could definitely use a little help in the decor department... but I guess that sort of hole-in-the-wall, too-cool-to-care-bc-we're-rollin-in-the-dough atmosphere adds to the charm.
