I luvs me some Porto's!  Thank my lucky stars it's a hop, skip and a jump away.. . Seriously, their fruit tarts are to DIE for!  I've bought several of them for parties and sure enough, the compliments flow, flow, flow.  Trust me, this is the place for fruit tarts.  Whole Foods or Gelson's will charge an arm and a leg ($40-$45) for a 8" round where as Porto's, you'll walk with a 11" round one for about $20.  I've also had their triple chocolate mousse cake which is so light and creamy and yes, oh so good!!. . The lines can get pretty long and trust me, the first time I went in there and saw the line out the door I thought, "oh hail naw!"  But if you're patient enough, you'll see the lines move pretty fast.  . . Of course I'll be back.  In fact, I'll be there before Thanksgiving to pick up some of their famous potato balls and maybe one of their seasonal cakes this time since it's ya know, thanksgiving and all.
