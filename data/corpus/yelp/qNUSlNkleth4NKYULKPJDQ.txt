I think it should be illegal to give Canters a bad review. This LA landmark is the place to go after hours or anytime really if you are craving any deli-lious type sandwich. Just be prepared to not count calories and woof up those pickles and reuben / pastrami sandwiches! The only thing I don't like much on their menu is their fries and if you want pastries better to try earlier in the day than at 11pm like I did (bit stale). . . Definitely a place to take visitors - for starring at the mad ceiling and scoffing up.
