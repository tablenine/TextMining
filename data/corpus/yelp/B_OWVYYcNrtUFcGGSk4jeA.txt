Home Bristo.... . A little gem in Lakeview (actually in the heart of Boystown) that unfortunately I visit only once a year. However, I do look forward to that visit once a year. It's usually around late June for my friend's (Brett) birthday. Even though the place is very small (or what people like to call cozy) it as lots of personality and cute waiters, plus it's BYOB. . . Food:. I usally go with a big group so we get to try lots of the dishes a la family style. My favorite by far is the Sauteed Garlic and Escargot for starters and the Cider Brined Loin of Pork for entree. They have so many dishes that stand out because they do a great job of surprising your tatse buds with a mixture of sweetness and spice. However, I highly recommend the two I suggested. . . Service:. . Staff is very attentive and friendly. I really enjoyed that they always kept an eye on the table and made sure if we needed anything they were available. . . BYOB:. Best thing in Chicago. . I'm not sure if they have a corkage fee, but either way go BYOB. You'll save lots of money in the end. . . Yippee for HB!
