Hmmmm....Gioco....where do I start?. . Good: you take reservations on . http://opentable.com. . Bad: no reservation was needed on a Monday night--the place was empty. . Good: eats much cheaper than anticipated (about $25/person incl wine). Bad: all reviews scared us into being cheapies when we got there. . Good: food was tasty and went down easy. Bad: food also came out a little *too* easy next day and kept me at home all morning
