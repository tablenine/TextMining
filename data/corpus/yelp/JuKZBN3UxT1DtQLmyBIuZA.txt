i had to do it.  i just had to.  i know over one hundred of you foo's have already whipped folks up in to a frenzy with the glowing reports of the $15 sashimi lunch special.  but i finally tried it...braved the long lunch line on a thursday and succeeded in consuming such an amazing value for fresh sashimi this side of the pacific that my frugal chinese inner child was weeping with ecstasy all the way back to work.. . next time, i'll do what my dining buddy did: order the sushi rice on the side in place of the basic white rice accompaniment.
