4.75 stars...kekeke.... . You think if I ate here everyday...I'd get fat(ter)?? . . This is one of the best meals I've had in awhile. Of course the BF and I had to wait about 20 minutes but it was worth it. After watching Wicked at the Pantages, which was friggin awesome by the way, we decided to check out what the hype was all about at Pizzeria Mozza. Well...it lived up to the hype cuz everything was so so so so good. . . The two of us shared everything.... . -Meatballs in marinara sauce...this was delicious...it seriously melted in your mouth.. -Chopped salad...salami, parmagiano reggiano, garbanzo, cherry tomatoes, lettuce...the usual chopped salad ingredients but it was so fresh and the dressing was fabulous. I could eat this everyday. Seriously.. -Fennel sausage pizza...this pizza dough was like no other. Thin crust with a chewy and soft dough. Wow~! The flavor was definitely there...but the reason for the 0.25 star deduction was because it was too oily. Our server told us that the best way to eat this was to mash the sausages on and while this was questionable to me...I did it anyway...honestly I don't think it made much difference. It just made the oils ooze out and made the pizza oilier. It was still good though. Haha. . -Butterscotch budino...what the hell is in this thing and why does it taste so damn good?? Yes...its heavenly...but be ready to feel like you've gained 10 pounds from just eating this. . . Our server was friendly and attentive. The wait wasn't so bad. Definitely will come back. Oh...Osteria...you're up next~!!
