Don't go here for the sushi. . . Let me modify that.  If you are a occasional sushi eater who thinks that Ru San's is good, and you like the concept of the "free"  sushi special at happy hour on Wednesdays, then you will be satisfied.  . . But if you are sophisticated enough to know the names Urusawa, Matsuhisa, Masa and (I can't help myself) Soto, then you will find the sushi here to be fine but not even close to being special.  If you make this a destination thinking that you are going to get top quality sushi here, you will be disappointed.  With respect to local comparisons, it isn't even close to being competitive with Atlanta's best sushi of the moment (Hayakawa).. . I mention this because many of these reviews seem to focus on the sushi, but this isn't (and isn't trying to be) a sushi only restaurant.  It is a fusion restaurant, and the good news is that some of the other dishes are very good - the hot and sour soup (surprisingly) and some of the entrees.  And the sushi is edible, so if you are nearby, don't want to drive and need a sushi fix, you could do worse.  . . In my view, it really is a 3.75 star place.  A very nice neighborhood place with interesting decor and nice happy hour specials.  Not a place where the quality of the food compels you to drive all the way across town (that's what the specials are for, and they do pack people in).   Bottom line:  I've been here several times so far and I will go back, but I don't focus on the sushi.
