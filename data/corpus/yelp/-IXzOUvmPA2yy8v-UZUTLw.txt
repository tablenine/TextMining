What can I say that hasnt already been stated.  Al was there and came over to greet us.  Brought us a sampler appitizer plate and everything on it was delicious.  We needed more pita to completely clear the plate.  The gyro was tasty and the tatziki was creamy and had a wonderful flavor.  I had a gyro and the BF had the falafel.  Both were great and of course we were treated to a little baklava bite after the meal.  This place has a lot of charm and not a big pricetag, unlike most of the restaurants in the area.  I will defineitely be bag again.
