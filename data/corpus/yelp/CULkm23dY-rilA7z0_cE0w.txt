Two stars because of the great burger. If it were the service I was reviewing it might not rate a one star.. I know you have to order at the bar, but after you pay $24 ($4 tip included for the non-service) and you get a burger, fries and SMALL beer and you ask the busser for some condiments, I can understand not serving ketchup or tabasco but Jesus Christ, Â WHEN YOU ASK FOR WATER AND ARE TOLD YOU HAVE TO GO UP TO THE BAR AND GET IT YOURSELF after your food is placed in front of you and you spend the $$$ to sit in a noisy ass restaurant with people who have no concept of how loud they are talking-no screaming- for no . apparent reason to the person next to them...not a good experience.. Basically the staff is there to take your order (not at your table), place the food in front of you and clear dishes. Nothing else. Easy f'ing job.. Doubt if I would go back (even though the burger rates at least 4 stars) the service brought that rating way down.
