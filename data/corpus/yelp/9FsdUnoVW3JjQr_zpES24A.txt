Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Umami Burger is an interesting experience... first of all, I would like to say, it doesn't really taste like a burger at all... I guess that's the Umami-ness of the experience.  It is good however, and each burger is made with care.  Overall I enjoyed it-- but I'm not sure I'd wait 30 minutes for one, and there will be those that love it and hate it-- the only way to know is to go for yourself.
