Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
Cut is easily one of the most overrated restaurants in the city.  . . The interior decor is nice enough, but the staff is snooty to the point of rude, and more importantly, the steak is utterly mediocre.  I went for my birthday and splurged on the kobe steak, a $160 piece of meat, and, without hyperbole, it was no better than a fridge cut from Ralphs.  I lived in Japan and have had amazing Kobe beef.  This was nothing like that.  . . Moreover the wine suggestions and appetizers were equally underwhelming.. . If you are into bragging about going to an expensive, well-known restaurant, go, but if you actually know what a good steak is like, don't bother.  This place is a rip-off.. . My suggestion....instead of paying $160 there, go to Bristol Farms' butcher and pay $30 for a prime steak and then go and buy a  $25 Zin at the Wine House.  You'll come away much more satisfied and much less poor.
