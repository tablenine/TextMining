Restaurant: Desta Ethiopian Kitchen
Category: Ethiopian
I live about a mile away from Desta, and love their convenient drive-thru option.  I can call in my order, wait 10 minutes, hop in the car and be home enjoying wonderful Ethiopian food in a short time.  The restaurant itself is tiny inside which is why I prefer take-out, but it is very quaint and nicely decorated despite its small size.  They also have a deck for outdoor dining.  . . The staff is friendly and the place appears to be very clean...you can see into the kitchen, especially from the drive-thru window area, and its reassuring to know that it looks cleaner than the average restaurant kitchen by far!. . The menu is a little bit different than most other Ethiopian restaurants, but as a vegetarian, my options appeared exactly the same as everywhere else.  I get the vegetarian combo and eat every bite despite the fact that it is almost enough food for a light meal for 2!
