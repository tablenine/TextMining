Desta I have to say had some amazing food!!! I went with my Ethopian friend to make sure I get the true taste of Ethopian food!! Well trust me Desta did not disappoint!!. We got the fish Tidbit and the lamb tidbit...omg I have to say the Fish was reallyy good!! It just melts in ur mouth and is soo yummy that it leaves you wanting more! The injera was something totaly new to me...and to get the total Ethopian experience, I had to eat it all with my hands, something about eating food with ur hands...just makes the food taste even better!!! I was soo impressed. Â To finish it off we got some Ethopian ginge tea....add a tiny bit of sugar, and trust me...the tea was just perfect!!!. The only reason I gave this place a 4 and not a 5 star rating is the decor...def they tried to do it up but it was not up to par, but its a place you def go for the food and not the ambience!!!. Def going back again :)
