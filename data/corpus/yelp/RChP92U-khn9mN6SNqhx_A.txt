Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
Penny's is overpriced. $1.25 for rice is bullshit, utter utter BULLSHIT . ( 2 stars for having to pay for rice). The only thing I'd ever get here is the Tom Kha Kai soup, $4.00. Everything else is medicore, Â but sadly because of its location I've been here one too many times. I feel like a cheater after every time I've gone here...and there isnt even a regular Thai spot near that i"ve been too. I feel like I'm a traiter to everything asian. I walk out always with a slight hint of shame.
