Bad for SO many reasons:. . 1. Slow service: we ordered raw meat, I'm not sure what takes so long to prepare. It also seemed to be a LOT of work for them to be serving people. Â (slamming glass onto table, not attentive service, asked for tea 3 times, service person's cell phone ringing loudly, etc).. . 2. Traditional small plates? Low in variety and not very tasty.. . 3. BBQ service process? Both my bf and I had to move over 1 seat after having situated ourselves comfortably. Then a random man came in with coals... Interesting but took too long and having to wait to have someone cook our food was frustrating.. . 4. Quality of Food?. - Rice was stale - there was a hard/crusty layer of rice on top. . - Meat quality poor! Beef was WAY too chewy, and the chicken was not good either.. . 5. Check - they scoffed and said my card didn't go through, as if I was trying to trick them. The meal was already expensive. The card worked before-hand and this made me nervous I was actually wrong. But no.... I went next door afterwards and it worked just fine.. . 6. Afterward? My bf and I are allergic to MSG. There definitely seemed to be something in there that didn't agree with our stomachs.. . If I could, I'd probably give this place 0 stars: I've lost $44, rude both during and at the close of service, left with an upset, yet still hungry stomach.
