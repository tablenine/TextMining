Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
Another A+ from a satisfied customer.  I've been going to Porto's since my friend introduced me to their potato balls, and my life has not been the same since taking that first bite.  . . Potato balls are definitely one of the highlights, but it is not everything.  Their selection of bread and pastries will turn the carb-shunners of the world into born-again bread eaters.  Guava strudel, guava with cheese strudel, croissants, meat pie, potato balls, plain bread, awesome bread, short bread, tall bread.  . . For all you sweets lovers, yes, they do have mousses and mini cakes, creme brulee, you name it.  It is hard to resist buying up the entire selection, because, oh did I mention?  Prices are super super super good.. . Cakes here are excellent as well.  I take a cake home to my parents for special occasions and they are always impressed at the design and the taste of it.  A++ because my parents are hard to please.  Believe me, I know.. . The only thing about this place are the lines.  But do not fret, you will need all the time in the world to decide on what to buy because this store is an indecisive person's nightmare!  Plus, a huge line is a testament to how crazy good this place is.  Fantastic!
