Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
One of the best ramen placed I have eaten at. Even though it is a far ride from where I live, my friends and I always go here for ramen at this little cozy restaurant and its worth the drive there. I have only tried the ramen and the dumpling which I was never disappointed by. The ramen is worth its price seeing that it comes in a bowl thats the size of my head, probably even bigger. haha.. . a great place to get your 'yummy" at a cheap price and a really full tummy.
