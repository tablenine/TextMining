Duck and bacon sausage. Two of my favorite things smushed together into one casing.. . Wow. . . The really unique thing about this place is just selection of sausages you can choose from. Rattlesnake? Alligator? Buffalo? If you want to try out something but don't think you're ready to have an entire dish revolve around this exotic meat, come here and try it as a sausage!. . It is rather expensive for what is basically an exotic hot dog but definitely worth the experience, at least once. Very hipster crowd. It's in the art district of downtown L.A., which explains the hipster crowd and then some. Rather bare bones sort of decor with hard seats and exposed walls. But all of this can be overlooked by the novelty of having a duck and bacon sausage. Mmm..... . The only complaint I had was how long it took for our order to arrive. I went during the lunch hour but the place wasn't even full. The line was reasonable. And yet, we still had to wait something like 20 minutes for our order to arrive. It was just sausages and fries! It should have came in a much more timely fashion. This might be the only thing that prevents me from going back. I really found it unreasonable to wait that long for our food.
