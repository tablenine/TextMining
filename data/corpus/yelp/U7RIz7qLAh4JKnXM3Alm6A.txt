Superb service (5 stars).. Value (3.5 stars).. Quality (4 stars).. . Tried this restaurant for the first time on a Friday evening and I was very impressed with the service. Top-notch service here!  Very attentive (on our food, side dishes, and drinks), accomodating (quickly seated us to a different table when we asked), and cheery attitude.. . The complimentary side dishes included the warm cheese bread (yummy!), fried bananas (hit or miss), crispy hot polenta (very good!), and mashed potatoes  (tasted bland).. . The veggies from the salad bar were fresh and tasty. The following from the salad bar were tasty: the Mushrooms, Heart of Palms, Salt &amp; Lemon seasoned slices of Cucumbers, Red &amp; Yellow Bell Peppers, and Beets.. . Now, the meats: Most of the meats we requested were medium rare but were tough to chew or too dry. The ones that were tender included the filet migon, the filet migon wrapped with bacon, and  the pork rib. . . I too, as Brian K's has done in his review, advise trying out the restaurant or going during the day because it's about $20 less per person. Lunch: $34.50; Dinner: $56.50. . . Just as Bernice C. said in her review, there are other AYCE Brazillian restaurants in LA for lesser price. However, you won't get the same type of service, decor, and freshness.  Again, if I go back, it would be for lunch. . . Parking: Valet ($5) or meter (limited).
