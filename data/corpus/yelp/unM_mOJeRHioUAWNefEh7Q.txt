Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
I visited Fred's with a co-worker after he brought in the Seattle train on Thursday night (late). We first stopped by Cafe 101, but the parking lot was packed, and this was the next closest place I could think of.. . Drinks... I ordered 2 Cokes.. the first one was flat.. . For Dinner/Breakfast I chose the "Eggs in the Hole." Instead of toast, I had an English Muffin, suggested by our friendly waitress. . The English Muffin and eggs were good, but arrived at room temp. I was so hungry I didn't care enough to complain however. Hash browns good, not great, but the bacon was MOST EXCELLENT! Big pieces of real bacon, not too thinly sliced = big smile on my face. My co-worker had the club sandwich, loved it, and was holding his stomach until I delivered him back to the crew hotel. . . Fred's is always packed, but luckily we stood for only a few minutes before spotting an open seat (indoors). . . 4 stars next time if my hot meal is served hot. ;). . The restaurant is kept clean, bussers and other wait staff are attentive and friendly, and the area is good and safe.
