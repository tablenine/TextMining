I will admit, the venue was a totally hip hollywood style restaurant/bar/lounge, yet the food wasnt as good as i expected it to be...dont get me wrong the sushi was good...but nothing too outstanding...they have a large menu, and yet i still want to try other things there, but the reason for going, i would say is the vibe.... . do make reservations - although the place is huge, it was packed...they also seated us in some small corner which made me a feel not as cozy as i wanted to..... . overall experience...i would go again with a group/friends to drink and eat...but i wouldnt say that you should go for the food....
