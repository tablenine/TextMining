YAY!! This is hands down the best Mexican place in Atlanta. Every-time i am in town i make sure to plan a lunch stop at No Mas! The salsa, with a hint of mystique, is just the beginning of the wonderful foods you'll experience, accompanied by really great customer service! I highly recommend No Mas!
