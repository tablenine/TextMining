WOW!!!! The food here is great ! My favorite is the scoes' #1 which is a 1/4 of a chicken with two waffles. The candy yams and mac n cheese are so so delicious. You cant go wrong with anything on the menu. I prefer this location cuz its the closer one to me but parking is tough. They only have street parking or you can pay at a nearby lot. Waiting to be seated can be long but its worth it. Do yourself a favor and stop in.
