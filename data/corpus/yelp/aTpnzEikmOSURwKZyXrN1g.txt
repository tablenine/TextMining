This tiny, unpretentious, and friendly Taiwanese street food sandwich restaurant is a good place for a quick bite when you are in LES! Everyone working here seems friendly, enthusiastic and hard-working, which made me want to support their business more. Â I had their $9 signature sandwich "Haus Bao", the skirt steak sandwich. Loved the sweet and soft steamed buns! The meat was tender but the flavor didn't really hit the spot...It was good, but it didn't have the rich flavor I had expected. Nevertheless, I appreciate that they use quality meat, I learned that they use the special all natural non-antibiotic beef from Niman Ranch(there's a catalogue on the table about this beef farm) so I give them extra star. I'd go back again and try different flavor next time!
