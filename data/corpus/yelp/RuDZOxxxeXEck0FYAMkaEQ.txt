Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
We were not sure if it was open because you have to walk through a maze of construction. We were the start of the dinner rush because we were greeted by barrage of managers, servers and hostesses. They all stopped what they were talking about and immediately greeted us. We had the sweetest server that was on top of all our needs. . . My boyfriend and I both ordered breakfast, pancakes, and they were good. The food came fast and we weren't rushed as we sat and chatted for awhile over pancakes. My overall experience was good. The menu was huge but easy to navigate. I love the option for "guilt" for $0.
