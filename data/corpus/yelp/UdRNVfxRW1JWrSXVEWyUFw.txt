I didn't look at the other yelp er reviews until I was sitting in the place but I think I agree with most of the others for the most part. The first time I ate at this place it was before the remodel and I felt like I stepped back in time going in there. The new decor is adequate but the food still isn't up to par. . . I'm afraid that I would actually recommend going to "awful house" before going to this place. I know this place is supposed to be one of those Atlanta landmarks but the waitstaff and cooks are going to have to put more effort into this thing for me to head back over there.
