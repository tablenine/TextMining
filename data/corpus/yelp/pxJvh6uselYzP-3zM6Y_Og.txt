Restaurant: Ru San&#39;s Buckhead At Tower Place
Category: Sushi Bars
Ru San's has a tome of a menu chuck full of makis (rolls), as well as a variety of cooked items in addition to sushi.  Everything is very inexpensive (a big attraction to be sure) but the quality ranges from average to dangerously past-fresh.  Serving any of the oily fish (e.g. white tuna, mackarel) way past their prime is just gross.  Sure for the same cost you can eat four meals here for one meal at Taka or Hashiguchi (both close by), but that one great meal is what I would rather eat than the four dull and unsatisfying ones.  . . It's an energetic and casual atmosphere.  Not bad for parties I suppose, what with sake bombs and funny staff and all.  But if you are not having a party and attracting the attention of all the staffs, the service is pretty terrible.  There is a big patio and from my experience and others, servers come out to do anything--ordering, filling water, bringing meal, bringing check--once every 20 minutes.  One time my friend and I ordered one entree each, and one came after the other has been finished already.  I waited forever to pay and no one came, and could not even find the server when I went inside to look.  . . To be honest I have never had the Ru San's sushi buffet that sounds like something every Atlantan has tried at least once, and I am not that interested.. . Better than mall cafeteria, I'll give you that.
