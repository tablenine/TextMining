Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Fast (and I mean fast) servers and great burgers!. . I love the burgers and the well done fries, but  the most fun is watching the servers do their job at lightening speed.  The same servers that have been there since I first went about 7 years ago.  If you even 'think' that you might need a napkin, they are right there handing it to you.  Best Burgers in LA..... . We usually get the Hickory Burger with cheese and their french fries.. oh so yummy its soooo delicious. If you live or near the pico blvd, in west hollywood, definitely a try and a MUST!!. . The only drawback is waiting for a seat at the counter (it's only counter)  You just have to hope everyone will go in turn. No chairs outside or anything, just the inside counter and you would have to wait if you decide to dine in. not unless you take out to go.. . Still...definitely worth the counter and parking is a hasstle.. . Pros: Bomb a** burgers and fries. Cons: Parking
