Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I walk here and pick up an order of two tacos on a semi-regular basis, but the fact of the matter is I don't know why.  The tacos aren't that great, the salsa feels like it was made in a smoothie blender, and the chips are made from the same stuff as the taco shells, only stale.. But the fact remains, I keep coming back.  Is it the remarkably cheap price?  Is it the fact it's not a chain run by The Man?  Is it the location, so very close to me?  Do they put crack in their meat?  I have no idea.  It's alright, but I do not understand why it's such an LA staple.  It's edible, I've never gotten sick from it, but if that's the best thing you can say about a place... how spectacular can it be?. Maybe I like it because it's reliable.  The folks at Baja Fresh make my burrito different every time I go.  Tito's?  Tito's you can count on to taste exactly the same, good enough to keep you coming back, every time.
