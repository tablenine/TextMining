Restaurant: Crust
Category: Pizza
My waiter explained that Crust is the first all-organic restaurant in the Midwest. Kudos to them. . Expect a wait (my party of 4 waited 45 minutes after being told the wait would be 20 - but the general manager took care of us with a good table and a small compensation on the bill). It says they don't take reservations, but apparently you can call them ahead of time to alert the restaurant your party will be there? Haven't heard of that before, but I'd recommend you check it out and give it a shot!. Decor of restaurant is nice, very simple and modern with large windows looking out onto Division. The seating was a little crowded and the tables are small making for a very intimate dining atmosphere.. The food was good, but again the fact that it's organic makes it better and truthfully I'd probably visit again for that reason alone to support the organic lifestyle.. LOVED the cocktails though. Such a tremendous selection. I had some delightful concoction with vodka, honey and bergamot. I couldn't even taste the alcohol but could feel a bit of the buzz coming on.. Salads were delicious and you can certainly split them. The beet salad was refreshing as was the special citrus salad (mixed greens, grapefruit, pomegranate and fennel).. Pizzas were good and were served on wood planks. You can split pizzas but they're good for 1 person. I had a seasonal pizza with squash and proscuitto. It was delicious and light.
