Restaurant: Adobo Grill
Category: Latin American
I am a guacamole fiend, and Adobo has some of the best.  A little spicy with big big pieces of fresh avocado, served right in its own molcajete- oh yes, please.  An American restaurant that also serves Micheladas (beer with lime, salt, and ice)?  Double yes!  I had a phenomenal meal here recently and already can't wait to go back- thank goodness I just moved to the neighborhood.  Besides the guacamole, I also had the tortilla soup (a vegetarian version!  thank the heavens!) and the jicama y mango salad.  Yum yum yum.  Boyfriend had one of the ceviches and the specialty zucchini blossom quesadilla, and we both came home with leftovers.  He also had a stellar classic margarita, no salt, with a floater of smoky mezcal.  Our service was great and we loved the dog-friendly outdoor patio, although I could have done without the long line of Second City patrons smoking like chimneys a few feet down the sidewalk.  If my next experience here is as good as this one was, I might bump this rating up to five stars.  Loved it!
