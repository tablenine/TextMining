Restaurant: El Azteca
Category: Mexican
El Azteca used to be one of my favorite mexican restaurants. The service was always great, the food was always spicy and flavorful, and the prices were low.. That was 2007.. I returned last night with some friends in hope of having a fun Mexican meal... Is that what we got? No. Service was bland. The restaurant had a certain darkness about it, as did the employees. The chips were very hard and the salsa was mediocre. The sweet tea was pretty good.. The food didnt take too long to get out, and I can now see why. 2 of us ordered Fajita Burritos, and I have NO CLUE what the hell we received. It appeared to be no sort of burrito like the menu was described, and was more of a disgusting fajita with unappealing sauce-entree. I asked the waiter what was up with this sub-par meal, and he said that it was what we ordered.. we were all so disappointed. Never will we return here again.. There is a positive aspect to my review- La Parilla is always opening new locations and it is the best Mexican chain in town (my opinion). Forget about El Azteca, go to La Parilla!
