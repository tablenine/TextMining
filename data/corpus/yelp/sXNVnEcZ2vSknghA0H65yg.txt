The drunken crab and garlic noodles were absolutely out of this world.  You really have to try this place at least once in your lifetime.  However, whether you want to or not you're paying for the total package - atmosphere, décor, snobbery, pretentiousness, etc . . . . If I could find this food for less $$ at a shack on the side of the road - I'd be there all the time.
