Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
When at Savoy, it is acceptable to: . . - enjoy the Hainan chicken; add copious amounts of hot sauce, soy sauce or minced ginger - it's up to you. - obtain as many refills of the iced tea as possible. . When at Savoy, it is never acceptable to:. . - call the restaurant by SavoyS as I often times hear; this is a very common problem - it's a singular name, never has it been plural (get it right!). . Got it? Good. Go.
