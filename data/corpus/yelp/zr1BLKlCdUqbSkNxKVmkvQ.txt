Alright I will admit that I was suckered into visiting Oinkster after watching a repeat of DDD on Sunday morning. I had also seen it plastered all over yelp and figured it was worth visiting. . . Very long line, they are saying its because of the DDD show. That's fine by me, I don't mind waiting for great food.. . But greatness was not found here. The Oinkster pastrami was definitely good, but I have had better and for way cheaper.The house mustard made the sandwich. Â Belgium fries were yummy, and the garlic aioli was tasty as well. We also tried the plantains and I really enjoyed them.. . Moving on to the pulled pork sandwich...awful and the BBQ sauce only made it worse. Guy Fieri made this sandwich seem like it was made from gods, well I can tell you it was not. Super let down. It had the consistency of oily news paper mulch.... . It was worth the trip, I enjoy outings like this, but I do not see myself craving this place again. Been there, done that...time to try some place better.
