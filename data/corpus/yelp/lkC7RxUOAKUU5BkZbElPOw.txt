Went to deleece for brunch several months ago, and had been meaning to write this review ever since.  The atmosphere was fantastic, and it felt really conducive to our small group.  The waitress kept the endless mimosas coming, and we kept drinking them.  . . The food was pretty good but not outright thrilling.  Maybe it was because I was adventurous and tried one of the interesting eggs benedict variations.  It was good, and I'd certainly go back, but being one of my few brunch places i've been to, i didn't feel strongly either way yet.
