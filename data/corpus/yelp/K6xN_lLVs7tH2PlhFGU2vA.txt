Oh, high expectations, how cruel it feels to have you crushed to the ground! In this case, my husband set me up for failure. His great memories of meals here on business trips to Chicago a few years ago had me excited. And, I was truly starved of good Persian food and longingly recollecting my favorite joint in SF. So, really, this meal didn't stand a chance. With overarchingly impossible high standards to live up to, it was doomed from the start.. In a word, my experience was: tomato. Yup, tomato. Everything I ate was bathed in a curiously sweet, stunningly bland tomato sauce - from the rice, stuffed peppers, even some kind of falafel-type dumplings on the platter. As for the hummus and kashko bademjan, they almost made me wish they were covered in sauce, it might have been an improvement. Sorry guys, this wasn't for me. Maybe I'm just the wrong audience for a kabab haven.
