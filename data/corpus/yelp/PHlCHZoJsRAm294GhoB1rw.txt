Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
We get delivery from Butterfly about twice a month and they're pretty consistent. I usually order the Sesame Chicken which isn't the typical stir fried, sesame chicken dish you normally get from Chinese restaurants. This is chicken breast stuffed with a fried egg, spinach and crab meat. Then deep fried and served with peanut sauce and steamed veggies. Yum. I also get the Golden Wings appetizer - Chicken wing stuffed with chicken, cabbage and bean thread noodles - imagine an egg roll that uses a chicken wing instead of an egg roll wrapper. . . I'm Thai and I'm usually pretty harsh when it comes to Thai food. Butterfly americanizes their Thai food so I stay away from the more authentic dishes such as the curries here. You don't see the 2 items I mentioned above too often so that's why I keep coming back.. . I wish I can comment on the sushi but I have a hard time ordering sushi from a Thai restaurant. And yes, it is a Thai restaurant (as opposed to a Japanese restaurant serving Thai food). When I dined in, I heard them speaking Thai.. . Added a few hours after writing the above: I guess I made myself hungry and ordered the sesame chicken and beef curry. The curry was pretty good, not as Americanized as I thought, nice spice.
