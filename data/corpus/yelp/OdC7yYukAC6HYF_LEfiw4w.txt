Don't be coming here expecting quality Italian style pizza. This place offers a much Americanized version with a Korean twist to it.. . I did try their Potato Gold pizza which is.... sensational!!!! The crust filled with sweet potato and the scrumptious toppings...  (I want to go back!). . With that said, here's my reasoning behind the rating.. . 1. Over priced. [self explanatory] . 2. Service [arrogant Asians]. 3. Mediocre taste.. . Nothing stands over the top here besides their potato gold pizza. Everything else is the usual run of the mill style cuisine.  Which explains.. "Meh, I've experienced better.". . Bathroom 4/5. Clean and ready for seconds!
