For the price for an LA hot spot, this place really has it!. . Everything on their menu is about $10.  Their salads, sandwiches and hot plates!  I came with a group of 6 people and we got lucky and scored the big table in the back!. . I got a hot plate that consisted of the angus beef flank, mashed potatoes, and small salad and I chose the arugula salad.  My cousin got the same thing as me but a sandwich and I tried his and I would say it's a lot better as a sandwich!  Their mashed potatoes are so creamy and buttery it's so delicious!  I also got to try the ahi tuna nicoise salad which was also a great experience!. . If you're looking for something quick, tasty, light and healthy, I would say "GO TO TENDER GREENS!!"
