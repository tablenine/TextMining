i think this place is pretty much over-rated. i just went there for lunch. i ordered tonkatsu and tsukemen. the tonkatsu is good, but not the best. the soup base of ramen is salty for me, maybe for myself i can't stand the salty food. the egg is not over-cooked, which is good. however, after i dipped a little bit noodle into my soup, i saw ONE HAIR in the cooled noodle. wtf, i 've never had this problem in other restaurant. it is disgusting. then i told the waitress and she took the noodle away. after 5 mins, she brought the new plate of noodle and said sorry to me. i think it's ok. but i couldn't finish the ramen since the soup has been getting cooler while i was waiting for my noodle. i couldn't eat noodle without the soup, that means, i missed the golden time to enjoy the ramen. what a pity. i think i m lucky beause i ordered the tsukemen instead of daikoku. if i ordered daikoku, i could not tell if there was a hair in the noodle or soup. maybe i wouldn't know if i already ate the hair while i was eating noodle. . i know this place is popular, so i wanna let u guys know before eating your food, be sure to check if anything special in your food. good luck
