Believe the hype, everyone!  My gf and I ordered a turkey and ham sub a couple weeks ago, and the sandwich was STACKED.  This 12" sub made four meals (two meals for the each of us).  All for only about $7.  The bread was all that it was cracked up to be: fresh, crusty, yet amazingly light, lending itself to the heap of ingredients on our sub.  The flavors of our turkey and ham sub were very good, but the bread and value deserve even greater praise.  I wish I took a picture of this beauty.  I'll definitely be back.  Highly recommended.
