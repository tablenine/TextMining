I've been twice in the last two weeks- it's my current favorite!  Great food, especially the cheese boards, mmmm.  Everything I've had (or eaten off others plates) has been REALLY delicious- and now I crave it every day.  It's a little pricey, especially if you like your wine--the tab adds up quickly--but it's worth it!. Great service too- very knowledgeable and patient!
