Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
langers is an institution. you show me a restaurant in los angeles that's been around for 61 years and I'll show you one damn fine deli.. . first off, we always go for breakfast... but that doesn't preclude you from indulging in the best, thick cut pastrami that you've ever seen fall apart on your fork. in fact, it's pretty freakin' luxurious to have pastrami breakfast.. . and what digs! lost in time. if you've got a group of 8? no problem! the little dividers in the center booths DROP DOWN so it feels as if everyone is at the same table. genius. . . by the by, the hands-down best waitress in town is Caroline. you have no idea. topped up waters and coffees and check ins. it's like heaven. and they have pickles and breads for sale. old school. i love diners and they do it right, i just love this place.
