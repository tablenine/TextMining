Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Milk is a casual yet good for people watching neighborhood hangout. When you step in, it feels somewhat sterile because of all the white paint and stainless steel. The high ceiling makes it feel less cosy but gives a very cool feeling in hot summer. It has a  real dairy/ice cream parlor vibe.. . They have many things but do most of it really well. It has good ice  cream, ice cream treats, sorbet, and great cookies, cakes, and puddings. They also have good coffe and cuban sandwiches.. . I love their butterscotch pudding, chocolate chip cookies, and chocolate fudge cookies. Their tres leches cake isn't too wet but very moist and rich and delicious. However, the blue velvet cake feels like it was dunked in moisture and was too mushy for me.. . Their fudge sundae is a good bargain. I refuse to go to Mashti Malone's because their portions are way too tiny for the price. They put little scoops of ice cream with fudge in a small container that sits comfortably in your hand and calls it a sundae and charges around $7.. . At Milk, a large cold glass container is filled with 2 generous scoops of their ice cream with hot fudge, butterscotch, whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry top it off  for less than $6. Their coffee ice cream is so yummy and strong that it can keep you up at night. They aslo have little good chocolate covered ice cream treats for .50. . . I would have given it 5 stars if the seating was more comfortable with more indoor seating. Staff are usually friendly and helpful but it can get really crowded with staff getting confused and flustered. Parking is terrible in this area in the evening but before 6p there's parking in the side alley of El Cayote parking. After 6, you are on your own and being speed racer to get to a parking space.
