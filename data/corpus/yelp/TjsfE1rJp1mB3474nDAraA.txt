I love the food here like my dirty girlfriend.  Portions are Jim Belushi size.  You can have left overs for days.  Coffee is stong and tasty....french press. Go there but not at prime weekend breakfast time, as all the local west hollywood showbiz wannabees will be jockeying for position in the long line.
