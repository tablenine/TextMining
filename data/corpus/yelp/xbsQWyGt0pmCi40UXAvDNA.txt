Okay seriously... this place doesn't impress me, especially considering the $$$$ price rating.  The salad bar is very good, the meat is okay, but really, I wouldn't come here if I were paying.  Of course, the few times I did come here, someone else was paying, in which case I might have given them 4 stars, but in all honesty, I much prefer a good steak dinner over this place which would cost either less than or about the same as this place.  The only meat I like here is the rib eye and the sirloin... and I think I would prefer a huge slab to myself as opposed to small slices that dry out and get cold.. . Desserts are pretty good, very rich and thick flan, pretty good chocolate  mousse cake, and personally, I would avoid the papaya dessert.. . Cheese bread is good.  So is the lemonade.. . Will only be back if it's not on my tab...
