Not as great as it's hyped up to be. The almond croissant was a bit of a baking disaster. The guava+cheese strudel was only decent. The mushroom soup tasted canned. We didn't get to try potato ball nor sandwiches yet. But looking at sandwich plates around us, we're inclined to think that they might not be greatly better than Panera's.. . Two things we liked greatly: Salvadorean quesadilla (the look deceives, its taste leaves you savoring for more after having a small slice) and the walnut raisin bread (sourdough based, chewy and delicious).. . Lessons learnt: come here mainly for the Latin-style pastries, not the French type pastries.
