Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
This establishment along with Park's BBQ, also on Vermont, in K-Town are among my top picks for Korean BBQ restaurant outings. . . Service: 5 Stars (pretty rare at Korean BBQ restaurants). Food/Quality: 5 stars. Parking: Valet only $2. . Comes with about 10 different panchans: kimchee, rice-paper wrapper, cucumber, 2 styles of radish, sweet potato, bean sprouts, dried fish w/ string beans, and potato cake of some sort.  It also comes with a large bowl of salad. The salad is well seasoned, one of the best kinds served at Korean BBQ restaurants.. . Highly recommend the Soowan Seasoned Beef Rib (#1) and the Korean BBQ Beef. Both were very tender and well seasoned. . . Also, the cold noodles are very good. Great to consume after the beef.. . Caveats: 1) No matter what-DO NOT have the kitchen cook your meat. It doesn't taste as good as when it's grilled on your table. 2) I didn't find the abolone stews to be that special and for $19.99, I would rather order another plate of Beef. 3) Thier seafood pancake contained too much whole green onions and not enough seafood-it's simply a filler...Again, for the price of $15.99, you're better off with an another order of beef or shrimp to grill.  Remeber why you went to a Korean BBQ restaurant. =P. . Lastly, I don't recommend coming here after 9 pm.  The one time that I was there around 9:30, I was told that the restaurant extended their hour from 10pm to 11pm.  I was really happy at first, until I found out that they were out of cold noodes (one of the best in town).
