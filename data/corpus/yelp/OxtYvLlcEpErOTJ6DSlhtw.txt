I know the no.19 sand witch is supposed to be the End all flavor to all pastrami sandwiches, but I am gonna have to go against the 5 star reviews here.. . The bread is crispy yes, but it's way too hard to bite down, leaving the sandwich very hard to eat in 1 piece.   If I decide to skip the crust then there is simply not enough bread left to go with the greasy, tasty pastrami in the center.. . If they can only have softer bread to accompany the excellent filling..  3.5 stars from me.
