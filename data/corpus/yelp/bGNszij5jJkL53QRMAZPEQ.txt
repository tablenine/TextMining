Restaurant: Mexicali Cocina Cantina
Category: Mexican
Great place for food and margaritas.  The ambience is fun and loud, which is to be expected for a chips-on-the-table-when-you-arrive restaurant like Mexicali.  The food was surprisingly affordable, and my wife's Ahi Tuna was *delicious*.  I went out out on a limb and ordered the Blue Crab Enchiladas.  While they were tasty, they were waaay to rich for my taste buds and I could only make it about half way through.. . We also had a pitcher of the Cadillac Margaritas.  Dee-lish-ous.. . There is plenty of parking in the back, and the waitstaff was friendly and helpful.
