Restaurant: Rathbun&#39;s
Category: American (New)
I dined at Rathbun's with colleagues when I was in Atalnta for a conference in May.  It was recommeded by our hotel bellhop after we told him we were going to another place he thought was awful.. . But his recommendation was spot on!  Rathbun's was the best meal I had in Atlanta the whole time I was there.  Way better than the overly-hyped Woodfire Grill.. . It's a beautiful restaurant off the beaten path.. . The appetizers were great, especially the fries with the blue cheese drssing.  I had the whole roasted Bronzini for my entree which was delicious.  The deserts we had were all good too.. . Rathbun's is definitely recommended if you're visiting Atlanta - the cab ride to the sketchy part of town is worth it!
