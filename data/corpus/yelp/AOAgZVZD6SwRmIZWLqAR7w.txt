The Potato Balls were different than I expected - they were fried potatoes with a savory meat interior.  They are delicious to eat piping hot and the flavors juiced out with each bite.  I soon realized that ordering one potato ball per person was definitely not a good idea, I wanted more after I finished.. We also orderd the refugiado, which is a guava and cheese pastery.  It might seem a little strange because guava's not a fruit you typically see in a fruit pastry, but this little number proves that it should be.  It's the perfect mix of tart sweet (guava), creamy sweet (sweet cheese) and flaky sweet (the pastry)..
