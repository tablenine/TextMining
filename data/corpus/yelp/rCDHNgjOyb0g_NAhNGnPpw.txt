Decent Fancy-Mexican Place:. . Margarita's were tasty.  Environment is good.  They had a vegetarian menu for those that don't eat meat.  Strange their was no queso on the menu.  . . Pretty good place for some Mexican food.  A little spendy for what you get, as they play upon the attempted 'upscale' ambiance.  But a pretty good place overall.
