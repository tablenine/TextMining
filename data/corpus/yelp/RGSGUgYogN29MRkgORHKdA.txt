Restaurant: New Wave Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
New Wave is a solid operation with good coffee and sandwich options, and benefits from a void of coffee locations in the area.. . Likes:  Proximity.  It's a 20 minute walk from my house, and a 3 minute train ride.  Free wifi.  Talented baristas.  Large space with usually adequate seating.  Relatively friendly service folks (there're a few too cool for school folks there, but most are benignly hipster).  . . Dislikes:  The music is usually poopy for doing anything but having a loud conversation, and rarely conducive to work (for those of us who like to work in coffee shops).  The color scheme makes me pretty uneasy and the art is really sporadic.  . . New Wave will do for now, but might find itself in trouble if someone wants to appeal to the non-yuppie, non-hipster twenty- and thirty-somethings in the neighborhood.
