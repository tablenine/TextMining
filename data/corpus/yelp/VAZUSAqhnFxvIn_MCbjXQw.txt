First I want to say that I totally heart Brett D.'s review.  I know we would totally be besties.. . I so so so so so wanted to hate this place but it has several redeeming qualities.  Okay the food here is great.  I hate to say it but it is true.  I had the Fiesta burger and it was a fiesta in my mouth.  I also had the Tots and they were stellar.  The beer list is also top notch and extensive, think Small Bar but smaller.. . I suggest that you go early in the week (excluding any nights with "big games" on).  I went on a Tuesday night and the "tool" factor was limited.  There was also this fun shuffle board-esque game that was fab.  . . The reason that I only give Boundary 3 stars is do to the fact that there are limited nights to enter and not throw up on yourself.
