Pretty damn good.. . I will not go into much detail on a restaurant with 100+ reviews... if you don't know that you at least need to try it by now, you are looking for far to much out of a review website. The menu is not going to jump off the screen and into your mouth... just get in a cab, and go.. . Tacos were super fun to try (the duck and avocado were my two favs) and the guacamole was indeed fantastic. We had a fairly large group of about 10 or 12, and the restaurant was very accommodating and comfy. Drinks were decent, not the best I've ever had, but they got the job done. They were out of a bottle of wine a few members in my party had their hearts set on, but the waiter was great and brought over tons of samples and they ended up with a great wine regardless. . . I recommend trying this place out, especially for a large group (mainly for sharing purposes).
