The taco selection at this place is the way to go.  You can get the tacos a la carte and then add other sides if you wish.  I always opt for the ahi tuna taco...really good.  Then the chipotle chicken and the sauteed salmon.  I am not a meat eater, but other people have complimented the choices in that area.  The guacamole is good too.  The margaritas are not strong so I opt for the bottle of wine and they have a simple and tasty small selection.  The decor is fun too, chunky wooden tables and chairs.  . Definitely a good staple, but some nights you have to wait quite a while so it doesn't hurt to make a reservation.  They also have a little outdoor patio in front.
