Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
Eating at this retro diner is like being at a theme park for an hour. It's a great place to stop by before going to Griffith Observatory and an even better hipster feeding trough. . . Food: Think fresh, then fattening. They have some healthy items on the menu if you're looking for a well balanced meal. The massive fruit side is overflowing with apple slices, strawberries, grapes, watermelon, papaya, and honeydew (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). It's such a good deal for the amount of fruit you get. I ordered Alice's Egg sandwich which was a vegetarian item (not vegan though thanks to the egg, . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). The waiter told me this was one of the better items on the menu, but I was sort of disappointed. It was yummy and had a cute potato chip accent on the top, but it desperately needed more sauce of some kind. The real winners at Fred's are the pancakes. The Hunka Hunka Burnin' Love cake is filled with everything you probably shouldn't put into your body (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). Imagine a soft, warm pancake studded with bananas, peanut butter, chocolate chips, drizzled in a rich caramel sauce. . . Atmosphere: This place is a diner down to the last detail. It's sort of weird to see a ton of hipsters eating amongst all the 50-60s paraphernalia. I love the pics on the walls that spell out messages using Hollywood sign lettering on a hill backdrop. It's so LA. Try to avoid the bathroom. The outdoor seating area is fairly large and reminds me of all the little cafes in Beverly Hills for some reason. Warning: there's only one toilet and it's really disgusting.. . Service: Nothing exceptionally good or bad to report. Â . . Synopsis: Cute decor and yummy breakfast food. Get the pancakes!
