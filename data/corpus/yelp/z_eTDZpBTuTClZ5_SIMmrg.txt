Very inexpensive and tasty! Each dog comes withe best fresh cut fries. I'm actually contemplating a 30 minute drive to get some right now. For me its a toss up between here and superdawg. A couple of friends of mine from Melrose Park turned me on to this place when I lived up north and I'm glad they did. The only downside is cash only.
