Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
Stopped by the Hungry Cat last night before they close for the next month for renovations that will expand the restaurant size considerably, also adding a raw bar. This was my first time here and the experience was great.. . I got the arctic char ($27) served over a bed of potatoes, crab meat, and kale. My first time having arctic char, it's a related to the salmon and trout and has flavor characters of both fish. My friend Mara had the ling cod ($23) with merguez sausage, fingerling potatoes and kale. Both dishes were very good. I was excited to try some of the drinks of the cocktail menu I had read so much about. First I tried the Dark &amp; Stormy. A mix of gosling's black seal rum w/ bundaberg ginger beer &amp; lime. Mara got the Mia Farrow with Blue Ice vodka, muddled tangerines and limes and a splash of, obviously, rosemary syrup. I had to get one after tasting hers, it was simply delish.. . The menu is mostly fish, with a lone burger. They serve lunch and dinner, with brunch on Sunday.
