Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pastrami on a hotdog?  Pastrami, chili, and cheese on a hotdog?  Oh....why the hell not.  Aside from the bazillion different kinds of dogs, the primary thing here is really the actual quality of the dogs.  I haven't had a better hotdog anywhere.   They've got that nice hearty SNAP when you bite into them.  . . And then there is the whole nostalgia thing...used to hit this place up after Laker's games at The Forum.  Indeed, looooooong time ago.  Or after nights out downtown doing things we shouldn't have been doing.   But those were some fun days.. . I'm still not moving back there.   But next visit I *must* have a Pink's.
