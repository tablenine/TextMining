Restaurant: Hub 51
Category: American (New)
awesome food, awesome ambience, awesome night. We were visiting Chicago, and after a half hour researching on Yelp, I found Hub 51. It was perfect. Young atmosphere (20 somethings-30 somethings), good music, and great food (and drinks!).. . Here's what your gonna do:. 1) order a pitcher of the Hub punch. 2) order tuna appetizer and chicken nachos appetizer - theyre large. 3) if you've got a big crew with you (8+) get the guacamole appetizer. 4) order whatever entre you want (i rec. the tacos) theyre all good. 5) finish it with cheescake. 6) email me, thanking me for the advice (and offering to take me to dinner at Hub 51...). . PS- reservation policy is weird. they only allow 1/3 of the restaurant to be reserved tables. so either call EARLY or get their early, wait for your table by hanging Â at the bar and getting loose
