Pizza = 3 stars. Service = 3 stars. Drinks = 4 stars. Hostess = 2 stars. Price = expensive ass pizza!. . This place is nice to have in the neighborhood, but it is expensive and not that filling.  If you are going to pay $15 for a personal pizza, it better fill you up.  They have a really good beer list too.  But whats with the damn hostess hemming and hawing about finding you a table when the restaurant is only half full?  I mean please, ditch the attitude and seat a hungry paying customer because you are only diminishing the tip size for your servers.. . Don't go out of your way to go here.  Its just OK.  La Madia in the loop is a lot better.
