Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I've been a longtime fan of Tank, but my experience last night has left such a lukewarm feeling that I'm not sure when I'll go back again.. . First of all, the host (who I have never seen before, but my dinner guests have had very similar encounters with him) was incredibly rude. We called to make reservations and after holding for 15 minutes he finally said (in an exasperated tone) "and do you think you want to give me a phone number? good bye" and hung up even before reconfirming the details that I gave him. Then when we show up at the restaurant, he said in the same tone "you are too early, move aside so I can help the others behind you.". . We wandered around the neighborhood for 15 minutes and returned only because my friend had a groupon for the restaurant. I wanted to go elsewhere. After sitting at the table for 45 minutes, we finally had our sushi. I understand that they were busy, but the waitress did not check on us at all, and the same rude host took our check from us. "Are you done yet? I'm taking this" By the time we left the restaurant, there were maybe 5 tables full, so there was no reason for the continuation of his snide behaviour. . . Between the average sushi, zero sense of urgency from the sushi chefs and the RUDE host, I'm not sure when I'll be back. Such a shame, cause I have highly recommended this restaurant to others in the past. . . The host certainly needs an attitude adjustment. Given the various reviews below, others seem to have the same thoughts.
