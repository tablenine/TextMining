Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
If you love a good pastrami sandwich, you'll love this place.  There's a lot of meat in the sandwich.  The meat is not lean, but very flavorful.  You also get a basket of dill pickle slices which is quite delicious.  I can't decide if I like lean pastrami, like they serve at Katz's deli in New York, or the more fatty pastrami at Johnnie's.  They both taste wonderful!!
