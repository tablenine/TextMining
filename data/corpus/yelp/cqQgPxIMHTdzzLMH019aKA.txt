Tried the mac n cheese, curried lentil salad, fried squash blossoms and rapini with anchovy butter. I liked the salad a lot. The dressing was light and all the ingredients fit together nicely. The curried lentils didn't really taste curried, but I still enjoyed them. It also featured a rose made of duck prosciutto, which I'd never tried before. Less salty then pork prosciutto, and very tasty. The rapini was also quite good, simple and well cooked. The squash blossoms (lying in a bed of cream) were a little heavy for my taste, but not bad. . The mac n chee was a big disappointment though. There wasn't a sauce to speak of. Just orange pasta with some breadcrumbs and ham. I couldn't even tell what kind of cheese they used. I know dive bars that can school this place on the way mac n chee should taste. . The service was faster and friendlier then I would expect in a place like this, so that was nice. All in all, Ford's isn't the kind of place I'd eat if I was paying, but it wasn't too bad for fancy food.
