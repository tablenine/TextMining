I haven't been here in AGES! The service is prompt, to say the least. When I'm usually here eating competitions usually ensue, resulting in busted guts and lots of laughs.. . The meat, pre-marinated and mouth watering, will never run on empty. Surprisingly, if they're around closing time, in order to relieve themselves of the meat, they'll ENCOURAGE and try to get you to eat more. That means if they refrigerate, they keep it to a bare minimum - I like that. The rice is either Japanese or Korean, it's distinction being plump and sticky, full and chewy. Last I went, it was $25 per person, but I hear they prices just went up about $5 or so.. . Don't wear your Sunday clothes, because you'll leave heavily smelling like garlic as you wobble around with a full stomach. The valet is a bit over-bearing and seem to radiate a hateful vibe if you fail to tip. No surprise- I tip out of fear.. . My only upset is, in having no cash, tip options were nil. So my buddy walks to the counter after we've paid and asked if they use charge $25 to his card in which he was met with an immediate and flat no. I didn't like how they voiced it, but I guess they were busy. So we ended up exiting only to be hounded for Â a tip. Seriously. They stopped us, said "tip." No, not in the form of a question, but stated as non-negotiable. We tried to tip $25 and they said no, but when it was their only way to get money, after hassling us, they charged the $25. Leaving bitter that night (only once out of the times I've been there), I don't know whether I fumed more out of anger or garlic.
