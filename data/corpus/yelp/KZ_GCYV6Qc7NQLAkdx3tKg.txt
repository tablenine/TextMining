Once again I think my high expectations impacted my experience.  It won't be the first time.  I have high expectations for a number of things in my life and continue to be disappointed so you think I would learn.  I expected David Burke's to be a really nice restaurant, not a dimly lit coffee shop.  I expected the food to be above average even for restaurant week.  Actually I expected the food to be better for restaurant week since isn't that what's going to bring me back.  I expected a great deal, but I don't think my meal was worth more than $32 so what's the point.  The food was good, the service was OK, but I won't be going back.
