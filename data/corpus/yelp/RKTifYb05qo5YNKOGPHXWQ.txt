Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I came when there was no line, figured I'd try it out.  I had whatever the special is, Pink Dog or something with a side of chili fries.. . I couldn't finish it.  The fries were so overfried it was disgusting, like eating dry wax.  The chili was watery, and some kind of odd red color and texture that was unappetizing, like what I imagine raw human kidneys are like.  The flavor was .... sour ... but not "oooh" sour but that horrible musky metallic sour of canned stewed tomatoes.. . The hot dog was a hot dog, but extra overcooked with that odd smell and taste that baloney has... MSG or nitrates I'm guessing. The bun was one of those you'd get in a 24 pack generic brand, 1 part bread and 2 parts air.. . I went to the bathroom, which had no lock, and had to keep two people from walking in while peeing.. . All in all one of the most disappointing meals I've ever had.  What the hell do people go to this place for?
