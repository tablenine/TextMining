Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
1st the website.  I love the music and it pumps me up to eat like royalty.  2nd the restaurant. Got the huge bone in filet medium, gorgonzola mac and cheese, asparagus, and lobster mashed potatoes.  Steak was so tender and perfect with a great salty flavor.  Gorganzola mac and cheese was thick, heavy but very gourmet. Loved it!!! Aspauragus had that perfect crunch.  However the lobster mashed potatoes were wayyyy too oily with a pool of oil floating on top.  Disgusting, we sent it back.  Overall on the other stuff, 5 stars. Trumps Ruth Criss by half a star.  This is the baller place to go if you know how to eat.  Very expensive so bring some money.
