Restaurant: Five Seasons Brewing
Category: Pubs
Went to Five Seasons brewery at 8:00 on saturday night.  I was told that it would be a 20-25 minute wait, although there seemed to be plenty of open tables.  Went to wait at the bar and ordered a few beers.  The beer is still pretty good.  After we finished a round of beers, we order more beers and a few appetizers.  We got the sausage plate and the anti-pasto plate.  Both plates were very bland in addition to being very small.  Think tapas sized plates for full appetizer prices.  My wife asked how ling it had been as half the restaurant was empty at this point, and we had been waiting close to an hour.   Decided to get one more beer just because we were already there.  After 1 1/2 hours of waiting at the bar, we left the almost empty restaurant.  The hostess never even tried to seat us.  I cant remember going to any restaurant and not even gotten seated.  I guess they forgot about us.  The 2 bartenders were also very rude.  Our antipasto plate was served with bread that was burnt to a crisp, and when I asked for more bread, I got serious attitude from 1 bartender, who then waited almost 10 minutes to tell the other bartender that we were complaining about our bread(this was said loudly right in front of us), then waited another 10 minutes to get more bread.  I will never set foot in this place even again.
