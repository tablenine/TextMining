Well, i'm kind of a one or two dish gal when it comes to places like these because of possible repetitious flavors... however, this is a more delicious flavor that i don't mind. i loved every time i've gone there because sit down or take out i get treated very nicely, and timely, and it's cheap! i was however disappointed in the only one huge size of soda they offered for the take out part of my excursion.. . All in all, definitely get what you paid for and more here. mm mm good.
