Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
A major disappointment since the food was subpar and the service was lackluster. The server did not seem like she had significant experience in waiting tables and seemed more like she belonged at a diner than at a high end restaurant. My experience at Tam O'Shanter (in Los Feliz) was much better in terms of customer service.. . The croutons in the 'spinning salad' were extremely greasy. The prime rib was very disappointing; hardly even close to Prime grade--maybe it was Select. The baked potato was not much better than something that could have been eaten at Sizzler and mushrooms are nothing special. The creamed spinach was respectable. One good thing: Chocolate Fantasy dessert. . . All in all a disappointment and I would probably not come back. Still giving it two stars because I think our sad experience had a lot to do with our server. Such a shame since so many other reviewers seem to like it. I eat great steaks pretty often (and prime rib on occasion) and this place doesn't make the cut. Especially with all the great deals that many steakhouses are offering around Los Angeles, you're better off spending your money elsewhere.. . If the manager of Lawry's is reading: having a manager walk around and ask if things are okay won't elicit honest answers. Unless the night is completely rotten I don't like to spoil it by raising a stink over poor service/food that should have been handled before the first customer enters the restaurant.
