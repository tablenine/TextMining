5 stars? I don't see why not, since I liked everything about this place. It's a fine dining restaurant that doesn't feel stiff at all. Wait staff was casual and direct, and the 5 course chef's tasting was amazingly good and full of variety.. I recommend this place for a great meal when you want to go somewhere very nice and unique. I found everything to be very good yet somewhat understated: the food, the decor, and the architecture.
