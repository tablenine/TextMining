First off, let me say this is one the best pizza joints of eaten at. My friend and I decided to eat here on a random Tuesday night but it didn't matter because the place was still crackin'. We ended up getting sat at the bar so we wouldn't have to wait. Sitting at the bar was fine because the service was still quick and the bartender was pretty cool. The only thing that was odd were the paper placemats which kind of reminded me of the Old Spaghetti Factory (I worked there for 4 years) -- not a good thing when you're supposed to be a higher end restaurant.. . Anyway, to the food:. . 1. Tricolore with Parmigiano Reggiano &amp; anchovy dressing - This salad was bomb. The anchovy dressing that was on it was probably the best salad dressing I've ever had. It wasn't overdone or too powerful and there was a perfect amount on each piece of lettuce.. . 2. Fried squash blossoms with ricotta - These were also very good. The ricotta is at the very bottom of the squash blossoms, but it's a nice surprise. The presentation on these was a bit lackluster: they were served on a small ass saucer with a cocktail napkin underneath them.. . 3. White anchovy, tomato &amp; Fresno chiles - This is probably one of the most interesting pizzas I've had and it came per the recommendation of the bartender. I honestly don't know how to describe it (tangy maybe), but you should definitely order it if you like trying unique things.. . 4. Fennel sausage, panna, red onion &amp; scallions - How can you not like homemade sausage? This pizza is delicious and is worth it for the sausage alone.. . We got all this and a coke for $68 which is pretty damn reasonable. The pizza is very good and is definitely up there with the best I've had, but it's still a notch or two below Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix.
