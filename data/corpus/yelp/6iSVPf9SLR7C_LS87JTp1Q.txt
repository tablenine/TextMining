The food was amazing!  I made my reservation on-line using Open Table.  Yamashiro called the day before to confirm.  We had a table in the corner next to the window.  It's a remarkable place!  I had the Pepper Filet Mignon and he had the Cipotle Citrus Lamb Chops.  This steak melted in my mouth.  So, so good.  For dessert we had pumpkin creme brulee which actually came in a little pumpkin.  That was hands down the best dessert I've ever had in my life.  And I live for dessert, chocolate, candy........sugar!  I eat candy for breakfast, for god's sake.   The ideal experience would be to arrive before sunset to see the gardens, have a drink, post sunset-eat dinner and enjoy the skyline all lit up!
