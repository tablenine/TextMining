Order the double chocolate shake...you will not be dissappointed.  Go in drunk and with an open mind.  If you are prude or easily offended, do not go.  If you love to complain, do not go.  If you are up for an experience...get your ass there!  You are about to enter another world of serious chi-town dogs and a little somethin' to go with em'!
