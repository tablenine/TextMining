Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
Found myself at Reza's after trying to take friends to Ole Ole and realizing that they have closed! :-(. I have eaten at Reza's several times and can only really say that it is consistently mediocre. I have had their lunch buffet and I agree with some of the other comments posted here. Their food is very inconsistent and really not great quality for the price. I love buffets, but this is one that I actually try to avoid. As far as regular diner, it appears that they have decided to do a buffet style appetizer bar. In concept this is great, but again the execution is lacking. The falafel is cold, the hummus doesn't seem to be up to par, pita cold, etc. The actual entree was very tasty but served with a mountain of rice is not the most exciting presentation. Too many other middle eastern/persian oprtions in the city that are better than Reza's.
