Definitely a 5-star breakfast joint. The lines seem long but the wait is short and goes by quickly...at least  before 10:00am. An excellent and unique menu with lots to choose from.. . Pancakes are their specialty and portions are ridiculous..serves 4 people at least. Usually food that big isn't good...but not so here. And a big-up for the real maple syrup...this is rare and usually why I never get pancakes out.
