I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  The food is delish and the owners are soooo nice and friendly.  The prices are a great value for the quality.  Plus Thursday nights are $20 prix-fixe... from the entire menu!  I'd recommend the bruschetta, mussels, pork chops, and ANY of the wonderful fresh pastas.  The only warning I can give is not to get full on the warm, crusty bread they bring to your table.  The roasted garlic spread they serve with it is addictively good.
