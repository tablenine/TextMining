When my body is gagging from too much clean livin' , I get into the car and drive over the hill to Beagle Rock and slide on into the gaping jowels of the Oinkster, his holiness of all things pork. . The pastrami is not kosher, but it rocks in an entirely different post-Canters kind of way. One sandwich could stuff a linebacker; dainty ones might have to grab a piggy bag to go. . The pulled pork? Pretty good, but I have spent time in the Virginias and Carolinas, so my standards are pretty high. Sister liked it, though. . Les Pommes Frites? Tres Beligique. Love them. Stubby, double fried, logs of crunch and delight. Probably doesn't need the added garlic mayo, but if you really wanted to alienate the world afterward, please be my guest.  The do have homemade catsup, a novelty, and not just by means of spelling. . Added star based on ease of use, parking and indoor, outdoor seating and it's  friendly, Beagle Rock vibe. I'll be back after my nest 20-day detox.
