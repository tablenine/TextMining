I have dined at L.N. many times. Service is always friendly. Food is always consistent. Prices are very reasonable. I went there last night and the special Talipia was only $13. Unlike many BYO's, they actually have a bar to sit at (and drink your own booze) while waiting for a table. If you have ever had a not so great experience here you owe it to yourself to try it again.
