Category: Bakeries
Canter's has been around much longer than I, and if it ever closes down, I will be very sad.  The Brooklyn Avenue is to die for, and the breakfasts are really good, too.  The pickles are the best, as is the rye bread.  Some of the servers are rude, but I usually ignore it, because the food is worth it.  The dinners have never been very good.  I've never ordered one, but I've heard.  I would stick with the corned beef, pastrami, pickles or breakfast special, and you'll have a great meal.  Oh, the potato salad is really good, too.
