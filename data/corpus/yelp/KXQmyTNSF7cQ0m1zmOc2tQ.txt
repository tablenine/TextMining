Some of the best food I've had in my life. Everything was fresh and delicious.. . Tried the jicama, mango, cucumber salad, fiddlehead fern special, ravioli with hazlenut tomato sauce, and sweet potato pancake. I especially liked the first and last item. The lemonade was also very good.. . It's small, which makes it nice because it feels more intimate and you can have a nice conversation. We got there at 5:30 on a Saturday and were sat immediately. I will definitely go back here next time I'm in Chicago.
