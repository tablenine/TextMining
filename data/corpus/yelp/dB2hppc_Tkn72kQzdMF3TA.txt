I had heard so much about this place, and I finally got a chance to stop by. Â It took me such a ridiculous amount of time to make a decision on what I wanted that I ended up pissing myself off - who knew that was possible? From this day forward, I vow to be a more decisive person. I ended up with a strawberry ice cream sandwich with chocolate chips, which was tasty. I was sufficiently pleased with my choice, and the macaroons are a unique way of presenting an ice cream sandwich. I didn't care for the look of this place. It is really bright inside, and the walls are painted white. Bright and white can be blinding, as evidenced by Milk. It's not to say I wouldn't come back if I was in the area, and the three stars are solid three stars. However, I have given Milk a shot and next time, I would probably choose to try another dessert place seeing as how there are plenty of options all over town.
