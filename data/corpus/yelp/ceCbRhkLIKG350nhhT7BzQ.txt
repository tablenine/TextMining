I've been here for lunch more times than I can count on my fingers and toes. The prices are reasonable, and the food is fresh and relatively healthy (except that yumalicious sticky bun thing).  I usually get the spinach peach salad, sans gorgonzola, and occasionally splurge for some mushroom soup which is fantastic.  The dressing is a little on the sweet side, so get it on the side and dole out lightly.  I've also gotten the salmon panini and salmon long plate on occasion, both of which are quite good, although the sauces in both cases are a little overpowering.  I recommend substituting grilled vegetables on the long plate - grilled red onions, zucchini, and corn on the cob, mmmmm good.  There is usually a line during lunch rush, but the turn around is quick.  As many people have noted, it is surprisingly good for a chain and something you wouldn't expect until you've tried it.  Well executed concept.  Also, free WiFi :)
