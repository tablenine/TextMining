Nearly perfect.. . I love the food - this time around, a kickass veggie burger and a goat  cheese spread appetizer. There was also a salmon fillet, salad with chicken, pumpkin ravioli and a couple other items at the table that were all good to great.    . . I also really like the drink menu, atmosphere, live music, service. . . I don't like the 45-minute wait that stretches into an hour with no word from the hostess.  Just sayin.'
