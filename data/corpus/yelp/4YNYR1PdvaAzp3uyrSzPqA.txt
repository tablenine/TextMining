Small place (as in small) but awesome service. We sat outside on the heated patio and was well taken care of by our attentive waitress. Hmmm  seafood pasta in Alhambra? Oh yeah. It's not your typical pasta dish. No tomato sauce. Just sauteed seafood. And I like it a lot. I also enjoyed the side of toasted pizza bread. Their shrimp rolls was so so. I took a bite of their Hainan chicken and it was really good. We also ordered the mushroom pizza and escargot and that too was good. Overall it was a great dining experience.  I will not hesitate coming back here again. We were in a rush so I did not get to try the cream brulee. The only hard park would be parking since they don't have their own lot. But there's parking in the streets around the neighborhood.
