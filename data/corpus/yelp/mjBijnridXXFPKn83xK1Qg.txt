We didn't go for the food, we went for the experience. It was a fun night but the food was a bit tricky. We were at a large table and were able to witness the success or failure of a number of meals.  My husband ordered the lobster/shrimp ravioli special -- it was truly terrible. He and I shared my beef wellington which, ordered medium rare, was really quite good. The potato au gratin which came with it was undercooked however.  I took it home and after a round in the microwave, it was delicious. Each entree came with a salad which was pretty good. I would certainly not recommend going for the food, but to maximize the required dining experience, we would order the portabello fries and beef wellington medium rare with the potatoes well-cooked and share between the two of us. More than enough food for two -- and tasty too. :) Have fun!
