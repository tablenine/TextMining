Restaurant: Daddy D&#39;z BBQ Joynt
Category: Barbeque
After a long line up of disappointing franchise BBQ joints, I finally ended up at Daddy D'z.  This is the ghetto rib joint.  The inside decor is crummy at best and the booths are kind of tight too.  Booth seating doesn't make any sense to me.  It doesn't work logistically because people have to get up when someone inside needs to get up.  This reminds me of the times when the person on the window seat of a plane wants to go to the potty.  The food was great though.  The ribs had a nice smoke rings.  The meat was quite tender even though it didn't fall off the bone like the way I like it.  Meat coming off the bone easily is a plus for me since it is accompanied with the feeling of meat melt in my mouth.  The ribs at Daddy D'z were a little chewy since it held on to the bones.  I had baked beans and candied yam for sides.  There was also a cornbread that came with my 1/2 slab of rib meal.  This meal is super filling.  I couldn't even finish my cornbread which was insanely dense.  The cornbread's density caused it an abnormal texture.   The ribs were definitely above average.  I will probably bring some friends back for some sort of rib tour.
