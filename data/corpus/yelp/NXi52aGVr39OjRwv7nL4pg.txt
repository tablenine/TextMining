Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
The Hungry Cat is ever so tucked into a cool corner in an alley in a shopping plaza in Hollywood....gives that feel like you stumbled onto something like a real gem find. . Chef David Lentz and co-owner Suzzane Goin managed to put together a cool and quaint eastcoast style seafood-faired cafe. Bring a date for a lowkey evening or sit at the bar for some of the coolest inspiring cocktails (hand squeezed) ive seen this side of sin. I cant quite give a total 'bowled over with love' rating because when you deal with fresh seafood ...you best be ready for shells and sand to play a factor in the evenings tastings. Hosts couldve explained their seating situation for the night instead of one taking us to a table..then...some other giving us a stern..'immmm soorry you can only sit at the bar' move. Luckily the bar service made up for the clusterfk pick of host employment. Ill most likely give this cafe another shot someday.
