Their tilapia was steamed just right.  Often this fish is overcooked by many restaurants, but they did a good job here.  Also, the kung pao chicken is stir fried quite well and with consistency.. . I've tried their family combo and it's well worth it's price.  . . If you want a blend of Chinese and Vietnamese style food, this is the place to go to.
