When I was unemployed, I ate here every day for a month. I never once got sick of it and enjoyed every single one of their special that I tried except the trout salad (my fault, I had a traumatic trout-eating incident as a child so it must have triggered those memories).. . Now that I work downtown, I'm only able to eat here once a week for dinner. How I miss you, Tender Greens.. . Always super fresh, always super tasty, and always super reliable to serve up a healthy and delicious lunch or dinner. I've introduced many a friend to their mashed potatoes with the hot plate, sweet tomato soup with just the right amount of kick, and sweet carrot cupcake.
