Restaurant: Wurstküche
Category: Hot Dogs
This place knows how to deliver overseas brews full of preservatives as well as pre-made packaged out of state meat to a band of 'exotic' people who have no idea what's going on AND it's overpriced. Gentrification at it's finest, very impressive! GO to Wurstküche 10 times over the next 3 months OR buy yourself a ticket to Germany take the train to Belgium, enjoy all the non-'exotic' authentic food and brews from both countries this place has capitalized on. It's Pinkberry for men with that added touch of bad hipster service. My final opinion.... only try rattlesnake meat if you are man enough to kill it yourself, otherwise cook yourself some burnt chicken on a stick.
