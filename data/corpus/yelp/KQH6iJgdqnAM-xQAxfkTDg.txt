Restaurant: Fortune Cookie Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Fresh. Flavorful. Fantastic. This is without a doubt the best Chinese I've had in Atlanta. Â I recommend the spicy eggplant dish (which is on the low calorie menu, though from the taste you'd never guess) or perhaps the scrumptious mo shu pork. This quiet place has a varied menu, excellent service and high quality food. The shopping strip where it's located is rather dull, which is probably why this restaurant is such a well kept secret. Fortune Cookie is a fortunate find.
