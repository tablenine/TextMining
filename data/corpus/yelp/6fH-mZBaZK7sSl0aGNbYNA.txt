Restaurant: Over Easy Café
Category: American (Traditional)
Since moving to Ravenswood I have been trying to go and explore the diner culture in the city.  Over Easy Cafe was a most wonderful experience.. for a small place it was pretty busy with a 45 min wait at about 1030 on a sunday which isnt that bad for a breakfast place.  While you wait outside the cafe has coffee for patrons to sip on while a table clears up.  the Sassy eggs were delicious as well as their chicken sausage links.  Plates range from 650 to about 10 bucks but you get a perfect portion and it is super yummy! worth  every penny! it is nice and cozy in side. you dont even feel like it is as small as it actually is.... . i would make this my regular breakfast place if i ate breakfast religiously :-D
