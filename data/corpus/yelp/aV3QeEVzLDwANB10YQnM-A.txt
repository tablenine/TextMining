Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Great all you can eat Korean BBQ place. I don't think it' can be beat for the price, the outdoor setting, and all the crazy friends you can bring and enjoy some good food with. You can be as rowdy as you want and you won't be bothering a lot of people because of the great environment. Love taking my friends here, we all leave without holes in our pockets, stuffed bellies and great memories. I think the cha-dol is amazing!
