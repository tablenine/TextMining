O, O, OMG....is all I can say about this place. This is Atlanta's best and finest steak house/lobster bar. I ended up befriending the GM of Chops and let's just say I was treated very well. Had there signature flash fried lobster tail and it was incredible! What made it such a memorable night was that I had Opus One. At the end of the night I requested my bill and everything was comped! . . They also have an exclusive back room where only the big baller's hang out. Expect to drop some dough 'cause this place ain't cheap.
