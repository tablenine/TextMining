Ordered the loroco pupusas which were really good. It was my first time trying pupusas and I am hooked! It's a very simple appetizer, corn flatbread filled with cheese but is perfectly satisfying when accompanied with a pickled cabbage salad and some kind of tomato sauce. So simple yet so good!. . My boyfriend ordered the Bistec Encebollado..salvadoran style steak. GREAT choice. So tender and flavorful. But an even better choice, believe it or not is what I ordered: Camarones al Mojo de Ajo, king shrimp with a lemon-garlic marinade. Very generous portions of garlic will win me over and Gloria's did. Looooooved it! Perfectly grilled. You only get 5-7 butterfly shrimp but it is so damn satisfying I guarantee you will leave smacking your lips and grinning. I love trying new foods but next time I come back, I'm ordering this dish again.. . Bill came out to be $32! What a steal. Don't mind picking up the tab for that one..and I'll be back f or more! Highly recommended.
