after we finally figured out where to park (in the back underground), and found the place (in the back corner, no real signage).....this was a great lunch. . . couldnt decide between lobster roll and pug burger so server told me to go with the burger. insane size on a small english muffin. add fried egg. comes with a ton of fries. if you dont mind some blue cheese on your burger id say you have to get this. . . girlfriend got crab cake benedict, good but probably would try something different next time. . . started with hamachi which actually was not that good. id come back here for the burger as weird as that sounds since this is mainly a seafood place.
