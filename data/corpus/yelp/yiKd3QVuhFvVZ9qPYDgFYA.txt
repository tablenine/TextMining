Maybe not the highest quality food in all of Chicago, but I just love it so much. Â Best gyoza (potstickers) I've had - they're just crispy goodness. (Makes my mouth water just thinking about 'em!). The pad thai is great too. I'm not a vegetarian, but I love to get it with tofu. Their service is quick and friendly, and the prices are just right.
