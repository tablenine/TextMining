My second time to this popular diner was an improvement on the first. Maybe it was the company. Maybe it was the nighttime visit. In any case, the joint was packed as usual, but the counter is as good as the booth and two seats was all we needed. Â Wendy had tofu nachos. I had the Jucy Lucy burger with onion rings. A wide selection of food, all-day availability of breakfast, quick service and decent prices.
