Category: Southern
Alright, so I've heard all the hype. I was kinda skeptical. But alas! I was more than pleasantly surprised. Who knew that fried chicken and waffles of all things actually GO GREAT together?! Who knew the salty and sweet phenomenon hit a home run with this combo? Their mac and cheese is pretty good, as are many of their other southern-style sides. The service is friendly and very homey. THe only downside I could think of was and maybe I'm wrong but I don't think they had AC. And on a hot day in LA and w/me dowsing everything in hot sauce, I need some AC! But overall, a great meal with some good company! I shall never doubt you again Roscoes!
