My buddies decided to surprise and took me to this place for my birthday.  I'm a big meat eater and I was looking forward to trying this place for several months.  Thanks guys!. The place was somewhat different than what I expected.  I was expecting an old, aged tradition steak place but the decor was modern and somewhat upbeat.  The background music, photos for celebrities on the walls and on the menu, young staff and decor were fitting somehow.  . We ordered several appetizers (Toro tartar, Kobe sashimi, etc) which were quite good, we all had USDA Nebraska Corn-fed sirloin steaks with some side dishes (mac and cheese, finger potatoes, creamed spinach and mushrooms) was washed all down with nice bottle of Melot.   They were all good but one thing that was really stood out for me was the dark chocolate soufflé.  I'm not a big fan of desserts but I really enjoyed the warm semi sweet souffle with various "condiments.". Some negatives:. It can be quite pricy. The choice of music is somewhat eclectic and loud. Celebrity sighting can be somewhat distracting (Larry King, Sidney Portier, Tom Arnold, Jackie Collins were dining near us). . The most memorable part of the dinner for me was four guys just having a dinner together, talking "shop" and eating fatty meat!  Good times....... . Cheers,
