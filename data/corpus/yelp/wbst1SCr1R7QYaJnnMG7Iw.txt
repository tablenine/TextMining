Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I really liked the burger itself because I like my burger patties to be soft. We got the Umami burger with the truffle fries. The burger was delicious with the flavor and perfectly cooked meat. . . Now, the service on the other hand is not praise worthy at all. Actually, our waiter sucked! He had this semi attitude on him when we got there. We had to ask repeatedly for our utensils, not to mention, when asked to see if we can get the burger cut in half, he's reply was " we don't cut our burgers". wth?? Really? We must've looked like retards who dined out for the first time because last I checked Kitchens at restaurants had knives available for such request. . Additionally, he gave us the worse seat in the restaurant which was this crappy room with small bar side along the wall. There was another party in there that we might as well have joined their conversation since the space was fit for for a family. . If it wasn't for the server I would go back there again.
