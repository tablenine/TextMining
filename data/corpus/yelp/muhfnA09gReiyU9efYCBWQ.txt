When I first heard of Kogi I was so excited.  I love Korean food and I love Mexican food and I love taco trucks, so what could be better?  I couldn't wait to finally come across one of the trucks.  I followed on Twitter and finally, serendipity.  I was on the look out for a place to have lunch and, luckily, I was not in a time crunch when I spied a truck so I turned around and parked. Huzzah! . . I ordered three tacos; tofu, spicy pork, short ribs.  They were good. But not oh so yummy as I'd hoped the fusion of these flavors would be.  For a mouth-watering delicious Mexican taco, try a different taco truck.  For yummy Korean food, visit K-Town.  For convenient and sufficiently good tacos or for something a little different, enjoy Kogi.  . . I still love the idea and if I spy them again and the line isn't long, I may stop to try the quesadilla.  I'm still very curious about this venture and I hope it succeeds.
