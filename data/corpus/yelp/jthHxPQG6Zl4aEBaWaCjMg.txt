I love Mexican food and was sick of going to Garcia's all the time, so we tried this place. So nice inside! Really cozy and great atmosphere. We went at like 6:00 pm on a Friday and it was busy, but we were seated immediately. . . Totally not a fan of the salsa, but my husband liked it. It had a dijon taste. Weird. I'm not too adventurous, so I just had the taco platter. It was nothing special. My husband had the skirt steak, which he enjoyed, but again, eh. . . It was a nice atmosphere and maybe I would have liked something else, but for $40, we probably won't rush back.
