I want to come here every weekend. I want to try everything on the menu!. . We went here last weekend at about noon. It was a cold, rainy day. Not a fun day to be waiting outside for 45 minutes for a table in this tiny restaurant. But, they have complimentary, Julius Meinl coffee while you wait. That was wonderful. There were 3 of us, so it took us a long time to get a table. Two tops were being sat faster because of the LINGERERS!! Okay people, this is a small restaurant and a lot of people wait outside, sometimes in the cold and rain, for a table here, so this is clearly not a restaurant for lingering and chatting it up after you are all done with your meal and paid up! I would not really recommend coming here with a large group of people, unless it is about 2:00 or 2:15 (this is when they seem to slow down quite a bit, but they do close at 3:00).. . I had the banana cream french toast with the caramel rum sauce. OMG! So good and the portion was just right. I do wish that I would have ordered a side of bacon with it because I tried a piece of my husband's bacon and not only was it cooked perfectly, but, it tasted great in combination with the french toast. My husband had the Sassy Eggs. They were phenomenal. How can you go wrong with chorizo and eggs!. The daily specials looked awesome as well. I seriously could eat everything on the menu. That is why I am now planning on coming here at least once a month. Oh, they also have strawberry or blackberry orange juice. Of course it was delicious.. . The decor and atmosphere is super cute. It's bright, fun and modern. The staff is super friendly. . . I am in love.
