so this place is pretty much a huge hit and is busy on a very regular basis. it seems that they are having a lot of success which is really cool because the owners are young and the economy sucks. having a hit against the odds is great news, i think. . . i go here pretty regularly-- always taking new people along to try it out and everyone is always pleased to be eating here. the only problem is that there is some major inefficiency. ordering takes place is a tiny front area that can sometimes be busy with up to 40 people waiting in an awkward cramped line. first time visitors who are not accompanied by someone who has been here before are terribly confused. menus are still small paper menus and no one is sure where to get one. why isn't there a big menu overhead that people can read while they wait in line? your menu items are almost always exactly the same and even if they aren't--- cover up what is missing-- have an additional board for specials.. do something! . . fortunately-- what they lack in experience or coordination they make up for in personality and friendliness. almost everyone who works here is very nice. i love travis who works at the register. charming. . . they seem to even be expanding their vegetarian options which is cool. you can bring your unfortunate meat-avoiding friends here with confidence. i still order the rattlesnake sausage. it's a phenom. . . but guys! please do something about the lines. let us order at the bar too. get another register. don't make excuses. you're making a lot of money and you need to improve to keep your clientele loyal and happy. and PLEASE fix the lighting. i don't like eating in a basement atmosphere-- i don't think anyone else does either. yes the food is good but the restaurant itself needs work. re-invest!
