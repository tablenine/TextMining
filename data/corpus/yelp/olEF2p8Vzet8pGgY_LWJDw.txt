awesome food. terribly slow service and so crowded on weekends.. i debated on stars, but i think it's not fair to give bad review cuz it does have awesome food. . didn't try that famous pancakes cuz we were overwhelmed by the size. we didn't wanna waste the food. so he had mom's french toast and i had fiesta scramble -- both fantastic. so flavorful and delicious. bacon on the side? epic. great coffee too. . parking's pretty easy since they share free parking lot with riteaid. but it could be tough since construction stuff from riteaid took over lots of spaces. . would definitely try to avoid weekend. waiting outside on  the ugly side of sunset isn't fun, and the service is pretty horrible. it took almost 2 hrs for our entire brunch there and i know it took less than 30min for us to finish the food.
