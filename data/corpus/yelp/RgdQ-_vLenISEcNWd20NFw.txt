Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
The whole time we waited in line I thought, "I hope this is worth the wait, I hope this is worth the wait..."  45 minutes later I sat on one of the back tables and thought, "Well at least I can say I've been to Pinks!"  . . The lines are long and I gotta agree that the ordering system sucks but I don't think it's ever going to change so.... . We ordered some Chili Cheese Hot Dogs, a Mild Polish (with the chili) and fries.  The fries are nothing to write home about (coated and seasoned) and the dogs were ok (my sister really liked her polish dog) but at least I can say I've been to Pinks.
