The best food to get at any diner/greasy spoon is breakfast.  So buy the french toast and the mac and cheese balls, if you want a proper dinner then go somewhere else.  what do you expect from a place that's open all hours, would you rather eat at Denny's?  I've never had bad service but I find amusement in the "actress" or "actor" t-shirts that the food servers wear.  Is that what you would call Silverlake irony?  Chew on that, residents of hipsterville.
