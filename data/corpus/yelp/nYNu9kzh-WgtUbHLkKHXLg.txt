Restaurant: Fellini&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
Fellini's mostly gets my vote because they are open late and it provides me an alternative to Taco Cabana assuming I can get my butt in gear to eat dinner before 2am. The food isn't bad but it's not great, I haven't found a dish I hate but I haven't found anything that I love either. The food all has a very Johnny's Pizza taste/similarity to it all. . . I love sitting outside at this location, I practically think it is a must! The whole Ponce area isn't the nicest place ever and you should be prepared to get approached by a bum or two if your sitting on the outside brim of tables/chairs but that just adds to the general excitement of the area. What really helps me pick Fellini's over any other pizza place in Atlanta is the late night hours, outdoor seating, tons of parking and most importantly they have Coke Zero on tap! As the biggest Coke Zero fan in the history of the United States you have to get really pumped when you find gems like that!
