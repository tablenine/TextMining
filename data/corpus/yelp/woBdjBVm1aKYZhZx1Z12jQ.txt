Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
lawrys- name brand steakhouse. example of hyperbole, almost like LV toilet paper but for steak.  . . just got back from the traditional pre-xmas dinner there which we have done for years. yet this year was different since my tongue has evolved just like me.. . i had the lawry cut and also got to try the miso sea bass. the prime rib was medium rare and done properly. it came with corn and mashed potatoes. i asked for extra gravy since im a groovy guy and like lots of gravvvvy.  skipped out on dessert since the meal was so heavy. had about half my steak leftover . . the sea bass was tender and moist and the miso seasoning relatively strong, but just on top, like snow on the mountains.. . they also had meatball and potato chip appetizers if you come before 5, not sure about afterwards. the meatballs were very yum, about one staircase about chef bouyardee which is at step #3. if i were a bum i would def try to sneak some snacks out of this place.. . the christmas caroling is ok. to me its almost like a weed wacker. the singers were good, just not into the xmas music and also not that big on christmas. the place was packed and you must make a reservation unless you want to wait and wait and wait x 2 hours.. . service was pretty wack too, although very friendly long waits in between encounters.. . if it were my choice, i would break "tradition" and go somewhere that has eclectic and sumptuous dishes, ie ____ where you can drop $40 and really feel like you had experienced some fine dining.  i can make steak at home, but not everyone can or maybe my pisces roots bias my perspective as well. also not big on brand names.
