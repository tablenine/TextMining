Restaurant: Crust
Category: Pizza
I got a really good deal with '. http://Restaurant.com. ' and I decided to try Crust. The $25 gift certificate is good for both food and drinks, including alcohol. So that's a big plus.. . Looking at the menu, there really isn't much to look forward to. They pretty much serve salads, sandwiches and pizzas with quite a decent list of wines and beers. If you are looking for something different, this might not be the place other than a few items on the menu. . . I had the flamkuchen, which has bacon, caramelized onion and bechamel. It was really tasty but the bacon is a little fatty to my liking. The crust was very good; chewy on the inside with a crunch on the outside. The only downside is that the pizzas are overpriced. It filled me up but not sure if I want to pay $14 for a personal pizza. If you are not hungry, one pizza will feed two people. . . I was excited to see that they have tapenade in the menu but folks, if you know what tapenade is, you will be disappointed with what you ordered. Their version is nothing but coursely chopped kalamata olives, capers and caramelized onions served with little pieces of baked pizza dough. I don't think they get it but what's the point of serving tapenade with bread if you can't *spread* them?. . Seems like the service is hit or miss. Our server was very prompt and friendly. The decor is nothing to rave about unless you like having mostly ordinary-upscale organic pizza with wine on IKEA-esque tables and chairs. It's simply confusing to say the least.
