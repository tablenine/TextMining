I'd been wanting to come to inkster for a while, now.  I'd thought it was a barbeque place from the name.  Joke was on me, though, because in fact, it's not a bbq place, and I think the name is meat to aptly describe it's *patrons*, like me.  An *oinkster*, pigging out on their pastrami sandwich and Ube shake, two of the greatest things in the world.  I don't love their fries, but the garlic aoili is the greatest thing EVER.  Even better than Zankou's.  Hip hip, hooray! I was going to say that the pastrami sandwich was the 2nd best I've ever had, next to Katzs in NYC...but to tell you the truth, I think they're on par...plus this one's a third of that one's price!
