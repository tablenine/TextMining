Awesome!!!!  I will say that the line and the wait had me a bit discouraged.  However a friend from LA encouraged me to wait it out!  It was so worth it!  It's definitely going back on my hit list when I head back that way.   In addition, I loved the way the owner looked out for his staff.  He prepped us prior to heading in spot that his waiter had a very long day and too be easy!  We made sure we weren't too difficult. . . The pancakes were huge and tasty!  I had the Bailey and Kahlua pancakes.  One friend had the Mounds of Pleasure!  I could not believe my eyes when the food came out!  The pancakes were huge!  I ended sharing my food with a good friend and we still didn't finish them!  . . Everyone was having a great time and LOVED their food!  The waiter was even spectacular!  We were some hungry folks when we arrived so we kept the food coming!  I will also say this!  There were a bunch of cuties in the place as well!  Ladies, great eye candy besides the food!  . . Have fun and enjoy this place as much as I did!
