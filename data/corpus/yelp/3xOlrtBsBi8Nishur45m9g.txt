Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
I am so bummed. My first high end Mario Batali restaurant experience was disappointing.  While I loved Pizzaria Mozza - Osteria just was not a great experience.. . It started with showing up promptly for our reservation and then waiting over 1 hour to be seated. Being told we were next to be seated and having two other parties seated before us. (Why bother lying to us? Just be honest!). After being seated we were told to order ALL of our dishes at one time - appetizers, primi, and secondi- despite the fact we had only decided on apps so far - because our waiter claimed it would be better for the kitchen. Yes, better for the kitchen to make every single dish at one time so they can close since we were seated so incredibly late. All of our appetizers were incredible, but the primi and secondi were progressively less good - you know why? Cuz my dried up quail and crusty ricotta raviolo had probably been sitting under a heat lamp for half an hour.. . For the amount of money O.M. charges, I know I deserve better than this.  Yes they comped us our proseccos and sent out a free appetizer because of our wait. That was great. But that doesn't mean the kitchen can just do a half assed rush job with our food. . . One thing I will say - service was impeccable (not counting the lying maitre'd). Despite how incredibly late it was, the staff never rushed us from our meal. They were very patient and attentive. Though our original waiter did leave before we finished and someone else had to sub in. Also - the sommeliers were really great. Good recommendations and happy to work in our price range.. . I'm sticking to P.M. from now on, and while this won't deter me from trying out Batali's other restaurants, I'm certainly not gonna cough up the bucks to come here for a full meal again. If I ever do come back, I'm sticking to Nancy's mozzerella.
