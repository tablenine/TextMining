I will never ever turn down an offer to wrap my lips around large exotic sausages. NEVER...  My oh My.... . Rabbit and Lamb with sweet peppers and my favorite, the Kielbasa with spicy peppers.  Sweet, spicy, meaty goodness.. . Bear and I got here near closing time.  Had no problem getting our order in and enjoying this tasty late night treat with a couple of beers.  I am not a beer lover but I will take a Chimay Blanc any night.. . Very comfy atmosphere with bench style seating and a few table tops.. I've been lucky enough to have only dined here during off times such as late in the evening or Mondays.  If you stick with this plan you will not be disappointed. . . Enjoy...
