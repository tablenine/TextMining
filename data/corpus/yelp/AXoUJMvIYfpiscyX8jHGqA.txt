Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
Delicious! Dunlays has an excellent martini and meal menu.. My favorite thing about the place is the food, if you're super hungry I suggest the cheeseburger, it's filling and the best burger I've ever had. (Well besides Kuma's and the Orbit Room) and if you're in the mood for a pre-drink snack, the spinach dip hits the spot. I'm neither a punk rocker, scenester, or yuppie, and I don't get any of those super high class vibes from this place. (What's wrong with a clean bar?). The drinks are not cheap here, but please tell me where they are under 4.50 in the city? Let's remember where we live people, those specials you enjoyed at your college bar are long gone. I'd take this place over delilah's any day.
