Do you miss the fine dining scene in Atlanta? Long for the days of The Dining Room and Seeger's? Make a reservation at Woodfire Grill stat. Chef Kevin Gillespie is turning out prix fixe meals that rival the best in Atlanta. (I'm talking about you, Bacchanalia. Still adore you, but I'm totally crushing on Woodfire.). . Our table opted for the blind tasting menu and it was one of the most memorable dinner experiences I've ever had. Each course was well thought out, expertly executed, and absolutely delicious. Most of the ingredients are locally sourced, and all are at their peak of freshness. . . I especially love how Chef Gillespie marries fine dining with southern flavor. The pimento cheese profiterole offered as the amuse bouche was an incredible bite of light, flaky pastry juxtaposed with the tangy rich creaminess of the cheese. Bliss!. . Since the tasting menu changes nightly, I won't go into details but I can honestly say I've never had a better pork belly in my life. Ever. It was that good. . . It also appears Woodfire Grill has made some small changes to their interior since my last visit. It seemed more open, and the seating was much improved. Service, good as usual, didn't disappoint. Thanks, Scotty!. . I'd like to give one last shout out to whoever is in charge of the music selection. Loved hearing The National. Keep up the great work.
