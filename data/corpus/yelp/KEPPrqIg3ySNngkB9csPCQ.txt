Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
The pizza at Coalfire is good quality, but it's also expensive for what you get.  I guess it doesn't help much that I'm not a huge fan of Neapolitan style pizza.. . The service here was pleasant, if spacey and unprofessional.  My waitress checked in on me once to see if my food was alright and then she disappeared.  No one ever refilled my water glass and toward the end of my grease wheel, I was running on empty.  By the way, I'm not a fancy-pants kind of person: if your intention is not to check water glasses and refill as necessary, then just bring me a jug to start with and I'll take care of topping it up.. . I'm happy that I finally got to try Coalfire, but having crossed it off my list of places to try, I don't think that I'll be back anytime too soon.
