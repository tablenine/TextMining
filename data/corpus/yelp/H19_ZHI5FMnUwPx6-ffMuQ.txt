The Magic Castle is pretty cool. I like magic and remember watching the old David Copperfield specials in the 90's. This place, though, brings you back to the old mystique of magic and has a great feel to it. Old school mansions are rad. Yes, I said "rad". . . I must agree with most here that the food is average at best and very expensive. But you kind of have to just buck up and weather through it, because the meal isn't the main attraction here - the magic is. . . The acts always change and the night I went it ranged from "so-so" to "hilarious" to "excellent". In one of the small show rooms we saw a Japanese magician who had won a few different rewards, and he was probably the best act I saw of the night. Making things disappear and reappear, he was lightning quick. Also saw a random act that just happened to be added which was a combination of magic and odd dancing, which was just the right mix to keep you interested.. . I hadn't seen so many "older" people getting so thoroughly hammered at a place in a long time. And they definitely throw a few back at the MC. Which was funny yet also a little scary - both because the drinks are expensive and because you know they're driving around Hollywood later that night. But we left somewhat early since my brother was a party pooper and didn't have to worry about it too much. . . Anyways, I enjoyed the MC and would come back again if I got an invite. Fun times had by all, that's for sure.
