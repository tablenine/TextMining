Just ate there this weekend after all the great reviews and was not let down! I had the Enchiladas Suizas with Cheese, white rice, and black beans. Washed it all down with an agua fresca de sandia (watermelon). The enchilada sauce was perfect, it was meduim spicy and delicious. My mother said it was the best enchiladas suizas she has EVER tried. I trust her opinion her being from mexico and having tried mexican food from all over! My sister also enjoyed her tortilla soup and nachos which come with a generous amount of cheese and meat. The tacos looked small but delicious, I'll have to try them next time but I am sure they are just as good as everything else here!!. . Oh and they serve breakfast all day, huevos rancheros, huevos con chorizo, etc. Major plus!
