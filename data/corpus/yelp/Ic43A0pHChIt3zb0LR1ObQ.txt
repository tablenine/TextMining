Don't even bother going if you're not a garlic fan. The decor is fun and full of energy and the staff is very helpful at giving suggestions and explaining the menu. The more intimate tables are perfect for a date night or the large tables are perfect for a group dinner. Wasn't a big fan of the gartiini (was practically straight vodka) or the bagna calda (it didn't seem garlicy enough!), but the garlic ice cream is one of the best desserts I've had in a while. Any of the garlic-enhanced meats are good, and the garlic mashed potatoes or garlic fries is a fitting complement to the main course. The mojito menu was another pleasant surprise. I'm a fan.
