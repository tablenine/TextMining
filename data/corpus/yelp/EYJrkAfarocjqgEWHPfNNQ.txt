Wrong omelette came out for my order. . . whatever~ they brought the right one out.  Dad's came out with burnt toast. . . really?  it was pretty obvious, please look at the dish that you're bringing.  Oil used in cooking yorkshire pudding for maple syrup?!  ARE YOU SERIOUS?!!!!??!  . . i dont even know if they were telling the truth, the first time the server try to pass it off as olive oil, but it was obvious it was used as there were bits of black something on the bottle of the little bottle and it tasted of meat. . . why does oil used for cooking bread taste like meat??  . . my sister's breatfeeding my nephew right now and she finished the whole plate before i realized it.  i guess the powdered sugar covered the taste?  but i was very disgusted.   makes you think what else the kitchen messes up if they mistake USED oil for maple syrup.
