Restaurant: Kogi
Category: Food Stands
So KOGI popped my foodie truck cherry!. . I remember when I was checking my Twitter and realized that a truck was serving nearby.. . My bf and I made a quick U-turn and stood in a quick line for our Kogi tacos! We ordered every kind of taco (Korean short rib, chicken, and spicy pork), except the tofu choice.  We also ordered the SPecial of the day (some yummy sandwich w/ pesto) and the dessert of the day (melt-in-yo-mouth chocolate cake!).. . We actually spent $18 @ the Kogi truck (including drinks) that day!  But it was worth it because my boyfriend was happy and it started my stalking of L.A. Foodie trucks!. . YaYer.. :*)
