Good food, but ho-hum service.  We got our seats immediately which was nice.  I expected it to be nicer on the inside than it was -- but it's kinda like a artsy casual spot.  The mens restroom is small and dirty.. . However, the food is what I came for &amp; it was delicious.  I had the skirt steak and she had salmon.  We shared and I like mine better than hers.  . . I'm definitely coming back.  I could even see myself eating by myself at the bar -- after work.  The food was wonderful and not too pricey.. . If they step up their service game, it would be a 5-star spot.. . SC
