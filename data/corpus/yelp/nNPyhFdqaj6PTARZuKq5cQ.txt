office burger - 12.50. sweet potato frites - 7.50. lindemans peche lambic - 8.00. . the burger was nice and juicy with a hint of bbq sauce and bleu cheese, don't expect to get any toppings because the only choice for this burger is how well done or unwell you want it.  the sweet potato frites were actually... really good, but for 7.50 it's a little pricey~.  if you ever want a sweet beer that doesn't really taste like beer but more like dessert, this is it.  the lindemans peche was just the cherry of it all... in my opinion, delicious!
