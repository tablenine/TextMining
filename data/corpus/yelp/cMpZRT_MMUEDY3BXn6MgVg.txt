Alright I went here this past Friday and I have to say I had a pretty good time! I never went to the old location so I can't compare the two but a nice spot all the same. The restaurant itself is pretty big and it can get pretty noisy what with the tons of people and live latin band which by the way were quite good. The food was damn good and pretty big portions for tapas. The prices here were about average. I had some wine($6.00) and a caipirinha ($7.50) and they were both very good. My friends though were drinking beer which was $5.00 ouch! They quickly switched to crown and coke when they saw they were pretty big and strong and only cost $8.00! Also you can Â sign up online to become an Amigo and show them you're printed up e-mail from them at the restaurant they give you a $10.00 gift card that you can use that night! Then you receive your Amigo card that you can use on all future visits for discounts on drinks and b-day freebies. Back to the food I think a couple of my favs were the fried Manchego cheese with quince paste and spanish olives, and the flat iron steak which was tender and packed with flavor. The place itself is very easy to find and has complimentary valet parking. I went there with a party of 8 and everyone had a good time. The only complaint I have is that there were several times that we needed our waiter and he was nowhere to be found but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt cause it was packed in there. Plan on returning soon.
