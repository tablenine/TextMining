The Good:  This place has become our favorite spot on Friday night. We love bar food and this place has it!  They are also the only resto I know that serves the Turduckon burgers.  Though, I am not a burger fan, it was good. We had the Grilled Chicken &amp; Feta salad with house-made herb-feta dressing.  Love it!!! I love their Buffalo Fried Chicken Liver, however they no longer have it on the menu.  Their Shrimp Poboys was huge and yummy! And, the onion rings are good as well.  I had their chocolate cake and key lime flavor cheese cake.  Both were delish as well.  They have a large selection of wine and beer, a definite bonus.. . The Bad: We love the music in the smoking room, but it can get quite smoky.  If they can switch the music in both rooms, it would be awesome!  . . The Ugly: the bouncer to the place next door.  Just because I don't have tatoos, cancer stick on my lips and rock out with the women that think they are bad ass, doesn't make me less of a human being.
