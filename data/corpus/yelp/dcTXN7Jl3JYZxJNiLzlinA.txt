A David vs. Goliath story:. . Yea, though I walk through the doors of a sugary death,. I will fear no large portion: for thou art with me; thy fork and thy knife, they comfort me.. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of this decadence:. Thou anointest my lap with a napkin; my water cup runneth over.. Surely sweet sweet goodness and gluttony shall follow me all days of my life:. And I will dwell in the house of the Griddle forever.
