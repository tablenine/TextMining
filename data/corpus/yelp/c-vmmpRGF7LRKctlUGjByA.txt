See my review on Sunset Ranch for my tips on what to do with the leftover pancakes you will surely have after you try to devour these massive, succulent, steaming cakes.. . Pancake stacks can feed a horse - literally.. . Seating is a bit cramped indoors and the street-side tables might as well have orange crossing-guard vests on them - you are barely off the busy Boulevard.. . Gustatory rewards are worth the risk of being flattened by sidewalk-drivers.. . If they still have the pumpkin pancakes - get them.  They are terrific.  They may as well come with a candle in the middle - the stack is as big as a Jack-o-lantern.
