ehhhhh is about all I can say about this place. Actually that's not really fair, would have given the place 3.5/ maybe even 4 stars if I was feeling particularly generous but an incompetent hostess brought them down.. . I have no problem with nyc bar/ restaurants hiring an attractive hostess to seem "hipper"  but PLEASE make sure she/he has the skill set to be competent at her job. I went a few weeks back and I'm still irked about her ineptitude (I think her name was Andrea?), since my annoyance hasn't passed I thought I would write about it. The wait grew from an initial estimate of 20 min to an hour wait and then she offered us a horrible table right in  front of the door (it was a cold night) I asked how much longer it would be for something further inside (it is a big space after all) and she said not more than 5 min, 10 min tops -- a few tables were wrapping up. Over 30 minutes later we were seated. After over 1hr30min waiting a restaurant is going to have to do a lot to make it up to me... nearly impossible. While the food was OK, the waitress friendly, and the drinks good ... they had too far to go to make it up unless they cranked out some high caliber food. That didn't happen.. The funny thing is this place isn't even that hip... they have a lot more confidence than they should. . Overall-- if it's a weeknight, you're hungry, standing right in front of the door and don't mind dropping $20 on an entree... walk right in.
