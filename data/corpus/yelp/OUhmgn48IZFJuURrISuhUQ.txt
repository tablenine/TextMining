Their $4 cheeseburger special on Wednesdays is great!  Crisp fresh mushrooms!  Fries were incredibly fresh and you can't help but eat them all.  It does get super smokey in the restaurant though on Wednesdays.  We have been there twice and both times our clothes stunk...  stick with the outside seating.
