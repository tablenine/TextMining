Restaurant: Busy Bee Cafe
Category: Soul Food
In a land where soul food restaurants are everywhere, Busy Bee rules them all.  The food is greasy, fattening, and utterly delicious- as soul food should be.  The sweet tea has enough sugar to make the straw stand up on its own, and the place is the hole in the wall in a rough neighborhood, as it should be (although the neighborhood is quickly becoming gentrified).  Everything there is good, but their baked or fried chicken is addictive, and their oxtails are great.. . The service is relatively slow (another hallmark of a great soul food place) and it does get busy around lunch time.  Also, the prices are a little bit high, but that's what happens when your soul food place gets Zagat rated.  . . Since I work close by, I have to resist the urge to eat their weekly (I AM trying to improve my diet), but this has already become my standard take-people-from-out-of-town-to-show-them-what-Atl anta-is-like spot.
