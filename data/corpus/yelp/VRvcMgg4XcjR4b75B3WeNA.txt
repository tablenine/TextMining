I have a serious problem.  I can't resist the foie gras.  Ever.  Especially when it's served with Vietnamese caramel.  Seriously, I don't know what I ever did during the ban.  To the enabler that brought it back, I thank you.. . We arrived at Sola on a chilly night, but I really wanted to sit on the patio.  The host was great about offering a shawl and having the heaters turned on so we would be comfortable.  It was a nice touch.. . As you probably gathered, I started with the foie gras ravioli with Vietnamese caramel.  It was a great combination of flavors and I loved it.  For the main course, I ordered the pork, which is comprised of grilled loin, braised cheek and kalua pork with figs and bacon bread pudding.  I love kalua pork, but the highlight of the dish was the grilled loin.  It was delicious and prepared perfectly.  My bf chose the cobia, served with potato gnocchi and mussels.  It was also very good.. . I liked the friendly service and the cozy atmosphere.  A great compliment to the food.
