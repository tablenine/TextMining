Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
So after 11 hrs at Disneyland, 50% of our car demanded we stop at Tito's Tacos.  I grimaced at the lines, and we waited about 20 minutes for a parking spot.  I was just going to wait until I got home to make dinner, but after all of this build up, I just had to have a taco.. . Meh.. . In fact, the tacos were pretty gross.  I'm still someone incredulous about the popularity of this place given the fact we are in Southern California and have access to some amazing Mexican food.  Tito's is WAY below average...and hello? Crispy taco shells?  Is this Taco Bell?  Should I have to pay 40 cents more for cheese?  That was kind of weird.  The salsa was pretty good, but nothing to jump up and down over.. . Disappointed.
