The strange landscape of Hipsters, Foodies and the oddball college kid and the business men who read about it in some food mag that is Wurstkuche. I didn't eat the food but I did have the beers. Belgium brews. Good. Apple Ale. Real good. Try it for sure. Apple Ale. Will be back to try the grub and rate it again.
