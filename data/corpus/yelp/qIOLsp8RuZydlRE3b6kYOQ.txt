Co-worker claimed this joint had "the best pad thai in the city"... while I don't agree, it was pretty good.. We ordered delivery and the fella on the phone was polite, spoke clearly and repeated my order.  . The delivery guy surprised us with a free bottle of champagne!  Not sure what that was about, but thanks Ping Pong!
