Moody and brooding... I like it! . . Nobody had ever mentioned East Atlanta to me before, so you can imagine my surprise when we stumbled into this Seattlesk (yeah, so... I make up words) bar/music venue! . . After we hit that Satanic strip of fast food restaurants between the city and East Atlanta, I was sure civilization had all but ended! Thank God I was wrong! . . I felt right at home! . . We weren't there to see a show, but I can't wait until I do!
