I wish I could rate this "NO STARS"....the one star is for my love of the Ocean Sundae roll.  The "zero stars" if for the seriously rude and obnoxious service that Tank delivers.  That cute stretch of Lincoln Avenue will greatly benefit from all the ex-Tank patrons that will never go back.  I am one of them.  I will smile as I pass by and wave at the owner/host and show him that my money is best spent elsewhere.  Heck, maybe I'll see him next time I'm at Bag Dog Tavern having a yummy Ahi Tuna taco....and he'll smile at me when he's clearing our table.
