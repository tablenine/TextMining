Love this place and I usually make it a point to never frequent so-called L.A. "hot spots." Food is great and, jesus, the dessert selection. Can sit inside (very little seating here though) or outside (none available when we were there). Pricey, and just when you thought you were just buying lunch/breakfast what-have-you, you decide to grocery shop (lots of items, sauces, edible things for sale) and then it just becomes a total money binge. But it's just a charming place - as much as I tried, I couldn't harbor a bad feeling toward it.
