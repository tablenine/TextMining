Yummy!  I've been waiting for something like this to come around!  I'm hooked on the larger sho pao that I normally get from the filipino or chinese stores... Wow Bao provides a very quick and clean appetite fix!  I've had all their flavors and loved them all.  I also had this one cold drink that was very good.  It was red and I think it had ginger in it.
