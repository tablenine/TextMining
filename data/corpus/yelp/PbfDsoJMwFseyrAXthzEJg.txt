WORTH THE WAIT! I've been going to this joint since I was a little kid and it's still as amazing now as it was years ago. The meat is super tender and what makes the place is the peanut sauce. Sometimes I serioulsy think they lace the sauce because it's so freaking good. The place is super cramped and they fill it to the brim so don't expect to be in the most comfortable eating environment. . . Be prepared to wait though! There have been instances where I've waited up to 1.5 hours.
