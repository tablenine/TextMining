Finally after months of craving and wanting, I had the opportunity to experience one of the finest burgers in town!  Thanks to my food lover friends and fellow yelpers, we were here for a birthday celebration.  All the rave and hype, and all were so true!  The burger was juicy, thick and perfect.  When you look at it you think you can eat two, but think again!  I really liked the sweet potato fries over the regular fries, but those are just bonuses on the side.  I also ordered a H.....something german beer and that was really good too.  There was a huge variety of beers.  The menu is selected, but really people would you order something other than the burger when you come here?!  that's all they need!  Some of my friends enjoyed their specialities: bone marrow and beet salads.  . As far as the service goes, it's a bar like restaurant, I had no complaints...or maybe I was so into my burger that I didn't really pay attention to anything else.  :). I had such a wonderful experience, I can't wait to return again!
