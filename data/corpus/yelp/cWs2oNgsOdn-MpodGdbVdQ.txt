Restaurant: Zuma Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
The first thing I do when going into a sushi restaurant is to meet the sushi chefs and the times I've been to Zuma they have been Japanese so I sat down and was ready to eat. I don't know what it is with Japanese sushi chefs but they have a pride in what they do and make sure their fish is fresh and the presentation is perfect. . . I have only been there about 4 times (since they are pricey but it's worth it) and the sushi has been great. The tuna  was so fresh and the pieces were larger then I get at other places. . . The only downsize is that the wait staff is a little slow even when it's not busy.  I've had to hunt down my waiter to get more sake. Also, don't bring any friends that don't really like sushi b/c sushi is about all they really serve and you're friend will be sitting there starving eating a side salad and miso soup.  . . This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Atlanta, so if you have a little extra dough to spend on sushi I definitely recommend this place.
