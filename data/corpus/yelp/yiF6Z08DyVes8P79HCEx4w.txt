Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Fresh salads, soups, sandwiches with a decadent menu of simple but delicious ice cream and desserts.  YUM.. . Some details:. - Especially amazing salad dressings - which always help make their salads really delicious. - Banana ice cream bars, coated in butterscotch and roasted almonds.  Heaven on a popsicle stick.. - Ability to order any salad as a half salad - still filling enough for a lunch and you can put the money you saved toward dessert. - Good sized menu with specials. - The owner is always there, and he keeps things running really well and takes good care of his customers. . Why it's not getting 5 stars:. - Parking can be tricky on the evenings, because there's very limited metered parking and the side streets are permit-only after 6pm.  They have valet but it's just annoying to pay to valet your car to get an ice cream or a salad.  (I know this is LA, but still...). - Sometimes it's hard to find a table at lunch for a bigger group of people. - I tried their cupcake in a cone and wasn't impressed.
