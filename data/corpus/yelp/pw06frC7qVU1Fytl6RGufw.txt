This is my second time here, and the quality is just as good as I remembered.. . I had the duck pate and the beef cheeks. Both were fantastic. Plates are rather small, so I shared a crusty gentleman. Also good.. . If you do not like meat products, you might be disappointed with the menu, but the bar scene hops.. . All in all, this is a great place.
