Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
The food here is DEFINITELY 5 stars. The reason why I'm only giving 4 stars is because half the time they run out of what you want- whether its the dungeness crab, sausages, etc.. . You HAVE to get the WHOLE SHA BANG. I don't know why anyone wouldn't. The shrimp here is amazing. There is so much flavor.. . My favorites are the corn on the cob and sausage as well. So so so so good.. . It's a great eating experience and the food is great, it's just very annoying when they run out of something.. . Oh, and I always come for lunch on the weekends. It opens at 12pm so if you get there by 11:40 there's absolutely no wait and you can enter right at noon. They'll just take down your name and put it on a list.
