Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I went there on a Saturday night around 8:30 after the Sunset Junction Street Fair.  Yes, there were plenty of food stalls at the fair but we were craving decent fish tacos.  The menu, as everyone has noted, is simple; the options are: fish taco, shrimp taco, and a variety of non-alcoholic drinks.  We grabbed a fish and shrimp taco each and shared a Diet Coke.  The taco preparation is simple, there is a fry pot next to the register where they put in lightly battered shrimp and fish when ordered.  My companion was a bit disappointed when the tortillas came out of a plastic bag and then heated on the comal rather than being made in-house, there is a certain flavor and texture that comes with fresh tortillas that you just can't buy.  . . Once the tacos are made, you are able to dress them as you please.  They offer about 6 different salsas, including pineapple (it sounds sweet but it was perfectly acidic and spicy), radish, mango, spicy, mild, and guac salsa.  In addition to the salsa, they have shaved cabbage and a plain crema, which adds a heavier component to the taco than my preferred white sauce.  Overall, this place ranks high in my fish taco books but just not the epitomy of the fish taco I am looking for.
