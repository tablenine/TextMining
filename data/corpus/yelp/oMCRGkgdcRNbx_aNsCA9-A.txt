Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Hot meat on swords (pardon the graphic imagery, but that's the best way to describe it)! The meat is wonderful, and the side dishes are exquisite as well. I wonder if that's Brazillian BBQ in general, or if Fogo de Chao has mastered it?. . You definitely pay for what you get, and lunch for two ran upwards of $60 during LA Restaurant Week. Service definitely suffers during rush times, and parking is also a hassle (I just went with valet parking out front).. . The reason I ranked it so low is because my credit card number was stolen there--so when you pay, pay by cash!
