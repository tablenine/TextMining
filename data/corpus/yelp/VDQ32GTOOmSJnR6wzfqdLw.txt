3.5 stars. I went to Chop's last night for a work dinner.. The service was excellent. We were seated promptly and had very attentive wait staff. We had 2 waiters who alternated checking up on us, which created a feeling of constant service without hovering.. The food was good, but not great. . The bread was not very good, I passed on the pieces that looked like they had an onion filling (very odd) and just had one slice of plain french bread. It was dry and pretty tasteless. I love bread, so this was a bit disapointing.. For my appetizer, I had the soup of the day - Black Bean. It was a good soup, very thick with corn, onions and pork (which tasted like tasso ham - very salty).. My entree was the 8oz fillet. I ordered medium, but I felt it came out more of a medium rare. It was a juicy steak and had good flavor, but I didn't think it was extraordinary. It was nicely seared on the outside while very tender inside. Good, but I've had better.. We ordered 2 sides - one potato and one vegetable and asked the waiter to select for us. He brought out their hash brown and their corn.. The hashbrown was pretty bland - a plate sized disk of shredded potato - crispy brown on the outside, topped with grated Parmesan cheese. With a good dose of salt and pepper it was good (but I thin i would have preferred the mashed potatoes).. The corn was actually quite good, despite its appearance of being yellow mush.. We had 2 bottles of wine, the first was a syrah (Earthquake) that was good once it breathed a bit. The second was a malbec that none of us enjoyed too much (especially after the first bottle).. We didn't have desert, but did finish up with a glass of a very nice port.. . I have no real complaints about the meal. It was good. Service was good. Ambiance was nice. It just wasn't exceptional and at the cost, I was a little disappointed.
