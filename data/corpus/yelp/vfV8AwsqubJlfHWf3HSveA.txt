The best steak of my life - hands down.  My fiance and I came here for our anniversary and while I'm not a huge steakhouse fan, this place completely blew everything else out of the water.  Not only was the service impeccable, but every morsel of food was outstanding.  They not only bring you cheese bread sticks, but Gougeres and a bread basket filled with in-house made pretzels and focaccia.  . . We split a beet salad (mind you, it's no ordinary beet salad) and the American Kobe filet migon and short ribs, topped off with a banana cream pie.. . I will definitely be coming back here and recommending it to everyone I know.  Just a side note - while it's very typically LA to be fancy and not super fancy at the same time, I would recommend throwing on at least a dress or some heels.  I only saw maybe a couple pairs of jeans in the whole place.
