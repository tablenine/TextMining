Restaurant: The Foundry On Melrose
Category: American (New)
beautiful restaurant with a great outdoor dining back patio.  kinda seedy part of melrose, no? our server was fantastic -- very knowledgable about the menu as well as with the wine pairings. went with the tasting menu.  started with an amuse bouche (aww yeah!) -- some sort of salami wrapped fig - nice.  then off to the first dish - hamachi tartar.  good.  seared turbot -- friggin' ridiculous good. one of the best fish dishes i've ever had.  quail - yeah, i'm not such a big fan of quail. then a beef tenderloin -- good. ended with a melon soup dessert -- not my fave.  dishes were all beautifully plated and quite complex, numerous ingredients with many different flavors and textures in the same dish.  it was cool when our server explained every dish to us as they came out -- kinda felt like we were judges on iron chef or something.. . we didn't stay for it, but they had a loud, lively jazz band playing in the front lounge/bar area.  looked like a fun vibe, but too loud to just chill for drinks with friends.. . overall, pricey, but great ambiance and food --- fo' stars.
