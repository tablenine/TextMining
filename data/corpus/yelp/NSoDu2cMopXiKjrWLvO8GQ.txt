My real rating would probably hover around a 3.5, but I'm not enthusiastic enough for a 4.. . I'll keep it short and sweet: . . Great atmosphere, good for groups, food is good but not out of this world, great selection of drinks and cocktails. . . I recommend for company dinners and the like. Something for everyone.
