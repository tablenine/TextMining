Category: Steakhouses
Ahh yes, Prime rib goodness. Cream corn goodness ^.^ a friend once described the creamed corn as "heavenly" A good place to dress up and have a very "fu fu" experience. Been a while since I was back here, but if you like the place and become a regular, I recommend the VIP card.
