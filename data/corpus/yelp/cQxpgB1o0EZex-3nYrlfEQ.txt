Here's what I had there.. . 1. Peruvian Ceviche. 2. Lamb Columbo. 3. White Sangria. . a total of about $39. . The Peruvian Ceviche was great. It comes with banana chips of some sort. Â I ate alone..not uncommon when travelling for business. The serving could have been enough to fill me up but it tasted so good that I went ahead and finished it anyway.. . The Lamb Columbo soon followed. This.....was.....awesome!! According to my waitress, it was a special at one point but so much was ordered that it became a regular dish on the menu. Glad I found it...and even with the ceviche...alone...was able to put it away.... . The white sangria was tasty. Crisp, sweet, and effective...at this point, no longer a light-weight..but I felt the alcohol in a single serving of the tasty sangria.. . Service was good...and as far as ambiance...hey...it was around lunch time and it's a restaurant in Downtown Los Angeles...so I couldn't really evaluate that.. . I recommend this restaurant especially if you're staying at the Marriott as it is walking distance away.
