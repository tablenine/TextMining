Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
I tried the Counter again, and I'm happy to report the service improved, as they have gotten a good rhythm going.  The manager even came out to make sure that the food was up to snuff, letting us know that if anything was not, to send it back.  I appreciated that.  Unfortunately, I still think the burger itself could have been better.  I think it's a quality problem.  Both of the burgers I've had there were a little gristly.  I'm sure that the Counter sources from a fine vendor, but by comparison to Duke's it's just not the same.  Again, the place is a little pricey for what you get, and I'm not swayed by all the fancy extra ingredients.. . I'm not saying I won't go back, but I won't run.
