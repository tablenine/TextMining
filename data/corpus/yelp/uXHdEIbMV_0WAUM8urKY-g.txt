I've eaten here several times, the most recent time being last Thursday. The food isn't spectacular or very inventive, but the decor is interesting and the service is USUALLY pretty good. The last time I was here the service sucked. I ordered the prix fixe (not really that delicious, but I was expecting that) and the server was totally inflexible about swapping the coconut sorbet for a different flavor of sorbet or ice cream...I get that restaurants have a set prix fixe for a reason, but come on! It's a single scoop of sorbet, not an entree! The friend I was eating with was allergic to coconut and I only wanted to switch so that she could try my dessert. Our server also had no idea what wine to recommend for my friend with her entree and seemed to be doing her best to get us out the door so she could go home. Annoying! I probably won't be back once I use up all the gift certificates I've somehow accumulated for this place.
