Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
i'm a patron of korean food and this place is definitely at the top of my list. i'm not korean... dont speak a word of korean... and i still got the best service. the hostess was happy and smiling and our waiter always refilled our water. for me service is #1 and this place had a great vibe/energy. . . the decor was really modern and the place was exceptionally clean for a k-town restaurant. this place could have easily been located in hollywood and not k-town. . . OMG THE FOOD WAS SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD. if i didnt live so far away i'd have it everyday. the side dishes were exceptional... and they're not cheap about giving you more. i usually have to hunt a waitress down to refill a side dish.. but this place was so attentive they came by asking if i would like some more. the kimchi tastes fresher at soonwon Â than some other k-town restaurants. . . overall i give this place a A+ for food and service. they actually speak english and arent discriminatory towards non-koreans. if you want to avoid bitchy korean waitresses that kill your dining experience... go to soonwon. everybodys super nice there.
