Restaurant: Red Light
Category: Asian Fusion
The environment for Red Light is essentially Cheesecake Factory meets Eastern deco with a dash of Alice in Wonderland at a formal tea party. I can't remember exactly what I got, but I do know it warranted not one but TWO chili pepper symbols, I was disappointed when it was about as spicy as a mild packet from T-Bell. The two other people I was with complained about their curry dishes, so avoid that? The door frames, doors, mirrors, and sinks have a Seusian flare to them and all in gold (rich Whos). I would recommend checking it out sometime when you got some extra cash to blow on a hot date.
