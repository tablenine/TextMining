The atmosphere here is nice- bright colors, clean look, shaded back porch. The drinks we enjoyed were poured well- not too sugary with a good tequila flavor. Our server was quick, friendly and knowledgeable about all the menu items although we didn't need much assistance since we ordered almost everything available. I can't remember anything being spectacular, but the food was definitely well made and well presented. This place seems like a nice, hip tapas place although it is not as experimental and edgy as some places around town.
