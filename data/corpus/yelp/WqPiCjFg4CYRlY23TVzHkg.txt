Good burgers and unique choice of beers.  It is crowded and you will have some guests that overextend their stay on the tables, but hey it's a more of a bar than a restaurant and it doesn't take away too much from the good and vibrant atmosphere and the quality food.  I tried to be mindful of the other patrons circling the tables like a shark circling their prey and left once I finished my drinks and food.  It's cool though how u work out the system of asking for dibs on a table when it appears that the guests are slowly finishing up their meals.  . . Their food is a little pricey but what do u expect for food from a bar.  Just fight through the crowd mingle with the locals and who knows maybe you'll meet up with some really cool or hot dates for the evening.
