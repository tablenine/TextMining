Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
The food here is OK, if you like ordinary food. There is really no reason to go here- Chicago is a huge foodie city, so why spend $$$ on food you could make at home? Shrimp Scampi? Caesar Salad? Psssch. Sometimes there is a 2+ hour wait, sometimes the service sucks. Sometimes not. Its really hit or miss. The only reason I go here is when visitors are like "OMG! Cheesecake Factory!!! We have to go!!!" Even though they have a Cheesecake Factory in their own home town.... . If you must have an over-sized piece of cheesecake, send someone in to get it from the front counter and then run in the opposite direction and go seek out food that makes dining out worth while.
