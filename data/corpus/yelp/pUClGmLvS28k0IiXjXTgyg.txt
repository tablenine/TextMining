Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Canter's is a staple open 24 hours.  This was one of the only places we could find open at 2:00 a.m. on a Sun. night.  . . The place is old school.  Straight out of the 70's decor and the waitresses are super friendly and working a tough shift during late night.  The place has an eclectic crowd at that time of night (couples, cops, groups of college kids, trendy Hollywood-ites) but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Had some good random conversations with others while waiting in the register line.. . Definitely keep this spot on your go-to places for late night eats in LA.  It's chill and although I only had a cup of coffee, the food looked really good.
