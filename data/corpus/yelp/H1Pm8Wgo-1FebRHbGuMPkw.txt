Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
This is by far the best Pastrami Sandwich I've ever had. A lot of people talk about how The Hat has the best pastrami. Well they have not heard of Johnnie's.Can't wait till the end of this month to go and get some...Oh tell Sandy and Linda Sal says "Hi".
