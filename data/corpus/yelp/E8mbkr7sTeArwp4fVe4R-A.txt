So if you are ever able to finish one serving of their pancakes (which is 3) you will officially be labeled a fat ass. The pancakes are huge! But damn good. Believe dat.. . I had the Tequila Sunrise which was chili relleno and some sausage and cheese with an egg thrown in there... sounds weird - but who cares, who says weird can't taste good... Ben had French Toast which i didnt get a chance to try but he ate it all so I can only assume that he liked it.. . This place got really busy AFTER we got there (which is nice) so expect a wait if you're coming here on the weekends... They also close early (around 4pm) everyday.. . What a delicious way to start the morning!
