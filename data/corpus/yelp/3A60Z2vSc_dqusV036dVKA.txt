The setting is very modern. A very casual restaurant. You order your food at the front and they'll bring it to you when ready. What's interesting is that they have 4 big tables (with probably 8 seats per table) throughout the entire restaurant, and they just put you to any available seats so you will be sharing a table with strangers. It will be a little hard if you have a big group going. I felt the food was okay, but not stellar. I felt the price was a bit too much for the food they give you - I've had better meals, so I put it as an OKAY on my list. Probably won't be going back to it since it's average, like any other restaurant.
