I went with a friend today for a nice lunch outside. The staff and owner were friendly and helpful. Â The service was also timely. I ordered the Athens crepe with grilled chicken and a side of fruit - tasty and made with quality ingredients. My friend ordered the Monte Cristo with home fries and was extremely pleased with his choice. There wasn't a speck of food on either of our plates! We also shared the cookies and cream crepe which turned into another clean plate. We were quite full and happy with the service, the food and I must say, the price (very affordable)!!! We will definitely come back! If I could give 4.5 stars, I would!
