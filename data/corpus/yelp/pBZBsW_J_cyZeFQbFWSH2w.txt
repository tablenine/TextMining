I LOVE WILLY'S!. . Being from California and knowing what REAL Mexican food taste like, Willy's is definitely at the top of the list.  Big fat burrito and with all the necessary fillings at NO EXTRA CHARGE, unlike Chipolte.  Chips included and your choice of salsa that you can help yourself to at the salsa bar.  Burrito Bowls WITH the tortilla. SPANISH RICE which is what your supposed to use in Mexican food, NOT WHITE RICE, like other places.  Their meats are seasoned to perfection and all the ingredients are fresh.  Worth every penny!
