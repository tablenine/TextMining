Restaurant: Spring Restaurant
Category: American (New)
Went here the other week with a Groupon and my sister in tow. We booked an early dinner right when the place opened, which translated into ridiculously easy street parking and a dead empty restaurant. I initially took this as a bad sign (if you're dead empty and offering groupons to drum up business, chances are you're doing something wrong), but the place was fully packed by the time we were done with dinner.. . We ordered some kind of egg ravioli to share, each got sweet potato soup, split the roast organic chicken, added a side of fingerling potatoes and then splurged on 2 desserts--a lemon pound cake with flavored whipped cream and a tray of mini desserts like mint ice cream sandwiches. On top of that, they brought out a free soup shot at the beginning, some pita chips and hummus, and closed with a shot of spiced hot cocoa.. . Overall, a great experience and truly amazing meal with so many different flavors, though not quite amazing enough to justify paying full price for it. If they ever Groupon again, I'll happily jump on that bandwagon, but until then, Spring was a nice memory.
