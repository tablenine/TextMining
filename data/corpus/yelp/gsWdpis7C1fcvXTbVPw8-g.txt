Heard a lot of hype about this place, so it didn't really live up to my expectations.. . I understand it's a whole French-Vietnamese fusion thing, but I didn't really like it; I felt that the authenticity of the Vietnamese was blurred (but maybe that's just me). Our service was exceptional though; very attentive staff. We got seating right on the upstairs balcony, which was a lot of fun.. . Decor is absolutely gorgeous. Here, I thought that they got the fusion correct! Very nice.... . Food was pricey and not really worth it. Portions were average, taste was rather bland and little off. Flavors didn't mesh and sometimes even clashed. Ehh.
