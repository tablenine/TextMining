Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
If money were no object and given the option I'd still eat at the pizzeria. 1 hit and a miss or 3. . . Red Endive, Fennel and Parmigiano with anchovy date dressing  $12:. A disappointment. Beautiful presentation, but somewhat difficult to eat and just not that special. enhh.. . Burricotta with radicchio, spiced walnuts, honey &amp; fried rosemary  $15:. Now this, on the other hand, is as good as ANYTHING I have ever tasted. Genius. The crunch of the fried rosemary with the sweetness of the honey and the salt of the mozz! The entire restaurant could revolve around this dish. My buddy had the caprese, and it was above average but not as good as the pizzeria's version and nowhere near as good and unique as the aforementioned hit.. . Corzetti Stampati with eggplant, olives &amp; fresh ricotta  $18:. Average. You can get pasta with egglpant and tomato sauce just about anywhere. The ricotta, though... Just order ricotta, straight up. You won't be disappointed.. . Pan Roasted Halibut con pepe verde  $28:. Nothing special. What you'd expect for fish at a decent restaurant just about anywhere, though by this point I'm pretty well stuffed. In all truthfulness it just didn't stack up to this place's rep (or the appetizer).. . Pathetically, I skipped dessert. My cheap-ass dinner mates started bitching once they realized how much this was all going to cost. Not that I left hungry... Skip the valet and park somewhere in the adjoining neighborhood just to the south.. . All told the Osteria just didn't quite live up to the unfailingly remarkable pizzeria (I've been there 4 times now). If I went again I'd do the mozz bar, 2 of the burricotta w/ rosemary and honey, and at least one dessert. The service was nice and unpretentious, and the sommelier was very helpful, too.
