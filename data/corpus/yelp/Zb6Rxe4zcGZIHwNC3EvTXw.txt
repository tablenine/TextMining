This is (by far) my favorite bar in town. I'm a fan of getting to sit down, have a drink with friends and actually be able to have the conversation vs. going out with glow sticks and waving them in the air all night. . . Plus, the Belgian Beer takes me back to my trip to Brussels a couple years ago! Â . . Go there. You won't be disappointed.
