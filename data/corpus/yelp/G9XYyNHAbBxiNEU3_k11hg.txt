Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
A great weekend brunch stop on a fall day when you walking your dog around the west village.  If your animal is well behaved, the staff doesn't really care that he's sitting under the table.  Their food is simple and well made, their BLT is made with thick slices of canadian bacon, the bread is wholesome and grainy and the apple cider was amazing.   . . Expect to wait in line and search for a table in this small space.  your conversation should be held at low volume if you want to keep it private and its the kinda of atmophere that invites hour long stays over coffee, but also where you get frustrated beause someone is alwasy bumping into you.
