I'd been wanting to go here forever after all the reviews I read! . I expected it to be closed on New Year's Day but it wasn't so my boyfriend and I headed over there right when it opened. . . I love love love the way the place is decorated! The weather was also gorgeously sunny and made it even more pleasant, and most definitely like you're inside of a fruit bowl!. . We got the turkey sandwich with avocado and it was delicious. Nothing particularly special or mind-blowing but quite tasty, especially with the spicy mustard added to it.. . The fruit cup was AWESOME. The Cremolatta had the best cream with the tastiest fruits. Sigh. Judging by the reviews, you can't go wrong with the fruit cups so I'm definitely going back there and trying the others.. . It felt great starting the day off with such a healthy meal, beautiful weather, and a cozy, cheerful spot to relax in.. . Plus my boyfriend and I both thought the owner was adorable! If the place doesn't cheer you up, her smile and sunny disposition definitely will!
