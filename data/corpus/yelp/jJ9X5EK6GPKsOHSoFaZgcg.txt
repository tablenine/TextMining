we were on our way to RIBS USA (review to follow shortly) and porto's came up in the conversation.. . CW: (whips her head around from the front passenger seat) . --"have you guys been to PORTO'S?!". --"no...". --"OMG, we're going there....ok, we're going there first.". . so we found ourselves standing in line for porto's infamous pastries RIGHT BEFORE we were going to consume a lot of ribs i might add. oh, what we do for our stomachs. anyway, CW and her friend insisted that we try the cheese rolls. . . --"they are small! guaranteed after eating one, you're gonna want another" . --"hey, you should just get a dozen of them! it's only 7 bucks". --"really??....alright, if u say so". . she was right. those cheese rolls are devine. you will want another one after you inhale the first. i'm not sure what it is...you'll just have to trust the hundreds of raving reviews here. the pastry is perfectly flaky, the cheese is moist, airy and insanely evil. . . we also got a red velvet cupcake to test it out and a slice of carrot cake. the red velvet was OK. try doughboys or yummy cupcakes in santa monica if cupcakes is what you want. i didnt try the carrot cake but it looks pretty tasty.. . lots of people here even at 7pm on a thursday night. this place is quite a drive for me to get to, but for porto's it's so worth it. i already know what i'm going to try next: potato balls and a croissant sandwich of some sort. . . hey AWESOME CREATORS/OWNERS OF PORTO'S:. there's a lot of retail space opening up in santa monica! won't you consider branching out to the west side? :)
