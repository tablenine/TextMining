So many have already said it but I'll say it again: big slices of fish, very fresh and reasonably priced sushi and sashimi. I am not a big sushi fan (my wife IS very much, however) but I do like other Japanese cuisines such as udon soup, and they have the best I've ever tasted! Chicken or beef, it is all good! They are small and kind of hidden in a run down part of Centinela. Fortunately there is a lot of reconstruction in that area, but that could be kind of bad for us early adopters as the place is already starting to get more customers and longer seating times.
