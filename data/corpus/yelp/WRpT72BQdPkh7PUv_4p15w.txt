Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
A waffle, buttered, with fried chicken on top, then drenched in maple syrup.  Genius. I really couldn't believe how good this was the first time I had it.  But you know what I REALLY couldn't believe?  That there used to be a Roscoe's in Oakland, during my formative years... and I didn't know about it.  I don't know who to blame for that -- my parents, my friends, myself.... but I do know this: I have years of chicken-and-waffleless living to make up for. From now on,  I will make a  point to visit Roscoe's at least once every time I'm in L.A.
