Wow factor! My friend and I went here on Friday night and I would recommend to make reservations in the main dining area. It was a bit louder than usual due to an intoxicated party (not the norm). Such a terrific space - an old print shop!! The front is more of a bar/lounge and the main dining area is sleek and sexy!. . To start we each chose one of their signature drinks- the Sepia Mule &amp; Sazera Royal - ohh so strong! Then our first course was the lamb shoulder, carmelized onion &amp; olive flatbread - a perfect snack! Second, we had the grilled octopus in a tomato sauce(this was my favorite) then for our entrees - my friend had the short ribs (tender &amp; delicious) filling and so savory and I had their scallop appetizer made into an entree! We were so full from the food, I could not imagine having dessert. . . Our server Charanne was fabulous - I pretty much relied on her recommendations and loved that she was 100% on all of them. I would say that this place is a bit dressier than jeans truth be told (those wearing jeans did look out of place). It is my new favorite upscale restaurant.
