a bizarre oasis of frathouse heterosexuality in the heart of west hollywood.  if you're a young, single dude and you like drinking beer, watching sports, and trying to meet hot chicks (or at the very least, oggling hot waitresses) then this is the place for you.  quite a selection of beers and a menu that rivals canter's in size.  a great place to get together with a group of friends to watch a big game (provided one of you gets there early enough to secure a good table.) and there's foosball, pool, and videogames.  basically, everything you look for in a bar when you're between the ages of 21-28.  also, according to legend, jim morrison once pissed on the bar during a drunken bender, which makes the place very cool in my book.
