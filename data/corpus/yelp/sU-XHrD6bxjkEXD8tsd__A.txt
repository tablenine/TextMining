Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
It was tough deciding whether to give Johnnie's 3 or 4 stars, because I did enjoy it, but to say I'm a fan would imply that I'd come back.  I only stopped here because I'd heard raving reviews about it (namely, one by Tom Leykis).  What can I say?  It was good.  A little bit too salty, however.  Aside from being salty, it's $10.25!  Are they serious?  $10.25 from a friggin' hole-in-the-wall stand (and I use that term affectionately, mind you)?  I don't care how long they've been there, a $10.25 pastrami sandwich better be ridiculously huge (it's big, but I wasn't even hungry and I finished it.), or it better come with some sides and drink.  The fact is, I'd take The Hat over Johnnies, not only for the price, but for the taste (the Hat's isn't overly salty).  Oki's Dog on Pico also has a bomb-ass pastrami sandwich that is super affordable, bigger than johnnie's, leaner, and less salty, and I would certainly call it better, even though it's in a slightly different class.  (Johnnie's being of the more traditional class, like that of the Hat.  Oki's has a completely different taste because of the cabbage, onions and bell peppers that they put on it, and thusly puts it more in the "specialty" class.). . Anyway, it wasn't the pastrami at the end of the tunnel of light, like it was supposed to be.  It's good, but not the best.  I'd say the price definitely kills it.  If it's worth the money, they'd I'd be forced to pay the high price for the love of the sandwich, but they ain't forcin' $10.25 on me, again.
