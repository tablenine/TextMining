Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
Tender Greens holds a special place in my heart because it's where the boyfriend and I had our first date.  HAHA.  . . I love the delicious, extremely fresh salads, and especially love their chicken soup, which has great chunks of potato, carrot, and tender chicken.  The broth is very flavorful.  Had the simple arugula with tomato salad last night to accompany my soup.  Though it's a "side" salad, it was huge.  Couldn't quite finish it.  I also had a glass of rose which was good.  Extra points to the server behind the counter who poured me a glass, corked the bottle, paused for a moment, and then uncorked the bottle and poured me more wine (all without my asking!).. . Free parking in either of the structures nearby for 2 hours.  Sitting outside is the best right now, especially if you can get one of the pseudo "booths" with a little cushiony sofa seat.. . Very affordable -- most entrees are $10 or less.  They also carry Wine Country nonalcoholic sodas, which are delicious.
