Mind you this was my first experience with Indian food and it couldn't have been a more pleasant experience.. First off the decor, ambiance and music (live D.J.) was phenomenal.. Dark lighting, hip electronic music, the perfect recipe for a great date. The Lotus should be on your top Â romantic and/or ideal ideas for a date.. On to the food:. My boyfriend and I shared the Chicken Tikka plate for two. Which was really for 4! We were then given the choice of two sides (yeah! more food). This all came with an appetizer (Samosa) and a dessert..  The server was nice and politely explained to me what was what on the menu. The food experience itself was orgasmic to say the least.. . I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The parking isn't even a worry since valet is only $5 and right behind the 7-11.. . Try coming early to avoid waiting, but if you do have to wait there is a full service bar to help you occupy your time.
