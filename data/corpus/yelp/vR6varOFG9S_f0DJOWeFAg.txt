We went here instead of La Fonda because we usually see the patio full of people. Maybe they are all just drinking? Or maybe it was easy to find parking (the lot is a good size). . . Any patio is great in Atlanta, but the tables here are plastic and rickety and can get swept up by the wind or knocked around by clumsy people if you're not careful. Service was a bit slow, our table of two got through our chips and salsa and our waters way before the entrees came out. The salsa was icky and sludgy, not fresh at all and no stand out flavors. . . I ordered a chicken chalupa and taco combo w/rice and beans, "but just rice, if I can". My order arrived with no beans on the side, but also no beans on the chalupa. The produce was fresh, but the chicken tasted boiled with no flavorings. I guess a taco/chalupa plate w/out beans is a healthier way to do Mexican, but I wish my order had been interpreted as I meant it. . . I noticed that a lot of orders all came out at once, and some people had been sitting there much longer than we had, so there's no telling how long food sat around under heat lamps before it was served.. . Don't be fooled by the crowded patio, unless you just need some drinks.
