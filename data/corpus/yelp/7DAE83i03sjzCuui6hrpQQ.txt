Vegetarians beware.. . We were told on the phone that they had vegetarian items.. We were told when ordering that certain items were indeed vegetarian.. When I heated up leftovers and smelled a fishy smell, I called up the restaurant and was told that there are no 'truly vegetarian' items on the menu.  . . If you are not vegetarian, the food is not bad.  But the strip-mall location is.
