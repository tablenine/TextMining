Good times are to be had by all! I went with a 6 people, one of which was a friend of the owner so, of course they took care of us. I will most likely go back whenever I can, because the servings were huge and the food was great. It was a very exotic experience ie. sitting on the floor, hookahs, belly dancers... Beware- People at the Indian restaurant next door get really angry if you park in their spaces.
