My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE this place. Whenever I eat here, I find myself humming an "mmmmm" throughout my entire meal, seriously! The food has such rich flavor -- nothing mediocre or subtle about it! It's gourmet Italian to savor and treat your taste buds.. . The setting is pretty calm and cozy, nothing like the busy streets (hello five corners intersection!), with dimmed lights and sturdy, heavy wood fixtures.. . Our service is usually nice -- nothing too significant here.. . Parking is the only hassle when we come to eat here. But it's quite worth Â it.
