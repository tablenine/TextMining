Restaurant: Roasters
Category: Southern
For the record, I used to be a food snob. That was...until I found places like Anne's Snack Shop in Atlanta, Ugly Girls Restaurant in the backwoods of Oklahoma, Uglesich's in pre-Katrina New Orleans. These places specialize in honest, straightforward, cook-it-like-you-mean-it food. . . Roasters is decidedly not for food snobs. If your idea of the perfect meal is food that's been handled within an inch of its life, processed to death and then reformed into something resembling its original shape just as a reminder of its origins, then don't go here.. . Roasters offers an honest meal. The chicken is moist, flavorful...well, honest. The sides aren't always the freshest, but then this chicken version of a meat-and-two doesn't pretend to be farm-to-table either - so, again, it's an honest place.. . OK, I admit to liking the quirky service. The kitchen's too loud, and if you speak or understand Spanish, you might hear something you'd rather not. (I pointed this out to the GM recently, and I could tell by the nice-but-glazed look in his eyes that it wasn't the first time he'd heard that.) I also like the eclectic crowd that hangs there. "Eclectic" - GET IT?!? That's a code word meaning: "Check your judgmental attitudes at the door" for those (fortunately few) adventurers who happen to think a trip ITP is a freak show.. . And, oh, just as a quick aside...it doesn't hurt a bit that the bottle of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay is the best value in the city. Winos, take note!
