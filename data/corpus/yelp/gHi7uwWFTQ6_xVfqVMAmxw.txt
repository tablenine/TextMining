It's the most adorable place! The outdoor patio makes it seem like you're sitting in your own private garden. Came with JT for V-day and again with JC ... both times the food was good. The desserts are light and good (berry cake and red velvet cupcakes). However, the soups both times I've gone were incredibly underseasoned; you have to add quite a bit of salt and pepper yourself.. . It's kind of a mess when you go in, if you've never been before. Basically you go inside, stand in line and place your order and then go outside and hunt for a table (although there's indoor seating as well). Come to think of it, that's not too bad ... Corner Bakery does that. However, this place gets packed on weekends with people, families, and pets so it's probably best to snag a table asap right when you get to the place. Other than that ... happy eating!
