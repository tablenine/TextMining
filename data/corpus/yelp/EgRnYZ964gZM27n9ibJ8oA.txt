Great Breakfast but too expensive for what you get!!  If you want eggs, beacon, grits &amp;pancakes it will cost you $13 when at J Christopher's the same thing will cost $8!. .  Forget lunch!!  You could make a better sandwich at home!!  If you go for lunch just eat Breakfast!!  Pancakes are great!
