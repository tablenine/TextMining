Severely overated hash house. Kind of a "Swingers" for this decade, it's got mediocre food, served by wannaba-Silverlake-hipsters. The main claim to fame at this place is "cool"-looking people hanging out. The food is fair, the wait is ridiculous, but the amounts would make any Kansas coffee shop blush. Overconsumption is a keyword here. Bring your shades and iPod and you're halfway there. Cannot believe that people rave over it. It's so last year.
