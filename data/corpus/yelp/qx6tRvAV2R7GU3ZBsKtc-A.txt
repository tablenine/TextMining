Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
My wife took me here for my birthday. What a fantastic experience. Everything from the helpful waitstaff, to the wine selection, to the layout and design of the restaurant to the appetizers and of course, the pizza, was superb. . . I really enjoyed myself here, getting a light buzz off the red wine our waiter helped us select and enjoying mouthfulls of fennel sausage pizza. I loved the pizza so much, I ordered another one to take home as an extra birthday present. . . Also the appetizers were grand. We selected two from the menu and both were delightful. . . Try and sit at the bar. It's neat to watch the chefs make the pizza. They do it all right in front of you, and you can almost smell the fresh ingredients.
