Great sushi with super-friendly service and very reasonable prices. Of course reasonable is a relative term - sushi ain't cheap, and if it is, let the buyer beware... . . All the whiners bitching about the lines and waits? WTF - it's good and it's cheap, you just said so your-selfimportant-selves. OK, not the widest selection of things that mostly Japanese people would likely order, but I did have an amazing (and generous) plate of engawa sashimi, perfect mirugai and sublime anago. If you're in the market for Alaska rolls and the like, you're probably hosed. You're also probably not going to be missed when you don't return...
