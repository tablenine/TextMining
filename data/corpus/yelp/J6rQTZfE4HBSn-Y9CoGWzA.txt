Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
Prelude to a night at the castle: I got an invitation from a member I met earlier this year. As an invitee, you get a pass for you and 7 of your friends. I found pre-planning the Magic Castle soiree was a bit stressful. You've got to make reservations with a credit card, and make sure your whole party shows up or you'll get charged the entrance fee for each no show. If your friends are like mine, that means you'll basically be herding cats. I mean, this is a city where an acceptable excuse for not showing up somewhere is "dude, it rained--yesterday. I can't go." There's also a dress code. Entrance fee is $20, on par with many clubs. My invitation mandated that we eat dinner there, and their restaurant is not cheap (or very good). So I agree with the other Yelpers who indicated in their reviews that the magic performed on your purse or wallet is the most bedazzling and spectacular trick you'll see performed. . That said, after my group got in, it was super fun. My goal was to hear Irma (the piano-playing ghost) play Smells Like Teen Spirit. She rocked it. We saw a show in a parlor and an after-dinner show that was packed. Hung out with a lawyer-turned-magician for a bit. Â My only regret is that we didn't see more shows or explore the castle as much as we should have (alcohol has consequences, kids). But I have another invitation and can't wait to do it all over again.
