Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Three item menu.  Super cheap.  BYOB.  Oh, and the best food I've eaten in L.A. ever.  Gosh, I thought I'd had good fish tacos before.  But these are so drastically better it's a joke.  I recommend either fish or shrimp taco with cabbage, spicy guacamole, and sour cream.  The owner, Joseph, is so cool and warm and anxious to tell you why his horchata is the best horchata in the world (it's a dollar).  Gosh, I cannot more strongly recommend this.
