What can I say that hasn't been said, oh 1200+ times already? . . Been here multiple times, so solid food and solid lines each time.  No need to rave any further.. . If you're planning on coming here on a holiday such as MLK or Labor Day, call to see if they are open.  I recommended that my friends come to the DTLA location on MLK, and they were closed the whole day!  We called the OC and Rowland branches and they were open, so I think it varies from location to location.  Hope this helps!
