I find it hard to unwind in LA after work,. unless I'm at a yoga class.. . I should be going to more happy hours.. At this place. Â The music, the service the playful staff at Mozza lent to one of the most singularly relaxing noshes I've ever had in L.A.. . Plus, that was the best piece of bread. I've ever eaten -Toothy, as fragrant. and delicious without anything on it. Check out their 35.00 weekday special.
