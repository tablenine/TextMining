Decent place. I never ate at the old location, but was able to eat with some friends last night at the new one. We had a myriad of dishes including:. . Lobster Bisque. Mussels. Oysters Rockefeller. Shrimp Po-Boy. Fried Pickles. Fries. Crab Dip. . All was pretty tasty. I personally like the vibe of Spondivits a little better, but this sure is convenient. Now if our server was just a little more together.. . I'll have to go back to see how the food is again, but it certainly was good enough for me to want to go back (so that's a plus)!
