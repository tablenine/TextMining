First time last night at Sawtelle.  They were parked right at Yogurtland.  We got there probably 15min before serve was scheduled to start and there were already about 20 ppl in line.  We got in line and were excited.  However, the drivers wanted to move the truck across the street so everyone migrated to the other side.  Unfortunately, the bus wouldn't start because the battery was dead and it took about 20 mins before they just gave us.  Everyone was then herded across the street to the original location.. . Now, the food.  When I heard Short Rib Taco, I was expecting short rib beef.  I think that was the only disappointing thing.  The quality of the meat was more like what you would get from beef bricket.  But the flavors were great and it was just spicy enough, not so spicy that the rest of the flavors gets lost.  The slaw was the best.  It was crunchy and great contrast to the beef.  There was also brownies and I tried the coconut almond.  It was okay.  Not anything amazing or mind-blowing.. . They definitely do a great job of marketing because the website pictures make you salivate.  Not sure if I would go out of my way to go next time but I may want to go again soon and try the burrito or the kimchi quesedilla.
