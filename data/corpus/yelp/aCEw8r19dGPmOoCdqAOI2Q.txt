so we were in LA for the weekend and someone suggested we hit up MILK  to grab some BLUE VELVET cake. I'm a big fan of the famous RED velvet cupcakes so naturally, I just had to go with and get some..      milk is a pretty cool looking shop located on the corner of a bunch of businesses.  if you're lucky, you can find parking along the street. as you walk in, you get that old school ice cream parlor feel... quaint and clean..      the main point of being here was of course, blue velvet cake..... which was awesome.  I've had a bunch of desserts in my time, but this shit was ALL GOOD.  Sweet, moist, blue as a mofo.... to simply describe this cake.  definitely recommend it to anyone!.      there were a bunch of us here and we also tried other desserts as well.  they got a a little patio area out front so we hung out for a while. i would say that this place is a great place to smash on some yummy desserts and just hang out and pass the time awauy....
