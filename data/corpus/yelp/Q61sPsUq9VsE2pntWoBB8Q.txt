went here for lunch with jess and my brother and it was pretty damn good. Good service, nice place, good food. . . The menu has a whole lotta things that sound good, so i took a while to figure it out. We had the tamales for an appetizer. The pork in the tamales was really flavorful, a lot of citrus flavor, which I liked. Probably the best tamales I've ever had, but there could have been more meat in them. I had the citrus marinated porkchops which were very flavorful, they were served with plantains and those were great too. We didn't wait for a table and the server was attentive. cuban food can be pretty damn good.
