Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I've lived in the Miracle Mile for about 2 years now, and I've finally managed to make my way over to Umami Burger.  I have heard so many good things about it, I just had to try it.  The whole table decided to go with the flagship burger, Umami x6.  After the first bite, all I can say is... wow.  It was a crazy mix of flavors all put together.  Now I really understand their concept of "umami"!  I can't believe it took me this long to get here, and in a sense, it was a good thing.  I don't know if my waistline could handle it :). . The pickle plate was awesome.  I thought they literally meant "pickles" not pickled items.  So it was surprise that we not only got the traditional pickles, but also pickled beets, okra, and mushrooms.  The sauce on the mushroom was really good, and literally our table was fighting to get the last pieces!  French fries were good too, and the dipping sauces they gave us were phenomenal.  I'm not a big fan of mayo type sauces, but my friends seemed to believe they were really good.. . If you want dessert, go for their ho-ho's and red velvet ding dongs.  Good stuff.  Their ice cream sandwiches look good too, but as I'm lactose intolerant and didn't bring my lactaid pills (dammit) I didn't get to try it.  Once again, my friends tell me it did not disappoint!. . Oh, Mexican coke anyone??!  None of that HF Corn Syrup for me!
