Restaurant: Holeman &amp; Finch Public House
Category: American (New)
I'm a big fan of Holeman &amp; Finch.  . . Greg, Andy, and Regan are great bar keeps.  Cocktails are other-worldly (perhaps a bit medicinal for some), they have a great wine list, and the food is great.. . BIG PLUS***  There is a MARTA bus stop right in front of the restaurant.  If you live anywhere near P'Tree, you can jump on the 110 or 23 bus and get dropped right at the front door.  This is huge for a drinking establishment.. . The only space for improvement is that I wish there were some lighter options on the menu.  . . This place is great.
