hype hype hype!  i went to this burger joint over the summer after all the hype about it being an amazing burger.  im not sure if it was the hype but i was disappointed.  the burgers are small for $10+, you can probably get a heartier one at the counter.  it isnt super flavorful like fathers office, i got their namesake burger (the umami burger) and it tasted like two super greased up in n out buns, a bland unseasoned patty and a ton of ketchup inside.  shouldnt the name sake burger be the most delicious?. . i think their truffle burger is what saved them in that it was very very flavorful.  so stick with that and youll be fine.  . . skip the onion rings as well.  really oily tasting.. . theres a separate dark small room in the back where they sat us with really weird acoustics so you could hear everything everyone was saying in that room even if you were whispering.  cramp. tight. dark. no like.. . otherwise, this place is okay but dont hype it up in your mind like i did.. . -E
