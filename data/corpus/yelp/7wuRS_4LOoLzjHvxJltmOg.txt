I have officially dinned in once, in the the patio area.  The Sangria was pretty good.  It is a great location if you can find parking.  Otherwise, they do deliver; which is pretty awesome when you get the urge for some great food in the comfort of your own home by lifting only the fingers of your hand to dial their phone number.  They have a few vegetarian friendly dishes and make sure to always order the 'house bread' (which should be no charge)!  Oh, and their banana pizza is an awesome treat...if you can stomach the calories or have friends to share it with ;)
