Nice little restaurant on Melrose.  Came here specifically for the Blu Toast but, unfortunately, they don't have it anymore.  Disappointed, I got their french toast, which the waiter told me was like the Blu Toast but with yogurt instead of cream cheese.  The french toast was pretty darn good; not too sweet, flavorful, and fluffy.  I gotta say, though, that I think I would've preferred it with cream cheese.  Cream cheese, in my opinion, would've given it an extra flavor and texture to make it truly unique.. . I also had a chance to sample their bacon.  It was quite flavorful, albeit a bit soggy.  If you're someone who likes crispy bacon, you probably won't be satisfied.. . I was surprised to see that it was only half full around 1 p.m. on a Sunday.  If you don't want to have to deal with lines, come here.
