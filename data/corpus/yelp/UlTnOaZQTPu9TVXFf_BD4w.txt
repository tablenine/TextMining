I don't know what the attraction is to this place, somehow Kogi was able to market their less than average quality lunch trucks in some magical way, because the food isn't that great. Stood in line for nearly 4 hours (yeah, what a complete joke). I figured this stuff MUST be good if the line is 4 hours long. Finally ordered two tacos and two short rib burritos. The meat quality is very poor, tons of fat and grizzle. Nothing special about the food, I've had MUCH better food off real Mexican lunch trucks.. . If you're alergic to MSG, do not go here. I was thirsty for days. Oh, and to top it off, they limit you at $12-$15, talk about cocky! Not to mention the cooks decided to take a 20 minute break and shut down production, even though the line was 4 hours long. Will never go here again. Those of you who think this stuff is all that and more, wake up! Don't be fool by marketing, it's called getting lucky.. . One last thing, THEY CHARGE TAX!!! A cash taco truck and they're charging tax. I'll let you read between the lines.
