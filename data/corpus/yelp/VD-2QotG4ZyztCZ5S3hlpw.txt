I have been to several Yardhouse locations.  This was my first trip to the downtown location.  It is in a great spot right in the heart of the Nokia Center and JW Marriott complex.. . As always the food was good.  I had the angel hair past minus the tomatos and eggplant.  I also had the onion ring tower for an appetizer.  Both were pretty tasty.. . Yardhouse is a cool spot to hang out, especially for games.
