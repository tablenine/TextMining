Went there for a sunday brunch with the hubby. Service was friendly and as expected, a little slow to order and slow to get the check. . . Ordered:. 1. Lobster benedict with arugula and truffle hollandaise - $14. - Lobster was decently portioned, a little dryer than I was expecting so not as fresh. Generous helping of arugula and the poached eggs are perfectly cooked. The side red potatoes were a little on the harder dried side, but it was the perfect side to mop up the egg yolks and hollandaise. I could taste the generous truffle flavor that really worked well with the eggs and lobster, so kudos. . 2. Mexicali Hash - $11. - the hash was tiny cubed potatoes, peppers, and some very tastefully seasoned meat chunks. The meat was a little on the stingy side, could have given a little more for the price. It was also served with two eggs sunny side up, cooked very well. . . The food was decent and good, but nothing too mind blowing. The price was on the medium side, not a good cheap eat but does not break the bank. The service was friendly but a ltitle aloof. Therefore, it was an "a-ok" meal. . . We might go back to try dinner next time but so far, the brunch was o.k.
