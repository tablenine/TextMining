Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
The "big fat greek dinner" on Thursdays is well worth it.  Make a reservation and enjoy wine tasting, appetizers, and HUGE family style Greek dinner (you'll have leftovers for days) that is delicious.  The lamb is excellent.  There's also entertainment (we've seen belly dancers and flamenco dancers), baklava for dessert, and thick, strong Greek coffee to end a perfect meal.. . Note: You don't go to Papa Cristo's for the decor.  Imagine a garage with faded Greek travel posters.  But the food, the crew, and the wine (available by the bottle from the market) will make you forget all that quickly.
