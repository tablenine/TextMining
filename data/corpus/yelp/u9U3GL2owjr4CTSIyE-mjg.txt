Coming from a strictly sandwich perspective, this is THE Italian sub spot. . . The catch is that you have to arrive by 1:00pm, and expect a line.  Also, there isn't room to eat there.  None of this deters me from giving them a 5-star rating though, Bari's is old school. You can feel the old Italian roots all over this place; in the signage, no-frills decor, just by looking at the lady who rings you up (she means business).. . Check this place out for sure.  It's the perfect place to grab subs to go for a picnic, when feeding a large group of dudes, or just a hungover Saturday.
