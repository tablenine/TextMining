This is the place to treat yourself and savor every bite.  Give yourself an incredible dining experience.  Yes, it is expensive but you leave it remembering every bite you had and wishing it was your B-day again or your anniversary or  whatever special occasion you go out to a nice restaurant!  .          I had the gnocchi with lamb ragu sauce, apple blue cheese salad and calamari with Asian salad.  All delicious!!  And the breads!  You must try all 4: olive, sourdough, walnut and flat bread.  . . Like one reviewer mentioned, if money is not an issue this is the place to go!
