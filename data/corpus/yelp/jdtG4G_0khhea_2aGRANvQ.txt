First of all, I'm of the opinion that "gourmet" and "mexican food" are pretty much an oxymoron. Mexican food is eaten from a stand, a seedy establishment of some kind, late at night, cooked by someone's Mexican grandma, you get the idea. It's like saying "gourmet" Hawaiian food, or "gourmet" Indian street food-- no dude, give me the authentic, non-bourgeois version (preferably cooked by someone's grandma). Pleaseandthankyou. . . But, this place is actually kind of yummy. I've tried several tacos in the past, and came in just for appetizers last night. The three salsa + duck nachos were enough to fill me and my girlfriend up to the point where we had to take our tacos home (hah!).. . And it was delicious, with a nod to grandma but a little more inspired. Home made chips, pickled jalapenos and vegetables, possibly the best tomatillo salsa I've ever had, and lots and lots of duck with gooey cheese and creme fresca. I guess its OK for grandma to take a night off every now and then.
