Restaurant: El Azteca
Category: Mexican
This restaurant scares me.  If you do some research on the place you will find some horrifying history  that has kept me away for many years.. . So, since those days are supposedly over, I recently went back and I will say the vegan fajitas are very good, and the margarita glasses are so big I could fit my head in them.  But I was still weary throughout the meal.. . They have a great patio and a good location right on Ponce- you can watch all sorts of crackheads wander by while you are sipping on your margarita and eating their mediocre chips and (seemingly canned) salsa.  . . In my opinion, La Fonda (located a block from El Azteca) is a much better choice if you want good chips, fresh salsa, and good, somewhat healthier,  Cuban food.
