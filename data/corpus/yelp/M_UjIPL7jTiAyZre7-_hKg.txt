Man oh man, I fell in love with this place even before I sat down! . . As I wandered in here for a late lunch date, the bustling marketplace vibe, sky high marble ceiling and yummy italian food smell satisfied my sense on all accounts.. . Because I was the first one in, I had time to check out all the different things going on in this restaurant. In one corner, vendors were busy selling macaroons to those with a sweet tooth. On another side, the chefs were preparing caprese salads carefully and meticulously. And on other sides, vibrant european diners are chit chatting away, eyes shielded with large, dark sunglasses.  . . After we got seated, my friend recommended a bunch of small plates to share.   We decided on a pizza, a squash dish, the fries, and a cold noodle plate. Along with the bread, all the food was enough to satiate four hungry eaters. And was the food yummos! Prepared with different flavors from your usual Italian eatery, this is definitely a fun place to come over and over again.
