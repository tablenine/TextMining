Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
Totally a dive complete with office building lighting and an entire wall of celebrity photos from Antonio's days as a sports writer.. . I won't lie I thought the cemitas were dry, heavy on the Oaxacan cheese, in dire need of their salsas, and sweet baby Jesus, I wish they REALLY toasted their cemitas.  They're still good, though.  . . However, I will whole-heartedly recommend eating several of their taco arabes with a"throwback" Coca-Cola (made with real sugar).  That definitely equals good times.
