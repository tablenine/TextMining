Salty salty salty............... everything was salty. Did I say salty ? Second try and I will never darken the doors again. The service was nice and attentive, the food was downright terrible. Scallops were so salty that they burned your mouth, Swordfish was as bad..................It was actually funny to think that two of us ordered swordfish and they both came out in a little baking dish to share. We were at opposite ends of the table so this presented a problem; not to mention that one of the filets was alot smaller than the other. This charming little presentation was 54.00 ................ Im not sure who got screwed more, The wine bottle or the guests............... oh by the way did I mention salty ???????
