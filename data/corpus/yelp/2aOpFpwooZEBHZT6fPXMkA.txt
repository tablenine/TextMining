I have lived in Atlanta for almost two years, and have somehow avoided buying fried chicken. It could be due to my overall dislike for anything fried, but I decided to break that trend with a visit to South City Kitchen after I heard that this is fine southern cooking. . . The abstinence paid off, because that fried chicken is easily the best southern dish I've had in a long time. The chicken they say is "buttermilk fried" and is placed on top of mashed potatoes and green beans. Delectable. And nice and fried. . . For desert, I discovered banana pudding, something else I've forsaken in the south. It was okay, as deserts go. I've never had banana pudding before, so I have nothing to compare it to. . . From what I had and what other people said about their dishes, this is an upscale southern eatery, which I will definitely like to go for-- at the very least for their fried chicken!
