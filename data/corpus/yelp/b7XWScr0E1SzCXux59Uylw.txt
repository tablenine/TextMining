As a sushi buff of Chicago, I can loudly proclaim that Mirai offers some of the best Chicago has to offer.  I've been here about three times now and I've decided they are worthy of a great review. My most recent visit was last night, on the patio after the Do Division street fest.  It was my first time on their patio and its a really nice space to eat a sushi meal.. . Their dishes are inventive and unique.  For drinks, I highly recommend the cucumber martini (which is half off on Sundays -$5.50)  Their miso soup is incredible.  I don't know if its the cooked tofu, lots of scallions but the taste is pure delish!  I highly recommend the choturo with quail egg appetizer.  One of the staff of Mirai applauded us for getting this appetizer but told us how much he loved it and he knew that we would enjoy it too!  Its really good!. . We also decided to have some basic rolls, but basic at Mirai is some kind of awesomeness!  We had salmon avocado and yellowtail rolls.  I think what I like about Mirai's rolls so much is that they are so fresh and artfully prepared and thats so evident in their presentation to diners.. . The food is great here and I will most definitely be back! Yum, yum!
