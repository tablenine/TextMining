Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
To be really honest, the pizza here is very mediocre.  I mean it's cool how they serve it as a pot pie kinda thing and that they offer whole wheat crusts, but as far as Chicago options go, you can find a lot better.. . What I'd really like to talk about is the Mediterranean bread.  It is the shit.  The mac daddy.  The daddy mac.  Get some, you will love it.  And it is massive - like 2 feet in diameter - so be sure to share it.  Add a Greek salad for a well-rounded meal.  Also massive.  So share that too.
