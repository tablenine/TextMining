Delicious!  Good wine list (but not cheap).  The minty lime cooler is a refreshing nonalcoholic choice.  The olive tapenade before the meal is wonderful.  The sweet potatoes on the vegetarian plate were so good my friend begged for the recipe.  Try the gaucho steak.  Leave room for dessert!  . . The decor is hip and funky, too.
