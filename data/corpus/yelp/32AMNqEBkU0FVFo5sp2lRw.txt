Not even sure the point of rating this place as there are more than a thousand already.  Either way, I'll just reiterate what everyone else has been saying: delicious ramen.  The portions are more than generous, and the broth is so damn good.  However, since the place is always major crowded and the broths emit crazy heat, it is a bit stuffy in there (but what you can expect at a Japanese ramen restaurant?).  Also, it's in the Little Tokyo, so just sign your name down on their list and check out the local shops while you wait for your table.  Good times to be had!
