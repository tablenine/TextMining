I've driven by Radial a few thousand times and never eaten there until a few weekends ago for brunch.  I ordered the strawberry/banana cheesecake pancakes from their very creative list of specials.  My wife ordered the creme brulee french toast (I liked it more than she did b/c it was "eggy" according to her).  Throw in some good cheese grits and good organic coffee and you've got a complete experience.  Can't wait to get back and try a few more things off the menu...
