My fiance and I were perusing the jewelry district and obtaining our wedding bands, when one of the jewelers suggested this place.  I am glad he did, because it was just marvelous!. . Inside it was very hip and European-like (whatever that means), and I was instantly intrigued.  Being on a BLT kick, I was instantly drawn to their gourmet BLT (with avocado, of course!).  It had heirloom tomatoes and some kind of tasty sauce.  My fiance ordered the basil pesto pasta, and we split both that and the sandwich.  Both were divine!. . They also have a bakery and deli inside so you can order various meats and things or fancy pastries and whatnot.  I did neither, as I was full from lunch.. . I highly recommend this place, and will definitely be back if I ever come back to the area!
