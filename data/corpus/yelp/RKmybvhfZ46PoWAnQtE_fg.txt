So I've heard a lot about the Kogi truck, and decided to check out the website to see if they were coming anywhere near me.  Today during lunch they were only a 10 minute drive away so decided to try it out.  . . The smell when you walk up is awesome!  Maybe I was just hungry, but the smell was super inviting and made me ready to eat.  I've heard the line can get kind of long, but it wasn't to bad at this location.  We were in line to order for about 10 minutes and then waited another 10 minutes for food.  No longer than we would have waited at Chipotle or any other establishment.  . . I was with my friend and we decided to try a variety of things to see what was the best.  We tried the chicken burrito, the sliders, the spicy pork taco and the short rib taco.  . . Let's be real: the tacos are small.  They are only 2 dollars... but they were seriously gone in two bites.  Of the two tacos we tried, the short rib was REALLY good.  The flavor of the meat was pretty awesome.  . . The Sliders were also a highlight.   If/when I go again, I will definitely get the sliders.. . The chicken burrito left a little to be desired.  In fact, I didn't even finish it.  . . All in all.... I think I would probably go back again.  If the line was too long, I'm not sure it would be worth it... but if I had the time on my hands, I would probably partake in this interesting phenomenon once again...
