First of all, I don't go to sports bars for the food.  If you're like me, then all you'll care about are the table taps from which you can pour your own beer (YES), the attentive and friendly servers (YES), the numerous bars (YES), and the flat screen TVs that display even the most mundane sporting events (YES).  Definitely a place I will chill with friends for a few beers and some game watching.  Seems like a great place to hang out after a Falcons/Hawks/Thrashers game.  . . That being said, I would never return for the food.  How can you mess up tortilla chips and queso ($11)?  The chips disintegrated like sand after the first bite, while the queso was lukewarm gloop.   The guacamole and the pico de gallo weren't bad, but how difficult are these dishes?   The walnut brownie sundae tasted like something a 4 year old makes for his or her parents with very little adult supervision.  The server seemed unfazed by our disappointment and even asked whether the brownie was "too mushy"...obviously she'd heard that complaint before.  The "ice cream" is homemade and tastes more like ice milk.  Yuck.  I was surprised by the poor quality of the food considering that this is a Concentrics operation.. . All in all, I will return for another night out, but only for the alcohol, sports, and people watching.. . FYI - they validate parking for up to $10 if you order food and if you park across Marietta Street in the Hilton Garden Inn deck.
