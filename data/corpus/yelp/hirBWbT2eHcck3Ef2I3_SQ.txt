Category: Sushi Bars
The poster who called it the Disneyland of sushi restaurants could not be more accurate.  The view was amazing, and it is probably worth going once for that alone.  However, the food was mediocre at best.  It wasn't too expensive, but it was still overpriced for the quality of the food.  Go for drinks and appetizers, not dinner.
