Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
From the ambience to the food itself, there's nothing gourmet about The Apple Pan.  And that's exactly why I love it.. . Their burgers are messy and juicy.  If you want cheese, you get good old Tillamook cheddar.  As for the fries, they're thick and crisp.  Sodas are served in a paper cone.  Awesome.. . Word of advice to the newbies: The Apple Pan is a small burger joint with a U shaped counter and stools.  There are no reservations and there is no list that you write your name on.  You seat yourself and it's first come, first serve.  The waiting area is standing room only and you stand about 2 feet behind the customers who are eating.  Because of all this, make sure that you pay attention to who is in the restaurant (and the number of people in their party) when you get there.  You don't want to be starting any fights by cutting in front of someone else who has been waiting.. . 4 stars for The Apple Pan.
