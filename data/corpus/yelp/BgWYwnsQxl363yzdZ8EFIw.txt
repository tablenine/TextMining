Restaurant: Native Foods

I have eaten in this place more times than I can recall.. . You don't know joy until you try the pizza in Native Foods.  And the fries.  And the sandwiches.  And the Lime pie. And..... oh, I'll stop there.. . Also, check out the Costa Mesa location too.  Such a pretty restaurant.. . Bizarre side note:  I saw Andre 3000 ordering take out from here almost a year to the day when I saw him ordering take out in Californian Vegan in Hollywood.  Crazy, vegan, spooky coincidence!
