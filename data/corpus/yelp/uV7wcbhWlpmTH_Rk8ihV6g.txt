Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Huge bowls of ramen with lots of veggies such as: bell pepper, sprouts, bamboo shoots, and thick ramen noodles. It was a hefty bowl for a meal and I didn't get to finish it. It was pretty tasty broth in the miso flavor. I added corn like I do with all my ramen. Yummy! I saw these two college students get the Special #2 and watched them handle the burrrrrn of the firey red soup. We went at an odd hour on Saturday so there wasn't a wait, but I think normally there is a long list since the place is small. Try it for yourselves!
