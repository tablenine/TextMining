They cure their own pastrami and it is awesome.  They make awesome pulled pork sandwiches.  They use good rolls and then stuff them so full of stuff that they dissolve.  I will fight you, Laurn H., on your claims about the peanut butter &amp; jelly cupcake.  It's really just great topping.  The fries get better as you eat them, though, and work really well with the aioli.
