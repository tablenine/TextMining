Womp womp - You are CLEARLY paying for atmosphere, and paying through the nose.. . Burger is good.  Not $12 good, but good.. . Place has the face of a pub, but the soul of an exclusive nightclub.  I realize its a bar first and food joint second, but a family was turned away because they had a baby and the baby could not drink.. . Snobby, expensive and the patron conversations will remind you that your in LA.  In a totally bad way.. . Food quality is good though.
