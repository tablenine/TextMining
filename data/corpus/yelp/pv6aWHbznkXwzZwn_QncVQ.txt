Happened to be in the Wilshire area &amp; Mrs. C has never been to Langer's, so lunch was an easy decision.  I chose the frequently-photographed often-reviewed #19 sandwich, and eating it is a revelation.  The sandwich, on the whole, tastes excellent - creamy swiss cheese cuts the salty pastrami, and you have slightly crunchy cole slaw against soft rye bread.  Fairly simple elements, beautifully melded.  What I want to write about, tho, is that when a few pieces of pastrami fell off the sandwich and I ate them separately, I *literally* had to pause.  It is unlike any pastrami you've probably eaten.  Does it resemble the Hillshire Farms processed stuff you get at the grocery store?  Not by a long shot.  The pastrami of your favorite fast food or burger joint?  Swing and a miss.  No no no, my friend.  The pastrami at Langer's cut into thick (but small and edible) pieces, and what will blow you away is how tender it is.  Melody W. states it correctly.  It requires so little effort to chew, is full of flavor and is clearly made of quality stuff.  The menu is quite large, but if you order something other than the pastrami, you either a) really like ________ , or b) should probably have you head examined.. . Potato salad is good, but a little unremarkable for me.  French fries, however, are served crisp and hot.  Service was prompt and friendly, and they refilled my iced tea, which I always appreciate.. . I think Yelp should have a police squad of must-see/must-do's and if you have been living in LA for 5 years and never been to certain places, you are either gently suggested to go to, or brought under threat of bodily harm.  Langer's has to got be in the top 10, at least, of such a list.  It's a little out of the way for me, but I really should go more frequently than I do.  Good stuff!
