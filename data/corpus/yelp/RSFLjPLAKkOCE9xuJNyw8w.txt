great sweet potato fries, GREAT burgers, pretty casual feel to the restaurant.  the only thing i didn't really like was the lack of seating--we kind of had to hover and wait for people to leave their tables so we could sit down.  this isn't exactly a place you bring a large group to, so come in groups of about 4 people--it's easier to find seats that way.. . otherwise, definitely check this place out--it's a good place to eat and lounge with your friends.
