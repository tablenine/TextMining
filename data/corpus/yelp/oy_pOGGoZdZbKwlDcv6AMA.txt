I'M officially giving Wurstkuche 4.75 Stars even though I can't pronounce the Name of this fine establishment, sometimes execution of something so simple can be so fricking good. I've seen this same theme tried and fail miserably (coughs Valhalla Table). . . I Had the Duck &amp; Bacon Sausage with Jalapenos,spicy &amp; sweet peppers. I like my sausage a little well done and it was cooked perfect from the first bite to the last bite it was excellent. My wife had the chicken and apple with hints of cinnamon - very good tasting sausage. She let me have a bite of it and the cinnamon is there but not overwhelming. We split the klein fries with the chipotle aioli sauce, that sauce was good with them fries. . . Everything tasted very good, good flavors executed well will get me back every time. I found my new stop before the Dodger game! . . Cant wait to come back and get my rattlesnake and rabbit on.
