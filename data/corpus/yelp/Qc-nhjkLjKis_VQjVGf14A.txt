Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Roscoe's is definitely an icon among Los Angeles restaurants, but I have to say that I don't buy the hype. The chicken is good, but not excellent. The waffles are great, but you can't build an entire meal of waffles. Their sides are extremely expensive. A small cup of Mac and Cheese for 4 bucks??? Seriously? I think my dollar is better spent at a far better restaurant.
