After the incredible buzz about Joy Yee having the best bubble tea in Chicago, I had to give it a try. We had a good experience there and a crappy experience, so I think it evens out to about a 3 star review. . . The first time was great - the novelty of the HUGE menu was fun, and it took us awhile to figure out our food and bubble tea selections. There are large portions, and the bubble tea comes in this huge beer glass with a handle, in case you feel like chugging it. I recommend the green tea, and my husband liked the mango.. . Our second time was comically bad, it felt like we were on a sitcom. Our waiter took our order eventually, and we got our food quickly enough but the red bean bubble tea my husband ordered this time was grainy and gross. We asked for it to be remixed or put through the blender again to maybe make it smoother, but it didn't really help. The hilarious part was that we saw our waiter sitting with the other staff having food, and then he was the one to clean up... and then he sat there hulling green beans. We sat there for so long trying to get his attention and laughing and wondering if we were ever going to get our check. He seriously forgot about us and didn't even look our way or tell another waiter to take care of us! We wrote "WTF??" on the check. So the service was totally horrible, the red bean bubble tea was undrinkable, and I was really disappointed. . . I don't think I'll be driving all the way to Joy Yee again anytime soon. BEBOBA IS STILL THE BEST BUBBLE TEA AROUND!
