Why is great seafood so hard to come by in LA? We're spoiled for so much. Anyway, after months of putting this place off -- largely due to trying to make reservations OTP and being told to call at least a month in advance. really? -- I finally checked it out, early on a Friday, after work. . . Practically empty, but seated out side quickly. Service started off great. In fact, we were getting double duty on drinks, water etc etc. Then as the place got busier... our waitress was nowhere to be found. It was a leisurely night so I wasn't too bothered, but this would get on my nerves if it happened again. . . Food was pretty bog standard, to be honest. A delicious lump crab, hearts of palm, and blood orange salad; and peel 'n' east shrimp (they were huge) were satisfying but not out of this world. Nothing particularly unusual happening on the plate or the palette. . . I'm going with been there, done that, on the Hungry Cat. I need a trip back to the DC area if I'm going to really do seafood in a big way any time soon.
