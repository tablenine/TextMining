Category: Delis
I'm not too big a fan of delis, but knew I needed to try Langers because it's an L.A. landmark. . . I ended up loving Langers because of the quality of the food and great service. I ordered the famous number 19 pastrami sandwich. It is an excellent choice, but their menu is FULL of endless other choices. The rye bread is honestly the freshest rye bread I have ever had. Yum. I want some now. . . It is standard deli prices where you'll pay at least 10 for a sandwich, but you get a very large portion. . . Parking is across 7th street and they validate. The neighborhood is not great. They close at 4 and their website says they are closed on Sundays.
