Restaurant: Nava
Category: Tex-Mex
I was a little unsure about Nava since I always heard it was just okay.  I was pleasantly surprised with the service, food, and atmosphere.  After we gave our name to the hostess, my friend was addressed by her name the whole evening by the hostess, waiter, and manager.  It was a nice touch.  We sat outside since the weather was nice for a summer evening.  Even though we were alongside P'tree Rd. there wasn't any traffic noise.  . . FOOD:  We started with the complimentary bread, which was a little hard and too crusty.  For dinner, I had the Seared Scallops with smoked tomato grits on top of a saffron tostada.  It was delicious!  The scallops were seared nicely and the grits were smoky and plentiful.  The tostada gave it a surprise crunch since it was totally covered by the grits.  For dessert, we ordered the peanut butter mousse bar, which was a good portion to share, but can also be  enough for one.  The peanut butter mousse on top of a chocolate crisp wafer with a scoop of ice cream.  It was sweet and not too heavy...it was a perfect end to the meal.. . Overall, since this was a great experience I would definitely come back!
