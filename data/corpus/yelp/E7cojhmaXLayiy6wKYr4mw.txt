Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I really don't get this place. I saw the horrific commercials as well as the massive lines, so I figured it was worth checking out. . . There's really nothing special about the food - I tried tacos and the burrito, and it was considerably meh compared to the food you can get at some of the really authentic places. Maybe it was unbelievable back in the day, maybe it's a mass hallucination - but there are much better places to go to than Tito's.. . And Cinco de Mayo is right on the same street, with a much bigger menu and it's open 24 hours! There's no reason to ever pick Tito's.
