3.5 stars (3 stars for food, 0.5 star for super friendly staff and lovely ambiance). . A very hearty and heavy brunch... We had the shrimp &amp; lobster omelette and the smoked salmon scramble.  The food for the most part was just average, nothing outstanding and nothing bad. The omelette could've  used more filling and less egg, and the side of potatoes were bland (remedied with the help of Cholula). The scramble did not look very appetizing, but luckily was pretty tasty.  Portions are big, very friendly staff and service, and the outdoor seating area is quite charming.
