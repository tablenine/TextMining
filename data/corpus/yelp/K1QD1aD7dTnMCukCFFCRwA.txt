Loved everything about this place! Yes, pricey but what do you expect?? It's all part of the trendy style of Hollywood, especially cuz it's owned by celebrities. They did a great job decorating the place; traditional Japanese style meets contemporary hipness! Loved the bar area!! The food was all good too but forgive me if I'm swayed by ambiance which makes everything good or better than it really is! Total ambiance snob, that I am!
