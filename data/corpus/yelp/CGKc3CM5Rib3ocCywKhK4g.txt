Great wine selection, and a wonderful french onion soup. I had the seafood crepe. It was not the best., too much cream sauce. But my friend had the curry chicken crepe which was the bomb.  Also the dessert chocolate crepe is very good.Prices are reasonable.  The outdoor area in back is very nice, similar to Duke of Perth. Enjoy!
