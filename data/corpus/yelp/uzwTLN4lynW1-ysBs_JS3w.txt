I'll just say upfront that the burger is actually what brought this rating down.  Perhaps it was a fluke the night I went, (and I'm willing to go try it again) but my burger experience was awful...more on that later.. . The restaurant itself is pretty small but has a festive atmosphere.  It has been crowded both times I've been.  If you are claustrophobic, stay away!  I didn't mind that, but I feel that I must warn that I literally could have held hands with the patrons at the next table and sung "kumbaya".  They've done a pretty nice job with the interior design.. . Service was great.  Our server was very helpful and friendly as were the other staff.  The restaurant seems pretty well managed.. . The food and drink selection was great.   We had salads, appetizers, drinks, and the famous 10pm burger.  I have to say that just about everything we had was surprisingly delicious and well thought out...aside from the burger.  I can see how this COULD have been a good burger, but it was the saltiest thing I have eaten.  I know that this wasn't just my impression, because I heard at least two other tables around us commenting about the saltiness of the burger.  I'm hoping that it was a mistake since everyone else on Yelp raves about this burger.  It was as if someone had accidentally knocked over the entire salt canister into the meat. . . I realize I can't rate solely on the burger, so this review gets a 3, for pretty decent service and the rest of the food which was good.  I'd be willing to give the place another shot.
