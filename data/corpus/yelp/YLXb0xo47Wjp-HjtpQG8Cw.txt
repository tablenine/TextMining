I can't tell you how much I love this place. Every time I'm in the area I make sure to stop, even if there's a huge wait. It is super trendy and it's always busy, but the food seriously kicks ass. The Bearded Mr. Frenchy (Cornflake crusted french toast....I know, my mouth is watering thinking about it too) is to DIE for. The decor rules. The menu is diverse and huge, anyone can find something they'll like.. . Fred 62, I love you. Forever and always.
