Everything said about this place above is mostly accurate. . . if you are serious about finding good ramen:. . . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . . I was taken here by a bunch of guys who work half of the year in Japan, they said hands down this is one of the best Ramen places in California. I completely agree. Read my review for more. . . Still got love for the Daikokuya tho, don't get me wrong. The only reason this gets four stars is for the waiting and the parking situation.
