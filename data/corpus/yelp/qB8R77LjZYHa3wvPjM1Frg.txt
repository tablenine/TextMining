Great lunch specials!  BYOB. . Chicken Pad Thai is great with a hearty/robust flavor.  Consistent portion/flavor on all 3 visits.  . . Boyfriend was pleased with his spicy dish the first visit... but it did not taste the same on other visits.  I do not remember the name of his dish.. . Staff was very friendly the first 2 visits.  Our 3rd visit we sat inside and it may have been our servers first day working.  There was a definite language barrier and she appeared very nervous to the point of dropping food on the floor.  Hopefully she is doing better;-). . Overall I like Joy's and we will return.
