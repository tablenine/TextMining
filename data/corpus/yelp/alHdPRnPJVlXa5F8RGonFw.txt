Ive gone to alcove a fair amount of times. i have ordered the carrot cake , red velvet, blue velvet cakes, jerk chicken sandwich with mango chutney, cobb salad,  fish n chips, and other then iced tea ive had the mint mocha and white chocolate mocha. the food is good, very nice portions, the decor is nice, the patio is great, parking is ehh, if their lot is full (its small) it can be a pain getting street parking. the desserts are ok. i think they get their cakes from sweet lady jane, im not sure though but ive been given not so fresh slices of cake here. so im usually iffy when ordering a slice here, the mochas are pretty good. overall its not bad at all. not a place i crave but its good
