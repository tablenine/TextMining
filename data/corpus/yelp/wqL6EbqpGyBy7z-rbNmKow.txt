Lunch, lunch, lunch.  Why is it always so empty for lunch?  I had to get the pork chop this afternoon because I was craving it all week, but the Massaman is also to die.  Yes, there are turntables which explains the  crowded weekend nights, but that is no excuse for the lack of busy-ness at lunchtime.  Great lunch menu, you're all missing out.  Have I mentioned lunch?
