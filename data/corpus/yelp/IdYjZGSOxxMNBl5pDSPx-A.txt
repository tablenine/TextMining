We entered for an early lunch and although the restaurant at first seemed overstaffed, in fact the staffing was spot on for the level of service attained. The only bump in service was the plates making it in front of the wrong diners. One or two of the dishes were so well presented I thought I was in Japan. . . This place attracted a stellar crowd at lunch! More jackets worn than I expected going in. Â A very well dressed, connected crowd.
