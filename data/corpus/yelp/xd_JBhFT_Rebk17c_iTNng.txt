Restaurant: Big Star
Category: Mexican
I have now dined inside Big Star and found the experience to be great. The tacos are still fresh off the grill and come out really quick. I sat at the bar and the bartenders are quick to make your drink. Big Star gets mega bonus points with me because they make micheladas and make them really well. I am a huge sucker for the limey-spicy-beery deliciousness that is a good michelada. The music is really good country (not top 40 nonsense) and is played off a very nice vinyl setup. The drinks and tacos are very fairly priced for their quality, if not somewhat under-priced. It can be hard to get a seat here so get here early or be prepared to wait. Also no credit cards so bring CA$H unless you want to be hit up with ATM fees at their in house ATM.
