Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
Very cute place for weekend brunch, this place feels fancy without being too expensive. The waiters are very attentive, especially if you go with somebody who knows somebody, which shouldn't be too hard. This is LA after all. The decor is lovely, and the restaurant has plenty of light to make you look pretty like a celebrity all incognito.
