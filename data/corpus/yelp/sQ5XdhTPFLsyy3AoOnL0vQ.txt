I would give Craft 4.5 stars if I could: . . 5 stars for the ambience (low lights, pretty romantic), the pork belly (melt-in-your-mouth delicious) and the cheddar cheese grits (their specialty).   . . 4 stars for the bass (I wanted the snapper but our server wouldn't let two people at our table get the same dish).  I did get to sample the snapper, which was wonderful, but the bass was a little tough and not very flavorful.  Also 4 stars for the parking - I didn't want to valet and the parking structure was incredibly confusing.
