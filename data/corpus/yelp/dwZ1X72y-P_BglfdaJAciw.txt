Restaurant: Twist A Tapas Cafe
Category: Tapas Bars
So, I can't be sure, but this may be the smallest restaurant in Chicagoland. (After I visit every restaurant I will edit this review.)  I understand intimate settings, but when your host has to pull the table out to seat you, that's tiny. - half a star. Service next, we were seated, water glasses placed and that's it. My dining neighbors on either side of us have bread baskets. After 5 minutes I have to ask the server for bread. -half a star. I was sooo looking forward to the bacon wrapped dates. The first one my dining companion bites into has a pit. -half a star. Our service was sketchy at best. There were two men seated next to us during our meal and our server was all over them. I honestly thought she was going to sit on their lap.  And barely noticing us. . The tapas are good, but nowhere as good as Cafe Iberico, Quartino, even Cafe Ba Ba Reba. Not one WOWED me.- half a star.  The mango sangria, however was fantastic.
