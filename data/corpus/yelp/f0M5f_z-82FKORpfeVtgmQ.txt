Had dinner here on our visit to LA and we decided to sit at the bar. Bartender was actually decent. He warmed up once we started ordering a bunch of drinks and food. . . I got the rib eye with cherry tomatoes with blew cheese and a vinaigrette. Cooked perfectly medium rare with a nice char on the outside. On the bone and it was lovely. . . Girlfriend got the vege burger. I don't know what she was thinking and I won't even comment. Has nothing to do with the flavor but you don't go to Houston's and order the vege burger. lol Anyways.. . We got the spicy tuna roll salad which turned out to be a spicy tuna roll and this cucumber salad that was awesome. It was a little misleading because they had a sushi section which we thought was weird to begin with but they had this item listed under salads. We ordered thinking it would be some kind of unique salad. It was just a roll with a cucumber salad but it was delicious non the less.
