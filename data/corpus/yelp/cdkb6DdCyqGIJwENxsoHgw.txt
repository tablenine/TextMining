Katsu-Ya is like dating a girl who's a hot mess: she might look and taste great, but she's gonna be high maintenance.. . First, the food.  Ever pop something in your mouth and start laughing cause it's so good?  The spicy tuna salad on the menu was the perfect starter, and the specials were all phenomenal: the yellowtail with jalapeno, the lobster dynamite roll... this is definitely among the best sushi I've ever had.  When your server drags the specials board over, ask her to recommend some things.  Everything will probably be awesome.. . Unfortunately, I can't really rave about the rest of the stuff.  The place is really bright and really loud.  I can usually stand one without the other, but together was a little annoying.  The service is as frantic as the crowd - and this was on a Monday night.  I can only imagine what it's like on a weekend.  But this is pretty typical for sushi in L.A., I guess.  I'm beginning to think it's more trouble than it's worth; there's so much other great food out there that isn't as fussy an experience.. . Finally - and I've complained about this several times before in other reviews - but I can't help thinking how unclassy the $3.50 valet thing is.  It's not the amount so much as the idea behind it.  Is this just an L.A. thing?  One of these days, I'm gonna bring four dollars and fifty cents, and tell the guy to keep the change.  I just threw down for sushi, you really need to hustle me for fifty cents?  Oh, and I witnessed one of the valets scrape the car behind me all over the curb.. . The sushi here gets five stars; everything else gets two.  But I rounded down cause of homeboy's car.
