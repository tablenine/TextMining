Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
You want really, really good sushi at a decent price?  Well, Hide Sushi is just the place.  It's a no fluff restaurant where they basically serve you sushi, which probably explains why there's no dessert on the menu. . . But the sushi is sublime.  Try the monkfish or unagi!  The second you bite into the sushi, you can taste the freshness and subtle flavors.  It's just beautiful!  I've gone to various sushi restaurants, but I have to say that Hide Sushi is one of the best.  You can expect to get your money's worth.
