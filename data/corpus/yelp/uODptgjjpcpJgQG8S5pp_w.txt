LOVE Sola!  Every time I go here, whether it's for brunch, lunch, or dinner, I always enjoy my experience.  The wait staff is gracious and courteous and the food is always delicious.  For dinner, their seared tuna is one of my favorites and the brunch menu has so many wonderful things to choose from.. . Outdoor dining is a real treat there because you're not sitting right on Lincoln Ave. inhaling all of the fumes.  I even co-hosted a wedding shower there and was impressed with everything.. . Highly recommend!
