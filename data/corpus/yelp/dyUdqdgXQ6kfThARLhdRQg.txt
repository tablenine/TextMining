Ode to traffic and parking!  How I despise thee when driving in the middle of Los Angeles!  Fred 62 was located on the corner of Russell Ave. and Vermont Blvd.  Parking is pretty much non-existant unless you walk, walk, and walk!  Or if you pay with a golden nugget to park in a cramp lot.  No me gusta.. Inside the restaurant, the decor is cutsy and diner-ish, but it's also cramped.  But I guess that's no big deal.  But the restrooms, oh the restrooms made no sense.  What does the letter "H" mean on the door?  At least they were clean, but they just totally confused me.  . On to the food......my friends and I came here for lunch.  I got the THAI COBB salad which I will admit was pretty darn good.  Their peanut dressing was a bit tangy but still good to my taste buds.  Another friend got a SONOMA salad which he also proclaimed was pretty yummers.  So thumbs up to the salads!!!. Another friend ordered the Angel Fish sandwich.  What is an Angel fish?  And why is he eating it?  :(  He said it tasted good though.. Other orders at the table was a lack-luster cheese omelet, a horridly bland Tofu Chiliquille, and Chicken Noodle soup, oh and a kid's meal order of hot dog and fries.  I guess those dishes weren't the fault of the restaurant, just the orders itself were already pretty plain, so you can't expect burst-in-your-mouth goodness.. The service was attentive since we put the waitress thru some annoyance cause our party was sooooooo late!  But our bill was over $100 and we gave a decent tip.  Soooooo  WHOOP WHOOP!
