If it wasnt for $6 movies Monday - Thursday I would avoid this place like it was an all you can eat chinese buffet... Since it was Buckhead Backlot beer prices have skyrocketed, service has plummeted and my last beer smelled like a wet dog. We went to see some chick flick a couple of weeks ago and had to wait 20 minutes for our first beer (so when we got them, we had to go ahead and put in an order for a second round.... talk about feeling like an alcoholic!) and we didnt get our check until AFTER the movie ended! I dont know about you, but if I'm drinking beer and trying to watch a movie, I'm making a beeline for the bathroom as soon as those credits roll. Long story long, if they ever do away with the $6 promotion this place will turn into a ghost town.. . Oh and do yourself a favor, go upstairs to Â Atlanta Bread Company for food. The food here is not so great.
