Damn there's a crowd at 9am!. . OMG! i love this place. For some reason, i wasnt expecting a super big crowd at 9am... . . i decided to hit this place up after hearing great reviews from my socal locals, and i was not disappointed. . . i was a bit confused for a first timer, as there were about 4 seperate lines in seperate areas (so i didnt really know where i was supposed to order sandwiches, pastries, ect) so, i just closed my eyes, spun around in a circle, and picked the first line that was ahead of me (the pastry gods were in my favor, cuz i picked the right line) anyhoo, i got the guava cheese rolls, the potato balls (thanks john paul), the cubano sandwich (thanks karen) , and of course my fav iced white mocha.. everythign was divine! . . will definately come here again.. . . Yelpers: any other suggestions that i should try?!?!?!? please let me know!
