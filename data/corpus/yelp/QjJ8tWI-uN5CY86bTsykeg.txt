Good effort De Cero, poor follow through.  This rating is closer to a 2.5 star review rather than a solid 3.  It would totally have been a 2 star review if I would have paid for dinner since I think some items are overpriced.  . . Likes: tasty guac, good hot salsa with the chips.  Duck nachos are unique (if you don't like duck, don't order 'em, people) and I enjoyed them.  I had a corn tamale, and while it wasn't outstanding, the sweetness of the corn paired with the tang of the sour cream made for happiness in my mouth.    . . Dislikes: for a $4 taco, I expect more flavor.  I had 1 al pastor and 1 chicken mole.  Yes, the meat was good quality, and bountiful, but I was not impressed.  What can I say I'm still a sucker for Taco Burrito Palace.  . . Will I go back?  Probably.  I like the feel of the place even though it is a bit noisy, and there was a lot more on the menu that I'd like to try.
