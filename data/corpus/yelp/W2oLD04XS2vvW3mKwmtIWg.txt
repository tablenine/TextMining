Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I just went here yesterday for the first time with 2 other people, and I will agree that the lines/ordering is a bit disorganized, but I think the food made up for it. Between the 3 of us I got to try most of the things on the menu and I will say that the enchilada was average, the guacamole was so-so mainly because it was too runny, the beans and rice were pretty good, and the chips and salsa that automatically came with our order were very tasty. I definitely liked the beef tacos the most because they were larger than normal and also stayed together nicely. Next time I eat here I'll probably get a few tacos and maybe some beans and rice.
