This place has its moments....like its late..late night and you're on that side of town and just craving a guaranteed heart attck down the line.  I like their polish and chicago dogs.  Have to say the novelty factor of happening upon a random celebrity in line is always fun...or funny depending on who it is...I wouldn't recommend going regularly...but for the occassional late night splurge...GO FOR IT.
