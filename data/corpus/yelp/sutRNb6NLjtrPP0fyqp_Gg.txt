The Food = Pretty good (but quite salty). . The Ambiance &amp; Service = Not so great.. . We dined here on a Wed. evening. Thinking it wouldn't be too busy I didn't make a reservation. I should have - we had to wait an hour to be seated. Meanwhile, I had a glass of wine and my husband had a ginger-cucumber fizz which was really good... but $10.75? When we got seated the two of us were seated at a communal table with about 8 other diners. Not a big deal, but when our food came it didn't really fit on our "table", and with the restaurant being so crowded and noisy everyone could hear one another's conversations. . . Anyway, on to the food. We ordered the saag aloo, matter paneer, and garlic naan. Our dishes were very tasty, nicely spiced, and came with rice. Maybe it's just a matter of taste, but we felt that both entrees were just way too salty! The garlic naan was okay, maybe a bit more doughy than most places. . . After the entrees we were pretty full, so we passed on dessert and asked for the bill. Being that our Groupon was for $35 and our food bill was about $32 our server told us that she had to upcharge us a few dollars so that our bill would be $35 before tax &amp; tip. No problem, we knew it clearly stated that on the Groupon. I just thought that If Veerasway really wanted to provide great service, they could have said something like...well, since we have to charge you an extra $3 here's an order of naan to go. We could have enjoyed that with our leftovers! I just felt that they overcharged us with no compensation or even asking us if we'd like to order something extra. . . I enjoy trying new restaurants, so I had a good time. I'd say it's a good place to try if you'd like a different take on traditional Indian cuisine. But, the next time I want some good Indian food, I'll probably head across to Jaipur first.
