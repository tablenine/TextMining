Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
I have eaten at Bossa Nova once, and have gotten take out plenty of times. I moved into the Hollywood area recently, and it's become a staple for delivery. In fact, I had a sandwich from there last night.. . The food is good and the portions are excellent--I've never been hungry after a meal from Bossa Nova. The prices are fair, and the restaurant has a cozy feel. . . The bathroom at the Hollywood location was very dirty when I went, and there was no toilet paper. Granted, it was later in the evening on a weekend, but still, as I use almost every bathroom in the city, I appreciate clean bathrooms.. . Sizes are good for sharing as well as good for finishing if you are REALLY hungry, and delivery is always on time or early than the estimate. Overall, a yummy experience.
