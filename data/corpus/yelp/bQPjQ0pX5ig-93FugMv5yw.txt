Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
All you can eat Korean BBQ for $15.  The food is decent.  Atmosphere is lively.  The wait time for a table can be quite long.  The best tables are up a few steps on the left, and seat at most 4 people.. . Little known secret:  You can make a reservation for a group of 8 or more!!  Even on Friday and Saturday nights.
