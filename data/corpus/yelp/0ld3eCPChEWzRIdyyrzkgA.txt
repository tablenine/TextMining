Stumbled here with a few friends the other night.  I didn't really have any expectations except that there would be a lot of hipsters in skinny pants.  I was correct about that.  . . I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive beer menu, although some were quite pricey.  We didn't order food, but the menu looked interesting - heavy Asian flair which didn't seem to match with their heavy Belgian beer menu.. . I'm not sure if it's because I'm not artsy or what, but the ladies bathroom didn't have a functional mirror or any decent lighting at all.  Was it supposed to be like some weird art installation?  The "mirror" literally was clouded gray and black, and about 4 inches around.  I looked for additional lights to turn on but there were none.  I did find what appeared to be a green light inside the mirror frame, I got freaked out and thought it was a camera.  Maybe I just had too many 9% alcohol beers, but it was super creepy.
