Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
DeCero is a fun place.  . . First of all, the margaritas are amazing. You when've had as many margaritas as I have, you can really tell when a place uses real fresh ingredients and this place is definately on the top of my list.. . The a la carte tacos are interesting, I don't think I have ever  ordered that way before. But if you're like me (indecisive at ordering) it's a great way to share with your table mates or for you to try a variety of ingredients in your tacos. . . Great layout and not too noisy. Great place!
