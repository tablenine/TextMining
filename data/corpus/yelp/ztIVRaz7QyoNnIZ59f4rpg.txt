Restaurant: Hub 51
Category: American (New)
I had a pretty lovely time at Hub 51.  I'll definitely be back to check out the bar scene.  I imagine the food gets even tastier after a few drinks.. . The restaurant had a great atmosphere.  The lighting and the music were just right.  The wait for a table was over an hour (7pmish on a Saturday), so we opted to sit in the bar area to eat.  I'd usually hate this situation, but the 7 of us were able to sit at a big enough table where we didn't feel too cramped.  If you plan on making a reservation, I would make it well in advance.  My friend tried to make the reservation the day of and the person making the reservation laughed at him.  . . We ordered the guacamole and hummus appetizers.  The other end of the table devoured the hummus plate, so I didn't get to taste it, but the guacamole was yummy.  For my entree I ordered the sweet potato sushi.  The portion was sort of on the small side.  However, people who ordered any one of the burgers got huge portions.  . . I gobbled up the sushi and still felt a tad hungry.  This definitely benefited me, because I was able to feast upon the carrot cake.  Our cute and bubbly waitresses talked our table into ordered a few slices and thank f-ing god we did.  I wish I had ordered another piece to go, because that means I might still be eating it right now.  Their slices are enormous, so I didn't get all greedy and childish when I had to share my dessert.
