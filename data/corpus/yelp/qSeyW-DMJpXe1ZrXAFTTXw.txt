Restaurant: The Boundary
Category: Sports Bars
Reasons to hate the boundary: shitty food, beautiful but unattainable employees, outlandish markups on everything they sell, valet parking, uniformed doormen.  . Reasons to like the boundary: Innjoy and Mac's aren't really sports bars in the same way that the Boundary is, beautiful but unattainable employees, great beer selection, bright eyed, bushy-tailed and generally fresh faced fellow patrons.. . Two stars because paying $1000 for a flat screen TV,  $80 for a month of cable television, $40 for six bottles of Chimay, and $100 for a stereo system that plays rock music is probably less expensive and more enjoyable than four weekend trips to this place.
