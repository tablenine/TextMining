the gyoza were great..... . The ramens good....but not worth the crazy wait....it took over an hour to get a seat...so I went and had a few drinks at a bar a couple of doors down...... . The char sui pork is a bit too fatty.....I can't believe I'm even saying that because usually I love fatty meat..... . and the place looks a little on the dirty side....I came here with 2 Japanese friend...one who lives here...the other lives in Japan.....they agreed with my review......
