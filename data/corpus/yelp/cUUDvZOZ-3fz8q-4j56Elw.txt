Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
i tried to keep savoy a secret as much as i could. but it's too impossible. the only place i can feel comfortable eating alone. just me and my hainan chicken rice.. . call it selfish. but i call it favortitism. i fear bringing guests here because you only want to hear good things about your favorite. i've had one who gave a negativity speech and i couldn't breath for a minute. maybe i did exaggerate. but 20 seconds do feel like a minute in moments like these.. . don't ask me about the other dishes. the chicken rice dish will be the only reason i drop by. it may not taste as good as home's, but it's the closest i can get in los angeles, let alone america. i dont know about the ginger though. it''s like how the californians use avocado in their sushi.. . 5.75 a plate is a steal. you can have it your way: white meat, dark meat or extra dark meat. order an order of refillable ice tea for 1.75.. . and of course, savoy is a cheap date place, but definitely not an ideal romantic place.
