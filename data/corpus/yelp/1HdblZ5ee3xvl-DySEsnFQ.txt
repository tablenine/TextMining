I'm astonished that this place doesn't have a higher overall rating--the experience far exceeded my expectations.  My wife and I decided to try out the 50% off special that they do on Mondays, and we did not leave disappointed.  We loved the decor and the vibe inside the restaurant. . Our server, Derrice, was awesome.  He was friendly, helpful, and attentive without hovering.  The experience started when he brought out bread with olive oil and balsalmic vinegar to dip it in--delicious!.  Alcoholic beverages are about average price for Atlanta -- $10 martini for her, $6 beer for me.  I was disappointed to find that they only offer two bottled beers (Amstel Light and Peroni) and none on tap.  We shared the mussels for an appetizer, and they were spectacular!  I could have eaten the broth with a spoon.  We also split a chopped salad with bleu cheese which was very tasty.  My wife had the scallop and shrimp scampi for her entree and I had the Dolce del Mare.  We were both very pleased with our choices.  Thanks to the 50% Monday special, we walked out of there extremely satisfied  for only $67--including a pretty generous tip.  We'll definitely be making another trip to this establishment.
