Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I'm from out of town, so I come to this place with no hype in my brain. I just saw a huge crowd and decided to go here.. . 1. Filling for under $5.. 2. Ms. Pac Man and Pole Position arcades in the back.. 3. The salsa is crackrock-good.. 4. Fast order (go inside, don't wait outside). 5. Active environment (everyone is crazy around Tito's). . 5 stars too much? No. I felt like a Norse God after eating here, filled with cheap tacos and tasty salsa. That deserves the most stars possible.
