Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
I genuinely liked Spago, not just for the name or the celebrity chef but for the reason my boyfriend and I cancelled on them 3x and would make fun of their fake accent they use when they answer the phone. We finally go there and ofcourse it's valet and we are all dressed up and walk in and there is a nice asian lady saying "Welcome to SPAGGGGOOOO" as we entered. Like all upscale places they seat us at the bar while they pretend to be important and we have a glass of wine.The spagggoooo lady comes back and tells us our table is ready, we follow her into the world of Spago. We got seated in a peculiar spot which was half inside and half outside- we liked it. We had the best of both worlds. Our waitress tried to do the fake sago accent but she was Austrian so she couldnt really do it, but she was super helpful with the wine list bible (its overwhelming). They didnt have what I was originally going to order so I went with my second choice and it was amazing. My boyfriend loved his meal also. The wine we selected was excellent and we shared a berry upside down cake for dessert along with epresso with a sambuca shot. Spago was a great time, I would go back. Also it's worth mentioning Not everyone was dressed, we saw people in jeans and tshirts, they looked weird in that atmosphere but if Spago accepts them who am I to compain.
