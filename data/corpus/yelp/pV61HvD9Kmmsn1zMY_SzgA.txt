Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Love, Love, Love...the fathers office burger! Quite frankly one of my favorite things to eat in LA. Its not your conventional burger...its more of Â a gourmet burger but the taste is Amazing! When I bring friends here and rant and rave about how its the best I've ever tasted, they are skeptical at first but once they've tried it they agree its really that good. . . Great selection of different beers on tap, and they don't let you make any substitutions to their burger...but then again, why would you want to change/add something that's already awesome! . . Pros--Awesome Burger, Love their Sweet Potato Fries, Excellent Beer Selection. . Cons--first come, first serve basis (open seating), no ketchup
