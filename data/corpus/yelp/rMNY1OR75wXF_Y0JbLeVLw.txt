I'd heard about this place and it just happened to be visiting close by my place the night some friends of mine who follow it on Twitter were visiting me. It was scheduled to be here at 10:30 pm; arriving at 10:15 meant facing an already-huge line.. . I ordered the spicy pork burrito. It was well-made, with a good tortilla, but the pork was a bit too soft and not spicy enough.Unfortunately, hot sauce can only fix flavor, not texture. Still, at $5, worth it.. . The guys who work in the truck are funny and good natured. They painlessly accommodated my vegan friends' dietary requests without blinking an eyelash.
