One of my new favorite places to grab snack-sized meals. And walking into the small establishment greeted by the nicest Asian man made me feel at home, literally.... . The buns are perfection: not dry, not too heavy or thick, but just right and the ratio of bun to filling was great.. - You have to try the signature Haus Bao with Angus skirtsteak, so tender and juicy. I order no cilantro to ruin the flavor of the meat!. - Chairman Bao - WOW. I loved pork belly before, but this was heaven in a Bao! so juicy. . - Sweet Bao fries on the side. Tasty with the dipping sauce, not the highlight of the meal obvi.. . Definitely a must-visit for anybody who has yellow fever when it comes to food! . . It's almost worth the hour long run I forced myself to do afterwards.. . Prices are reasonable, a bit steep, about $8-10 for 2.
