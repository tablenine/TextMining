I dined with my wife and another couple last Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed my experience.  A little pricey, but not outrageous. I highly recommend arriving 30 minutes early and having one of the bartenders whip up one of their signature cocktails.  Very nice.  Food isn't complex...no foam....no craziness.  Just straightforward good eats.
