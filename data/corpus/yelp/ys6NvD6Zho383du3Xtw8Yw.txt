I had their cheese toast (YUMMMMMMMMM) and one of their chicken sandwiches...and I'm pretty sure their chicken sandwich made me sick (I won't go into details, just trust me...lol)  at least I'm hoping it was the chicken sandwich...because I refuse to believe something as yummy as the cheese toast would make me that sick! :-). . I'll go back again (and yes I'll have the cheese toast) and of course try something else...maybe the ribs that some people have raved about on here!  I'll keep you guys posted! :-)
