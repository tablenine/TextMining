Restaurant: Indie Cafe Thai &amp; Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I would classiy Indie cafe as a neighborhood gem. It is a BYOB Sushi and Thai restaurant. Dominicks is less than a block away so it is really easy to grab some Sopporo and Sake before heading in. The food is excellent including the Green Curry which is my favorite. They have a great lunch special during the day where you get an entree an appitizer and a seaweed salad for $7 bucks. This is my favorite restaurant in Edgewater.
