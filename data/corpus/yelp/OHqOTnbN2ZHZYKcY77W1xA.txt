Wow, this is my new favorite burger in LA!  I had the Manly burger with bacon, cheddar cheese, and fried onion strings.  The burger was ridiculously juicy, but a little rare looking for my tastes.  I didn't get sick though, so no problems there.  The burgers aren't grand in scale, but they make for a decent-sized meal.  . . I also had the onion rings, which were really fresh and extremely tasty.  I usually don't eat ketchup with my fries or onion rings, but I went buckwild on their housemade ketchup.  It was more sweet and less tomato-y which definitely sold me. . . Umami burger is so money!!!
