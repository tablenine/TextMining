You can have lunch here (order specialty sandwiches, hot or cold), or empanada, meat pies, potato meat balls or tons of pastries. There is a large selection.Each item is about $0.75-$1.25. Sandwich is about $5, so fair.. . Parking outside in back is metered. Good luck finding a spot.. . In Glendale its divided into two rooms: One room on side you can order coffee, sandwiches, and choice pastries and meat pies. The other side of the same room you can order cakes (for special occasions). In the other room is a ton more pastry options. Sandwiches are made fresh, pastries you point to and order from behind the glass. You can sit there to eat; good luck finding a table.. . Line was a decent length but moved quickly. They also have a menu you can take in the line with you and options on the board over the food, but half the items behind the glass you have to verbally ask the price of. . . I'll have to agree with Stacy k's review. Maybe everyone hyped this place up too much. I've been hearing about this place for months. Maybe my friend who advised what to buy made it sound too good. I tried to like it. I tried 4 different items. Anticlimatic.. Don't get me wrong. The food is fair. Its just not amazing. In fact my friend's midnite sandwich tasted just like a burger to me, although I'm sure the ingredients were much healthier.. . Conclusion: Not bad to try if you're in town and need a not so healthy snack, but not worth driving large distances too.
