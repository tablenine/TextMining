Fantastic breakfast! I had the chilaquiles (sp?) which was essentially an omelette with tortilla chips, cheese and salsa...delish, and a dream come true to a nacho connoisseur like myself. Â The coffee was great and the servers were right on top of keeping me refilled. While waiting for our food, my husband and I loved playing with the little toys on our tables. . . At the other location, they have the coolest hand dryers I have ever seen...very space age. Sneak in if you can :) They have super cheap beer and appetizers if you hit them up for happy hour
