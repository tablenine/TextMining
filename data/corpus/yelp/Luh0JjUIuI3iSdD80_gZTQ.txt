Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
alright, we got ourselves another korean BBQ place here.  Any difference, I think not.   I do give this 4 stars, cause you can smoke outside, without leaving your seat.  It's plates after plates  with smokes after smokes.  I dont smoke but man does it feel good not to be the only one at the table cause all your freinds are outside smoking.  For that I love this place.
