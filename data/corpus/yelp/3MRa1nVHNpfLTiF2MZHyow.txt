This is a really good vegetarian restaurant. Its my favorite place to go when i am in the mood so what I call 'greasy' vegan food. Its a nice reminder that not all vegan food is good for you no matter how good it is. Â I must say again though that its the best place to go and have this type of meal it keeps me from missing all the normal things in life that a twenty year old should be eating.
