Great food (the mac and cheese. THE MAC AND CHEESE!!!). Good ambiance. Good service. . I have no complaints! Cool spot for a date. Has a romantic vibe to it. Dim lighting. I'd describe it as cozy. The space is small, which I like. . . It's a bit pricey. That's my only negative thing.. . My experience was grand.
