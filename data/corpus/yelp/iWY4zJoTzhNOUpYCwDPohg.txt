Wow!! I've been to this place twice. The first time we went, I over-ordered (didn't know the portion was so big), but for my steak I ordered the chef's cut. It was so mouth-watering, juicy, perfectly cook as medium rare as told. The sides are just OK I think, the big star here is the steak!! I don't think I've ever had any better steak than this one.. . The second I went here, I ordered the towering seafood concoction, and it was excellent, seafood (prawns, oysters, crab claws, lobster tails) was fresh. No frills, just dip them in one of three sauces they provided (cocktail, tartar or horse-radish). I tried the horse-radish, and it stung me! (the way wasabi does). For the steak, I ordered the bone-in ribeye 32oz this time, and this didn't disappoint! Although, the medium rare was just slightly (just a tad) over, but this didn't take away my enjoyment of the meat.. . Oh and service is excellent. And very friendly with kids.. . I highly recommend this place. Best steak place that I've ever been to.
