3 for inconsistency. I've been here and have had a great lunch. I've also been here and have had a very disappointing dinner. How can you screw up Pad Thai? Â They managed it, and for a lot more $$ than a cheap store front joint. They had a duck entree with cranberries that tasted like they just piled raw cranberries onto a piece of duck meat. It was that bad. It was also an uncomfortable, cramped, and loud dining experience, so loud a reasonable conversation could not be held at the table.. . On the other hand, I know that other people have had splendid meals here. Would I recommend this place? I am on the fence.
