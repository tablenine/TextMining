Restaurant: Ecco
Category: Modern European
My friend and I sat outside on a beautiful day when we visited Ecco.  I raved about the grilled squid, and she loved the fried goat cheese with honey.  We ate until we could barely walk.  I tried the Long Live the Queen cocktail on the server's suggestion, but I really think anyone who doesn't like gin should steer clear of it no matter who is making the recommendation.  My friend's cocktail was really tasty:  she tried the Quella Ragazza and HAD to have more than one, of course.  Luckily, we were within walking distance of some decent shopping, where we "eccoed" praise for the restaurant to anyone willing to listen.
