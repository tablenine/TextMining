Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
my personal hangover cure: Flo fritatta. eggs with fresh spinach, cheddar cheese, potatoes,red onions, topped with homemade mole sauce, a side of black beans and a warm flour tortilla to mop it all up.. . I also love the flo egg sandwhich with brioche toast, basil mayo, scrambled eggs, and roasted red peppers.. . for guys, i highly recommend the borracho burger, just make sure you are truly hungry before tackling it.. . Free coffee with real cream while you wait for a table is great.. . the dinner menu is very good, though i tend to eat here more in the morning.
