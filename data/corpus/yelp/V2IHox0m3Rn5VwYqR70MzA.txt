Restaurant: The Shed at Glenwood
Category: American (New)
So, I told my friends that I would find a place for dinner. I thought we were in trouble when the taxi driver had not hear of The Shed and then more trouble when he called someone and they had not heard of it either. Then we walked in and it was pretty empty. Trust me....my friends will get lots mileage out of this one. Luckily, the service was great as was the food. I cannot remember our waiter's name, but he had only been there 2 weeks and was great!! We all had the Sunday Supper - $20, cannot go wrong. 2 of us had the fish and chips and the other had the chicken. All was good. For appetizers we shared the risotto balls and green fried tomatoes...both really good. . Good food.. Good service.. Good value.
