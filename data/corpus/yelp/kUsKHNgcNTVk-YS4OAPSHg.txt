Sometimes you look at the 1Star reviews and think isolated incident.  That's what I assumed when I made my first trip to Tank.  We recently bought a condo in Linc Sq. and were excited to check this place out after so many solid reviews from friends.  The short version is that our order was lost/not placed by our aloof, unsympathetic server.  We waited 50 minutes for nothing and witnessed little to no action to rectify our situation.  We werent the only folks experiencing this lack of service either.  The best part...she was also audacious enough to present a $4 bill for the iced tea I ordered.  Bottom line:  If you are going there for 1/2 price on weeknds, keep this in mind.  Your dining experience does not truely matter to them.  Your chair is easily replaced by the volume other lemmings lining up for a 'good deal'.  Why put up with this awful approach to dining when there are so many other sushi restaurants that are excited to have you as a customer?  Lastly, I had 50 minutes to stare at the sushi chefs and you might think their ankles are shackled behind the bar...didnt see smiles, speaking or interaction.  No enthusiasm in this place whatsoever.  I guess the hip, urban trance-like beats on the stereo breed high priced apathy.
