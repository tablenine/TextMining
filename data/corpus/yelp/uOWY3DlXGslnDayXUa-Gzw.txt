I came to Chicago for a weekend and on my agenda was trying Chicago deep dish pizza. We were directed to Gino's. We ordered the spinach and cheese deep dish and were told the wait would be about 45 minutes ( he wasn't lying). After out long wait our pizza came out and while it looked yummy (I must admit that due to my level of hunger at this point anything could've looked yummy) it wasn't all that stellar. How disappointing! Maybe I don't like change but I'm used to my Mellow Mushroom crust ( a Georgia thing) where it's fluffy and parmesan-ee. And this crust was hard and made from corn meal, bland. . I think next time I'll stick with regular pizza with all its fluffiness!
