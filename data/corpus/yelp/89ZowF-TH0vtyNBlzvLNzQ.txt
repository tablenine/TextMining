...heart attack on a plate...but I love it!!!. . This is definitely my guilty pleasure...fried chicken...buttery waffles...fried gizzards...grits...oh my. For those who haven't tried the sinful combination of chicken and waffles (I know it sounds a bit strange)...just TRY IT...you won't be sorry.. . ...my only complaint is the long wait.
