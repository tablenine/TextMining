It took me a long time to get to Green Sprout.  The name always fooled me whenever I would go to RuSan's upstairs.  I thought it was more American crunchy granola vegan food.  But, the former bf took me there for the first time, and I loved it!  Really good Chinese food.  The meat never makes any difference to me, so I don't miss it, but it's nice to have the fake options, and theirs are actually tasty - much better than the cardboard tasting imitations found in other veggie places.. . My favorites so far are the eggless hot &amp; sour soup, scallion pancake, twice cooked "pork", and the eggplant.  Nothing was too salty, which can be a problem when you're trying to give flavor to vegetarian dishes, but the last time I ordered delivery, my noodles were kind of greasy.. . The prices are decent and they have lunch specials during the week.  Man, this review is making me hungry.  I should know better than to review on an empty stomach.. . ***Closed Wednesdays!!***
