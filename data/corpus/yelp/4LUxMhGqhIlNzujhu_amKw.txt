Be warned parking = death.  . . But besides a lack of parking, Spitz is pretty much amazing.. . I initially went just to support the business since alum of the college I go to opened it.  Although after the first time I was completely hooked and on average go there twice a month or so.. . The portions are huge and flavorful and not especially expensive.  While a Doner in Europe won't set you back as much, for about $8 you can get an amazing sandwich, a side and a drink. I HIGHLY recommend their lightly fried, slightly sweet and salty pita strips and hummus.  Their fries are tasty too and it's nice to see Sweet Potato Fries on the menu as well.  Some days I add Feta to my original or classic or whatever it's called on sandwich bread but it depends on my mood.  Also, I never get the Chili Sauce.  I love spicy foods but it seems unnecessary when there are already so many flavors going on.  . . Every now and then I'll get Gelato but it's slightly overpriced.  It's amazing and every flavor is delicious but $5 for a small cup seems excessive.. . Overall, the food is fast, delicious and relatively cheap.  It's pretty much the one thing I can eat on a regular basis and not get sick of.  I highly recommend it to everyone.
