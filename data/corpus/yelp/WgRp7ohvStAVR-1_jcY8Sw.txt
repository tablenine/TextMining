If you can make me like onions you are magical!  And this is what happened at The Yardhouse with their diabolic onion rings.  This is a great place to watch games, in particular, THE LAKERS!  This is why I went you see.  Fun, laid back atmosphere with true Lakers fans.  Fast service, good food and as previously mentioned, the only place that was able to make me like anything that has the main ingredient as onions.  What is in that secret batter?  If you told me it was illegal I would believe you.
