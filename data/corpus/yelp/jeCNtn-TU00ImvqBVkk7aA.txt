Best Taiwanese food outside of Taiwan. Fare here is extremely good, although portions are a bit small, but who cares. It's worth it. For some reason, my friends and I always crave this place on Tuesdays, and to our dismay it is closed on Tuesdays. Dock one star for that. Otherwise this place is bomb, I highly recommend #1 Sausage Rice and #29 which is some type of noodles.
