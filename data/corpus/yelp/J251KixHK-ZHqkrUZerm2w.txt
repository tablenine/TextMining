I've been here a couple of times but after the last experience, I'm reluctant to ever return.. . The first time was fine.  The sangria was delicious and although half the tapas we ordered arrived to the table cold (???), we enjoyed our meal.  This was a fairly early mid-week meal.. . The last time I went, it was a huge party of 12 on a busy Saturday night and the waitress just could not get our orders right.  About 1/4 of the group decided to get entrees and the rest ordered tapas.  I was one of the 3 who ordered an entree and requested my steak to be medium rare.  About 3/4 of the tapas hit the table before my over-done steak got to me.  The waitress said she couldn't get the kitchen to hurry my meal up.  I hadn't asked her but she made it sound like it was my fault for ordering an entree in the first place.. . She had already peeved me when we had sangria and asked us how many glasses we needed.  I told her to bring everyone a glass.  She got mad at me!  And said that some people already had drinks and she wanted me to count just how many people wanted glasses.  Uh?  Really, I'm sorry but didn't I just tell you to bring everyone a glass?  . . Then it got worse when I could not get any silverware for my damn overdone steak.  So, as I had sat almost the entire meal waiting for my entree, I had to wait even longer to eat it.. . Boo.  . . The only redeeming thing about the place was the manager did try to make it up to us by getting us into the club (it's really an adjoining bar they have) next door for "free" although I suspect it's free anyway.  He just jumped us ahead in line.
