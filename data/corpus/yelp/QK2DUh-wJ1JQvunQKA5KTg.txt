After one unsuccessful taco chasing episode the night before, my friends and I finally arrived at the line on Melrose ready to be enlightened by Korean tacos. It all started with us buzzing through Sunset Blvd. during commute hour on a near empty gas tank, follow by a frantic free style sprint to the line as soon as we were parked. After hearing all the hype about this truck, I have never seen a line that was more enthusiastic and eager. . . Was all the efforts justified? During the 30 minute wait, we were entertained by sample drinks from Yuri restaurant and my friends had a great time being clowns and poking fun at the whole experience. My tofu taco and spicy pork taco stood out the most, but otherwise the short rib and spicy chicken tasted too similar to know the difference. Portions were small but the meat was tender and juicy.. . They didn't carry their slider, hot dog, and korchata so that was disappointing. We were able to sit in Yuri to eat our tacos, and by that time the line behind us had gotten unbelievably long--overwhelming the sidewalk. . . Overall it was a fun experience. I will definitely go again with the expectations of going with a group and getting there early. 4 stars for good, innovative tacos and one star less for not having the full menu available.
