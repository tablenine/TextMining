Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
My office has gone to this restaurant for Christmas 3 times in the past 8 years.  The food and service is always great - considering the holiday rush.  However, it seems like if you order something other than the Prime Rib off of the push cart - the waitresses get confused and whatever you are ordering seems to take an eternity because the push cart is on-the-spot tableside service.. . The inside decor seems a little dated and the bar area is too small for the Holiday parties.
