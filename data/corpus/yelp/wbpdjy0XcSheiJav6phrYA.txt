I went here after I did a Yelp search based on my hotel address during my first trip to Chicago.  To be fair, I must say that it was 15 degrees outside (without the wind chill) and I would probably give two stars to anyplace with heat and doesn't make me sick.. . Nice and cozy inside, I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  The bar tender was friendly, but the pours were a bit on the small side.  I ordered an open faced prime rib sandwich au jus, which was served as a slice of prime rib on top of a slice of sourdough bread.  The prime rib tasted fine, and it was nice to have a reasonable portion instead of an over sized serving leaving you in a food coma that a lot of places are serving these days.  It was the price which kept the fourth star just out of reach.  The food I had was fine, but it's just wasn't up to par with my expectations based on the pricing.  3 1/2 stars.
