The chilaquiles are calling to me this morning.  What's that chilaquiles?  You want Cafe Selmarie to drop you off at my place?  Well, my door is always open for you.. . Oh, I'm supposed to be writing a review, so: Cafe Selmarie has a tasty, tasty brunch, good service, and takes reservations for parties of 6 or more.  I suggest going with a group for brunch with reservation, because the waiting area is cramped.
