I don't like this location as much as the original.  Sure there's more space(to breathe), AND a patio area...BUT(and it's a big one)...where were all the female servers at?  It was a total cock fest inside, no kidding!  Sure, the guys were friendly and helpful...but still!  Sure, the girls at the original location are all Bitchy(notice the upper case 'B')...but at least they were nice to look at.  . . 3 stars for a good burger and a stellar selection of beers on tap!
