Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
Used to be one of my standard restaurants to take the folks when they visited. Once Kevin Rathbun left to open his own place, I moved on as well. But it's still got essentially the same menu and the quality hasn't changed much.. . After browsing through the other reviews, does anyone NOT get the chips with Maytag Blue Cheese? I admit, I get them every time...just wondering if people ever try the other apps?. . The interior is cool, it always reminds me of pictures of dining cars on trains from the 30's and 40's. The staff is very good, and the food is well executed. There's a reason why it is still hugely popular after being around for a long time.. . Random story: my best friend's next door neighbor in Baltimore found out that my friend had lived in Atlanta for a few years. He starts telling a story about how he went to a diner in Atlanta and was pissed that they didn't have fried pork chops or other "diner" food. He was genuinely insulted by the lack of soul food. Of course, he was talking about Buckhead Diner.
