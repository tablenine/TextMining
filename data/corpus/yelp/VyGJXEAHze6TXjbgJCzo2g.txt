Well, it's near my work- it's definitely got that going for it. We have held a couple of happy hours here, and I went once for dinner. Based on this experience, I would say that it's got a kinda cool atmosphere, decent food and some interesting menu items, and spotty service. When I ordered dinner here, the food came cold, which did not impress me. And today, for example, we sat there for an hour and a half, and our server came by the minimum number of times: once to allow us to order a drink, once to bring the drink, once to put down the check, and once to bring the credit card back. I will say that the check was handled fairly efficiently.. . The salsa chips are the good kind - they're nice and light and you can taste the grease. Mmmm. Also try the chocolate cake with chili.
