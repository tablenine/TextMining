Restaurant: Shopsin&#39;s
Category: Diners
Don't bother with Shopsin's.. . Apparently they don't need the business.. . My friend heard about this gourmet greasy spoon, and invited me to brunch. Walking in, she snapped a few photos, annoying a seated employee sporting a Shopsin's shirt, who asked her to stop.. . As we went to a table, the same guy said, "You're not sitting down.". . When we asked if he was serious, he made it clear he was, and that we were not eating there. Stunned, we bid him (actually owner Kenny Shopsin) goodbye.. . What just happened?. . According to their site, no parties larger than four will be served. We didn't know that - it was six of us - and no one told us when we were ejected.. . Shopsin can run his place any way he pleases, but why abandon tact? Blunt behavior can add divey charm to a place, but I find it confusing that customers aren't given a chance to adapt to house rules - our incident wasn't an isolated one.. . I'm certain Shopsin's cooking is ambrosial (they're popular for a reason), but there are other fine places to brunch, without the attitude.
