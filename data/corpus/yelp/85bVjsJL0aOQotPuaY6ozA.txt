Flip wins the prize for best restaurant music. I mean honestly, it sounded like I had just plugged my own iPod in. And yeah, my music selection *is* that good. . . I was seated at the "chef's bar" and conveniently enough, that meant sitting right next to Richard Blaise, his wife, and his super precious baby. I'm a total nerd when it comes to celebrities, even if they aren't celebrities. If you get interviewed on the local news for a comment about how bad traffic was that day, I'll probably want your autograph. So yeah, I freaked out and didn't say anything to him. Typical. . . Anyway, my server was super sweet and quick and let me sit for a while at the bar. I'm kind of regretting not getting a milkshake, but there's always next time! I had the butcher cut burger, which was absolutely smothered with bleu cheese and onions. It was all very tasty, but really messy and I feel like the toppings overwhelmed the meat. The bun was nice and thick and the burger was the perfect size. . . All in all, I really enjoyed my meal at Flip. $14 is a bit pricey for it to become part of my regular lunch circuit, but I think things could be a good bit cheaper if you brought a friend to split a side.
