- Cheese Rolls. OMG, WHY haven't I tried this the very first time? Well, it was suggested by the worker but I told her no when I should've said HELL YES. I found my heaven. Cheese rolls, would you marry me?!?!?!. . - Apple Turnover. I didn't like it one biiiiiiiiiiiit.. . - Strawberry &amp; Cheese Croissant. Ahhhh, too much for me. I only wanted to try it but didn't fall in love with it like I did with cheese rolls.. . - Guava Cheese Strudel. Whoa, guava jam is not the way to go for me. I like it better as juice! I've tried this before but totally forgot that I didn't like it so FML, just kidding it's not that bad.. . - Meat Pie. Okay, is this the same as chorizo pie? I get those two confused whenever I'm here, but I'm assuming it's the same thing. Mmm, for some reason it looked BIGGER &amp; it tasted BETTER! My mom's favorite, just because she's not a sweet tooth like I am.. . - Coconut Strudel. I HATE coconut but I LOVE how it's so good that I forget I HATE it, if that made any sense. . . ** Sorry, I've had lots &amp; lots &amp; LOTS of sweets to keep me pumping for some studying time tonight .. HAHA : )
