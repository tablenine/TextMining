GIANT PANCAKES THAT ARE THE SIZE OF MY HEAD!. I got just plain pancakes and I split them with two other people. I could barely handle one.. Usually when I walk by this place on a weekend morning its jam-packed with people waiting on line for the next available table. I went on a Wednesday afternoon and it was dead. The service was alright. The server didn't seem to stop by our table too often.. The downside about going here is you REEK like the place even an hour or two after you leave. The smell just gets in your skin.. . Also my friend tried a phone order on a Saturday because he works nearby and wanted Griddle for lunch, they said "we're too busy right now" and hung up on him.. Um, isn't he a customer going to pay you MONEY for your product? should it matter if it is busy? I would get in trouble if i did that at my job. A customer is a customer. You lose one star for that business.
