The best pile of burger I've ever had in my life. The first bite was screaming "I'm tasty!!!!" out loud. And that lasted till the very last bite. The aged beef was wonderfully aromatic, the Maytag blue cheese meltingly smooth but not overpoweringly so, the bacon compo soaked with BBQ sauce was perfectly balanced - not too tangy, not too sweet, not too slippery - and the bread was soft to your tongue yet firm enough to hold everything intact and say no to sogginess. Arugula added cleanliness to your pallet. Really, the best burger ever.. . The fine-julienned garlic fries with garlic aioli was as flavorful as garlic fries can get, without being too "garlicky", in the sense that your breath will turn into de-vampire-izer, or the sewage system of garlic city where people would use garlic juice instead of water and garlic soap instead of soap. The sweet potato fries with blue cheese dip tasted fresh and flavorful, but I think if you really want to enjoy it you shouldn't eat it with the garlic fries (just because the garlickiness will just hit the sweet potato flavor out of the ballpark). The fact that they were served in mini-carts instead of bowls or baskets didn't help that they were already attention-seeking. Lastly, the beer selection was great - 36 taps ranging from decent, affordable beer to rare, acquired-taste imports.. . If I lived in LA, I'd come here every time I want a burger. Or some beer with fries. Or both.
