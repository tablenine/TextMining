I came to Silver Cloud this past weekend looking for comfort food to wrap it's loving arms around my hangover but all I got was a stomach ache!. . Our server was nice and the coffee was decent.  But the food was not good at all.  My boyfriend and I shared the egg sandwich which was served on soggy bread with soggy bacon and cold eggs.  Blah!  I had a side of mac and cheese which was literally swimming in a pool of it's own lard.  Listen, I know you are there Mister Fat.  But I don't want to see you and I certainly don't want you to use my bowl to do the back stroke in!  GROSS.  I think the worst part was my boyfriends blueberry pancake.  It tasted as if there was a meaty hamburger grilled right before the pancake and they didn't clean the grill!  Blah!  I won't be going back here any time soon!
