Man, this place is good! I've had Korean food a couple of other times, but this place is by far the best I've had. Make sure you understand what you're ordering - otherwise you might accidentally order three times as much food as you want, like we almost did. I got the pork tofu soup, and it comes out bubbling furiously and is really tasty. The short ribs are fab. . I wasn't so sure about the dessert thing they brought us - it was rice in a clear liquid. I didn't care for it that much, but it was cool to get it. . . Not sure about the men's bathroom, but the ladie's bathroom has a really cool electronic toilet with all sorts of amusing douching options and even a massage option!
