You gotta love Gibson's. Yeah it may be Little expensive, but who cares !the food and drinks are excellent it so worth it. I make the trip to the(Rush st.) location at least twice a month. It's a great place to relax socialize and enjoy life, the piano bar adds a special touch to this gem in the city.
