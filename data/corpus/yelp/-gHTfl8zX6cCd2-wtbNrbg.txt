I must say I am a lazy Yelper but Portos has inspired me to Yelp again.  I had driven by this place many times and always noticed the crowd inside.  Finally went there this Sunday and it was totally slammed.  Anytime a restaurant is this busy you know it's good.  I had the medianoche sandwich and my husband had the Cubano.  They're pretty much the same sandwich on different bread.  Both were delicious, though I think I'll get the Cubano next time.  All sandwiches are served with plantain chips.  For dessert I had a piece of opera cake and the husband had tiramisu.  Loved them both.  However, the chocolate chip cookie is the real show stopper.  Served slightly warm, the cookies are moist and soft, with that perfect, slightly granular texture.  Best of all, the prices here are so low!  Cookies are something like 80 cents.  Delicious and affordable!  You must eat at Portos.
