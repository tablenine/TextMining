O sweet and succulent chicken, you are my late night answer to sleepless study sessions bundled with my Netter book and my cat.  The chicken here is really juicy and my fav waffles are the buckwheat waffles.  Its the same stuff that soba noodles are made of, but can have a "too healthy" taste for those that don't like wheaty foods.  Parking is sometimes obscure, don't park in that open plaza at night or "they gonna tow yo ass".
