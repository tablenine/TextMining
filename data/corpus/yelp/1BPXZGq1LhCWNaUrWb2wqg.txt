Restaurant: Tokyo Delve&#39;s Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
Here's the deal with Tokyo Delves....The food is bad and it's overpriced. BUT! And this is a big but (like Beyonce size); the experience is great!!! This is the perfect place for a big group, birthdays, bachelor/bachelorette parties, or just when you want to rotate it counterclockwise with some friends. I've been three times and I have had a blast every single time. Even though the food is waaay overpriced and pretty atrocious I have never left feeling ripped off. . . Go with a group of friends and go in with the mind set that you are about to get crazy. There are mandatory Saki bombs, singing, dancing, shows, getting on tables, and pretty much anything that you want to do is cool. Each time I went got more crazy than the next time. By the third trip I was dancing on the table and throwing Saki glasses up against wall...Ok, I was pretty swerved and it wasn't my best moment but I had fun and that is the reason I went there. . . ENJOY! Oh and make sure you do eat some of the food. You will drink a lot and you're going to want something in your stomach....Ok, maybe it would be better to eat before.
