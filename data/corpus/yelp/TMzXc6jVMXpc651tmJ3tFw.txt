Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I think this place is amazing.. . With the complexity of the menu, it is a wonder that any order ever gets out of the kitchen on the same day it's placed.. . Jerry's could simplify things to make it easier on the customers who can't decide .... make it easier for the staff to take a 100% accurate order .... make it easier and quicker for the kitchen to build the orders .... reduce the potential to run out of an item or an ingredient on the menu.. . Then they would be just like a lot of not very good and very boring joints throughout the city.. . I have been here many times.. . I expect it to take a little time. . . I know the flavors will kick ass.. . I know that way more often than not I will be so happy with my meal that I will be talking about it for hours.. . These folks must have a passion for what  they are doing or they would. cave in and become ordinary.. . If you are in need of fast and cheap, go to  McDonald's.
