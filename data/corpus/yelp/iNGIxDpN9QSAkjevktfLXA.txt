The Oinkster Pastrami was really good but was to fatty for my liking. I loved the smokiness but I hated how with every bite the meat pulled out bc I could not easily bite through the thick cut fatty pieces. I did love the cabbage slaw as it added a crisp freshness to the sammie and the gruyere and the caramelized onions were a great interesting addition to add to a pastrami.
