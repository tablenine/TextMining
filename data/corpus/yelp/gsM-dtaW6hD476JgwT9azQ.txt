Restaurant: FOX Sports Grill
Category: Sports Bars
A huge sportsbar, Fox Sports Grill is pretty upscale compared to most.  There is a gigantic rectangular bar in the middle of the main dining area, with several little couch nooks surrounding it.  The place is pretty nice, with leather couches, seats, etc.  There is a completely separate smoking area, as well as a tiny patio area on the side. . . The place is jam packed during special games and evenings, though, so expect a wait of about 1-2 hours!  Not really a place you can just roll up to with your friends yet.
