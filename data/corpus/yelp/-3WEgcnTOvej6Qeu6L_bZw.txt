Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
FOOD: The steak was absolutely scrumptious.  I just couldn't decide whether I liked Cut better than Mastro's or not.  Either way, I would gladly gorge myself into the throes of heartburn for another steak at either place any day.  I still find myself daydreaming in the middle of the day about that lobster/crab appetizer too.. . SERVICE: The only reason I didn't give this place five stars is because the hostess at the front was a cold, snooty you-know-what.  I was moving out of town, so I invited three of my closest friends to have dinner with me at Cut on my last night there.  Two of my friends were coming from Pasadena and got stuck in traffic.  The mean hostess lady would not seat me and the friend who arrived on time unless everyone was there (even if I ordered food for the other two, which doesn't make any sense), so I reduced our party size to two instead so that we could sit.  When my two tardy friends finally arrived, we had them join our table, but that horrible woman just rolled her eyes and gave us the iciest treatment I've ever had the misfortune of witnessing, much less receiving.  Our waiter was very nice and friendly, but the hostess was the epitome of the stereotypical LA wannabe-model snob who relished in looking down her nose job at us, the ones that pay her salary.  Despicable treatment.
