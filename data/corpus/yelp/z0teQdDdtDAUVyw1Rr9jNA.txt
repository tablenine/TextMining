Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
Chicago offers so many great options for truly great food, but this is not one of them.  While the ambiance, location and service are great, the food is not up to par.  Nothing is really "got-to-have-it-again-tasty"; everything feels a bit "manufactured"...and the dry-aging business is SO over-rated.. . After our visit to David Burke's, I was telling some friends about our meal and that I would not waste my money to go back.  They all said that they wished I had asked them before going, so they could have persuaded against it...as they also had less-than-average food there.
