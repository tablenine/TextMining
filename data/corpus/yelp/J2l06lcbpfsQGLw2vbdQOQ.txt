We went there for a late night dinner. The grilled vegetable salad was decent, I didn't realize until later that my wife didn't put any salad dressing in. It tasted better with the dressing.  My burger was decent. Nothing spectacular but doable, especially when hungry. The chili was sweet... I've never had sweet chili before. I thought the food was just ok. 2 stars for the food.. The desserts were much better. We had tiramisu and berry cheesecake. I would give the desserts 4 stars.
