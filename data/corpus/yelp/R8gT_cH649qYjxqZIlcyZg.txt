Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I love this place! The tacos are the right price ($1.50 - $2.00) and are amazing! I have not had tacos like this at any restaurant in Los Angeles yet! I love how they are made right in front of you, so they are steaming hot and crunchy! The salsa bar has an exceptional selection of cabbage, mango salsa, pineapple salsa, hot salsa not hot salsa, radishes, and some sour cream type stuff that keeps the hot stuff in check!
