This place is all about the food. Yes, the wait is tremendously long, bu t this is something you must experience atleast once...twice...or more if you can stand the wait. The meat they use here is tremendous. I've never had any shabu shabu that had meat of this quality. The ponzu sauce is an in house specialty that accentuates each bite. This is definitely a foodie spot. I suggest going mid week and early for dinner. At $17 a person its not bad. You sit at a counter and enjoy a nice pot of shabu shabu. If you've never had shabu shabu...and you love beef then you are missing out. . . Try it...and you'll put a smile on your face... ;)
