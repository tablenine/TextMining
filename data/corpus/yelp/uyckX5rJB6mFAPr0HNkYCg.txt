Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
This restaurant is the holy grail of steak houses in Chicago.  I had the 75 day aged (Underground Himalayan Salt Room) Prime Rib and my mouth was overcome with an orgasmic array of tantalizing flavors and juices.  It tasted almost like what I imagine the Himalayan Mountain range to taste like on a cold spring morning.  The lollipop tree of cheese cakes was to die for, and while the service is excellent the communication between the wait staff and the kitchen timing is a bit off.  Best steak I have ever tasted, great ambiance and fantastic company make this restaurant a must try in down-town Chicago.
