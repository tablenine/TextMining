The only redeeming part of this restaurant/sports bar is the rooftop deck. This is the third time I've been here and the service is terribly slow and almost rude. I am used to loud but the noise level in this place is unbelievable - you will not be able to hear your friends short of yelling. They also made us wait over 20 minutes for our confirmed reservation.. . The food is mediocre at best with the pizza being pretty terrible. Â The bartender, Lane, however, was a seasoned professional and understood our party's frustrations at the hostess/other waitstaff and went out of his way to make sure drinks were flowing.
