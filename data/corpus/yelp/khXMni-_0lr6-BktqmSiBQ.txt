My god. I went here on a blind date. After about fifteen minutes, my date asked, "What kind of place have you taken me to?" Not that we ate anything. We were ensconced in the bar, drinking cider and beer. I felt, as I sipped my Strongbow, like I had walked into a time warp and been shot out into an eighties video. . . Among the bar's numerous inhabitants was a large, middle-aged man clad in a double-breasted blue pinstripe suit, a la Wall Street. He sat stewing over a watery cocktail, his dusty blond hair hanging raffishly over his drink. Nearby, a rapidly aging peroxide blonde stood against the wall doing her best to project some kind of cougarish sex appeal. She looked like she had mistaken a microwave oven for a tanning bed. Her tiger-striped dress and Egyptian-style eyeliner set her firmly in the realm of the absurd. . . As my date and I continued to ignore each other and gazed around the human zoology experiment we'd stumbled into, I noticed a man get up and walk to the bathroom. Almost instantly his date or wife, neatly embalmed in a mountain of powder, rouge, mascara and lip gloss, turned and made a flirtatious comment to the pin-stripped junk bond broker, who brightened and came jauntily over to have a chat with her while her husband innocently relieved his bladder. Meanwhile, the requisite ex-athlete, boozing with his ex-agent, leered menacingly at whatever females came through the door. He was wearing a massive tropical shirt and slacks, signifying he was now permanently on vacation.. . Eventually, the date and I paid and fled. The time warp machine ejected us into the late evening glare of Peachtree Street and South Buckhead, doing its damndest to move into modernity, with curiously unsatisfying results. But now I know better. Next time I'll wear a power tie and leave the date behind.
