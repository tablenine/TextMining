I split the oinkster pastrami sandwich and fries with a friend. Came out to 12$.. . The pastrami was salty. . I could hardly taste the coleslaw in the sandwich. . . When I added some Carolina BBQ sauce (watery tangy stuff) it took some of the salty taste away (unfortunately I probably added in more sodium) and tasted better. But better than Langers. NO! . . Their fries were the worst fries I've ever had but I couldn't stop eating them because of the aioli and the two special types of ketchup they had. . . Parking was okay but I went around 2 on a weekday.. . Overall wouldn't drive out of the way for this.
