Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Went here once after a Laker Game and it was my first time. Our waitress ended up being Mama and I was kind of glad that she was because it just added to the experience. The chicken was pretty good, but I like mine well seasoned and kind of crusty and they didn't have much crust on it.. I suppose that's the southern style, y'all. Â . . It was pouring ass rain outside, and yet it was still pretty busy and the parking lot was horrible but we got lucky and got seated pretty fast too. . . The waffles were pretty good, but again I'm kind of picky about waffles and they were a tad soggy but they were pretty freaken' good. The butter tasted homemade but I could be wrong? . . What really did it for me.. (laugh if you must) The CORNBREAD. The CORNBREAD with the butter.. Mmm.. I still dream about that damn cornbread.. it was warm, fresh, thick, corny (Ha), and sooo yummy.. . . I'm going out to LA tomorrow afternoon actually, Too bad I'm broke but I don't know how much that's really going to keep me from going to Roscoe's even the fact that tomorrow's SUNDAY doesn't make me want to stay away..
