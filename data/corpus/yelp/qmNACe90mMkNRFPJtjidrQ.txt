This is a good place to go and get some streight up good old food.  I've only really eaten there once and it was on Christmas day. It was pretty much the only place that I could find that was open.  I ate an omlette that was pretty good.  The lady that waited on us could have been mistaken as being rude but I think she just had a no no-nsense attitude.  When I said that the omlette was good she said, "of course it is.". Another cool thing about this place is the Kibitz room.  It's a little bar in the back where bands play sometimes.  I seems like just a hole in the wall type bar but i think it's a freindly atmosphere.  If you're in a band its a cool place to play because they won't charge your friends admission and some people will just walk in off the street to watch the bands.  . . So even though it might smell wierd in there sometimes, Canter's is still a good place to go.
