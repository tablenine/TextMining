Honest to God the 1st thing outta my mouth after I had my very 1st bite of a Kogi taco was..."My people are geniuses!!!" Seriously. I admit it. The rum and diet I had just downed on the dance floor at the Brig probably helped just a tad, but...nonetheless I'm firm in my opinion. It's bomb. I've always felt blessed being Korean, bc I got to eat lots of yummy Korean food w/o being weirded out by most of it ('cept the seafood...I hates me the seafood!) I've had the taco truck twice now, and this is an awesome pairing of Korean and Mexican cuisine.  Ya know how mixed-race Asian (Happa)babies are unbelievably cute? Well, I like to think of Kogi Taco Truck as the most delectable Happa food baby! :) And a quick note...you can get kogi (Korean for meat) in the quesadilla....I fell in love-all of the nagging questions and murmurings about career, love, and life halted and all became right in my world when I had my 1st bite of  the KimChi Quesadilla w/Kogi...don't not go bc everyone is going...it's true...it's as good as they say it is. But beware: the line! 15-20 mins upfront will save you a good 30-45mins on the backend, so be early!
