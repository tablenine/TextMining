If I had a choice, I'd rate Urban Belly 3.5 stars, but we did have a really nice time there last night, so leaned for 4 over 3. I read a lot of other Yelp reviews before going and here's the deal. If you don't like communal seating, just don't go. It is what is; my wife and I enjoy that setting from time to time. I will concur with a lot of others that the price point here is higher than it probably should be. We did enjoy everything we got (the eggplant side; one dumpling appetizer; two noodle dishes), but it's a tad high and I totally agree that tipping before* being served (especially if it's your first time and don't know the drill) is annoying. Okay, so those two issues out of the way, I'll say that we would certainly go back because the flavors in what we ordered were super-tasty and the menu, tho a bit spare, appeared to have several other things we would like to try. Also like the BYOB because it allows to drink what we want without any crazy markup like you usually find. This is a good somewhat off-the-beaten-path noodle shop to enjoy.
