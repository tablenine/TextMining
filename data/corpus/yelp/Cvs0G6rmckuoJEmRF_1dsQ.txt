Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
this place is the shiat. . . Luckily, i didn't have to wait in line for a seat when I arrived at the apple pan. Just sat down and awaited the orgy of deliciousness that i was about to experience. I had their Hickory cheeseburger.. so good, juicy and big. The fries were really hot, although they could have used a bit of seasoning. no biggie. . I liked how they gave the drinks straight from the can.. My friends and I got our food within minutes of ordering which was good cause we were starving!. Only drawback would be that parking on the street is a bit tricky, we ended up getting a parking ticket. whatev.. Next time, i'm going to try one of their pies.
