Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
When I want to take some years off my life, I come to Fred 62 at 3 in the morning and order myself a SUPER RICO sandwich.  It's probably the worst thing to be eating at the end of a night out, but it's just so good to resist.  I already love me a good greasy tuna melt, but Fred 62 takes it a step further and deep fries it in batter!  Holy heart attack!. . Lots of people love Fred 62 as you can see by the lines some nights.  I do too.  There's not much more to want from a late night diner than what they offer here.  It's also a great breakfast spot in Los Feliz, among the many other good options in the area.  Parking can be an issue, but if you roam the neighborhood you'll probably find a parallel spot to back into.. . So come here and fill up on the good, health unconscious food.  It's okay, it's those last years when you're old and grey anyway.  You won't miss them.
