Went here for a friend's birthday - it was good, but not as good as all the hype about it.. . We do love imported beer (24 of them) - they had some great stuff. And the sausages were good, and very unique - got the rattlesnake and rabbit and it was tasty. The dips for the Belgian fries were unique and yummm too. . . BUT - seating sucked. There were no seats inside so we had to take our group to the outside patio ---it was FREEZING. They should really put some heat lamps up in the winter. Also, the Belgian fries were supposed to be fried twice, but they weren't as crispy as I thought they would be for something deep fried 2x -- in and out's extra well fries have more bite and crunch. Though I have to give props for the truffle oil - that was reallly good.. In the end, though, you are paying a pretty penny for what really is just a glorified hot dog. Gourmet, unique, and delicious for sure, but is basically a glorified hot dog. . . A great casual hang out for friends, might even go back again. Just not anytime soon. And definitely not for an actual meal.
