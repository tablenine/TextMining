Here's the good: Food is good and Beer Selection is great, i love the beer garden vibe.. . Here's the Bad: The attitude. I can't stand blue cheese and they don't budge so if i want a burger that means picking all the nasty cheese off and I'f im paying that much for a burger I want to be the one calling the shots. . Plus their burger pales in comparison to Umami Burger.. . Here's my experience. I had to go here to pick up some food for clients that were coming into our office. Called in to place an order. "We don't do phone orders, you'll have to come in and place it in person.". Ridiculous but they're close by so I went in and told them everything I needed to order To-Go. "We don't do To-Go.". They refused to budge, knowing full well that I had to take all the food out of the restaurant with me, they told me I'd have to sit at a table, wait for the food, they'd bring it out and I could put it in a to-go box myself.. I sat there for ten minutes transferring all the food we'd ordered from plates to boxes.. So who is this helping? You're just making more work for the people who now have to do more dishes. What a waste of time.
