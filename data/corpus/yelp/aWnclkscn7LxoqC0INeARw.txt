Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Being Taiwanese, I'm no stranger to vast variety of hot-pot style dishes that are available to typical Taiwanese.  Shabu-shabu is actually at the bottom of my list.  This is because, come-on, shabu-shabu broth is just water, with no other flavoring.  However, by chance we got to try this Shabu shabu, and it is miles above the rest.  The key is the quality of it's meat, which are highly marbled and extremely fresh.  It's one of the rare instance where I can appreciate the tasteless broth, since it highlights the quality of the meat quite well. . . Be warned though, like Daikokuya, there's almost always a huge line waiting to get in at all hours of operation.  People tend to lined up quite a queue already before the restaurant even opens.
