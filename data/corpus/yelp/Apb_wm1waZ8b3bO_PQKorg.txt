LOVED THIS PIZZA!. . My partner and I ordered Calos Pizza the other night on a whim, and were VERY happy with our pie!  We had the "Stuffed Pizza" with green peppers, garlic, and onion... a combination that had a light and yummy flavor.  We had a large, and were unable to finish with just the two of us... and had a battle over the leftovers the following day. . . GROOD (great + good) PIZZA!  TRY!
