Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
My girlfriend and i celebrated our 1yr anniversary at spago last night. The experience,service, setting decor and half of our dinner didn't disappoint. . Notice how i only mentioned half our dinner.. My gf ordered the veal and it was awesome.I on the other hand had the new york prime and it was at most average.. I ordered the new york prime med well and it was over cooked to my liking... . Other then that, we enjoyed every minute slipping wine and enjoying our beautiful surroundings.. ALL in all im glad we got to celebrate our anniversary at this restaurant.. . . side note.. this place is very costly so make sure to check ur balance before making reservations
