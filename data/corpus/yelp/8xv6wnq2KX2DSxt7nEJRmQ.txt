Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
I am in the unfortunate situation of not living close to any coffee shops save Starbucks. However I make sure to take the mile-long trek to Kopi as often as I can. Their coffee and tea are fantastic, and their food is some of the freshest and delicious coffee shop fare I've had in quite some time (I swear they have a garden in the back). Plus their atmosphere (both decor and music) is amazing! It's very cute and kitchy as every independent coffee shop should be, but they have a loft area by the street-side window where you can sit on big pillows by low tables. If you can snag one of those spots, do it! Definitely come here--you feel like you are in brief visitation to an eastern land with a touch of fairy tale. Definitely better than Starbucks!
