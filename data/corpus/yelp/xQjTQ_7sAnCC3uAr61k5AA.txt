Not sure what the hype is all about. We tried 6 different kinds of dumplings and the pork xiao long bao were the better of them but still didn't impress me. . . The skin was a bit too thick for my taste buds and left a gritty feeling on my tongue....yuck.. . I would rather go to my neighborhood joint called Shanghai East: . http://www.yelp.com/bi....
