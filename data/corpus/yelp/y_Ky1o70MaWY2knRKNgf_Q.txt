Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
Cheekily called "chopstick cuisine," Ping Pong is a quirky little BYOB sushi/Pan-Asian restaurant. It's also probably the smallest restaurant in the neighborhood, with about three tables inside. Luckily there's outdoor seating in the summer. Only open in evenings, its a great place for an intimate date and a creative menu.
