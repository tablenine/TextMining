Amazing service, super romantic! I had been wanting to try Zed 451 for some time and was glad i did! The atmosphere is never rushed, the hosts and servers are super polite and attentive. They are willing ot make suggestions and insure you are being served to your meal preferences. I will most definitely go back!
