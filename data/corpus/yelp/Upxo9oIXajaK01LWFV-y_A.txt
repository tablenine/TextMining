Seeing in pictures and reading in reviews that portions are small, my hubby and I went and ordered a lot.  But we both didn't expect that what we ordered was more than enough!! Neither one of us wanted to drive back home!  We were soooo full!!  We had the best lamb dinner.  Never had it so good.  The salads, the meatballs, and OMG the desserts (yes, we had 2 kinds, would you believe!) - they were all fantastic.  I would love to go there again, but maybe not on a Saturday.  It was too packed, and even if we had reservations, we still waited.  We were too embarrassed to complain though, seeing that everyone else didn't seem to have a problem with waiting.  Come to think of it, I wouldn't mind waiting if food is THIS good.  But then again, I wish they would expand.  The place is just too small to accomodate all the customers...
