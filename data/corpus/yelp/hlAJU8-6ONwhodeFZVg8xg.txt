Sushi what?. . We were at Universal Studios on our buy a day, get a year pass, and an old friend use to rave about Katsu-Ya, but i've been avoiding it since they opened up the brentwood location, but decided that since i was in the area i'd try the original one.. . The place is really popular, so much that there was a waiting list even before they opened at 5:30 on Sunday. We sat at the sushi bar and ordered the Yellow Tail Sashimi with jalape√±o (5 stars, but small portions), the red snapper sushi (3 stars), albacore sushi (5 stars), and a roll i don't remember (4 stars). Service was prompt, and the sushi was fresh, and the portions are small.. . Overall we got out of there for under $40 which was fine by me.. . Get there early, or get a RSVP.
