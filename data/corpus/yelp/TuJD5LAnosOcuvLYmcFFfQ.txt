Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Love this place but the prices have gone up so much. I'd probably frequent it more but everytime I go it seems like everything has increased by at least a dollar. People think it's overrated, but I think the waffles are exceptional. And there's something about the chicken and gravy that sets it apart. Obviously, I could go to Churches, pickup a 12-pc meal, stop by IHOP on the way home, and make my own gravy, but there's something about the ambiance of Roscoes that makes it a fun place to eat at. . . Will probably only return though when I'm ready to pay $15 for fried chicken and waffles... Churches/IHOP/My own gravy actually sounds good right now.
