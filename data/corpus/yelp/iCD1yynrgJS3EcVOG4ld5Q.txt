Though this franchise has its built its name around the hunk of beef, I didn't particularly find anything special with this establishment.  Yes, it was clean and the portions were huge but it was so impersonal; kind of like a way more expensive Chili's (I know, ouch.) . . The food was good but kinda really really salty.  I kept downing water for the rest of the day. . . The service was also a little hoity toity for my taste. As we were waiting for a table, I couldn't shake off the feeling that the hostess were looking at us and thinking, "which of these kids can afford to eat here?". . Living in LA, I'm blessed to be able to eat at places that aren't found anywhere else in the country, in the world. I think I'll stick to those.
