Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I am not much of a meat aficionado because I hate the steakhouse vibe/ typically uninspired menu that comes with it. . . However, Lawry's is a classic. Classic great prime rib with all the trimmings. It is an institution worth visiting. Not totally gourmet or divinely inspired...so I gave them 4 stars. But for what they are...they do it very well, and have been for years and years.. . ---Anthony
