Went to Landmark Thursday night and enjoyed a nice meal. It's not a high-end place or as nice and expensive as Boka (which is a great place!) up the street, but it is a step up from casual dining. I enjoyed a nice bottle of Australian Shiraz, and they just added a seafood appetizer section to the menu which includes stone-crabs and oysters. The stone crabs were great and cheap ($12 for 3 medium size claws). The mahi-mahi was great and my date enjoyed the chicken. Try the mushrooms as a side dish, very tasty. I've also enjoyed the lobster club on previous occasions.
