Everything on the menu sounded amazing, so it was hard to order. . . Portions are huge! I went with two guy friends, and we only ordered 2 dishes and still didn't finish.. . We ordered the normal french toast, and it was really good. Nice and buttery, warm and crispy on the outside. MMmmm.. . We also got strawberry pancakes--they come in stacks of three, and they're HUGE! It was pretty yummy but not amaaaazing or anything... . Overall, I think we needed to order eggs or something to offset all the sugar. Good thing we stuck to the plain/original french toast because it would've just been wayyyy too much sugar. . . Service was good, timely. We went around 11AM and waited 15 minutes. Atmosphere is lively, a lot of energy, so it's a fun place to go. But if you need to have a serious talk with someone, it's better to go somewhere quieter.
