Love this place!  I come here often, not only because it's convenient since it's a walking distance, the food is great too!  (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).  Mosty outdoor seating, there's probably a couple of tables inside for the tight space lover I guess.. . I am always welcome here, although they do not have a menu for me, my mom always make sure she gets something that's Pepe friendly.. . I'm normally walking around this area, so keep an eye out for me :p
