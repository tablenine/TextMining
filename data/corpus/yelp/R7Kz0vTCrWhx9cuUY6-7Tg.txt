yumyum!  My mom took me here a couple of months ago.  We ordered fish dumplings and it was delicious.  Four stars for that.  The sticky rice filled with red bean paste was WAY too sweet!  Couldn't finish that.  service was bad and place was busy as hell.  Ended up leaving satisfied and full from the fish dumplings.  No complaints about the food, just bad service.  Left with take-out- extra orders of dumplings to take home :)  I was happy.
