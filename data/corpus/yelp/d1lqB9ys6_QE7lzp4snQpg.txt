Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I've heard of Din Tai Fung from several friends because it's almost like a household brand in Taiwan.  I was so looking forward to going there to see what the big deal is all about.  They have recently opened another dining hall right around the corner from the original location.  The place is very well decorated, reminiscent of the Getty Museum somehow to me.  As usual, both locations were jam packed.  We were offered immediate seating at the new dining hall after 30 minutes of waiting.  Naturally we took the offer.  The food is mediocre at best.  The service was friendly.  The portions were normal sized.  I was expecting magic but only got an average Chinese meal.  Nothing special.  Kinda disappointed.  :(
