love ramen? love pork broth? love authenticity? this is the place.  not a ramen fan?  this just might be the place to change your mind.  I was initially introduced to this place by the wife's sister with a "this place is sooo good, i hope they haven't run out of broth."  I though that was weak, how could a place run out?  Why not make more?  Well, I've yet to come up with the answer, and honestly I dont care.  (running out of broth is only a sunday issue btw).  I just try to get there early if I go on a sunday in order to get my ramen, but I also go early on all other days to avoid the long wait.  There's a bar setup where you sit opposite the large pot of broth and it gets pretty warm, but theres also 10 or so tables that seat four.  When you get there, jot your name on the clipboard, then sit and wait till you get called.   YOu can usually wander around the street and check out the anime store nearby.. . Now for the ramen itself.  Nice savory broth with tender slices of pork, bean spouts, and shallots.  The ramen has a nice al dente finish to it as well.  You can combo it up with other menu items, i usually get the fried rice and share that with the wife as we both devour our ramen.  It is a must to put in a good bit of the ginger thats at tableside as it cuts through the fattiness of the broth.  However, regardless of how rich the broth is, you'll always be able to see the bottom of my bowl by the end of mealtime.  Make sure you get the hot tea as well, as you will feel healthier for drinking it.  I've yet to try the sushi there, as the establishment is always warm from the large broth pot in the open kitchen and it just doesn't feel like the right setting for fresh sushi IMO.  Once you're done, stop by the yogurtland for a refreshing end to your dinner.
