Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I love my area of Los Angeles --- close to the beach, bars, and all the best shopping. I live a stone's throw from excellent sushi, small plates or Italian (three of my favorite foods).. . However, West L.A. is a desert wasteland for Chinese food, and as a Chinese person who loves food (is there any other kind?), this is a small tragedy for me and my stomach.. . So I made a trek last week to the dreaded Valley for my Chinese food fix at Din Tai Fung, apparently home of the best dumplings you can get outside of China (it is, in fact, the American branch of a popular restaurant in Taiwan). When you walk into the restaurant, there's a clear glass window where you can watch the dumpling makers at work---rolling out thin, round skins and deftly forming perfect little dumplings so quickly, they appear to be performing magic.. . My sisters and I ordered up a storm, because I wanted leftovers. For starters, we got three trays of dumplings, including the restaurant's signature dish: juicy pork dumplings. Are there three more beautiful words in the English language?. . The pork dumplings are justly famous --- tender, fragrant, and served with fresh ginger and soy sauce. But all three kinds of dumplings that we ordered were fabulous. In fact, there was not a single miss during our entire meal, from crisp, garlicky green beans to a popular cold tofu and bean sprout appetizer that we ordered after seeing it on nearly every table in the restaurant. Soup noodles were satisfying and served in a clear, simple broth. By the time dessert arrived, my dream of having leftovers had died.. . I hear it's impossible to get in on weekends, and even on Tuesday night, there was a wait. But it's well worth it.
