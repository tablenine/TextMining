Their 'thick cut bacon' sandwich is not on the menu, but is replaced by a smaller, more pitiful-like BLT.  The chips may be homemade, but are kind of soggy.  Their quiche, however, is quite nice - ham and gruyere cheese - yum.  Their zuchini bread with chocolate chips is also a nice, semi-sweet snack/appetizer before you begin your brunch.
