one word sums up my review of Geisha House. OVERRATED.. . $ 36 - filet mignon { 4 small slices of beef drenched in a soy and sugar marinade....not good}. . $24 - Sashimi plate { 2 of the smallest pieces of sashimi in each salmon, tuna and yellowtail...not good}. . $15 - Johnny walker black on the rocks. . $18- Grey Goose Tonic w/ extra lime.. . That is how you blow a hundred dollars...LA Style.
