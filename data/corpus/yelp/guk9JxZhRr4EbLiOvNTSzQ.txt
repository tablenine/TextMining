Category: Dim Sum
So if the idea of eating dim sum until you just burst into flame, explode and die ever crossed your mind - well, you never know, right? It *might* be a possibility in a parallel world, and you have to keep your options open - Phoenix is definitely THE place to go.. . Because with such a name, you can rest assured that you will be brought back to live. Which is a definite plus.. (If mythology is not your forte, you may at least know about the one in Harry Potter. Otherwise, well, my advice to you is to go out a bit, read books, watch movies and GET A LIFE.). . I didn't exactly go to such extremes last Saturday - I am good at self-containing around people. Had I been alone, things would have been slightly different but I have a lady-like reputation to keep. So I kept the lazy susan moving, picked a few items here and there and did a pretty good job at (moderately) stuffing my face without being noticed.. . Traditional fare, all good (even though the custard rolls were a little too dry) and fairly priced.. . Perks:. - service, efficient, fast, smiling.. - huge dining room, split in two by a bar. - rocking view of Chicago skyline. . Open daily for dim sum for lunch, and during the week for dinner. If you can avoid coming on a Saturday, all the better because parking is just i-m-p-o-s-s-i-b-l-e.. Don't forget to stop at Saint's Alp downstairs on your way out.. Repeat as often as necessary.
