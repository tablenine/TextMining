Today was my first time here and I loved it. We walked in and were greeted by a sweet hostess and seated right away. Our waitress was at our table in a minute introducing herself and taking our drink orders. She was cheerful and friendly. Food was great. I had always heard of this place and was so excited to be there. Â Awesome experience. I'll be back.
