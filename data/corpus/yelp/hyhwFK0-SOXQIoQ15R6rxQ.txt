I'm sorry--since when does a restaurant have a slow line outside on one of the coldest night's of the year?  Stand in line?  For a restaurant?  Outside???  What is this? HYDE!!!!????  I've had drinks only here in the past and it was nice ambience.  Don't go here past 10 on a Friday or Saturday unless you want to chance waiting in line like a bunch of lambs.
