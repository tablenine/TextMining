Oh man does this family know how to make some awesome crawfish boil!  I just back from New Orleans for the French Quarter Festival and thought, "No way could a place in Atlanta match what I had in NOLA."  I was dead wrong.  After reading reviews about Crawfish Shack, I decided to give it a try.  Not someplace I'd want to sit down and eat (only three small tables) but the guy who served was super nice and he definitely knew how to cook crawfish.  He even let me try a few of the little suckers before I bought five pounds.  Not too spicy, not too salty, and not too sweet.  Oh, and the Cha Gio (Vietnamese crispy egg rolls) were awesome as well.  I'll definitely be back.
