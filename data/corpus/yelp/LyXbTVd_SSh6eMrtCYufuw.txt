I was looking for the strawberry shortcake that another reviewer wrote about but it wasn't on the menu. After I just ordered the strawberry shortcake malt i discovered it was to the side of the cash register. :( Oh well. The strawberry shortcake malt was decent. The strawberry sherbert scoop was hard to reach and may have not been worth the effort. I think the cookie? crumbs they put on top was hard and it felt like i was chewing fat/butter. My friend got a simple scoop of banana ice cream and that was really good. Â I wish they had .5 star ratings because I would give it a 3.5 more than a 4. But i'll adjust my rating after i go and try their strawberry shortcake cake and blue velvet cake.. . Edit: YUMS! Their Blue Velvet cake is as good as it was hyped up to be. Sweet but tangy with blueberries in the cake. Delicious! I almost ate the entire thing. I also tried their sandwiches, the prosciutto and provolone was decent, better than the media noche (kind of salty). But come here for the desserts! I tried their sweet corn ice cream but it sucked. The blood orange sorbet was good, not too sweet and tasted like grapefruit to me but my friend said it tasted like blood oranges to him. But you can ask for a sample of their ice cream. This place is YUMS!
