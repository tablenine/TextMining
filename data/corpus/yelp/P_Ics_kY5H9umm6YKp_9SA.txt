I went here last night with my son. It's neat and small, overall it's a nice restaurant. I ordered the onion rings and french fries with cheese (both were not good). It was huge but it nasty. I mean, compare to McDonald's fries, its much better. The burger was fine, but I recommend Johnny Rockets. I doubt that I would go here again. I really don't like it.
