Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
Honestly this place wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for a few serious annoyances. . . 1. Our table was rocking back and forth so in an attempt to fix it I took some sugar packets (as i've seen done in many places) to stuff under the side that was not even. A staff member came up to me with some serious attitude about wasting sugar packets and how they have special things for that. Really? Wasting sugar packets? It was a total of 3 sugar packets. For the prices at hamburger mary's they shouldn't be so stingy. . . 2. My boyfriend and I both got burger. Mine was nothing great by any means but his was really fatty and the meat quality was pretty bad. He felt sick the rest of the day. . . 3. There is way too much going on with the menu, I couldn't even focus on one page. . . One thing that I did like was the green to go packaging and other environmentally friendly stuff around. That's about all I liked.
