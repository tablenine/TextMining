Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Who woulda thunk it.  Chicken and waffles - the perfect breakfast marriage.  It's my unwritten mission to convert all those who have not experienced Roscoe's to chicken and waffle fanatics.. . My only complaint about Roscoe's is that it takes me forever and a day to decide on my sides - how does one narrow down the choices when your faced with cornbread, mac and cheese, grits, red beans and greens?  If my stomach would allow it, I'd have a feast with it all!. . The staff always makes you feel like you've just walked into their home and they're more than happy to serve you up a plate of goodness.  "Hey hon, pull up a seat, here's some coffee, stay a while and relax."   That kinda vibe.  . . I don't live in LA, but along with Houston's for the ribs, we make it a point to stop by Roscoe's for the chicken and waffles every time we're in town.  Until the day that Roscoe's decides to expand it's reach to San Diego, a two hour car ride will have to do to satiate my favorite breakfast cravings.
