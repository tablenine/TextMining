Came here tonight to enjoy an anniversary with my girlfriend.  We were really looking forward to this after seeing the reviews here and it lived up to its hype.  We did the prix fixe menu and I started out with the Beef Tartare, which was topped with a 24K gold foil wrapped egg, it was delicious, the beef was so tender.  For my main course I went with the Venison that had a cabbage wrap filled with more cabbage and chicken, an amazing dish, the venison was cooked perfectly, and melted in your mouth.  For dessert we both went with the Chocolate Bar which included excellent coffee ice cream and caramel mousse, just fabulous.  An overall great experience, if you can I suggest that you come here, you won't regret it.
