blue velvet cake. it's friggin blue. i'll drive from the westside out here to get this smurf engineered (if not made of smurf) cake. Where else can you get a blue velvet cake? And they've got tons of other cookies and sweets. Cupcakes in ice cream cones. Ice cream. And me being a sandwich fiend, they've got a media noche sandwich that i've been wanting to try to but it's always too late. that's my only knock on this place is that it closes way too early. it'd be a perfect hang out spot. can't miss on the blue velvet though.. . you'll even get a blue surprise a couple hours later.
