This is my spot!!! This is where me and my friends go on Sundays and have margaritas. The patio is always packed whenever we go. We always go to the one on Ponce. Usually when I go I always get the Super Burrito (chicken) combo or the chicken fajita quesadillas. Along with my frozen Texas strawberry margarita. I have never had a bad experience here and I have been going here for almost 2 years. Hell, actually in my profile picture on here I am at El Azteca on Easter Sunday this year celebrating my bday. And as you can tell I had a nice little buzz goin on by this time. Lol.
