Come here on Thursdays where you can get a huge &amp; delicious pizza for just $4.  I always take half of mine home for leftovers the next day.  The outdoor seating is awesome in the summer, but it can be a long wait to get a table.  People-watching is five stars - very eclectic crowd and music.  . . Actually, I don't know why I don't go there more often.
