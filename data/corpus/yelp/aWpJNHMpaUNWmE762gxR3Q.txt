I was blown away by my meal on Tuesday night. Literally, for the first time all year and the first time in a long time.. The goat cheese and crostini appetizer, is really good, but really standard. Cafe Ba Ba Reeba has it, among other places. I guess there is not much you can do with it to change it up. The only thing about it was they gave you four pieces of crostinin with it. Really? Because figure at least two people are ordering this as an appetizer...so two pieces to devour a huge hunk of goat cheese and tomato sauce? The bus boy was on to us and brought more bread over; nice considering our server was M.I.A for the entire time we were there.. The insalata con uova (Italian for egg) was hands down, the best salad I have ever had in my life. Argula, lemon-oil vinegarette, light parmesan shavings, grilled asparagus and a fried egg. . I must have looked like I was eating my last meal to the surronding tables, because I inhaled this salad. It was freakin awesome. My other two gal pals completely agreed. I mean, wow. Still thinking about it two days later.... I ordered the rigatoni something, pretty good. Nothing to go on about, but it was good. They were nice about the sans meat substitution, which is always appreciated.. The torta lava and the tiramisu were both fantastic as well; this place just all-around has great food. Our server? In a word, absent. He was very attentive to his other tables, but seemed to have a sight problem, because he would rush past our table without stopping. The tip we left, 100 percent belonged to the bus boy. . Cute bartender too! Â :)
