With this review I'm going to take a moment and venture back in time to the days when I used to eat meat.... (about 9 months ago)..... I feel like a crack fiend talking about my days as an addict.... . My boyfriend and I had been wanting to eat at Pink's forever but refused to wait in that god awful line. We happened to drive by one day when the line wasn't too bad and we jumped at the opportunity. . I ordered the spicy polish dog with bacon..... sweet baby jesus....I can still remember how amazing it was. If I didn't grow a conscience I'd be standing in that line for one right now.... The tastes still drive me crazy at night and have me thinking, "Will the sweet piggies know if I just eat one of their cousins?? How about just a bite??". But alas....I am sticking with my new vegetarian lifestyle. . I heard they had a veggie dog so I'm going to have to go back and try it....I know it won't be the same though..... . Oh, and their fries are delicious too!
