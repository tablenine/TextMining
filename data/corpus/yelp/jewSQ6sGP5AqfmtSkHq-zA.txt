Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
If Moody's and I were located in California where I could sit in the patio on every visit I would give it 4 stars. The inside is too musty, too dark, too hot and too dirty. . . The burger is good (Moody Blue Cheese Burger!!!) and the bun is generic. Onion rings are awesome. Beer is moderately priced and not extensive but does the trick. . . But really, the patio is what keeps me coming back. It's the perfect place to sit in the summer. . . Also, their menu says to go to their website for coupons so... do that.
