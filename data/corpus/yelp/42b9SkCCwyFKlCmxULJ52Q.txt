- chicken tikka masala ($6.85) - 3 stars.  very good flavor, and slightly spicy, but the consistency was too soupy and oily.  I prefer the creamier, more viscous curries at Cafe Bombay and Saravana Bhavan.  The chicken was sparse, surprisingly dry, tough, and overcooked.  Also, the portion was relatively small and NOT filling.  . . - saffron rice ($2.99) - 4 stars.  fragrant.  good complement to the masala.  This was a large portion.. . - Chicken 65 ($6.39) - 4.25 stars.  Excellent.  Tender, succulent, medium-spicy chicken nuggets.  Not greasy even though it's breaded and fried.  It goes well with the sweet chutney sauce and the yogurt sauce that comes with this entree.  The portion is small, but filling for me at least.  (I ordered this on my second visit to Zyka.) . . I wish they would use paper plates instead of all that styrofoam.. . Overall, 3.75 stars, but I still am NOT a fan of Zyka's curry, specifically the chicken tikka masala.
