WowZers,. This is one of the best places I've been to for dumplings.. What can I say that hasn't been said.... The service is the most remarkable thing that I think of when people ask me about the place. A very polite staff and great service, but like many of these types of eateries, be ready to wait a long wail for sitting. Its just that popular.
