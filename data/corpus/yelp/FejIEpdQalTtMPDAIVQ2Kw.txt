Eat It OR Beat It?. **EAT IT!!**. . So I've heard and read about the rave reviews for Tender Greens and in fact, the second location in West L.A. prompted me to try this place out especially since it's walking distance from where I work at Sony!. Upon arrival with my fellow co-workers, the lines already began to form with locals! Ordering was easy, you order first and pay at the end of the counter. . . Flat-Iron Steak Salad ($10.50):. Talk about fresh ingredients and lots of flavor! The steak (medium well/ shank cut), came right off the grill (you can see them make everything). And the greens with very light sauce was very delicious. . . CONCLUSION:. If you have a love for salads and are willing to spend $10 on salads, I say go for it! However, if you don't and aren't willing to spend $10... I say try it anyways! The salad portions are very generous and very delicious, you're bound to be full and happy at the end! :)
