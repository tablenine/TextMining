Disappointing.  All the right signs are there.  The menu looks good.  There are hookahs, occasional belly dancers, and a good lunch deal.  I guess the sitting-on-the-floor thing could go either way, but it seemed like a good sign.  However, I thought the food was kind of dull.  Not that it was offensively bad or anything -- perfectly adequate, and I'd go again for a big hookah get-together on an off night.  I've tried it three times now, each time thinking I must've just been on an off food night, but no dice -- not much flavor at all.
