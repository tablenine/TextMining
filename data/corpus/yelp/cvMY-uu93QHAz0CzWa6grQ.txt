The meat is good, the chicken could be juicier but hey, its a good place to eat especially if you can get a seat outside.  Wish they had a better beer selection.  The service is quick and friendly.  If you want ribs without hassle this would be your place.  You'll leave satisfied and a bit stained from some finger lickin' sauce.
