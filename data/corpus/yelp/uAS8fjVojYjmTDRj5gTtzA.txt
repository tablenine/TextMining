I did the Special #2 where if you finish the entire bowl you get your picture on the wall.  . . It went in burning.. . It went out burning.. . My six pack abs transformed into a 5 month preg stomach in a little less than half an hour.. . But I finished it, and squeezed out a weak smile for the camera. (:  You can find the picture labeled "Dean the MACHINE!!!". . Ramen is good, and ditto with the rice dishes!
