Ok, I hate to do this and I am sure most of Atlanta won't agree with me but I'm not a fan. I am a native and I have been here several times. Last night, I joined the mom and the grandmother for our weekly dinner and I just didn't think it was all that great. I had the scallops, brussel sprouts and the loaded smashed potato's. The scallops were decent and the sprouts had zero taste...ZERO!! My water tasted better. Not only that, after picking up grandma from her Independent Living Facility the Colonnade was even more depressing. Oh , and the portions are small. I feel like these types of restaurants always give big portions, isn't that kinda their MO? I am going to stop trashing this place because it is similar to trashing the Braves or the Varsity and being from here, I don't want to have too many enemies. I'll be back here at some point I'm sure, maybe when I am 80 but next time I am checking out the strip joint next door first.
