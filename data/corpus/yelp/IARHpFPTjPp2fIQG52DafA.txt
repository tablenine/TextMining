De Cero. You wooed me with your promise of duck, shrimp, catfish, chicken mole, and beef tenderloin tacos. Quite good.. . Your goat cheese tamale set my mouth on fire with the hot of the salsa calmed by the cool of the cheese. . . Your chips and guac cooled my angry head from driving in some crazy traffic just to get to you. . . So what went wrong, you ask? Simple. The service. The bartender could not be gotten no matter what we did. Yes it was busy- but there were three of you back there and no one could wait on us? Really? And then when we finally did get a drink we ordered the next one right away for fear we would never see you again. . . Once seated- our server was better- attentive and helpful - and she made some great suggestions from the menu, . . Know if you go it is NOISY in the place- lots of solid surfaces with little to cut down the noise so my suggestion would be to grab one of the bistro tables out front where it was definitely easier to hear your friends. . . Valet parking is $10 or on a weeknight you will probably be able to find parking on one of the side streets. . . My advice? Order take out and enjoy those amazing tacos in the comfort of your own home where the only one who has to get you a margarita is you!
