To start, I had the charred baby octopus and it was very good! This is a nice date place, although our waiter was a little off, we definitely made the most of it! I had the sturgeon which was fantastic and I definitely tried my best to show my date I knew what that meant (although I had no idea, I knew it was some kind of fish? lol). Try it! Just look at the menu before hand. : )
