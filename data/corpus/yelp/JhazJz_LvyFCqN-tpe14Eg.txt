Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The best fried chicken I've had outside of the South.  . . The fried chicken is truly heavenly at Roscoe's.  The meat is tender.  The batter is just crispy enough and it doesn't fall off the chicken.  And the batter is tasty.. . The waffles are also something special.  I think they are the best waffles I've ever had.. . Roscoe's gets way too crowded on Sundays after church.  I always avoid it on Sundays.
