I had dinner there with my girlfriends. I read about it in the Dine Out Magazine, and it appealed to me so I wanted to try it out.. . The server was nice. . The decor was pretty neat. . The food was only mediocre..  I mean the price is very cheap. . But nothing really memorable. . No complains. . We had the heaven beef (not recommended), Â lettuce wrap, crab meat salad, calamari, and fish snacks.. . It was all only mediocre, wouldn't go back, because nothing memorable and out of my vicinity.
