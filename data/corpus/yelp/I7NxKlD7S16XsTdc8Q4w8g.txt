Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Growing up not very far from here, I used to go weekly, with my family, from the time I was very little until I was less little than that but more little than I am now. And then, in the early 90's, the Times rated it the best pizza in LA. The multi-hour waits rolled in and I haven't really been back since. . Back in the day, they had great thin crust pizza and Â an authentic fake Italian ambiance, with red and white checkered plastic tablecloths and pitchers of Moretti. I was here recently and it never crossed my mind to review it...but then the damn Globe ran a piece that mentioned that Barack Obama came here in his Oxy days...so now you'll really never be able to go. Shame, isn't it. Hindsight being what it is, one could say that Casa Bianca was the first casualty in the Eagle Rock gentrification process. Pour one out.
