I'm always a big fan of brunches, especially the ones that can last you all day!  They have wonderful and generous portions.  . . I always fancy crepes, and they've got a great peach cobbler crepe.  Pecan waffle with banana is also fabulous.. . My only thumbs down here is it gets really noisy... when we went in groups, we ended up always shouting at each other.  . . I would recommend a visit before 10 am on weekends, else the wait can be very long (upto 30-45 mins towards lunch time).
