I am a native and resident of the area to this restaurant, however, when I go there, it really makes me feel like I just don't fit in with the "hip suburban yuppie" crowd.  I don't get what all the fuss is about.. . I've been here several times because my mom really likes this place.  Here's a description:. . First, you pull up and realize there is nowhere to park because there are only about 10 parking spaces.  They sometimes have valet, but come on, this is a taco restaurant.  If you manage to find a parking spot, it's going to be next to the worst smelling dumpster that will really get your appetite up.  I just park down the street at an abandoned office suite.  If you arrive during peak lunch/dinner hours, then be prepared to wait for a while.  I have been during an off peak hour and made the mistake of telling the host that I was waiting on another person.  So, he refused to sit me at a table until they arrived, even though there were plenty of free tables.  Yeah, way to treat customers.  The place is very small and cramped, which is not really my style when I want to enjoy a meal.  A lot of reviewers rave about the food.  Since I have been here numerous times, I've tried a lot on the menu and can't rate any of the meals as great.  They do at least make a great margarita, which warrants at least two stars. . Am I really that out of touch with my neighbors?  I just don't understand why everyone raves about this place.
