El Cid may be getting 4 stars due to nostalgia, as my sister took me here once years ago when she lived in Chicago - but in all honesty judging by my and Theron's trip there last night, it deserves it.. .  The atmosphere is fun, colorful, and I was particularly pleased to encounter a mariachi band as we rounded the corner to the upstairs dining area. We sat a cross from the bar in a cozy, warmly lit nook at high tables and, while it did take *forever* for our food to come out, our orders were carried out to a T.  We both got the combination plate -  I with a chicken enchilada with verde sauce, a 'tostada' without meat, and a chicken soft taco.  The tostada should have been served on a separate plate and even come out sooner, as the shell was no longer crispy upon arrival.  The rice was a bit sweet for me but the beans were decent, the chicken meat was good - what you would expect of a typical Mexican place - and the enchilada was delightful, covered with white cheese.. . Theron enjoyed his 'quesadilla' but in my opinion doubling a corn tortilla and folding them over a bunch of white cheese is not a quesadilla. But, he liked it so who am I to judge? ;). . We also ordered a fish taco - as everyone raved about them. I thought the flavor was really good (my friend liked it a lot) and loved the use of cilantro, but could only eat a couple bites because it was way too salty for me.  . . Let me also state that after initial wariness, the margarita I ordered (Herradura, cointreau, and fresh lime juice) was made exceptionally well. It was pleasant to drink but had an underlying strength to it that made waiting on our food to arrive much more fun. :) . . The waitress also brought out gardinaire mix of pickled and oily jalapenos, carrots, and onions you get in some taquerias for me, since I love spicy food. All in all a really pleasant dining experience.
