Restaurant: Spacca Napoli
Category: Pizza
A recent dinner at Spacca Napoli for a group of girlfriends and me turned out to be a huge success - not only did we get our yumtastic pizzas in 3 minutes flat (yes!  I actually mean 3 minutes!), but we had the amazing desserts (risotto gelato, spumoni, tiramisu, and a scrumpdiddlyumptious Nutella filled crepe-y thing) to share, and left so satisfied!  The pizzas are huge and good for a group to share; we had our pick and all chose different ones to savor!  Our server was also nice as can be and let us take our sweet time to chat, spill the beans, and talk girl talk!  The restaurant itself is also away from all the hustle and bustle of the main Andersonville streets and is located in a quiet industrial corridor, and parking is plentiful.  Plus, for all the tasty grub you get, you don't empty your wallet.  A great find!
