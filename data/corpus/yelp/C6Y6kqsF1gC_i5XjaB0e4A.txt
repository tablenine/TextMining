Category: Mexican
Ok been seeing the commercials and finally had a moment to check it out. I think it's an odd place the ordering system is quick but it throws you off, next I like the menu but it's inside and hard to see, next, i don't dig being being charged for cheese, add it in to the price. So 2.30 for a taco with cheese, I think it's a tad greasy, but the shells are super crunchy, I like that, I like the cheese you do get, I also ordered a beef tamale the outer part was good, but not great like lulu's. But it's only 2.30 the chips and salsa was very good IMO. Â 6.60 for two tacos and one tamale I think it was good enough not the best I've ever had but good and it did have a unique flavor so a solid 3 stars I'd go if I was in Culver City
