Ok - so I'm sure by now you've read all 501 reviews on the Griddle, but if you're visiting just my page to see reviews... THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES TO EAT!!!  I highly recommend "kickin' and screamin" breakfast tacos, bluberry pancakes, apple &amp; cinnamon pancakes, their mild french press coffee, their french toast (its addictive), basically its all good!. . The waiters are waaay cute.  The waitresses are hot s*x.  Not that should matter, but nice scenery with a good meal is always nice.. . There is parking in the back behind by Rite-Aid.  . . Yes, it is ALWAYS that busy.  Be prepared to wait in line....for a very long time.. . This is a good place to spot a celeb or two (but please don't go there just for that).  . . The prices are reasonable for LA standards.  If you're a tourist from the midwest reading this, you might find them to be a little overpriced - afterall you are in LA!
