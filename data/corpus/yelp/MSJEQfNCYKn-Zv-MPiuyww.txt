Bourgeois Pig Cafe, you're awesome! Your sandwiches are delicious and establishment cozy. Although you pay for the quality, it's completely worth it.. . I tried both a the Sun Also Rises and Chicken Parm Panini and they definitely delivered. Their baked goods looked extremely tempting, but I resisted. If only I lived closer, I could eat here instead of Potbelly.. . Highly recommended and anxious to go back!
