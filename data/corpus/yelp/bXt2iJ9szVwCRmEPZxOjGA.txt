It's been a good - oh, I'd say - ten years since I last ate at this classic joint.  At that time I didn't afford myself the honor of munching on a  french-dip RB sangwich, so this place went unacknowledged by my potent palate for the decade.  Since moving back to the home base, I told myself I was going to go, and this time give all my effort into throwing the french-dip down my gullet.. . One word: satisfying.. . It was tasty in it's simplicity.  Bread, cheese, meat, bread. Then dip.  What keeps me from plopping a 5-er down is the long line(they can't help that) and the non-fixings of the sangwich.  However, they do have a grip of side dishes, and I hear they are quite good accompaniments.  But the sandwich was the headliner, and what made it so was the juicy slices of lamb.  Most patrons don't steer away from the classic RB, but I tell you, the lamb kills. Slays. Assassinates. Nukes.  Goddamn asteroids the alternatives. So a 4 star it deserves based on the lamb itself.  That, and the fact that they have Fat Tire on draft.
