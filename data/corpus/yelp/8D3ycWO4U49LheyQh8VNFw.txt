Bari is an excellent place to go for Italian sandwiches and foodstuffs.  . . This storefront grocery is tiny, and at lunchtime, it's packed.  But, if you come during off hours and peruse the aisles, you'll find many a delicious Italian treasure.  Homemade giardiniera, pickled eggplant, fig syrup, and San Marzano tomatoes?  Yes, please.. . Bari makes a mean Italian sub, packed with many kinds of meat, toppings, and giardiniera.  My favorite, though, is the Italian veggie.  Fear not vegetarians, this is not a lame afterthought of a sandwich.  The Italian veggie has the house made pickled eggplant, which is tangy and has a nice toothsome bite to it, as well as lettuce, tomatoes, provolone cheese, and vinegar and oil.  Served on fresh baked D'Amato's bread, this is the veggie sandwich of kings.  The tangy eggplant, the rich olive oil and the creamy cheese come together to make this one of my favorite sandwiches in Chicago.
