Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
Tender Greens is an unlikely spot for a carnivore like myself, but I must confess: The food is delicious. . . In celebration of President's Day (or whatever other excuse we could come up with), we decided to take a quick trip to Culver City for lunch. The menu is simple yet fresh. I ordered a flank steak sandwich with spinach and goat cheese salad. Once you place your order, you stand in a line to pay. In the time you wait in line, they make the food for you. The kitchen staff is super-efficient and since you get to watch everything they do, you know exactly what goes into your food. . . I have had better steak sandwiches, but this one was definitely above average. The salad, although very simple, was quite flavorful. Some may consider it a little bit pricey at $10.50 pre-tax; but compared to the usual Brentwood lunch spots that I'm used to, the price seemed fair.
