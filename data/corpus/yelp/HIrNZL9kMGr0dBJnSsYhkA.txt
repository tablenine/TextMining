Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
This is a vegetarian, "fresh", California style informal restaurant that is clean, very friendly and pays attention to little things like using ecologically friendly packaging. It is located in the restaurant portion of the new giant strip mall in El Segundo on Sepulveda just north of Rosecrans. I was very surprised to find that this restaurant had so many recent reviews because it appears to be a chain. . . French Fry review: . . The sweetheart fries are a specialty that uses sweet potato fries combined with a chipotle dipping sauce. When I saw the sweet potato fries I prepared myself for experiencing the same taste I have had again and again from the generic frozen ones that seem to be favored by so many restaurants. They probably originated from this frozen variety with a small amount of skin and irregular wide cut. This restaurant has added a (very light) batter which makes them crisper but may detract a little from the flavor. The sauce was actually very good and combined well with the flavor of the fries. . . Overall, These sweet potato fries are pretty generic but are good, particularly when combined with their dipping sauce.
