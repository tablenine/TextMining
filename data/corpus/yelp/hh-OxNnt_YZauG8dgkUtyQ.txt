After being hit with the cacophony of noise as we walked into the poorly-lit cavern of undecorated space, we were shown to our table - nearly in the kitchen. The surly and slow service was matched nicely by the poor quality of food at outrageous prices. If you do find yourself unfortunately trapped here, order the beer cheese soup; it's the only passable food on the menu.. . I'd rather be anywhere else. Â And if you're going for beer, hit Hop City next door and order pizza in; your experience will be light years better!
