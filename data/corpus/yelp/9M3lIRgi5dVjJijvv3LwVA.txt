I don't give 5 stars out lightly.  In fact, this is my first.  But Phillippe's is just that good.  Where else but Los Angeles can you eat at the ORIGINAL birthplace of the French Dip (what? it's not really French?!) for less than $10?  Where the Chinatown ah-gongs sip a great cup of coffee and read their papers next to a table of downtown suits with a full order of sandwiches, poe-ta salad, and pies.  This is one of very few places where you can see this kind of wonderful cross section of  Angelenos - wingtips and steel-toes.  There's not much I can add that a million other reviewers haven't said.  So I'll just say this: the PORK SANDWICH rules!  (I think it's the fattiness that makes it better than the beef.)  . . The lines may seem long, but they move fast.  This is such a great place to meet folks because the tables (including rooms upstairs) and parking are plenty.  Oh, and there is a lovely room in the back that takes you on a trip down memory lane, before the auto industry had not dismantled our rail system... but that's another story.
