i love being wined and dined...when the wining and dining person is worthy of it and knows what he/she is doing.  that's what happened at bone's.  the name sounds like a drama title on hbo or something, but the food here gave me chills to my bones.  the best peppercorn steak EVER!!!  apparently, the person who took us here was a regular and they really treated us like royalties.  even with a reservation, we waited, but hanging around at the bar with ppl twice my age was kinda fun.  when my steak came out too rare, not only did they take my plate, they took all the sides (we ordered a lot, like 7) and brought new ones back so i could eat them at the right temperature with my steak.  not impressed yet?  how about this...they comped all 7 sides.  now that's a service!!!  it's very classy and old money kind of place.
