After one... two or 5 Mai Tai's you just may break out in a renegade sing along to Tongo Hiti's version of my heart will go on...along with a tall Chinese Yelper who's name rhymes with Hames. *wink wink* All in all we had a great night as a bunch of yelpers invaded Trader Vics. This was my second time there and I was not disappointed! As the night went on this place got pretty packed with tourists and natives alike. The bartenders were awesome and efficient with dealing with the crowd, and my hand never emptied of a drink!
