If Gluttony is indeed a cardinal sin, the Tiramisu at the Marietta Diner will cast you off with a smile on your face and desire for more! Their Gyros, however, will leave you quite disappointed...... . Despite being reassured that they really did "carve the meat off" over and over again, first by the waiter and then by someone (manager of some sort?) whose sole purpose was to ask how everything was over &amp; over again....the 6 soggy, wafer-thin, perfectly symmetrical slices told me otherwise. Gone were the crisp &amp; chunky, lop-sided slices reminiscent of true directly carving-from-the-mass-of-meat-turning-upright-grac efully-as-a-ballerina-on-a-fiery-spit I've been accustomed to in Chicago. ='( Accompanied by a handful of equally limp fries and ho-hum "Greek salad", the tzaziki sauce proved to be the saviour of this mundane meal...sad, but true..     However, my companions' breakfast options fared much better: I couldn't help but savor the ginormous french toast and heavenly bacon my friend ordered (Mmm! Bacon!!). My Sister's Omelet was perfectly done (according to her, and the minuscule amount left on her plate), with yet even more praise for the bacon. Lastly, appropriately... we saved the best for last: dessert!. .    The Tiramisu Rocked my world more than a wild night of alcohol &amp;  chemically induced binge of bar-hopping &amp; clubbing......well, maybe not that much-- but it was damn good. The Cheesecake (chocolate/vanilla layers) was also to die for... All in all: Far better than Denny's or I-Hop, but as for the "Mediterranean flair" -- it's been left at the port.. .   Oh, and by the way -- don't look  up at the ceiling while sitting in the front vestibule awaiting your table, as you're likely to either get dripped on in your eye by the A/C condensation, or even worse: see cobwebs lazily draping the swinging light fixture...
