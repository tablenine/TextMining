My first impression was, "It's the famous Kogi truck in everyone's facebook pictures!". . I just had to try it. I've heard that the food was "OK," but with this many reviews, of course I gave in! I like the whole food truck thing, I think it's a genius idea from the creators of Kogi. Once they saw an opportunity and some potential to create a new trend, they jumped on it! And hello, Korean food/Mexican food fusion? I was waiting for something like this.. . I always eat a combination of Korean food and Mexican food at family parties, half my family being Korean and the other half Mexican. So why couldn't I think of wrapping basically a Korean meal inside a tortilla? That sounds good any time of the day, but especially for late night eats, sounds amazing!. . The lasting impression? "I won't go out of my way to follow their tweets, but hey if it's in the area, yeah I'm down!"
