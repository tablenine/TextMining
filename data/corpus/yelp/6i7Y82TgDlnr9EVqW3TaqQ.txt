Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
Hainam chicken rice is decent. Chicken isn't as tender and rice isn't as flavorful. I wouldn't consider it authentic but they are consistent with their food. The salad tastes good but it is a bit on the heavy side. I definitely wouldn't recommend most of the items on their menu except their specialties. Most places that serve Hainam chicken are hole in the walls so its hard to find one that sort of resembles a restaurant which is why Savoy Kitchen fits the bill and maybe why it is so popular.
