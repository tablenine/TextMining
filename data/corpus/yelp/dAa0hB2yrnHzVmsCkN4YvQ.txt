Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
i love fogo de chao. their filet mignon and lamb chops are amazing. they were slowly cooked to juicy perfection. i ate three servings of lamb chops by myself, on top of everything else. their cheese bread, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas are also good, but why waste your stomach? the salad bar was pretty good too, but i didn't eat too much of it.. . my mouth is watering now. too bad it's so expensive, otherwise i would go back this weekend.
