My friends and I came here after an art/music show (+ open bar) nearby a huge craving for comfort food after getting buzzed.  Seeing the usual at least 30 minutes waitline at nearby Daikokuya, we opted instead to go here since we weren't eager to wait, and we gotta use the restroom BAD!. . Suehiro serves a variety of homestyle japanese fare - some combination meals, donburi (rice bowls), nabemono (pot dishes) along with some noodle plates and few sushi rolls.. . I got the oroshi soba ($8) with a gyoza add-on ($2.50 for 4).  Both were pretty good, the gyoza was crispy and not too greasy/salty, and the soba had lots of grated daikon and tempura flakes and was in a light-but-flavorful broth.. . I also tried a few of my friends' dishes, including their ramen (she ordered miso broth but it came out as a shoyu, and even then it was kind of bland) and the sukiyaki (good flavor, the meat could've been more tender).  So yea, somewhere between OK and good (and I would give 3.5 stars for this place if I had the chance) and definitely worth considering to go if I'm craving some homestyle cooking at a reasonable price.
