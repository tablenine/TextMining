I keep going for the ambiance...something about the sawdusty floor and spartan decor upstairs that tickles my fancy.. . I would like to have a cup of au jus though with my meat. But the cheap coffee more than makes up for it. It's really too bad they got rid of those brown mugs! Thankfully in a move of prescience my crazy mom slipped one into her bag years back. Â . . For all it's minor shortcomings, it's still my favorite place to go downtown before or after a Dodgers game!!
