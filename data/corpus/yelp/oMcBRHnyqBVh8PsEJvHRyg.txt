arrived at 930 for breakfast...beat the late morning rush (after 10am). ordered quickly...staff very friendly. two people, two omelets and a latte...28 bucks sans tip..a bit too pricey. latte took a little too long for the lack of people waiting. food came out too late...it was probably sitting in the kitchen for 5 minutes  before it was brought to us. if it was piping hot i would have gone 3 1/2 stars maybe 4. omelet was average, not as good as square one or toast. potatoes were spiced properly but not as hot as would have liked. . come for the morning atmosphere leave your pickier foodie friends at home
