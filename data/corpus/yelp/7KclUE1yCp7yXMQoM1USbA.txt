First, I'm a southerner by virtue of my father's side of the family and lived in the middle south for 12 years.. Second, the fries are just fries. the cole slaw is below average, not southern style, the pulled pork is good, not excellent, the beets are good, not southern style,  the corn pudding is good, but it's east coast amish - southerners don't eat puddings made from vegetables!  my gran was Mennonite so i know about meat and veggie puddings.. Third, it is cheap with easy parking.. Finally, when we left we smelled like a McDs all the way home.
