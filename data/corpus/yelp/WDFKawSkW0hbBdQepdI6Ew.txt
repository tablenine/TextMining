lets see. . Cheap delicious food, right around the corner from my crib?. suggestions: more or less everything but here are my personal favourites. . pasta rosada= creamy tomato sauce adorned by very delicious noodles, with grilled chicken on top? bizzzommmbbb. . bossa salada- ( i ditch the gorgonzola for feta) get it with chicken or seabass (or whatever fish that they have) - bizzzommb x2. . there main shrimp dish is bizzzzommmmbbbb ( sauteed shrimp with sauteed veggies on the side) bizzzommmmbbb. . and the portions are huge that i always send the bread back! so if you see a handsome jewish guy yelling at the waiter to take the bread away from the table, dont feel too shy to send a beer my way!. . achallah
