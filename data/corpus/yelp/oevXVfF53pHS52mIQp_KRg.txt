Restaurant: The Swallow at the Hollow
Category: Barbeque
Atmosphere is nice and the music has always been great the 3 times we've been there when someone was performing.. . The ribs were excellent but my wife's pulled pork was fatty and stringy.  . . They do have a policy that your whole party has to be there before you can be seated.   This policy is fine but when my mother complained (there were about 10 tables open at 4:45 on sunday) the owner got in her face and told her "Well you can just leave if you don't like it!"  This was yesterday on mother's day! of all days to get in a customer's face this "Big man" tried to intimidate my mother on mother's day!
