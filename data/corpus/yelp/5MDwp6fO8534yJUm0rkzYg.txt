Oinkster. Yeah, it's not a name that seems to appeal to the health cautious but let me tell you, even on a diet, I'd eat here any time. This old converted wiener joint now serves up burgers, strangely odd fries, shakes that are something else and pulled pork sandwiches to kill for. I say kill because you don't want to die, you just want to enjoy them.. . The Ubi shake... Oh my goodness, it taste like purple. Delicious delicious purple. Be aware that this thing is something that can't be shared. It's going to be gobbled up by one person only. . . Happy Hour here offers some great deals on pitchers of beer and pulled pork tacos. So for those of you who feel a whole pulled pork sandwich may be a little much, there's a nice alternative that's a bit cheaper. . . On to the pulled pork sandwich. That is the way to go. Forget about the pastrami. That sucker is dried up and while good, still not as good as the pulled pork. Even the burger is delicious here. . . A new favorite place that is a gem in the Eagle rock area. If you haven't been here, make your plans to go here early and go here often!
