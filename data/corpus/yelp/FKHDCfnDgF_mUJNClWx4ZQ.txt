Thanks yelpers!  We are new to the neighborhood and checked this place out last night based on reviews.  Service was impeccable.  Our waitress was attentive and consistently checked if we were enjoying our food throughout the meal.  The rainbow roll was very yummy and fresh, along with the other sushi we ordered, and the free cheesecake was a nice touch.  We'll definitely be back and next time we'll BYOB!
