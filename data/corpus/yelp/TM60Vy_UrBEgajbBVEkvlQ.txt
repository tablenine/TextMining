Restaurant: Mediterranean Grill
Category: Greek
After trying out the Mediterranean Grill on North Decatur Road, I have become obsessed with this low-key dive. Last night, I swung by the Midtown location, worrying that I wouldn't be able to find it, as other Yelpers have deemed it hard-to-find. But luckily, the glowing sign beckoned me to a small strip of shops just before Kanuga Street. . . I ordered the same thing I had at the North Decatur eatery: the grilled jumbo shrimp entree. The spices on the shrimp seemed even stronger and more delicious this time. The house salad (real romaine lettuce, tomato and cucumber) stood out with a simple red wine vinegar-based dressing. Plus, I added a kick to my pita bread with yummy tzatziki sauce.. . This place is cheap and delicious -- and makes me want to visit Greece.
