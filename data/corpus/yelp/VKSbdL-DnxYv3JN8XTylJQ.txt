Restaurant: FLIP Burger Boutique
Category: Burgers
I went here with a few girls for a girls' night out. The drinks and food are overpriced for what you get. I was surprised to see an expensive fashion food restaurant so far from Buckhead. . .  The burgers are "gourmet" (translation: small &amp; expensive). We were still hungry after we ate and we sent to another restaurant. With what we paid for these overpriced Krystal burgers, we could have had surf &amp; turf at Outback!
