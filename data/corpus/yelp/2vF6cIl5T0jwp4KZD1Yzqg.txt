Restaurant: El Cid 2
Category: Mexican
A good friend of mine introduced me to El Cid 2 before the additions.  We went recently and were surprised and happy at them.  The place looks great!. . I've always enjoyed El Cid.  I think the food, while not pushing the boundaries of Mexican food, is pretty darn good.  I'm a huge fan of the Chimichanga but that's my tendency for fried food talking.. . Is the service great?  I'm pretty forgiving since I'm a server and understand the complexity and difficulty of doing such a job.  While my last experience wasn't stellar it was just fine.  I got my food.  I got my drinks (though no pitchers on the top floor!), and I enjoyed it.  . . Look, go to this place.  Its good.  Heck, its great.  You want great Mexican food in Chicago but not sure where to start?  Go here.  It has become a staple of mine and I wish I lived closer to go to it more.
