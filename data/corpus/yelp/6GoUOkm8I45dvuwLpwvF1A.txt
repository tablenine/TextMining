We stopped in today for lunch..arriving just before the lunch rush. Seated by the owner and waited on promptly. Rubin, the owner and namesake of the dish I ordered ("Rubin's Reuben"), is a great guy and showed his genuine appreciation for your business. We saw him not once but three times give complimentary samples from his awesome menu. . . I look forward to my next visit for breakfast (which is served all day!)...
