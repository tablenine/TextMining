Category: Pizza
Very high end European style bistro with surprisingly reasonable prices for the quality of food they serve. Portions are a little smaller, but still filling. I tried everything on the menu so far and I can honestly say EVERYTHING is very, very good. Wide open windows and an open floorplan really give this place a very sophisticated vibe. It almost feels like you're in London, before you notice some crazy transient out on the street.
