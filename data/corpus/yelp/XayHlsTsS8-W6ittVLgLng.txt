It is rare for me to venture into midtown, but I stumbled in here last night with a couple of friends.  It was a Saturday evening, the SEC championship game at The Georgia Dome had ended an hour or so before and the GT/Clemson ACC Championship was being shown on TV, but our party of six was immediately seated.. . I was happy with all the non-food details - clean, comfy and friendly waitstaff that was attentive and polite.  I loved that it had good lighting and floor-to-ceiling windows that let in light from the street.  It's not bright, but you won't have to squint to see the person next to you.  The only downside was the acoustics - if you want to converse at a normal level, and you've got more than four people, I wouldn't recommend.. . Three stars due to food.  Everything on the menu sounds scrumptious but everything didn't turn out that way.  We had black bean hummus as an appetizer which was decent.  I had the Seared Tuna sandwich served on focaccia with peppers, arugula and I believe an olive-mayo concoction.  The result was strange - I wouldn't order it again.  Another friend got tacos that were underwhelming.. . The Pub Burger is served on an English Muffin and was delicious, and I would definitely recommend the Spicy Cucumber side dish.. . I'll go back someday to see if their menu changes.  Until then, three stars.
