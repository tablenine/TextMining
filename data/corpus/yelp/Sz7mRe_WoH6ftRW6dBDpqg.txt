Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This is the only place I totally crave for ramen since theirs come with a kick. Usually, I get a Level 2 or 3, which has just enough kick without the feeling of being tortured and having extra uncalled for spice, such as dripping sweat being added to my soup. Â Definitely worth a try if you are near LA's Japantown.
