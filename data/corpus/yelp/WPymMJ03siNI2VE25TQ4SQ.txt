I went to this place one night with a few friends.  My friend and I had to double check to make sure it was the correct place because there are no signs, just a half-moon flag outside.  . . Inside the decor was nice (we were downstairs).  The service was great and everybody was very attentive, but for the price point the food was not on par.  It was good, yes, and our sake ($68/bottle) was nice, but I've had better food a few blocks over at the amazing Go Japan.  . . If you are looking to be seen or impress somebody with fun decor then go here, otherwise look for something more authentic.
