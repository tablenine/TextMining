Goshdammit the drinks are good here. I mean, yeah, you here people say that, but some people are just suckers for a giant drink menu. I'm happy to say my girly martini was as good as I'd hoped, better, even, perhaps.. . And on top of that? Great food. No, nothing life-changing, but not disappointing in the least, and the desserts are even better. (And that's saying a lot for me, because I'm an appetizer and entree girl, not a dessert girl.). . Also had great service - attentive without being overbearing or stress-inducing. Great evening, fantastic drinks, good food, good service... what more could you ask for?
