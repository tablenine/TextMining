"Fusion" is a word bandied about as much in California as "avocado" or "Governator."  I think Fusion means "White man borrows" or something like that.  Gingergrass is a great taste of the White Man can do when he gains inspiration (or borrows or steals or other...) from Vietnam.  The food here is delicious and fun.  I've not had a bad meal here.  I'm sure in The 626 there's plenty of Vietnamese food of a great authenticity but... that's far (like a day by horseback) and the shoe fits so I'm eating it.. . _C$
