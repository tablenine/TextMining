You elusive son of a bitch. I finally caught up to you. You didn't disappoint me, partly coz I was buzzed and would have eaten a raw octopus, Old Boy style and partly coz I was talking to a cute girl while I savoured your Mexirean creation. Just for the originality I'll give you top marks. . . The chicken tacos were delicious. They have a limit of 4 per person. I was wary initially and only got 2 tacos, that was a huge mistake. The line kinda got longer afterwards and I didn't want to sweat out for a couple more. . . Guys, if you think you can handle 4 tacos at a time, believe me do it. I will be back for more next time to try some of their other creations. I didn't have to stand in line for long as it was at a hotel not on the street.
