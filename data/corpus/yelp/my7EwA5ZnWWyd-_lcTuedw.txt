Not as tasty as I had hoped.  But, the place is a fun, casual atmosphere all the same, with some nice design details.. . The olive oil is a "bitter imported brand", our waiter informed us when we complained that it tasted rancid.  When we asked for butter in stead, we were told they didn't have any.  Other than an incovenience, the service was wonderful!. . I ordered a seafood in red sauce on linguini.  The seafood was good and cooked to perfection, but the sauce was a bit too salty, and the consistency created a solid pasta mass.  The other ravioli dish was enjoyed.. . Complimentary Valet Service!!
