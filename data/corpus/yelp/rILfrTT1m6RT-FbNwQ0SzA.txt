Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Wonderful local institution. . . I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said, but I'll add my review on top of the others. The food is great (although not omfg-good) and the atmosphere is fun and festive. I think more than just the immediate experience of eating a meal, you can really test a restaurant by seeing if after the meal is over, and you go home and continue on with your life, if you start craving the food at a particular restaurant and how often you crave it. . . I crave the food at Papa Cristos all the time. That says something I think about the place. . . The food isn't the best I've had, but there's something about the place that pulls me back.
