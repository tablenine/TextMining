RFD is making me lazy.  I know I'll love the nachos (*with* taco mix, please) for a starter and the carrot cake rice cream for dessert.  Overall the entrees have varied from decent and interesting (that blackberry glazed tofu special they had a few weeks back) to the bomb (tempeh meatloaf -- I know, I kind of can't believe it either).  The vegetables are always fresh and colorful and totally yum.  And the prices are crazy reasonable for vegan LA fare.. . So... when push comes to shove and I need a good meal with other veggie friends... I've stopped adventuring on Yelp.  I just come here.  Really, it's the ice cream.  Carrot cake.  Look into it.
