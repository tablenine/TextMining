Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I like the steamed dumplings and garlic spinach, but this place is definitely loosing it's appeal. It's always packed, even the new 2-story place next door is packed. The dumplings get worse and worse every time I go. . . I guess that's what happens when a place 'blows up' like that though. The quantity of patrons degrades the quality of food/service I guess.
