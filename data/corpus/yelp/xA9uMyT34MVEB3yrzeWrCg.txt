There are really only two dishes worth ordering here - the Ramen and Tsukemen.  However, it is hands down the best ramen in Los Angeles and possibly anywhere in the United States.. . The noodles are firm yet just elastic enough.  The pork melts in your mouth.  The broth tastes like it has been stewing for ages with all the marrow goodness.. . The other dishes are pretty average.  There are much better places in LA to get their non-ramen bowls.  This place is the best when you're craving a hot bowl of noodles.
