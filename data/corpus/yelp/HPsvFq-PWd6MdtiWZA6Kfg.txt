WHAT A JOKE!!! I'm really not sure what all the hype about Big star is, its mediocre mexican food at a snobby bar. You can easily get the same mexican food just about anywhere in Chicago for less or the same price. I agree with some of the other reviews, as I was with a party of 3 who wanted to eat as well. I was snubbed by the hostess and told if I wanted to eat I would have to stand, since all the bar seat were taken on this fine Monday evening. My friends and I ordered a few tacos, only because we were told they would be the best we've ever had, the "bartender" seemed like she was a few marbles short, she also forgot I asked for my tab about 3 times. We ate and left as soon as we could, we would have loved to order a ton more food had we had a place to sit and enjoy ourselves. Sorry Big Star but I will not be back!
