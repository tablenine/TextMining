Wow! This place is fantastic. Honestly some of the best pizza I have ever had the opportunity to indulge. We started with the caprese salad which was in the top 3 best I have had. Two different pizzas one with coach farm goat cheese, leeks, scallions, garlic &amp; bacon and another with prosciutto di Parma, rucola, tomato &amp; mozzarella. Both were insanely amazing. Finished the meal off with some gelato and sorbet, try the coconut its creamy goodness. . . Few things to consider: . . - If you didn't make a reservation you're going to have to wait unless you come after 10:00 pm. - Sit at the back counter where they make the pizzas so you can see the whole situation go down.. - This place isn't cheap, you're getting gourmet pizza in a personal pan size from $14-16 per pizza plus the apps, and salads are the same price. . - Valet is 8.50 during the day and $10.00 at night. Park down the street. . . Definitely a place to check out.
