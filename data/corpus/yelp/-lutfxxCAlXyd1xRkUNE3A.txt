Restaurant: Cafe Selmarie
Category: American (Traditional)
The Sunday brunch at Cafe Selmarie is a mix of the commonplace and the cosmopolitan. The Mediterranean tart with carmelized onions, artichokes, olives and goat cheese (there was more, but I can't remember it) doesn't sound too good - especially when you figure in the topping of blackberry sauce - but it all works, and it was delicious. My roommate had the more traditional eggs and bacon, which looked solid, and bonus to the bacon for being less strips and more slabs. The staff was also quite friendly, but the atmosphere was a little to modern-art-museum-y to be a restaurant. Still, it looked good, and the desserts up front looked even better; the place offered a macadamia nut tart that looked like it might kill you three bites in, which would be the equivalent of being strangled by Maria Bello mid-coitus. Selmarie is on the pricey side, so it will be more of a treat each time I go.
