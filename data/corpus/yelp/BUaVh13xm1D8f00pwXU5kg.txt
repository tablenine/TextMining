If you're anything like me, you'll understand how difficult it is to walk past Hot Chocolate and into the doors of The Bluebird.   But don't worry, HC fans, The Bluebird won't disappoint.  . . I had an uber romantic girl date with my best friend last week.  Since I love carbs I had to try the velvety potato soup (with a chunk of grilled bread) and the mushroom, brie, spinach and bacon flatbread.  We shared an order of lamb sausage (from New Glarus, WI) and it was so delicious.  My flatbread was just okay.  The crust was rather bland and needed some seasoning.   My friend loved her fancy bacon, cheddar and onion burger. . . Their dessert menu is boring.  So while you're ahead, pay your bill and head on over to Hot Chocolate for dessert.
