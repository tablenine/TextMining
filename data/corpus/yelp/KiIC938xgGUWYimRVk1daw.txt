My friend brought me here one night while searching all over for a bite to eat. finally we stumbled up little tokyo after me leading him the wrong way to a bar.  . . We walked over to Daikokuya and he said, it's the best around. I believed him since i didn't know to much about noodle soup because i have never tried it before. The only place i ever really heard about was Orochon because it was on the Travel channel.. . My friend basically ordered for me and got me the Daikokuya Ramen. I ate earlier so this huge bowl was a bit much for me to handle at that moment.  I thought the taste was fantastic. The noodles were amazingly tender, the pork belly was to die for. We also ordered the dumplings which were spot on as well.  . . Our service was awesome.  The language barrier was a bit much but we made it through the night.  I inquired about other asian places within the area and all the waiters were very eager to share some good tips with me.. . I will definitely be going back and ordered some more items off the menu.
