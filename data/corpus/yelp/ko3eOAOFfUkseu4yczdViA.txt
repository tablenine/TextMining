Came here for the first time. I got the pork belly rice bowl. I want to like this place because I love the Kogi food, but I have to say exactly how i feel.. The restaurant is nicely painted, bright, and a small. I ordered take out, and you can wait in the back towards the kitchen for it. They come out with your food in the paper bowl- the same materials that they serve you at the truck. You package your own take out meaning you put aluminum foil and place it in a bag yourself. . When I got my bowl, it was very pretty and full of color. There was my fried egg on top of rice, pork belly meat, basil leaves, spinach, peanuts, a whole lot of sauce, and other condiments. I love rice, and I like rice with some moisture. BUT the rice in their rice bowl was too mushy. There was a whole lot of sauce, and it tasted salty, sour, spicy, and mildly sweet all in one bowl. There was just waay too much going on in that one bowl. I like eating nuts alone, and not mixed in my food. In the case of the rice bowl, it was an exception. The peanuts in the rice bowl added much needed texture in all that mushy-ness, so it was a good thing they were there. It was spicy! I wasn't expecting all that spicy-ness at all, and I'm not a fan of spicy food. . There was a cute guy that brought me my food. I don't think I'll be coming back. I'm definitely sticking to the Kogi truck and/or get it at the Alibi room (when i don't have cash).
