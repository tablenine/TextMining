After stuffing myself at brunch across the street at Rosebud, my group decided to hop over to Alon's and ogle some of the carb laden goodness. I ended up getting a chocolate raspberry mousse cake tart thing for less than $5. They have a bit of an odd setup inside but that might be because we came in on the opposite side from where we were supposed to. One would think they'd have more than one register area, but apparently not. . . As for the pastry itself, the mousse was light and flavorful and it tasted like there were actual raspberries in the filling. Based on the seeds in my teeth, that's probably a safe bet.
