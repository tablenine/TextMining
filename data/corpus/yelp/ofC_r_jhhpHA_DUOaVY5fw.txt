Best sushi in Atlanta hands down. I have been going to this place for years... and I mean YEARS. The sushi is fresh fresh fresh and delicious. The rolls are large- one roll would fill you up- but of course i am a fatty so I always order 2. The sushi melts in your mouth, but not in your chopstick. So good. The apps are good also- the edammame is warm but crisp and the agadashi tofu is crispy on the inside but like buttah on the inside. I must also mention their ginger dressing, which I literally crave. I could just drink the dressing with a spoon- but it tastes pretty good with the salad too. . . I must also talk about the tempura udon, which is my winter time staple. The broth is so good and tasty. The shrimp is large in size and the tempura stays on without flaking off. I could eat the whole ginormous bowl in one sitting... THAT is how good it is. . . When I am craving sushi, this is the place I go. Seriously. And the location is the BEST. Shopping AND Sushi. No better combo.
