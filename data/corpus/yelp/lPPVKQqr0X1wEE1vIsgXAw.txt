Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
After catching this place on "Man vs. Food" we decided to try it out. Our conclusion: the regular size portions should be considered to be a challenge to finish alone.... . HUGE portions of quality mexican food. Tacos were large and in charge. And the carne asada burrito was so big me and my girlfriend couldn't finish it.
