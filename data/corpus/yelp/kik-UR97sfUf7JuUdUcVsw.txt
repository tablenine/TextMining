Oh, L.A. - land of the trendy Asians.  Your citizens lie in wait in anticipation of the next big thing, only to jump off the bandwagon just as quickly as they jumped on.  Having grown up there, I bore witness to this on many occasions... boba in the late 90's, the Counterstrike/PC Bang phase at the turn of the millenium, and the current "fro-yo" craze. . . But I digress.   To its credit, Kogi chose an excellent target audience in L.A..  Coupled with the media's recent obsession with Twitter resulted in a viral marketing campaign unlike any other.  . . Sadly, I found that the food did not live up to the hype.  I tried one of each taco (pork, short rib, chicken, and tofu) and a pork burrito.  Like others, I enjoyed the beef short rib the most, followed by the pork, the tofu, and the chicken.  They weren't bad, but they weren't spectacular like everybody else had mentioned.  . . Such a shame.  L.A., I anxiously await the next over-hyped food adventure you have in store.  Boiling Crab, perhaps?
