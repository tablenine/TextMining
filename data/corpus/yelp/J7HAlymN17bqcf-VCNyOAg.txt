Restaurant: Cafe 28
Category: Cuban
I have visited Cafe 28 on multiple occasions and I have never been disappointed. They offer inventive twists on traditional Mexican and Cuban dishes that are flavorful and visual appealing. I will say I have never eaten one of their dinner entrees due to the higher-than-I-want-to-pay prices and the advantage of spending less to get two appetizers (approx $14). I have eaten their delicious non-traditional tamales, awesome papas rellenos, halibut &amp; shrimp ceviche and Cuban roasted pork with caramelized onions atop polenta. Plus, Sunday brunch is a great time to visit and try the Cafe 28 version. . . The owner is extremely friendly and willing to discuss his food philosophy. And the staff takes care of every need. The Mojitos are popular and refreshing but the Margaritas are the best.
