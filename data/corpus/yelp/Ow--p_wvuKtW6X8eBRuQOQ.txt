Sweet baby Jesus on rye.. . Wow.  After 10 years as a vegetarian, I broke my decade long pastrami-free fast at Ashkenaz and I thought, "Yes.  This is good."  And I stand by that, but man oh man, if I had known about Manny's I may never have gone veggie in the first place.. . The sandwiches are huge, as has been described by many.  And they are accompanied by a wholly unnecessary latke-- very delicious, very fried.  The matzoh ball soup is not to be missed, even if you are awed by the size and weight of your sandwich.  I had a hard time carrying my tray to the dining room and now feel stronger for the effort.  . . I recommend the trip for anyone not in the area-- make a day of it if you're headed down to see a Sox game.  The prices are a little higher than you generally see at delis-- soup, sandwich and a drink will run about $20, believe it or not-- but it's a splurge that you can easily rationalize.  A Manny's lunch, depending on if you hit it early or late, will serve you in good stead for two meals, or at least one and a half.. . I have to say, though, that Manny's failed to impress on the pickle front.  Ashkenaz wins there, hands down.
