Restaurant: Paco&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I would have given Paco's 3 stars, but I had to give an extra star for the yummy flour tortillas!  They are so good.  I would be happy just eating the tortillas with butter and not ordering anything else.  They are heavenly.  They are made right there in front of you. . . Good margaritas, good tacos, and good guacamole. An overall good mexican restaurant.
