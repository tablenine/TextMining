I used to watch that MTV show "Yo Mama" and at the end of the show, Wilmer Valderrama used to give the winner two complementary dinners to this restaurant. So I was hooked.  I finally got to try it out on Valentine's day.  I thought that the ambiance was nice (more of a "hip" crowd) but the service wasn't that great.   The waiters kept getting the orders mixed up and would deliver food to the wrong table.  They had a pre fixed menu, so we ordered from it.  I thought that everything on the menu was good except for the sushi and dessert.  Would I go here again?  Ehh...maybe if I had some extra cash to spend.
