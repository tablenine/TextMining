five of us went here for lunch during the week and it was so good~ i'm really not a big fan of ramen, but this place was yummy. we ordered two hot and two cold, and had them make two of them combos with fried rice and i forget what else... regardless, it was all gone within 20 minutes. the only downfall was that the waitress didn't really understand english, but that's what pointing is for, right?
