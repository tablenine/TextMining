Came here after eating a light meal and it just hit the spot! I got their strawberry shortcake which was $4.50... a bit pricey since the ice cream trucks are only sell them for 0.75 but it was a hundred times better... and as it should be for that price! my friend go their cookies and creme bar which she gave good review. The next day, I was already craving more... :) So pretty expensive, but it hits the spot if you are craving some sweets!
