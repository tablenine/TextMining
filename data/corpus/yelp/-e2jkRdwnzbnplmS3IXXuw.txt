I'm very excited about this new sushi place. It's cheap and really good! The rolls are bigger than any other sushi place I've been to in Chicago and they are also much cheaper! The service is ok...they tend to get overwhelmed by the large crowds that have been coming into their small restaurant lately. Hopefully they'll expand soon because I plan on eating here a lot.
