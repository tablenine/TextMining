Be ready to spend more money than you usually would at a deli. The corned beef and matzo ball soup is crazy delicious. A corned beef sandwich, a bowl of matzo ball soup and a drink put be back close to $20. The atmosphere is vintage and fun. The service is great. Definitely try it out, at least once. There's parking in the back. Major plus.
