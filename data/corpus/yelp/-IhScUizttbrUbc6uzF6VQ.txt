Category: Steakhouses
All in all a very pleasant dining experience. The service was exceptional, friendly and attentive without hovering. I had the 22oz dry aged porterhouse. Very flavorful, but it was a slightly thinner cut than I would have expected, compared to that at other steakhouses in this class. That said, the preparation was spot on. The others in my party had other cuts including the South Side filet and classic filet - all were prepared to instruction and much enjoyed. The sides were slightly lacking however, but were certainly secondary to the meat (creamed spinach, tempura green beans, and truffle Asiago fries). . . The real highlight of the evening for me however, was the Caesar salad with white anchovies. The table side preparation I can take or leave, but it was quite possibly the best Caesar salad I've had. The dressing ingredients were expertly balanced and the anchovies were a perfect accompaniment, delicate and flavorful. . . There are obviously several great options for steak in Chicago and I would put Primehouse on par with its peers. Â But I will definitely return for the Caesar salad. Yes, I realize that sounds odd...
