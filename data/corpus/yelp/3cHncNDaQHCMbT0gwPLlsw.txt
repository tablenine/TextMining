There's so many incredibly good restaurants in Atlanta that it's tempting to be stingy with the 5 star ratings, but Canoe was just so perfect that I have a very hard time not handing one out.. . The ambiance is flawless. I worry about HOW they manage to keep it so insect-free, but it was nice to sit outdoors and enjoy perfect weather right next to the river.. . The service was perfect. Their timing was flawless and their knowledge of the food was amazing.. . The quality of the food was tops and the wine selection was beyond expectations. Again, the servers seemed to know every wine first-hand, which was really appreciated =). . I can't think of anything negative to say, hence 5 stars =D Pricey, yes, but still good bang for the buck.
