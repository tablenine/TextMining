Stats is perfect for game night. Pull up to the bar, order your favorite food and libations and root for your home team.  I first visited Stats during March Madness and it was mad crowded in there.. . I think UNC was playing Kansas and my date and I had to stand in a 10 minute line just to get in. The bouncer was cool because even though I arrived after my date did, the bouncer still let us in together.. . When you walk in there are pockets of intimate table seating near the windows and a large bar in the middle. Since it was a popular night we had to stand the entire time, but there were plenty of TV's to see KU whoop some ass.  . . I can't comment on the food since all I had was drinks. In fact, this establishment was the first place I converted into a beer drinker. I ordered a Blue Moon with an orange slice and it was on!. . I noticed that Stats had an upstairs lounge area that people can normally peruse, but on that particular night, some company was throwing a Tarheels party so if you weren't on the guestlist or wearing your Carolina Blue, you weren't going through.. . It was all good though. My favorite part of the bar was the bathrooms. It was like a baseball dugout locker room or something. You wait your turn for the unisex stall and once inside there are various sport stats to tantalize your temples.  Definitely 5 stars on the bathroom meter.. . If you're a sports lover, check out Stats. If you're not, check out Stats. It was alot of fun and the bartenders make decent drinks. I'll update this later when I try their food. But I did see some nachos that looked killer
