I love this place! In fact I cannot believe I have not yelped about it already! Everything is so tasty. Try the coq a vin crepe for dinner or the Florentine for brunch. The coffee is awesome and so is the fact that the sell orangina. If you can get a seat outside when the weather is nice...there is nothing better. You should try it!
