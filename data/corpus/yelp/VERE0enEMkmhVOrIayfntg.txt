I guess I don't know what I'm missing, right?. . After a thrifty waiting time and being seated in a cramp section next to a kid who was done playing with her food and decided to walk around her table, we ordered and got to crackin. I decided to stray from the predictable and NOT get the Hainan Chicken. So instead, I got the Â Chicken Curry dish. When it came to my table, I was like FUUUUUU-- This is exactly the kinda curry that I DISLIKE! Don't know what kinda curry cuisine it is, but it's that thick, oily, stewy, dark-brown curry. Definitely different from the curry I normally get at Thai places. I gobbled the chicken curry mostly because I was starving, but other than that I don't think I would've cleaned my plate.. . Oh yeah, I tasted the Hainan chicken. It's eh. Skinless boiled chicken on jasmine rice. I liked the ginger dipping sauce, tho. It was something outta the ordinary.. . Maybe I'll try something else next time I'm here. Mayhaps the duck pizza?
