My new favorite lunch place near the mid-Wilshire / Beverly area. Parking sucks, but if you're lucky, you can get a good spot on the street. Otherwise, be prepared to drive around in circles for a while. . . My favorites so far, and I say so far because I plan on going back every several weeks...The turkey wrap and the falafel wrap -- and pretty much any of the salads. Oh, and don't forget about the sweet potato fries!. . This place is very LA, but interesting to people watch while you enjoy a good, fresh -- and might I add -- sometimes fast meals!. . Sidenote: Breakfast is amazing here too. Healthy options!
