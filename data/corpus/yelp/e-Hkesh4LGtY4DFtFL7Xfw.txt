wow.  I went there the other day with the fiance (lol, that rhymes) for a quick dinner: he got the Cuban sandwich, I got the chicken with goat cheese. I hijacked the second half of his Cuban sandwich when he wasn't looking: I love the man, but the sandwich was THAT GOOD. The food is awesome, the prices are VERY reasonable ($3-5 for a sandwich? YAY!), and the service, well, what do you expect!? it's fast, rushed &amp; dismissive.  Who cares? it's a sandwich!  . . By the way, they make their french rolls &amp; all the bread used for their sandwiches in house...yeah, that's how good they are!. . We usually get their pastries (the fruit tart is just awesome) but the sandwiches are...yummmm. . . I think we'll end up doing our wedding cake from here: they get every other product right, why wouldn't they get the wedding cake right?
