i live in san francisco but i go to atlanta for work frequently and a co-worker took me here.  it's a gorgeous restaurant with a very elegant feel to it.  the food is divine and they have some pretty creative cocktails and the service is really goos as well.  the only catch with ecco is that it's on the pricy side.
