Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
I love this place. Food is always yummy. The portions are huge (even lunch portions). The menu is huge. The staff is always great and friendly. It is a bit on the expensive side but always worth the money. At times you do have to wait but never to long. If I don't have time to stop in for a meal I always pick up a slice of cheesecake to go. BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!
