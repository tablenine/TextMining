Restaurant: La Tavola Trattoria
Category: Italian
My husband and had dinner at La Tavola with two other couples last weekend and it was the best meal we've had out all year! The mixed green salad was fantastic, and the Orichette with house made sausage was TO DIE FOR! We were there for over 2 hours and never felt rushed, the atmosphere is so cozy and warm. Our server was fantastic. As we left the restaurant we all looked from each other and decided we're coming back next month. This place is a real gem!
