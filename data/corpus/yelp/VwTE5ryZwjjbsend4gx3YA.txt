this place is ok. they always seat us quickly. we always end up here on saturday nights after a movie at the arclight. i like the fact that they have ramen at 1am. the sandwiches are really good. i got the hippie one and i thought it was great. what isn't great is the hotter than hell penne. i lik spicy food. it's not hotter than hell. it also bathes in it's own broth. gross
