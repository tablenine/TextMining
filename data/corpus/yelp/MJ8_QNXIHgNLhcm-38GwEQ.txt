This is sooooo sad! My favortiet Thai restaurant has gone dowwwwn hill! I USED to love this place with a passion. I don't know if business has slowed down for them, but some of their food is not as fresh as before. One of our favorite SHRIMP CAKES are made with PORK and shrimp as well and its not stated on the menu! This time we had them take it back because there was a funky smell. It wasn't fresh!!!. . They seemed uneasy and rude if you bother them with something like that instead of apoligizing, etc, etc. . . NOW!! They automatically add 15% tips on your bill!! We only have a party of 4! WTF?? We used to tip them 20% but if they wanted to add the 15% on to the bill, we're not even going to give them the extra 5% because they became so greedy! :-(
