I was kind of scared about eating at this place. Celeb owned and they just redid the exterior to make it really, really red? Turns out I was wrong. I first went here for a mixer in the upstairs bar area and I didn't have any food that night but the sushi looked intriguing. So I decided to try it for real. Decor is funky, dark and fabulous. Really great stuff and it sets off a nice mood. Service is exceptional and really took care of us and constantly brought drink refills without asking. Ordered some Amberjack sushi. Was really surprised to see Amberjack since that's mainly a fish you see in the south, but they had it and it was great. Just a pity that only bring two pieces for 10 bucks. Ordered the chef's special sashimi which comes with Glass Noodles in a 'igloo' made of crushed ice. So the presentation is fantastic and so was the sashimi. Yes, it's 38 bucks for 12 pieces but it's some of the best stuff they got so you expect it to be good and you're not disappointed.. . But here's the real reason to go.. . Miso Matzo Soup.. . I'm not making that up. It's miso soup in an larger than usual bowl with plenty of tofu and more importantly, a gigantic matzo ball! It's a Japanese version of Matzo Ball Soup and it's great! In fact, if there was only one thing I could order here at Geisha, this would be it. This alone will make me come back to what I'll now call a 'Jewpanese' restaurant. Soy!
