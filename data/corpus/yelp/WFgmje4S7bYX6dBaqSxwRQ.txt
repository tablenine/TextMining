My brother recommended this place for dinner and reading the reviews here I thought it was a safe bet to try.  Ding ding!  Winner winner chicken dinner!  There's too many things to try so a second or even third visit is required.  Some of the food we ordered: Chicken wings (of course) - one not spicy and the other spicy.  I didnt try the spicy ones.  Pretty tasty though, nice flavor in return for little meat.  Fried rice was decent as it had slices of sausage or was it hot dogs? put in it.  The tofu salad with bits of tuna was good.  The deep fried halibut wasn't bad either....you get the whole fish deep fried which makes pretty much the whole thing edible. Pan seared scallops with butter - hmm, nothing noteworthy here except the fact that the scallops (white part) were still attached to the "roe" or orange mussel looking thingy.  To some this may in fact cause some panic as it doesnt look like your typical scallop, but don't fear - for it tastes as if you shoved a mussel and scallop in your mouth simultaneously.  We also ordered the french fries as we were curious as to how they were prepared.  Funny thing is that out of all the items served to us, it took the longest as we were told they were made 'fresh"....uh..ok.   For 5 of us, it took roughly 20-30 minutes around 730p to get a table on a Saturday night.  I suppose that's not bad considering how popular this place is.  Dinner came out to be less than $50 including a large beer and tip.  Hmm...either our group wasnt very hungry or prices were pretty darn good!
