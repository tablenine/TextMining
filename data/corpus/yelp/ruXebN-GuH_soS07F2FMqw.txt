I'm leaving my original review here. But, I just want to update by saying that I recently returned and was less enthused than the first time. the service was pretty bad, and the food seems to have gone downhill a bit. I'm not sure quite what it is, but something was awry when I was last there. For this reason, I am downgrading from 4 stars to 3.. . **Original Review**. Excellent restaurant. Free mandatory valet, which I never complain about. The decor is simple. The bar is divided from the dining room, which helps keep the noise down. However, the main part of the dining room is large and loud. If you sit closer to the road, in the smaller section of the dining room, it is much quieter, and you will have no problem carrying a conversation.. . The food is great - very solid fish and seafood. I had the tuna tartare as an appetizer and sea bass as an entree. They have a number of speciality entrees, but you cannot go wrong with a fresh catch prepared any of the four ways they offer it. The crab cakes are supposed to be the best, and someone at my table ordered them. he agreed they were some of the best he'd ever had. Desert was pretty good, but by the time it came, I had eaten enough. The bread is great - I believe it is made in-house. . . This place is a must if you are a seafood or fish lover.
