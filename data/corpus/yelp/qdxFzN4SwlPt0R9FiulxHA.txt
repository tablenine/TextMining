The two stars are for the coffee, which was passable and the dip that came with the spinach pie appetizer. . . This place had literally the worst falafel I've ever had and the horrible service to match. The waiter gave us an insane amount of attitude about what we ordered. Two of us weren't incredibly hungry but still wanted to try the place. So we got appetizers and he snapped at us and then when he delivered it said, "Here's your *appetizers*". To top it off, he never came back with our change (because I think he thought we didn't leave him a tip). We did- an overly generous one because we aren't jerks. But I instantly regretted it and if I had had bigger stones, I probably would have gone back and just took it back.. . The falafels were completely dry and over spiced and the spinach pies were far too greasy. Also, this place isn't "healthy". It's disgusting. The complimentary bread was unevenly cooked, overly doughy, and way too greasy. . . All in all- don't waste your time. Go and support a restaurant with good service and food that doesn't make you sick afterwards.
