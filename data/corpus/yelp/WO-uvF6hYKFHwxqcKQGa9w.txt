Jerk chicken, greens, fettucine alfredo and a grape soda please. Every trip to ATL includes at least one top at Eats. Their greens are sooooo good but not the best I've ever had in my life (come over to Karen's house and you'll see what I'm talking about!). I'm very picky about my mac-n-cheese which is why I opt for the fettucine (nobody beats Karen's mac-n-cheese either). I just love this place because of the food, the music and the whole crazy atmosphere. Plus, any place that serves real grape soda, ice cold, in a bottle is OK in my book. I'd give them 5 stars if they'd have black eyed peas to go with the cornbread. The cornbread is kind of dry so the pea juice would soak it up. Oh well, they'll always be one of the must-stops on my trips down south (along with Waffle House). . Go EATS!
