After a super fun Yelp event at The Glendon on this Wednesday evening, bf and I joined a bunch of other Yelpers at Father's Office in Culver City.  In the group was Ciara G, our bestest Yelp friend - and witness to our first FO experience at the Santa Monica location.. . While we were "lucky" enough to find a parking space 2 blocks away and then share a ledge space and one barstool between the 3 of us at the Santa Monica location, parking was a dream AND had our pick of several WHOLE TABLES (including a couple on the outside patio) at this location!. . We were instantly, yet tentatively - in love.. . Two feet all in came when we walked up to the bar to order, and the bartender asked how we wanted our FO Burgers cooked!  None of us wanted to disturb the balance of perfection that is served on the bun, so we got them medium rare - but after hearing Nazi-like stories about how you could NEVER change the way this burger comes, it was just nice to be asked!. . We spread out at one of the giant bench-warmed tables, and our food came up within about 10 minutes.  Just like we experienced at the Santa Monica location, everything was AWESOME:. . Sweet potato fries - crispy, sweet-potatoey, with that heavenly dipping sauce. Skinny regular fries - skinny and crispy but still tender inside, with THAT dipping sauce. Office Burgers ($ 12.50) - cheesy, juicy, oniony, beefy. Organic Beet Salad ($10.50) - chunks of gorgonzola, roasted beet chunks, and walnuts, lightly dressed with greens, and a festive spiral julienne of raw beet on top. . There really is NO reason at all to go back to the Santa Monica location to fight everyone else for one square inch of space!  This location has a big - and FREE - parking lot, plus you can SIT to eat your burger!. . Just one last note (humor me):. . *********FRYSMITH - TRY THE AWESOME FRIES HERE!!!!!!!********
