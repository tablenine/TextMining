You know, TIME magazine put slashed lobster prices on their Top 10 list of things to take advantage of during the recession.. . That's how I justify it, at least. Shrimp and crawfish are good and all, but just go for it. You know you want to.. . Lobster with the whole sha-bang.. Your life will be changed.
