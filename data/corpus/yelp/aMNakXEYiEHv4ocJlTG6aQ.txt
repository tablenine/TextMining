This place is expansive.. . I brought my mom here from San Diego and she told me if I ever wanted to impress a girl, to bring her here. She took home about a dozen pastries and ate them within the span of 2 days.. . The cheese balls and potato balls are great. The cookies are great. The pastrami sandwich is great.. . The only downside is how much traffic it gets, but it's well-earned, so you can't complain too much about it.. . Run don't walk.
