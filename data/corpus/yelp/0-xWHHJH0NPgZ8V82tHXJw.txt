Restaurant: Vortex Bar &amp; Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
I would say 75% of my visits to ATL included hitting this place up.  The burgers they got here are pretty rocking.  Not only are they big and delicious, but they have a plethora ("Would you say I have a plethora of pinatas?') of types to choose from.   This worked out pretty well as I have been here a number of times with people who want "just plain" to the "just plain strange.". . The other thing that I really like about the Vortex is that they offer tater tots in addition to fries.  Sure they're just tater tots, but I LOVE TATER TOTS.  Usually my friends and I will order the tater tots with cheese sauce as an appetizer, in addition to the tater tots you get with your sandwich.  . . Overall, I really enjoy this place.  The ambience is kind of like a biker bar, a biker bar you can actually feel safe in.  Usually filled with a younger crowd, idon't be surprised to see grandma rocking a chilli burger at the table next to you, or "Buffy and Todd"  chowing down on a turkey burger at the bar.  This place fills you up, so come hungry or expect to have leftovers.
