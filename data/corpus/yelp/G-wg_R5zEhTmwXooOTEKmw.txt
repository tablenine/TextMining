Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
My impression of pink's is overrated and overpriced. If you haven't been there I think its worth a try. . Their hotdogs are definitely creative and very filling. I normally get the plain hotdog with ketchup or the chilli dog. . The other hotdogs are just too crazy for me and always give me indigestion. . The line is always long and the hot dog never makes up for the wait.
