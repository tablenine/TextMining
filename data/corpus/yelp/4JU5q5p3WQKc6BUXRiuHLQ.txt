Category: American (Traditional)
Vortex is a must every time my boyfriend comes to town!!  The authentic bad ass atmosphere here is actually quite inviting!  . . The burgers rock-  i have tried bison, ostrich and beef and they all tasted pretty damn good.  And of course, the sweet potato fries are yum yum yummy.  You gotta order these with your burger!!  . . L5P is such an eclectic area.  Who doesnt love going there to just hang out and watch the craziness unfold?!?!
