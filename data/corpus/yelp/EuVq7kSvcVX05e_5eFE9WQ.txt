The sushi is great, but the cooked foods are just okay.  I think i've been here so many times, i have tried the whole menu.  The tempura, noodles, teriyaki, and set dinner entrees are just OK, nothing really spectacular.  The sushi is always fresh and the prices are pretty good.  Ordering off the sushi menu a la carte can get pretty expensive if you eat the good stuff (sea urchin, yellowtail, toro, sweet shrimp), but it is always fresh and delicious.  My suggestion is to order the chirashi if your on a budget, its a pretty good value.   The spider roll and caterpillar are great choices, I also like the spicy scallop, bluefin toro, and the yellowtail belly.  Overall the sushi and rolls are traditional, they dont get too creative like many americanized sushi bars.  So don't expect something fancy to come out, but if your looking for simple fresh sushi for a good value this is the place to go!. . The staff are always friendly, the place is very cramped and noisy, and the wait is very long.  Either come early  or very late, otherwise expect to wait an hr or two (even on weekdays!).  With that said, this is probably not the best place to bring a date to.... . Price: $$$ (for some reason the price is always 30+ per person when I go with my friends, but then again, we alwasy order premium sushi and eat away) =)
