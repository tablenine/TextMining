If you like garlic, you won't go wrong with this place. For me, it's more for novelty than fine cuisine, highlighted by their garlic-themed decor. Â Coming to this place, it's expected that everything is going to be "garlicky." What I didn't know were the differing degrees of "garlicity." I made the mistake of starting off with the highest level, then worked my way down. If you start with a dish with a strong garlic flavor, any other dishes that follow will seem bland if it doesn't have the same flavor intensity. . . This is absolutely skewing my review. My biggest mistake was spreading that delicious garlic pesto spread on the bread before my meal even came. Granted, that spread was addicting, it does have a very strong garlic flavor. So strong in fact, that I don't believe there is any item on the menu that can match its intensity. As good as it is, save it for later. . . By the time I got to my garlic braised boneless short rib, it couldn't taste a damn thing. I did try someone else's garlic encrusted baby back ribs, and this was superb. All the other dishes were average with a kick of garlic. Overall, i think this is a fun place to be, great for taking visiting relatives, but not exactly a culinary mecca for foodies.
