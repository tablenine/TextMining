I wish this place was in San Diego!! Came to this place on a wed. morning. It was very busy but with no wait. The concierge at our hotel recommended this place as being "the best" breakfast place. She was totally accurate. My husband ordered the 2 egg breakfast w/bacon and a pancake on the side. The bacon was amazing and the pancake...DELICIOUS! I had the breakfast tacos, also amazing. They don't skimp on anything. Can't beat the french press coffee, our server was great!  5 stars!
