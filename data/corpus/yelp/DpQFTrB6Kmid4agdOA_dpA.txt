Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Although Ford's has the celebrity connections (chef/owner is son of actor Harrison Ford), it doesn't have the snooty Hollywood feel you might expect.  I like that.  The beer selection is modest, yet strong in variety.  The dinner menu isn't particularly amazing with basic bar-fare that's cooked well with various improvements to quality and ingredient choice.  The restaurant is in a busy location in Culver City downtown making patio ambiance vibrant and inviting when the weather is good.  One of Ford's strongest areas is its selection of cured meats, charcuterie, and flatbreads...mmm, headcheese.
