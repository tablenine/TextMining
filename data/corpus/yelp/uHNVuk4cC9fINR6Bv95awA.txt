Damn. I'm craving this place again. I just went like 10 days ago. Love this place. The best ramen I've had in all of LA. You get so many freakin options, it's like the Counter for ramen. Pick how strong your soup base is, how chewy your noodles will be, and all the extras (spicy miso, extra pork, boiled egg, seaweed, etc). Then after you're done eating all your noodles and you still have soup, what do you do?? You ORDER MORE NOODLES. For a buck, you can keep refilling your bowl with noodles. And I usually do until I'm sick or my soup is gone.. . And the soup. So good. Not as salty as other ramen places are but super tasty. The customization really helps since you can get your soup and hence ramen exactly how you want it.. . Ok now for the small negatives. This place can get expensive. Order enough extra noodles or extra stuff and it can easily become a $12 bowl of ramen. Also, the seats kind of suck. I think it's cuz I've gotten seated at the same table everytime I've gone (twice now). And it's the tables in the back where you gotta take off your shoes and sit Indian style. It gets uncomfortable after a while.. . But I'm giving it 5 stars anyway. Why? Because the food is that good. I'll deal with the uncomfortable seats and slight cost for the best ramen this side of Japan.. . Shin-Sen-Gumi = My first born's new name
