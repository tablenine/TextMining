This place reminds me a lot of Dean &amp; Deluca in New York, the restaurant is very white which high ceilings and very clean. The prices are a little above average, but not outrageous, and the food is pretty good. I got the eggs benedict, which was good, but when my dish came out, my first thought was, this is it? But it was actually filling for me. We also went to the bar area, and the bartenders are meticulous when they make the drinks to make sure you get exactly what you want, and it's presented in the nicest way possible.
