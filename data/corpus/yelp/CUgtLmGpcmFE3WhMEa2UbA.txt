Restaurant: Caf√© Santorini
Category: Greek
Another occasion to try new restaurants - birthdays.. . A friend's birthday prompted this visit to Cafe Santorini. Having been to Sushi Roku across the alleyway, I knew at least where to park the car.. . I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna. Honestly, this was one of the best seared ahi tuna I've ever tasted. Soba noodles soaked in oil with shredded seaweed and sesame seeds complimented the fish quite well. The tuna itself was seared ever-so-slightly, rolled in cracked pepper, then sliced thin. The resulting taste was really fresh, really peppery, and citrusy (squeezed lemon juice) accompanied by the soba noodles and the glass of Sauvignon Blanc. I greatly enjoyed myself at this restaurant culinarily. . . The reason for the four stars? The $7 parking. Yes, I realize it is Pasadena, but I bet there are other great places where I can experience the seared ahi tuna with a great glass of sauvignon blanc without having to dish out $7.00 for two hours of parking. :0p. . Great atmosphere as well - our party had reserved a small room away from the main dining area above the banquet room. We could look down to the banquet room through a glass wall. It was private and quiet. Great dining experience all around.. . Seared ah tuna = $25. Glass of sauvignon blanc = $10. Parking = $7. Plus tax and tip.
