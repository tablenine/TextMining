Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I'd never been to either location before, but I liked Jerry's when I went for dinner last night.  I thought the service was fine - our waiter didn't hover, but my water glass was never empty, and he always showed up at the right times.  Getting our food didn't take long even though the place was busy, and the outdoor seating was great (albeit a bit crowded).. . The menu is huge, but I got the Wolfy P on ciabatta (turkey, bacon, honey mustard, apple, grilled onions) and it was delicious.  And I mean delicious.  Sandwiches are in the $8.50-$11 range, so a little expensive, but you get two sides for free.  I left feeling more than satisfied.
