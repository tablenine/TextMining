omfg they came to lake forest tonight.  Best truck food evar. . . It was *so* good. The short rib burrito was good, the short rib taco and spicy pork taco were better. The Kogi sliders were *the best*.  The meat was well marinated, it was flavorful and moist. The short rib could have been more tender, but otherwise the pork and whatever is in the kogi sliders was *awesome*. I really like the cilantro/green onion/lime relish. All the flavors come together so nicely. The sliders have a nice buttery flavor to them too that only enhances the omg goodness of the meat. . . I only heard about the Kogi truck last night, my friends were telling me how awesome it was. I checked out the website and low and behold they were due to come to Lake Forest tonight. I also checked twitter and they were there an hour early!!. YAY! I *stalked* this truck tonight. We left early, got there on time (after not being able to find the "gypsy den" where it was staged behind), and we were literally first in line :D. . The guys in the truck were quick and friendly, and they make some damn good food. . . Go find you some Kogi!
