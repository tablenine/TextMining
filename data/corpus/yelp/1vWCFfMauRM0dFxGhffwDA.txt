this is old man food.. . not the so old you need to gum it kind, but the old man food which is served in big hearty man style servings, served plain and simple without painted on streaks of reductions and foams, served by young hearts with older shoe soles than Abe Lincoln that have been standing for years behind the counters serving thousands of sandwiches to those wanting it big, meaty and tasty, served on a plate to be put onto your lunch tray which you carry yourself to your simple table in a huge room filled with others lost in the world of unhinging mouths.. . pastrami on rye, corned beef, potato latkes, matzo ball soup, porn sized pickels and now all available for evening suppers with a cold beer.
