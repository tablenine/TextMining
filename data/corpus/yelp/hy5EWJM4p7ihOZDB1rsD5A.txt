SWEET.. . My friends and I were looking for a place in k-town to eat on friday night. and saw that soowon has a 4.5 star so we decided to try it.. . We called them to make a reservation but they didn't speak that well of english nor did they take reservations. We decided to meet there at 7:30 anyways, without reservation.. . Couldn't find it the first round of drive - the front of the store is facing the small parking lot but there is a small yellow sign that says soowon galbi. The window is clean and the interior is nice and upscale looking.. . The lady greeted me, the first one to get there, and told me that I can write my name down - a group of 5.  Within half an hour, my friends all arrived and we were seated.. . You can order a combination set or individual plates. Since we had 5 people we ordered combination A - a lot of meat, side dishes, drinks, etc..  The big tray of meat came out and from there it was very quick. The servers will come to your table every 5 minutes to cook more meat and give you refills on your side dishes.. . We had so much food !!  We couldn't even finish the meat !!. For 5 people, including tax, the bill came out to be $130 - normal cost for korean bbq.. . The meat was really good and the service was super nice.. Thank you Soonwon Galbi, we'll come back again.
