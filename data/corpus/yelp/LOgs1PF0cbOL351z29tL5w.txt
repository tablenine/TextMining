Going to Titos reminds me of a story I heard about some US soccer players (or whatever sport they played) that thought it would be funny to start a fake line into a locked doorway while they were in Russia for a game.  The Russian people, at that time, had to wait in long lines to buy everything, often not knowing what they were waiting for, just hoping it was something they could use or eat.  Soon, a huge long line formed around the block because the people at the front of the line (soccer players) started passing back false information down the line as to what it was they were waiting for.  The players slowly started to get out of line so that it would move, and soon the huge crowd grew restless.  Finally the soccer players left, so they wouldn't get attacked.  In the end, the people slowly made it to the locked door, only to find there was nothing there, and that they had been fooled, and had wasted the better part of their day.  I felt the same way after eating at Titos.
