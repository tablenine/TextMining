Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
This was one of the first restaurants I ate at after moving here a little over a year ago--- I admit the reason I first gave it a try was its convenient location 2 blocks away from my apartment. But as I have learned from my many breakfast, lunch, and dinner experiences here over the past year, it is honestly a great place for good, yummy, consistent "diner" (or to us metro-Detroit natives, Coney Island-esque) food. Gus (Stella's son) always greets me with a "Hi Sweetheart/Beautiful/etc" which might sound creepy but it's not--- that's just a testament to how warm &amp; friendly he is with all his "regulars" or "semi-regulars" (such as myself). . . Now, I don't consider myself a picky eater, I just like to substitute/modify my meals. ;-) But the wait staff never flinches when I make my somewhat "finicky"  requests  &amp; one waiter even worked with me to figure out the cheapest way to charge me for the salad I wanted to create by working off the ingredients/prices of salads already on the menu.. . My favorite thing here is hands down the challah french toast (different from the regular or stuffed that's found on the menu). I barely see anyone eating it, maybe b/c it's a special listed on the little chalkboard hanging by the kitchen &amp; only available on Sat/Sun mornings. But it is seriously divine, as it comes with fresh strawberries and a vanilla cream sauce--- can we say YUMMY? (Look for other specials on this chalkboard every day--- I think this is too often overlooked!). . Also, don't pass up their creative milkshakes &amp; pumpkin spice cake (and I don't even like pumpkin)! . . (FYI: They offer breakfast at non-breakfast times; you just have to ask for the breakfast menu.)
