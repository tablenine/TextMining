Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Like others have said, there are so many reviews that mine may get overlooked but here goes.... . I used to live in Chicago and every summer for two months everyone found outdoor eateries to hang out at. After being couped up inside for so long, people just had to get out. When I moved to LA I was suprised that with such fantastic weather there were so few outdoor restaurants.. . Well, when I found The Alcove I was so excited. There is a line to place your order, but as has been said, it goes faster than it looks. Plus I need the time to go over the extensive menu. This is mostly fo me a lunch place and I tend to get one of their paninis or other sandwiches. There is no better place to have a bottle of rose wine with lunch on a warm afternoon.. . Oh, and I don't really like desserts but at this place I am always tempted. Every dessert is about 8 inches tall and covered in gooey richness. Super place to go on one of those LA 'sick days' when you just can't make yourself go to work...
