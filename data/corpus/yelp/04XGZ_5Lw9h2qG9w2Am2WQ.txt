Went to the truck in buena park. My co-workers were raving about it, so I love food, why not try it out. I arrived around 6:15 and the trucked opened at 6:30. The line was already long, but I chose to stay anyway. It began to rain which sucked but I just had to try it out.. . I order the chicken burrito and short rib taco. Wow it was really good. It had a different taste that I actually enjoyed. I took the burrito to work the next day and it was still delicious.. . Would I wait in another 1.5 hour line for this place again? Probably NOT. If I was a group of friends, probably so, I would probably just order tacos they were yummy.. . I think it is worth trying to say the least.
