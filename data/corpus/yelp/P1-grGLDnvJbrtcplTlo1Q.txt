Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
This place drips with nostalgia (and grease) and I wouldn't want it any other way.  Drunk Frat boys, cabbies, and Poncey regulars cram in the tiny diner for basic plates of eggs, BLT's, and whatever else can be cooked on a flat top grill.  As is the rule for any food consumed past Midnight:  the drunker you are, the better it tastes!
