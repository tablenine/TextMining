Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Ladies and gentlemen, brace yourself for sandwichy goodness. This place has been around for an amazing 100 years, which makes Philippe's the Godfather of all sandwich joints. But don't expect a murderous rampage as the kind ladies baptize your sandwich in heavenly au jus sauce (ask for double dipped!) All you'll be left with is a smile of satisfaction. Thirsty? Try a lemonade for 60 cents. Now that's an offer you can't refuse.
