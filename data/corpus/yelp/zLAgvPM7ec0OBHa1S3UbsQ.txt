Good food. Great service with kids (although not really a kids joint). We had a very patient server who treated wonderfully. Â The beer was tasty and the sweet potato fries rocked! I would also recommend their "make your own Bloody Mary" Sundays.. . When I move to Bucktown, I'll definitely be a regular.
