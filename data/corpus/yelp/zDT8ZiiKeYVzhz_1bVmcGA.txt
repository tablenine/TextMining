This was NOT what I expected...not AT ALL.  I assumed this place was another neigborhood, nouveau-cuisine-type joint with pricey, interesting dishes, a cozy atmosphere and a borderline snooty server.. . Well...it is KINDA like that...at least with respect to the food.  But the restaurant itself is more cafeteria/cafe-style: counter-service, long communal tables and free wi-fi.  It's SMALL...not a lot of people can be eating there at any given time and, despite the large tables, is a little cramped for large groups.  However, the counter-service style of ordering is GREAT for large groups 'cause you don't have to worry about who ordered what when it comes time to split the check.  Plus, it's BYOB.. . The food...EVERYTHING I put into my mouth at this place was A-MAZING.  Pricey, but totally worth it.. . What a refreshing model of food-service!
