I don't eat here much, but when I am looking for unlimited Lance's crackers, I know where to come. You see, they have a basket full of these things to tide your hunger as you look over the menu and wait for your order.. . Aside from those little snacks, the favorite thing for me here is the City Chicken Sandwich... It's a pizza bread sandwich, with roasted chicken, pesto, goat cheese, spinach, and mushrooms (which I get without). This thing is awesome... a truly great sandwich full of flavors. If you're a fan of goat cheese and pesto, this is a must try.. . And I heard the pizza is good too, though I have yet to try it. It's all about that City Chicken for me. Heh.
