Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Don't go here expecting a chicago dog, . don't go here expecting something healthy, . (personally) don't go here the day before traveling,. . DO go here for an experience that will involve tasty and gaudy hot dogs. I think I polished off three of their dogs in a lunch break. Slight food induced coma shortly afterwards, a well deserved break in my mind.. . Would I go again? yes, in heartbeat.
