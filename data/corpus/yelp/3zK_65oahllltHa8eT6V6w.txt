I LOVE this place!  The wait is super long, like an hour+ but so worth it.  I live in San Francisco and drive down to this location just for ramen.  For about $10 a bowl, you get a good size meal.  I took my sister and her roommate here and we all got the ramen bowls with the kotteri (I think that's how you spell it) flavouring and we ended up having left overs for later and that was all we ordered and it was the first meal of the day.. . Parking sucks! It's located right outside of Little Tokyo which is a huge plus for me since I love to shop.  the first time I went I had the yaki soba, and while it was still good, you shouldn't go to a steak house and order the fish, or the Ramen house and order anything but.  It's a TINY shoppe, so they really can't hold a group bigger than 5 without using more than one table, it's not perfect for groups, but they try to make it work.  The waiters and cooks are SUPER friendly as well so don't be afraid to ask for clarification!
