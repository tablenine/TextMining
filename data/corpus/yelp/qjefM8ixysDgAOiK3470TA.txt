Restaurant: Willy&#39;s Mexicana Grill
Category: Mexican
I like Willy's the best out of the main burrito chain restaurants, namely Chipotle's, Baja Fresh and Moe's. They have the best tasting burritos and lowest prices out of the four by far. . . This specific Willy's has a great location since you go into the park while or after you eat.
