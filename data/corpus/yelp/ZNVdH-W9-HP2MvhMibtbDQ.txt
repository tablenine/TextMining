ive been to lala's twice now and each time ive been, i left unimpressed and dissatisfied.  aside from their two types of sangria (white and red.  white isnt bad.  tangy and light, but i still prefer the red), i felt everything was just mediocre.  . . ive ordered the arroz del campo, which is just rice with bell peppers, onions, garlic, and mushrooms topped with feta cheese.  i just remember this being especially salty and boring.  . . ive also ordered the lomo lala's which is filet mignon topped with mushrooms.  this dish is served with mashed potatoes.  the mignon came out dry and a bit burnt.  the mashed potatoes saved this dish from being a disaster for me.  . . probably wont come back to this place unless im tied up and dragged here.
