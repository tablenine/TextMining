Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
4 star breakdown:. . 1. quick service. 2. fresh food . 3. one of the tastiest dumpling houses in SGV. 4. decor . . DTF may not live up to it's hype, but it's still the one of the best/better chinese restaurants in SGV. The service and food are quick, decor is modern, and the traffic ensures fresh food. I've been told that this location looks similar to the nicer DTF in Taipei. . . Cons: Make sure to go early or kill the 1hr+ wait at the nearby shops. I went at 5:15PM (weekday), and I didn't have to wait. Once the second floor opens up, it should help the congestion. Parking is terrible during peak hours. As my friend puts it, "supply and demand! - X" (the only thing she remembers from econ). The demand for parking spaces far exceeds the supply. DTF needs to make an underground parking lot!. . dishes I recommend:. crab and pork dumplings (10pc). red bean dumpling (10pc). chicken noodle soup. string beans. . other popular dishes:. shrimp and pork shaomai. shanghai rice cakes? chao nian gao. hm.. Â their fried rice isn't bad either
