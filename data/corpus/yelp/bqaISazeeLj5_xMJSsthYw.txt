Restaurant: Rodan
Category: Nightlife
It took me a bit, but I really warmed up to this place! If it weren't all the way across town, I would put this on my short list for a chill night out. When we walked in, Rodan was pretty empty (it was about 7:30 on a Saturday, but the restaurant/lounge filled up within the hour. Once you walk in, past the bar, large booths (think 6 people each) are lined up down the left while padded benches and low tables make cozy seating for conversation groups to the right. The low lighting, lounge feel, and low but audible music make this a great place to chat up your friends. The outer space movie playing on the large screen in the back of the room seemed a bit out of place. . . Anyway, I didn't eat, but the limited menu seemed pretty reasonably priced and the portions looked generous when they came out of the kitchen. We ordered a bottle of wine, which was also reasonably priced. . . An interesting, but somewhat irrelevant fact to people who don't get as much amusement from cool bathrooms as me: The mirror in the bathroom is somewhat self voyeuristic as a darkened video camera image of your face as you wash your hands (please wash your hand people - not washing is just disgusting and unsanitary) among the floating butterflies. I know it sounds weird, so go experience it yourself!
