Hetero bars are so not my scene but some fab Yelpers dragged me here after the Elite Event at Sura and may I say, it was funnnn! They had Magner's Cider, YUMMMMMMMMY!!! Â Bytheway, thanks Lori L. for the Magner's!!! I had missed it sine my summer n London! It is a great space for large groups or just for a few after work drinks. Apparently they have food which I didn't care for, but I'm sure it is nothing special. I did leave/lose my beautiful Yelp hoodie here though! :-(
