I'd like you a lot more if I didn't have to wait 40 minutes at times to be seated (!!!).. . Your menu isn't bad but I tend to stick to the boring staples (sesame chicken, basil pork with rice and fried egg) as opposed to trying some of the more adventurous things on your menu. The baked chicken and mushroom rice is alright. . . The really outstanding thing is, as echoed, your bubble tea - and I have a tendency to wait in the secondary line just for it instead of actually eating here - though I'm glad they DO have that little window, even if it's a cramped space to try to order in, especially when the area is being shared with people who are waiting in line to get their tables. . . If you really have a hankering for Joy Yee's, I'd reccomend picking it up in Naperville, Evanston or... well, somewhere that isn't Chinatown. It's a lot easier to stomach when there isn't a mile long line out the door. . . Still, I'll keep coming back (to the window at least) for the mango cream freeze / mango ice cream freeze. . . P.S. Durian fruit smells like unholy gym socks.
