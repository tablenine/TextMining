I went here with my mom when she was in town, and it was fantastic. We went in the middle a rainy Sunday, so there weren't a ton of people in here - but the atmosphere was nice, our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable, and the wine was fantastic.. . If you go, I definitely recommend checking out one of the flights; I got the Sexy Reds and was quite impressed; my mom got the Pinot flight, and was happy with that, as well. We also got the Bin cheese flight, which was very good, and split the red pizza. Both were very good.. . The location is also great - located right on Milwaukee Ave, and they have a sliding garage door that opens up the whole side of the restaurant to the street for some great people watching while you enjoy your wine.
