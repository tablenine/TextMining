This place is awesome.  I like hamburgers--a lot--but I went for the pulled pork sandwich while my girlie went with the pastrami...we both had the belgium fries...verdict?. . The Pastrami sandwich is the BOMB.  It's really, really good.  I like pastrami sandwiches, have eaten them in San Francisco, New York and other places in LA...and this might be the best one.  Seriously.  Worth the trip.. . I didn't check out the desserts but they looked good.
