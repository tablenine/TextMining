WOW. . . Just thinking about my meal earlier is making me drooool. My boyfriend and I arrived at 12:45pm and were greeted and sat immediately. And after reading the reviews on here we decided on getting the infamous #19, #88, and a large fries. . . OMG, yelpers...I can't thank you enough! The corned beef on rye was heaven! The sauerkraut was perfection. And the crunch of the bread as you bit into it was so so wonderful. After finishing my half of the #88, I was a little unsure if the #19 could be even better. Um...yeah!!! Mmm that pastrami was some of the best I've ever had. And the coleslaw was a great compliment...not too heavy on the mayo and had a great bite to it. . . If I had to choose between the #88 and #19...I wouldn't. Go here with a friend and split both! Ahhh sooo good, especially with a spread of hot mustard and a kosher pickle on the side. . . Service here was spot on too. Our waitress, Joan, seemed to genuinely enjoy her job and it made for a great dining experience for us. "First time here? You guys made a good choice!", she told us as we ordered. After our meal was finished, it was our turn to tell her "We loved it! And we'll definitely be back". . . *Note: Park in the lot on 7th &amp; Westlake. Â 1st hour of parking is free with validation!
