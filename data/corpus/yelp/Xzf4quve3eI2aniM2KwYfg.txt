Meh. The food was okay. It was more expensive than I expected it to be. The turkish wine is a ripoff. The glass was $7, and it was like 1/3 of a glass of wine. It cost me like $20 for my stuffed eggplant, and one glass of wine. They require you to spend at least $15 per person before you can do hookah. The first thing of tobacco is at least $15, charcoal is $3.50, and refill tobacco is at least $7. That is really expensive, just for hookah. I doubt I'd ever go back, especially since Udipi is just a couple doors down and infinitely more awesome.. . Oh, I also have to say, I hate the belly dancing, and I hate sitting on the floor. Since I went with a young professionals group, they reserved the part of the restaurant that was on the floor, which made it totally awkward for me - having my feet fall asleep, worried I was going to bump into someone while I was stretching out, etc. And THEN, the belly dancing. Good lord. Things would be quiet and pleasant in the room, and then once the belly dancer came in, they would BLAST the music so it was basically impossible to do anything other than stare at the belly dancer, because otherwise you'd have to shout over the music. Yeah, not a fan. Please allow me to have conversations, thanks.
