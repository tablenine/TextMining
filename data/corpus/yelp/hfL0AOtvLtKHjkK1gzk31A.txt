I don't understand how a hamburger place can serve a STALE BUN!!! how a chef can be so out of touch with what they're cooking shocks me. did the chef not even touch the bun? . ok i'll stop with the bun already. anyway, we went here for lunch, the place was dark, quiet, and empty, but not in a good way. our waiter was such a snob! no conversation and was giving us the impression that he was way too cool for school. . i had the Buffy (a burger w/ swiss cheese, garlic aioli, and red wine sauce)--it was just ok. And $10! . The only redeeming factor for this place was the over-the-top names of the burgers, ie the "guacamole bj--open wide"
