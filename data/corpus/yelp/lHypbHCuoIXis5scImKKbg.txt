Underwhelmed. I brought my mom here for mother's day this year and they were out of everything. And this wasn't a situation in which we strolled in really late and they were out of a couple of things. They were out of about 40% of the menu and I made reservations... Didn't exactly make us feel special! Â In their defense, we were given a free basket of cookies as a "peace offering." That was nice, but honestly... I didn't go for cookies. After skimming the remaining items that were your basic egg scrambles and so forth, I decided on some kind of omelet and my mom got the shrimp and grits. I was not really impressed with either dish. I could have made mine at home, and the shrimp and grits was only okay. Our bloody marys were devoid of alcohol. I will say that I like the fact that they specialize in local food and have reasonable prices. Might have liked it even more if they actually carried the things on their menu.
