Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
One of the best ramen places you can find on valley.  Only second to Daikokuya.  However, a big turnoff about this place for me is the screaming men and the plethora of questions the server asks you about what goes into your ramen soup base.  Some people may like those gimmicks as it probably adds to their experience, but for me its just exhausting and unecessary.  Overall, the ramen is pretty good.  I recommend getting the spicy miso paste (+$) that you can mix into your ramen.  Just don't get too excited and throw the whole thing in there.  You will be sweating bullets.
