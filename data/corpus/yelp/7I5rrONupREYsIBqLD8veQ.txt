Hidden bombshell.  I can't express how many times this placed wow'd me throughout the night.  Mostly the line in the beginning was more of a distilled and prickly wow but rest assured I had a waiter come to us during our stay in the line and hand us menu's and take our drink orders.  When we got inside we received our beers.. and might I add that for beer lovers this place is definitely a hot spot.  They had so many unique and awesome german beers all represented with their own brand name glass.  I had the Spaten Optimator (Yes the name is intense) and it was some sort of Apple Cider hefenweizer (which was delicious but had a small portion.)  . . After we placed our orders we could go to the restaurant in the back in which to be honest I didn't even know existed and was not even expecting a sit down restaurant.  When I got back there I was surprised;  girls, live DJ,  full bar; what an awesome scene.  The food was brought out shortly after and not to be too harsh but it was just a glorified hot dog... needless to say it was a hot dog of the highest quality.  It was delicious... but the Fries with the White Truffle oil on top was jaw dropping.  I had never tasted fries like that before but they had to of been some of the best fries I've ever had.  . . The service was badass as all the waiters were pretty chill guys and and attended us as we waited.  Its definitely a scene you have to take someone in LA if you wanna show them a fun &amp; interesting dinner.  My only complaint is that the parking &amp; the area around the place kinda suck.. other than that it was off the walls.
