I was here once, and the martini I had was extra super duper strong, but still very good. Drinks are a wee-bit pricey (but aren't most martini bars?). . . The vibe and crowd is solid, a good mix of people and it doesn't cater to any one particular scene. It's a good spot for just about anyone looking to grab a drink and possibly shoot some pool.
