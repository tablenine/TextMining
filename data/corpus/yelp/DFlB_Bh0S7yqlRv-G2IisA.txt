They need to open one up in the West SFV.  Suck's I have to wait till I need to go to Burbank or Glendale to get me some.  Cakes and pasteries speak for themselves.  Place is always jammed with customers.  I love the sandwiches for lunch, that bread is great.  Not greasy like some other cuban sandwich shops in So Cal.  Also, grab a box of potato balls, empanadas with your pasteries.  You'll want to hit that when you get home before you work the pastries.  Glendale parking blows... those meters are a pain and only accept coins and credit cards.  Burbank is a little easier in and out.
