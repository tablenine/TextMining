This is the go-to place for neverending coffee, late night pre-hangover food, and morning after post-hangover greasy food. Or mid-day drinking and munchies. . . The atmosphere is fun, the menu is huge, and the waitresses are always friendly (and mostly in miniskirts.) . . PS. If you're feeling brave, try the vegetarian burrito/wrap thing... more jalapenos than one man should be able to handle, but you'll feel a great sense of accomplished once you finish it. Oh and pain. Great sense of pain.
