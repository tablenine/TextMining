Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
yes...cheese and cupcakes and the best salad selection a deli could ever have. (roasted roots and fennel, various mushrooms, broccoli rabe, green beans, snow peas &amp; asparagus...scallion pancakes, pastas...so many choices. . Choose 3 for under 11 bucks and you can share it with a friend.. . Best of all, despite the occasional icky Hollywood patron, the service is so sweet, patient and friendly to everyone. Saints, I tell you.. . Other than the rough-hewned heaven that is Canter's, Joan's is my favourite neighborhood deli.
