Good service, fantastic food and well-made drinks. Even though this is a seafood joint, I think they serve the best burger in L.A. My friend Eric took me here for my birthday and we had the best time. Eric had some sort of quiche and I had the Pug Burger. Â The Pug is served on grilled sour dough bread and comes with some of the best blue cheese I've ever eaten. We drank greyhounds... the grapefruit juice was fresh squeezed and the garnish was a house-made candied grapefruit peel. I hope to go back and try the crab legs. I lived in Boston for years and can't seem to find good crab legs on the Left Coast. There is hope with The Cat!
