This is a great brunch place for all to check-out.  They have both comfort food as well as healthier options.  They have sandwiches and  salads to go along with their main breakfast dishes.  I've been there only twice, but the food has been chamazing when I've been.  The place is really nice and spacious.  The first time, I had scrambled egg whites with some whole wheat toast, a cup of fruit and a baked sweet potato on the side.  I'll go anywhere for a back sweet potato, so I was very happy to see this as a healthy side.  They also gave me some some sliced tomatoes on the side as well.  The service was really good and quick.  The second time I had sweet potato pancakes, which were out-of-this-world.  Really great flavor and not too filling.  This was the regular and I wasn't too hungry, so keep that in mind.  The place is also not expensive at all, as the first meal was about $7 while the second was about 7 dollars with some added bananas on the side.  Great farmers' market omelellete and the blueberry salad as well as the thanksgiving sandwich were great lunch additions as well.  Great experience and can't wait to go back.
