I've enjoyed my experiences here.  I especially enjoyed seeing the shock on my friend's face as he discovered that his seafood cioppino cost $50.  Hehe...gotcha.  At this place, you have to expect it.  It's not cheap.  But the food quality is high.  The roasted crab and garlic noodles are excellent.  I have heard that the recipe is closely guarded.  Don't tell anybody, but I've figured out one of the ingredients: garlic.  I should be on Top Chef.. . The appetizer sampler was a great value.  The rolls, crab puffs, and beef satay were very good.  The scotch was strong.  There were some interesting cocktails that I must say took me to that "Place of Deliciousness" that we all try to reach.
