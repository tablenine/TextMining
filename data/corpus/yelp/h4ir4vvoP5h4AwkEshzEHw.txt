We went her for lunch during restaurant week. The service was great and I liked that they assumed everyone was ordering off the fixed price menu and gave it to you right away. While the Kobe sashimi was delightful, the rest of the meal was lack luster. We both ordered the aged burger mine medium with cheese, the husband's well done. Of course I got the well done with cheese and he got the medium. Desert wasn't all that great either. The slice of prime was okay except that it had this weird marshmallow icing that had a rubbery consistency. Overall it was a good place to go for a deal but I probably wouldn't pay full price.
