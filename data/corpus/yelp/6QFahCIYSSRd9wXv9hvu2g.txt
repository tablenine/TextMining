Great Spot for a first date. There is no sign over the door so your date will get the impression that you're in the know ;-) . It's has a cool atmosphere in that minimalist hipster sort of way. It's also dirt cheap and really tasty. Look for the Rambutan sign on the restaruant next door (also pretty good). It's just east of parkman on sunset.
