This place is so sceney it hurts.. . You almost can't blame Fred 62, though. It's not their fault that rail-thin, strung out trannies in dresses that are actually belted XL t-shirts skate in and out the front door. . . But the food is mediocre (and that's being generous). I adventurously (stupidly) ordered the udon. It was super salty and greasy. The BF ordered a BLT, which is hard to mess up. The place really is a glorified Denny's, but with an "edge".. . I dunno. I feel like you have to quit your job and take up drugs to feel comfortable there. . . Or maybe it's that I moved away from the Bay Area to get away from all that skeezy crap and I feel like it followed me here in the form of Fred 62.
