Restaurant: FOX Sports Grill

There was so much anticipation and hype about everything that opened in Atlantic Station. I was excited about Fox Sports Grill, but ultimately I don't have too much to say about it. The food and service, the times I have been, were just okay. Waiting for a seat because everyone is there to watch a game did not entice me, when I could be on my own couch watching my own big screen. I guess I just expected more from another restaurant named after a television station.
