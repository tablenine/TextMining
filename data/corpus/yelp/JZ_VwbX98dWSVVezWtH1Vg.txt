Restaurant: El Azteca
Category: Mexican
Everytime I drive down El Azteca, I always glanced at this restaurant and was amazed at how people seem to pack this restaurant every single day, regardless of the time of the day.  Since I'm not a Mexican food fanatic, I tried to stay far away from this restaurant, but one day, my boyfriend dragged me into this restaurant.. . Once I was sitted, a bowl of tortilla chips with salsa came out.  This was totally new for me, since I never went to a Mexican restaurant before.  I got Vegetarian Quesadilla and my boyfriend got Fajitas Authenticas with chicken.  I hated mine and my boyfriend loved his.  Service could have been faster and nicer, but with that many crowd, I don't blame them.  So overall, it is a good restaurant to go with a bunch of your drinking buddies.
