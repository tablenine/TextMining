Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
Hamburger Mary's is my staple brunch/hangover destination on the weekends. I stop by at least twice a month to cure my Friday night debauchery. I've been here more times than I can count but this past weekend made me realize what a 5 star restaurant is in Chicago.. . 5 stars bypasses the food, the service, and the atmosphere. It's simply a place I enjoy going to and is always top of mind. Hamburger Mary's also has one of the best black bean burgers in the city. It's fantastic, because you can get any hamburger style just swap out for a black bean burger leaving you with over 10 burger options! Not to mention, the sweet potato fries are spectacular. . . Aside from food, I've come in for vodka lemonade pitchers, mimosas, bloody Mary's, and I'm never disappointed. The key to a good drink is a solid price with a hard punch. Their drinks are always incredible. The service is always very welcoming and helpful. I came in once and had a difficult waitress, but I chalked that up as part of the experience. The joint is usually packed around brunch on the weekends so make sure you make a note of that. The patio is open (sat there this weekend!) and gives you the best view of the comfortable and chill Andersonville. Great place!. . I've been meaning to stop at their location in LA but haven't gotten around to it. If there food and service is anything like it is in Chicago, I won't be disappointed.
