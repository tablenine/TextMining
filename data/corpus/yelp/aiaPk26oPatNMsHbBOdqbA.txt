over 840 reviews, is this one necessary either? LOL. two words: CHEESE ROLLS. omnomnomnom.. . the line is freaking ridiculous in the bakery side, so i highly suggest going to the cafe side that's also connected (the one with more seating than standing room), and wait in line there. it's much shorter, but omg you really have to know what you want cuz they do things hella fast and quick here.
