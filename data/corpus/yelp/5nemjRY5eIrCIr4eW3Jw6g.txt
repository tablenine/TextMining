Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
The idea of only serving domestic micro-brews is great when you offer such diversity.  I especially enjoy reading the tasting notes.  And I thought I knew beer...wow.. . Tons of options on sandwiches and what I've had has been very good; all the sides are also good.  Still, I don't think it's worth the price - especially as slow as the service was.  I ordered a second beer with half a sandwich left and got it when we were ready for the check.  Had to flag down the server twice before we got water refills.. . When I have so much variety to choose from and in the end I'm just as happy as I would've been with a $6 normal sandwich, it's hard to justify returning regularly.  I'll take beer-loving friends here but that's about it.
