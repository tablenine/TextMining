meh. . . I'm not the biggest fan of celeb owned eateries. I feel the name clouds the quality of the food. That being said, this is Ashton Kushers establishment. I knew this coming it. It was mediocre sushi at a premium price. The waiters/ hostess' looks are inversely proportional to their intelligence. You have been warned! . . Order the blushing geisha... it was yummy, and I don't even like alcohol. As for sushi... the best roll there is the surf and turf (fillet and lobster). Stray away from any of their tempura style dishes, the batter is quite bland. The beef yakatori was so tender! Melt in your mouth status.
