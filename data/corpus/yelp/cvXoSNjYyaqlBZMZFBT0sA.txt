I've ventured off the beaten path. Tacos were my favorite and worth every penny but I'd like them even better if they weren't smothered with the citrus sauce that is on everything at kogi. Â I'd pass on the kimchee/cheese quesadilla it wasn't crispy but rather soggy. The korean spiced fries were good but nothing to write home about since it was just plain ol' fries with korean seasoning on top. I'd also try to korean mini burgers which were superb. Definitely the craze around LA and if you haven't tried it yet.....I suggest you hunt them down or stalk them on twitter. :) BTW: They're on abbot kinney on Fridays at midnight and you can find them at the alibi room on Washington Blvd everyday.
