I love this place so much I think I'm going to marry it.. I had the Daikoku Ramen for $8.50 and a order of their gyoza. . The gyoza was deliciously fried to perfection and the Ramen...ohh...the ramen was SO SO good. The Â perfect amount of savory goodness, not too salty, not too bland. The pork belly just melted in your mouth. I can eat and entire meal out of pork belly here.. My friend got the shredded pork bowl and I nearly squealed in delight when I tasted this. That will be my next dish I order all to myself. No Sharing. . I highly recommend and I will be going back during my lunch hour FOR SURE. The wait is a little long but I say it is well worth it.
