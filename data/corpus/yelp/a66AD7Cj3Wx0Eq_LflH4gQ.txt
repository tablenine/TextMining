Eat here its good!  . . Thats all I really need to write about this place.  Good BBQ and Roast/Grilled chicken.  The brunch is suprisingly good too.  Sides are delicious.  The interior is fun and the outside patio is a nice spot when there is good weather.  Parking is good too since the street is not too overdeveloped yet.  Go, eat, support non-chains.
