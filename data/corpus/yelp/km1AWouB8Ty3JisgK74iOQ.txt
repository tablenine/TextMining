Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Last time I went to Tito's Tacos was about 2 years ago. I left completely underwhelmed and wondering why people wait in such long lines for such bland tacos. Now that I work pretty close by, I gave it another go this afternoon - after all at 11:30 it was early so there wouldn't likely be a huge line.. . When not having a long line is the best thing going for a place, it's not really a place I wants to be at. I got 3 tacos and a drink. The salsa was more liquid than salsa should ever be and not a thick liquid - it was watery. Same could be said for the "hot sauce" I asked for - it was basically small bits of pickled jalapenos soaked in water giving it pretty much no shot of packing any punch. The tacos were ok: nothing special, quite bland.. . It's a bad sign in LA if you're at Mexican joint and you look around and there's no Mexicans. Next time I think Tito's, I'm heading to Cinco de Mayo directly next door to it.
