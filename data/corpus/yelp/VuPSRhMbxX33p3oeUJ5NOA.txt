French Dip! What What!!! i say that while I am thrusting my hands in the sky with total satisfaction.  Cafeteria style with the sawdust all over the floor.  PLace is friggin huge! and always friggin busy! so have one of your compadres scope out a booth while you order.  The good thing is, they know that they are always busy.  They have a bunch of registers going at once taking your order.  I feel like I am in line at Magic Mountain just waiting to ride rickety old Wooden Roller coaster that everyone loves but knows it will only last for so long.  Cash only! they are quik getting your order so I felt uncomfortable dillie dalliying around at the front of the line, trying to decide what I wanted.  NOTHING!!! and I Mean NOTHING is better than thier Spicy Mustard.  I think it is from another planet. It is sSOOoooo good. HOT!!!
