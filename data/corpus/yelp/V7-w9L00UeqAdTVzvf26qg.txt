I had a great idea and have decided to write my reviews as they happen. I'm here at El Azteca now. I've just ordered some creamy queso dip and a large mango margartia. Should be great.....(15 minutes later)...Just checking in. Wow! These margaritas are really terrific. And the queso totally hits the spot. I've ordered the steak fajitas as an entree....(5 minutes later)...I just did something totally spuntaneous and ordered another giant margerhita while waiting for my faheetas....(10 minutes later)...Jesus effing s#$%, I burned my hand on the fajeeta skillet and had to dip it in my margaritta to cool off. Had to get anuther margareetha since my hand is in the other one....(15 minutes later)....haf waiter called taxi and taking fajeetas to go snack is deelishous u shuld come here beweer marghereetas hit u fast...(10 minutes later)....al;jsde4vl;kj 3asl;;xjdsei...
