Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I was very happy when they opened this restaurant in Rosemead.  I don't have to drive to Gardena for tasty ramen noodles.  Our kids also love this place.  I am not sure if it is the noodles or that their favorite cartoon character (Naruto) loves ramen.  Anyways, their lunch set menu is a good value for kids.  Parking on weekends can be busy because there is a dim sum restaurant in the same plaza.  Parking on weeknights is no problem.  Over the years, their quality is very consistent.. . You have your choice of noodle texture and strength of soup base and oil.  Noodle refills are 99 cents.  Overall it is a good value.
