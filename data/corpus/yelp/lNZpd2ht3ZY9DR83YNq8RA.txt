Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
Believe me, Bossa Nova is a must try!. . Went twice in one week because after my visit, I had to go back to get me my yucca fix. . . Ambiance: Relaxed environment. Seating available inside and outside.. . Service: Attentive staff. The waiter consistently came back to check on me and my boyfriend.. . Food: AMAZING! Everything had so much flavor! My boyfriend and I had the minestrone soup, shrimp appetizer, sausage and yucca platter, fried plantains, and the yucca with parmesan. All which I had no complaints about. I highly recommend the shrimp and yucca appetizer. . . Price: Everything is decently priced. You can have a filling meal and some leftovers for about $30-$35. Not bad for two people! . . Parking: There's a valet lot behind the restaurant for $4. Other than that, Â there's usually street parking. . . Tip: After 8PM it becomes a madhouse. People are all over the front of the restaurant waiting for tables, so get there early!. . If you're into Brazilian food or even just trying something new, Bossa Nova is a great pick.
