This place is just OK overall.  No complaints about the food (it's hard to mess up pancakes and waffles) but as others have noticed the service is... glacial.  Also, be warned that the lock in the men's bathroom is broken.  It looks like part of the door was eaten by a small animal so there's no way to secure it.   It's one of those with a urinal and a toilet and the toilet is pretty far away from the door so that can be problematic.  If forced to use the toilet, probably best to talk to yourself constantly in a loud voice or cough often so nobody comes in.
