Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
This place should be called El Tepeyuck.  I first came here years ago after one of my friends said the Hollenbeck was the best burrito in LA.  I'm no burrito conossieur, but I'm pretty sure that I bit into a brick of lard.  The smell alone is enough to make me yack.  I recently went again to give it a second chance, but BLECH!!  I really do not like the food here.  This isn't real mexican food, don't be fooled.  If I could erase one restaurant experience from my memory, it'd be this one... or Tito's Tacos (another place I don't get).
