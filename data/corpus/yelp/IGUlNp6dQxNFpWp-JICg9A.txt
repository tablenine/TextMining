First, the restaurant is beautiful and I am glad they are in our neighborhood.  The staff I encountered on my first and only night to eat there was so kind (host, hostess, waitress, bartenders) and welcoming.  I felt like they wanted my business and they treated us very well.  . . My 3 star rating is because we had a few let-downs with our dinner.  We ordered the flatbread with squash blossoms and buttermilk ricotta to start.  Sounds wonderful and delicate, right?  It should have been, but whoever prepared it had a seriously heavy hand with the coarse salt.  I'm not opposed to salt and my husband is always telling me that I should add more to my cooking, but we could not eat more than 1 piece.  I had the bacon wrapped brook trout and it was good.  No complaints, but no real excitement.  My husband got the fried chicken. The chicken was great and I consider myself someone that knows alot about the dish.  However, the waffle was bland.  It would have been better with potatoes.  What redeemed the whole meal was the PEAS side dish!  Get it if you go and eat them with your fried chicken.  We did not try dessert.
