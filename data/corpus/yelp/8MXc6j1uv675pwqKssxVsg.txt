For such a beautiful,romantic and nice location, so sad the food is eh so so.... Now I dont mind any of the dishes I have had here,but I wouldn't journey out for it.... Heres the twist though there banana split is absolutely grand e vu, lov it!. Very nice size, easy split for two and would never be sick of ordering... . So Â my advice? Eat here you wont necessarily regret it,its cute and romantic and trendy enough.. Honestly though I could have skipped the pasta dish and tuna tar tar and had dessert and wine alone and melted away with the dessert!. . its semi pricey,but depends on what you order so b/w 25-45pp easy
