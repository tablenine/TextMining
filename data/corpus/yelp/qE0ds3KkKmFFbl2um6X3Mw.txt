We had to wait 45 minutes just to sit at the bar (note to self: make reservations next time), even at 3 in the afternoon!  Apparently, the tables are for reservations?. . The eggplant caponata was simply delicious...although I kind of expected it to be served as a hot appetizer instead of a chilled one.  Either way, it was fabulous.  We ordered the Benno pizza (speck, pineapple, and jalapeno) and the proscuitto di parma.  Both were tasty.  I especially liked the Benno -- the combination of flavors (salty speck, sweet pineapple, and kick of the jalapeno) went soooo well together.  What a creation!  Oh and I absolutely loved the thin crispy crust.. . The Benno pizza arrived extremely late (~20 min after the proscuitto) due to some issues with the baking and we had our server check on it twice actually.  Overall, experience was pretty good but the food was even better!
