This place is just "ok". The food  is really no different in taste from any other sit-down Mexican restaurant, but the atmopshere and decor is nice.. .    It's not very expensive here, but for the price I was hoping for more than just canned refried beans (at least that's what they taste like). You do get a lot for what you pay for though. I remember leaving very full from this place. . . The drinks here are also very good. The Sangria and frozen margaritas: yummy.. . HUGE downfall is that it is so noisy you can't even hear yourself think. When I go to dinner at a restaurant, I do not want to think I am in a frat bar.
