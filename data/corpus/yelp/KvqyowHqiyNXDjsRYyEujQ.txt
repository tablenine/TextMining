Average at best. . . Went here for a date which was a good choice as it offered a casual and fun atmosphere yet was still nice and "trendy"...not -too- casual but not too pretentious.  There was no wait either, so that was a plus!  . . Started out with steamed potstickers which were just fine.  Was in the mood for something a bit spicy so I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken which, in hind sight, was a mistake.  The chicken was nowhere to be seen, the presentation was from that of a six year old, I was less than impressed with the food, especially after reading so many good reviews.  . . Sure, I'll come back here if it's easy and I'm hungry, maybe try to give the food another shot (perhaps I just ordered wrong...), but I doubt I'll be going out of my way to bring anyone else there.
