This is a fantastic Authentic Mexican restaurant from the people who brought you the vortex.  The food is really good and fresh.  The  decor  has a Day of the Dead style to it.  And the typical quirky Vortex type staff.. . The food is fantastic.  I highly recommend the Queso Fundido appetizer and the super bad ass Carne Adobo Taco's.  Hey and they even knew what an Arnold Palmer was.  The food is about the most authentic Mexican as I have found in Atlanta as far as the spices and ingredients used.  Anyone who confuses this with Tex Mex is crazy!  . . They have a well conceived Tequilla list as well as the usual Bar suspects and Margarita's.. . I will return here as often as I can.     A1 Mexican Fare!
