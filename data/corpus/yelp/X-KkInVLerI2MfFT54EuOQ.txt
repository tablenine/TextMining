Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Total garbage. Hour+ wait for boring hotdogs. The hotdogs themselves all have a tough, thick, chewy skin that makes eating them uncomfortable, and they are served on a cheap, tiny bun. I got a dog with chili, guacamole, and bacon. Everything was pretty average. The only redeeming factor is the onion rings.. . The reason the line is so long is because the staff is slow as hell. I'd say skip it in case you always wondered what a 7 dollar hotdog tasted like.
