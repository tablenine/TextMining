The sushi here isn't terrible; in fact, it's delicious. They get creative as well as providing standard rolls. The staff is friendly and the bartenders are even friendlier. All the makings of a great restaurant are here... but buyer beware. There's a freebie lurking around the corner that ruins the experience. . . Wednesdays from 5-7pm, there's free sushi and cocktail specials. If you're smart, you'll reserve a table ahead of time so you have somewhere to sit. If you're smarter, you'll avoid the deal all together. It isn't that the sushi is crap compared to ordering off the menu; it's the people who attend this event. If you don't grab sushi the moment that plate is brought out, someone else will. And they'll grab not one, not two, but TEN of each type out there, piling a plate like it's freaking Golden Corral. The sushi chefs seem to struggle to keep up with the demand, and it was such a fight to get anything that I wound up going out right after to get something else to eat. It's not the fault of Steel per say, but the space really isn't meant for trying to violate the fire code with people who act like that's the last plate of food that will ever appear on earth.. . Come here for a regular meal to truly enjoy your food and experience, or perhaps show up right at 5 for the free sushi. Otherwise skip the Wednesday special. Your sanity will thank you.
