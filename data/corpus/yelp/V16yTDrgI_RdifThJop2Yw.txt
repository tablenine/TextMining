Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
when Â the booze stop flowing and the late night munchies kick it, especially for that greesy taco or burger, come by pink's and you'll see a flock of people waiting in line to clog their artery with enough grease to last a decade. After you demolish your bacon+melted cheese Pink's hot dog you will definitely knock your ass out, "you're gonna like the way you physiologically feel (aka 99% of your body's circulation going to your stomach, hence rendering you in a state of drowsiness and food induced coma) , I guarantee it"
