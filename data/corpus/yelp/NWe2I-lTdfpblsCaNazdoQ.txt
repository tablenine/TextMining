Restaurant: Wishbone
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I now consider chef Joel Nickson a friend, but I was enjoying his cooking long before I ever met him. His first Chicago place over on Grand Ave. was THE spot for weekend breakfast (the wait be damned), even before branching out to the West Loop, Lincoln Park and now... FitzGerald's Nightclub in Berwyn.. . Here's the deal about Wishbone's food, and every other restaurant in the world: Consistency is the holy grail, as everyone has a slightly different interpretation on a recipe, regardless of measurements and training and skill level. That's what's good AND bad about cooking - every individual imparts a slightly different feel into what appears to be the same dish - on paper, anyway. . . Not to say Wishbone's food isn't good - it definitely is. But when Joel's cooking, his personality, style &amp; chemistry all come together in the kitchen, it's just dynamite on a plate. As I've told Joel, I think whichever of his restaurants he happens to be working at the time has the best food - because he's there to keep an eye on things. . . Another thing about Joel: The guy really has the "touch," and is truly beloved by his customers. The guy has more fans in the city than you can imagine, from heavy politicians to world-famous professional athletes to artists &amp; musicians, famous entertainers (whassup, Oprah!) to mobsters, cops, ad agencies and everyone in between. Quite a blend.. . Finally, somebody show me another restaurant in town where there seems to be an equal appeal with black &amp; Â white customers, all digging the same menu, sitting side by side during a crazy busy brunch. Now THAT'S what's known as a "wide demographic..."
