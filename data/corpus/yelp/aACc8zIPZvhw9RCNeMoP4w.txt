This authentic Thai place continues to be my favorite.  The former wait-staff was more friendly (same chef and mgmt but mostly new employees since mid-summer 2009).  But this team provides excellent service.  The BYO policy is also a bonus, but I'd go regardless because of the food - it's consistently outstanding.
