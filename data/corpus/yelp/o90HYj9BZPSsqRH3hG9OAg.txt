Another brownie point for the Avondale neighborhood! The shrimp-fried rice is my favorite, authentic and delicious, and you can't beat their delivery time. They have been in Avondale for ages, and I've been eating out and getting delivery for over 20 years, with no change of quality! This is a must-visit in Avondale.
