I tried them after reading a few of the comments on Yelp. Guess I didn't get what everyone else got, because my food was "meeh"...I was definitely disappointed with the General's Tso's chicken. Not sweet enough...It was too salty. Maybe too much soy??? . . Anywho...the delivery was definitely FAST! I will give them that. But the spring rolls were not the best. Not as fresh as I would like them, cooked in old oil probably. . . Oh yea...I got some won ton soup. (Whatever that is. I mean, really, I've heard of it, but still don't know what a "won ton" is. *shrug*). Really, I just looked up the ingredients online (broth, chicken, etc.) and it sounded good so I decided to try it. It was probably the best thing I had from there. I really liked it! With those little crispy things... :-) I like, I like!. . So unless your'e bored, don't feel like driving out for lunch or going to get something other than the General Tso's, don't waste your time.
