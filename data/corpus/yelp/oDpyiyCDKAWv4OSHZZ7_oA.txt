Ambiance isn't what I'm used to in an Indian restaurant (many NYC spots are holiday lights GALORE)...but it had a romantic touch w/ the red candlelight.. My bf had never had Indian food so it was great that the food was delicious!!. Service was great too...the waitstaff were on point, making sure we had water &amp; cleared any finished dishes.
