Restaurant: Nacional 27
Category: Latin American
I love strong flavors and spice and that is why I am drawn to Nuevo Latino food. One of my favorite restaurants in the city is Cuatro and although I begged my boyfriend to take me there, he insisted that we branch out and expand our dining repertoire.  I was more than agreeable as I too had been wanting to try Nacional 27.. . After looking over the menu we decided that it would be a good idea to just stick to the tapas section and ceviches instead of trying entrees.  Perhaps that was were we we went wrong.  Everything we had was just ok, but nothing was all the memorable or motivating us to return to this restaurant. Nacional 27 seems to overplay sweet flavors...truly EVERYTHING we had was sweet.  And nothing that we had was all that spicy.  My guess is that this restaurant is playing down spices to appeal to a larger crowd of people.  This was a big let down for me.. . We started with the guacamole because my boyfriend makes the best guac and is always looking for a challenger.  This guac tasted like avacodas only and had no flavor.    We then had two different ceviches and they were both good but we have definitely had better elsewhere.  We then tried an array of tapas that were all just ok.. . Although this was a 2 star contender for me...I have to give it an additional star because the restaurant is very beautiful.  We also had great service! However, Cuatro wins hands down.  Next time, I am not letting my boyfriend sway me away from taking me to Cuatro!
