I'll admit it, I stayed away from this place because it looked like such a typical trendy spot where people went to be healthy and look important.  while both those statements are true, I was missing out on one important thing - the food is AMAZING!. . I look the new york deli-style layout where you can see all your food from behind a glass.  we ordered a steak sandwich which was absolutely out of this world.  we complimented it with some garlic potato wedges and a REAL orange soda not made out of HFC syrup. . . the dessert makes me hesitant to return too often.  we sampled the fudge gelato, carrot cake, and the vanilla cupcake with raspberry filling.  O...M...G.  joan's, I love you, see you soon!
