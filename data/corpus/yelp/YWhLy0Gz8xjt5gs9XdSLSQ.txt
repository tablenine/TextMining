I love love love this place.  The food is amazing and wonderful and relatively inexpensive.  It's a wonderful gem.  I'm so fortunate to work close enough to come here for lunch.  I love the bread and the wonderful sauce they bring with it.  Their mashed potatoes are to die for.  I love their marinated chicken and their flat iron steak. The service is very quick and very good.  I would bring every one here if I could.  It's one of my favorite restaurants.  Bravo!
