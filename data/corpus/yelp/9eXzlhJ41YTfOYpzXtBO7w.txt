Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
We were recently in the Lakeview neighborhood.. My son and I were starving, and both of us craved Thai food.. Despite my earlier experiences with Duck Walk, we ventured in.. . The decor hasn't changed, it's small and cozy.  Service was friendly, no complaints.  There were about 3 servers on duty and another man that flitted in and out of the restaurant several times with menus in hand.  In reading others reviews, I now know what he was doing.. . We ordered fried shui mai, potstickers, shrimp pad thai and pineapple curry friend rice with beef.  The appetizers were very good, I tried one of each, but my little one polished off both. Entrees?  Meh.. We both really liked the pineapple curry fried rice, except for one thing.  The beef.  It was dry, chewy, and grey; the consistency was much like reconstituted beef jerky.  We both tried to eat a piece and subsequently spit them out into our napkins.  What was worse was that it had a very fishy taste, and I had flashbacks from my last experience here.  I did my best to behave like an adult, zipped my mouth and didn't say anything to discourage my little one from eating.  I discreetly removed all the grey bits of meat from our dish.  . The pad thai was average, the noodles a little too al dente for my taste.  The shrimp was thankfully deveined.
