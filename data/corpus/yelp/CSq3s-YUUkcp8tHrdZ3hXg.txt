A reason to go downtown other than to buy crack or go to the gun range!  This was a tough one to rank.  Hands down one of the coolest restaurants in LA.  Very good ambiance, great decor, great service.  Just wish the food was a bit better.  I feel like people rate this place highly because of its hip factor, which makes them less critical of what they're actually eating.  It does get crowded, but there is a nice bar area with tables as well.  One thing to note, bar prices for food are the same as the restaurant.  All in all though, I do really really like this place and wish I could give it 4 stars.. . Pizza - A bit bland.  The meatball is the best and the pepperoni is OK as well.  It's a good pizza as far as LA goes, but I'd say Village on Larchmont is better.. . Steak - It's ok.  Not bad, but not steak house quality.. . Mussels - Probably my favorite item on the menu.  Good size, great broth.. . Portobello Fries - Definitely unique and one of the more popular items.  Worth a try.
