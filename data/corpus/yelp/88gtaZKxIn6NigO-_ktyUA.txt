Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Like this needs another review, but oh well. . .. . Everyone talks about the lack of parking and seating, the crowded space where you stand to put your order in, and that it's overpriced, but Joan's food is terrific. The pickles can't be beat and you can buy some to go. We always get sandwiches and share the Salad Trio (a selection of three of their daily special salads) to share for $10.25. The Lentil salad is a standout. I can't go to Joan's and not order it. The Pressed Chicken, Bacon and Brie sandwich with carmelized onions on french bread ($10.75) is excellent! The Tuna Salad sandwich ($8.75) is also good, but it's for those who like their tuna salad with a lot of lemon. On the pastry side, the cookies are just OK, but the Rustic Apple Pie is really good. I have yet to try the cupcakes everyone is raving about. I looked at them recently and they look kind of small for $2.75-4.00 each. In summary, if you can deal with the crowds, the food is worth it.
