Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
"Meh. I've experienced better." . . Honestly, I have. I don't understand the hoopla and shebang for Daikokuya. I think it's because there really aren't any other good ramen places in Little Tokyo. I've been to the best ramen places in Japan, and of course, nothing compares. But there are other places in LA that have better ramen than Daikokuya, hands down. Daikokuya's noodles are a bit too hard for ramen noodles. They just don't seem fresh, plain and simple. The soup broth is very average - nothing special. And I have one problem with this place: the fried rice is SO oily! When I got my fried rice, it was literally - no exaggeration here - drenched in oil at the bottom. So folks, try somewhere else when you're looking for a bowl of ramen. . . Mmm Mmm
