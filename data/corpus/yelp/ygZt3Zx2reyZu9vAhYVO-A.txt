Mmm...yummy sandwiches and delicious breads. They are stocked with a excellent, homemade grab 'n go delights.. . I like this place but what's up with the fruit salad? It is so lame for a gourmet place. I mean, can you get more pedestrian than grapes, cantaloupe, watermelon, and (yawn) honeydew melon. Look, it is a pet peeve of mine but I'm sure many would agree. Step it up, Alon's!. . If you want really good fruit salad, go to Metro Fresh. They change up their fruit salad to keep up with what is in season - like mangos, kiwi, strawberries, peaches, etc. Yum!
