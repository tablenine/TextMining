Cencentrics no longer owns Stats and I can tell. More attitude and bland service. The good things about this spot are the roof top and the location. The food is fair nothig to write home about. Dantanna'shas great for for a sports bar. Stats has plenty of space which is great. However, having men and women use the same bathroom is gross.
