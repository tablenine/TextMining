I got a chance to look around before I dined here. I checked out where they brew their own beer and saw the pool tables and the rest of the restaurant. They have suveniors in front and they sell any variety of their own microbrew. The meal was hearty American style chops. . The service was very good and it was a relaxed atmosphere on the evening I was there.
