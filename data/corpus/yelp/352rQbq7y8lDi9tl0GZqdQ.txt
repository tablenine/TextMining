I've been here a couple times now, and too be honest, it would have gotten a 3 or 3 and a half except for the wait just brings it down a star.  The broth is good.  The noodles are way too undercooked and sort of just thrown in.  . . Its just really frustrating when you see 4 tables open and there's an hour wait.  . . Is it me or do most Japanese places suck with service.  I mean who has three servers working on an hour wait.  And then they bus and clean all the tables at once, so they get slammed. its really simple.  . . At least at Chinese places they are rude but fast.
