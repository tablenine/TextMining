We went to Mana Food Bar last night - between the extremely friendly service, the amazing pineapple/ginger sake cocktail and the really delicious food, I am not shy to say that we will definitely be coming back.  The outdoor seating area is great and will be summer fave this year.  Can't wait to try more things on the menu!
