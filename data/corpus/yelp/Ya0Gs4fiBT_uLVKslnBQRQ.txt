Restaurant: Krog Bar
Category: Tapas Bars
Krog bar is very small, but it serves its purpose well. Located in the same weird complex as Rathbun's, it makes a great place to get a glass of wine and appetizer before heading in to get your main entree. It also has a nice patio that makes for good stargazing at night after dinner for some wine and a desert. Classy, and elegant, take someone on a date here before or after dinner and you will be looked at with starry eyes, unless you just suck.. . Get here early because its likely that it will be crowded. Definitely best for small groups and couples.
