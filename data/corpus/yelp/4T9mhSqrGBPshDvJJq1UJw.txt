I had a really really good time.. A foursome, we did a couple of bottles of a nice Australian red (Syrah?) and split some appies that were delish (not as incredible as the description, but good nonetheless). Â The shrimps were amazing but the SAUCE they were in kicked ass.. I got the pork chop with sweet potato and barely left the bone.. Dessert was nanner pudding; perfect.. . Our server was great - he even knew the Eagles song of which we were trying to recall the city (Winslow) that our Alzheimer-like memories were spinning cycles on; very unobtrusive, yet always there when we needed him.
