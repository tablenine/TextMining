i love this place, and I'm so glad there's finally one that's closer to my house. this is our go to bakery when it's a coworkers birthday in our department. . . things i love to order: . potato balls . papa preparada (potato balls in a sandwich) . cheese rolls . fruit tart . basically all the desserts . . cakes i recommend: . chocolate grand marnier . mango mousse . triple chocolate mousse . . ***a lot less busier than the Glendale location
