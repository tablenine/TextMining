Restaurant: Uncle Bill&#39;s Pancake House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I liked Bill's just fine.  I always like breakfast food, so I'm pretty hard not to please.  The omelettes were pretty darn good.  Gigantic and bulging if nothing else.  I had the Manhattan with egg whites and I substituted the standard American cheese it came with for Jack (ew, kraft on my breakfast? No thanks).  It wasn't fancy like they'd try to make it at some brunch spot on 3rd in LA.  No - it was good ol' American diner food. . . The pancakes were just OK.  Nothing phenomenal for a place that has pancakes in the name.  Though the banana buckwheat seemed to be the best of what I sampled.. . It is a busy, happening brunch spot in Manhattan Beach.  The service was good for how crowded it was, so that's a plus.  Nothing to go out of your way for though.
