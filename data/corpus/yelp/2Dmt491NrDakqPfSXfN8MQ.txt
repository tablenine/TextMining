Okay so this is one of those Hollywood hot spots that people talk up so big that when you experience it, you're left disappointed.. . Let's start with the food: AMAZING! Wonderful! INCREDIBLE! RICH! TONS!. Restaurant: CROWDED! EXPENSIVE! FULL OF HIPSTERS! NOISY!. Service: SLOW! ARROGANT! EYE CANDY!. . This place is seriously raking in the cash...they've got you waiting up to an hour to sit, they serve you in about 15-25 minutes, and they want you out of there after first bite. . . If you don't feel uncomfortable having angry, hungry, tired people watch you eat and waiting to snag your chair...then feel free. However, for me...I thought this was WAY over rated.. . Go to Home instead located at 1760 Hillhurst Ave. This way you can SIT, EAT, and TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS instead of STAND, GET BUMPED, SHOVEL FOOD, and SHOUT.
