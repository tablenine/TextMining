I took my mum here for Mother's Day and was unpleasantly surprised by the $50 fixe price menu.  Zoikes!  Another bummer was that because they were only serving a set menu, I wouldn't be able to try some of the appetizers which I had read yummy things about.  . . I started off with the farro salad which I thought was tasty, but not  mind-blowing.  (But that was OK -  I mean, it's a salad after all).  My father complained about his appetizer asparagus soup being "too asparagusy."  I really didn't know what to say so I just rolled my eyes *twice* in response.. . For main course, I got the Branzino en Papillote, which is a European sea bass, served with the skin perfectly pan-fried to a crisp.  The fish was moist and flavorful.  Delicious!  I'm not a fan of heavy sauces and this sauce/broth was wonderfully light so that you could still enjoy the taste of the fish.  Others seemed to think that their dishes were OK, but not memorable (monkfish, pork chop, and steak frites).  That was a shame, since I really liked my fish.  Afterward, the dessert menu really didn't entice me so I finally decided on the profiteroles which were very very cold causing it to be very very hard.  . . I thought my meal was the best amongst my group.  Unfortunately, for $50/person, I expected a bit more.  I'd like to go back to try their fruits de mar plate (a tiered platter filled with fresh and raw seafood).  I selected this place because my mum loves raw oysters, so I was sorely disappointed when we were stuck with the fixed menu.  Next time, I think I'll just skip over to the bar and order a nice chilled white along with the seafood platter.
