I thought I was the first to write a review on this hidden restaurant on Yelp, but later found it's under Social rather than Social Resto Cafe Bar -- thanks to fellow Yelpers for your messages. =). . We wined and dined at this rather classy (yet usually causal) establishment on a Friday evening. Location is hidden between an acupuncture office and an office on a narrow road where people wouldn't think twice a restaurant could be found. Perhaps that's just how Atlanta is like -- finding the most randomest (if there is such a word) establishments at the most randomest locations.. . What I liked about this place is the vibe and decor. It has the European/Mediterranean feel. Servers were in shirts and jeans, yet the decor was rather classy -- which gives it a rather causal yet classy clash to the place. If you're dressed up or down, you'll fit right in. Severs and managers are quite friendly (could it be that it was a slow night? No one upstairs, only a few tables next to the bar.).. . After reading some other Yelper's reviews, we had a different experience. We ordered tapas and cocktails for the evening. Tapas consists of Salmon (decent), Meatballs (err...), Potatoes (stuffed with something that tasted very salty), Calamari (grilled, which is fine, but tasted burnt and very salty), and Mussels (very sweet and some-what dry -- which was a bit strange for my taste). Â Unfortunately, our overall experience with the food wasn't too pleasant.... . Will I be willing to give it another try? Sure, it's a nice place to chill with friends or to go to on a date, but definitely not for dinner. We end up going home and we each had a bowl of ramen noodle.
