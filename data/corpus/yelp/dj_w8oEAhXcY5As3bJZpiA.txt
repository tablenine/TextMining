What part of, "I'm allergic to dairy" didn't you get?  Hello, do you have a functional brain?. . Yeah, I'm pissed.  After recently discovering all my food allergies I am having a really difficult time eating out in this city, yes, the one where people specify the temperature of their lattes and shop at gourmet markets for their dogs.  . Why is it so hard to get a meal that doesn't involve dairy?. . Joan's has a gorgeous deli case.  I wanted three salads that don't contain dairy, which you think would be easy to do when choosing from 20 or more salads, right?  No.  The selections are there but the woman behind the counter was less than eager to help me pick.  Suggestion:  LIST THE INGREDIENTS.  Then I wouldn't have to bob my head back and forth trying to decipher the forbidden foods from those I can safely eat.  Made me feel like the jackass in front of the line who didn't decide what she wanted despite having waited in the line for a good 7 minutes.  That was annoying.  What was more annoying was the cashier's inability to communicate to the kitchen this little request.  My three salads arrived atop yet another salad covering in a white salad dressing.  Upon researching this white salad dressing, I was told that it indeed contains dairy.  And now I'll need to wait another 10 minutes for them to fix my order.. . "Excuse me, clueless cashier, do you mind if I get them myself?". . I want to love this market.  It's clean, it's fresh, it has variety, and remarkably, it's not even that overpriced.  You'd think a place like this that caters to the likes of local socialites would step it up a bit.
