Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Too many martinis for a school night had me desperate for biscuits and gravy. But it was past twelve, and finding a good meal gets tougher in this town as the night wears on.  . . The folks I'd met at the Castle said "hie thee" to Roscoe's.  . . Roscoe's.  We'd been great together when I was more partial to waffles  buried in butter and all.  Been a few years since I'd tasted that golden chicken skin from their pots, so why not?. . "How you been, Father?"  asked the small gal pulling a menu as I walked in.  . . I didn't need to answer. The up-and-down look she gave me told her enough. She nodded and led me through the rowdy, late-night crowd to a not-so-private table, and wished me a nice evening anyway.  . . I ordered quick; I'm like that.  . . I went through a couple of chicken breasts and a side of biscuits, all "smothered and covered," as they say, in gravy and onions.  Chicken a bit overdone, but tender enough inside to be rended easily from the bone.  Biscuits were a bit dense, and the gravy neither spicy nor hot enough to take my mind off that woman who'd been watching me in the bar earlier that night.  Where had I seen her before?. . At Roscoe's, it's all about the atmosphere.  Not a bad place for late night eats, if you go for inoffensive home-style chow.  Friends probably make it fun, but I wouldn't know.  Make a note - the booths are too tight for those of an easy appetite, and tables get hard to come by in one of the only games in town after midnight.. . Otherwise, bone appetit, chicken lovers; have a waffle and let me know how it was.. . - Father Fang
