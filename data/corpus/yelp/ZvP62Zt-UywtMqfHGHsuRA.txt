This place is tucked away in a small business strip that time has seemingly forgotten. The decor is modern and minimalist, and the noodles are pretty delicious. I usually get some sort of bun, and it's always plenty to fill me up! Wait times weekend nights can sometimes be long, but the crowd is always friendly and the food always fresh.
