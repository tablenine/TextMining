50% my ass. It's not a great deal when you normally price your rolls at 15 bucks. Don't fall for the marketing people!. . This restaurant is a prime example of a trendy, posh, japanese restaurant that is heavy on the atmosphere and light on the food. Place is packed on Friday and Saturday nights. The food is very average here. . . Nice outdoor seating area.. . Come here if you want to impress your date, but don't come for the Â food.
