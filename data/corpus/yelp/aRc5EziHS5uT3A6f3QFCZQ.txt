Ate here once... but probably won't go back. There are other spots in the city I'd rather go for breakfast. . . Food - OK. You can't take things out of your order (ex - I wanted the avocado omelet without onions and green peppers, but she said no because the filling was "pre-made".) I find it a little odd that there's a pre-made mix for an omelet, so I opted for something else. They do have the option for a plain omelet and then you can add in whatever you want (for .50 cents each extra item). Same goes for the wraps-- they are "pre-made" as well, so what you read on the menu is what you get - no changes. . . They are known for their cinnamon rolls... in my opinion they are OK(frosting comes on the side in a bowl - which is nice for those that want a lot or those that want just a little), but they aren't something to rave about. They weren't considerably moist and warm.... just average. They give you an oversized serving, but it's really just 2 rolls so it appears bigger. If I was really craving a cinnamon rolls - I'd prefer Cinnabon instead.
