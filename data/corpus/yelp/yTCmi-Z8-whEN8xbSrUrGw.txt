I've eaten here quite a few times, as well as lived in Westminster for a while (Little Saigon) and ate a ton of pho there.. . This place is just OKAY. Nothing special about it at all. Sometimes its decent, other times bad. Most times right in the middle.. . Bad experience: they served me a soup once that wasn't hot enough, there was no steam at all and the meat wasn't cooking. I told the server and he took it back, but when he brought me another soup it was ALL INEDIBLE FAT instead of the usual meat mixture. needless to say I was upset. Â I've had plenty of dac biet before and know what a proper soup should be.. . so beware, the cooks here have very bad attitudes and if you send something back they might give you something worse in return.
