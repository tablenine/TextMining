this place is really cool. you just want to stand outside and absorb the jaw-dropping view for as long as possible.. . the food and service however...OVERRATED!  i expected much more attention to service.  the waiter poured water on the floor about 3 times while refilling my glass. i saw him do the same thing on other tables too.  the staff fell way below what you'd expect at a nice restaurant.. . the food was good, but i've had better ahi tuna for less than half the price.  the lamb chops weren't great either. . . so if you're looking for some great food, this isn't your place.  if you're looking to impress somebody from out of town, go for it.
