Came here during restaurant week and the food, the service and the atmosphere was phenomenal.  The portions were a little small (because I ordered off the restaurant week menu), but they made up for it with a ton of side dishes.  . I got the South Side Petit Filet and it was so good.  I've never had dry aged steak and I didn't completely notice a difference, but nevertheless it was very good.. Our server was so helpful and friendly and always there when we needed him, but not overbearing at all.. I will probably go back again because it was that good, but it is a little pricey.
