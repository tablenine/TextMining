Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Being from the Bay Area, I felt eating at Lawry's was bit like House of Prime Rib Vol 2.  Other than the higher ceilings, lighting interior, and less rustic decor, the entire dining experience seemed more or less the same.. . The prime rib (down to the selection of cuts) was a facsimile of HOPR. The house salad dressing may have added one extra spice, but I couldn't tell given that like House of Prime Rib, Lawry's drenches the salad in enough dressing to obliterate any nutrional value or salad-like qualities.  The creamed spinach, yorkshire pudding, blah, blah, etc - exactly the same.. . Really the only two differences were the wine selection, which given that my uncle provided all ten bottles really cannot be attributed to Lawry's and the ambiance which had the feel of large hotel banquet hall as opposed to a dark rustic lodge of HOPR.  Sorry to say, neither decor is very memorable.. . But it seems like the standard by which Los Angelenos measure a quality prime rib and I can see why.  The good thing about Lawry's is that if I have a craving for a quality cut of prime rib, I know that's exactly what I'll get.
