Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Whenever I try to tell my friends about this place, they correct me. "You mean Joy Yee's Noodles." Nope! I mean "Joy's Noodles"!! This place has really, really good food. I have had my share of good and bad experiences ordering pad thai in the past. This place offered some of the best pad thai I've ever eaten! I was here a little over a year ago but my mouth is watering just thinking about their delicious dishes. The restaurant has a very friendly atmosphere and I really enjoyed my overall experience. My only gripe is that it is so far away from my apartment and parking in this area is a disaster. It makes it kind of difficult to enjoy this fare on a regular basis. However, writing this review has reminded of how much I love this place and I will have to make a return trip very soon!
