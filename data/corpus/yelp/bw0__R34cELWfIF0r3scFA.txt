Simply the best when you want delicious food! I visit Toast at least 3 times per week. I suggest the onion rings, the fries, mediteranian salad and the bmt. Also, the busiest times always produce your order quickest. It's great people watching too. Everyone used to go there super casual and now people come dressed like Jonahs brothers and Lady Gaga.
