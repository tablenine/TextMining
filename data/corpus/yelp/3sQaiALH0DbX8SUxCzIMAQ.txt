Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
they serve little balls of soupy dumplings full of deliciousness.  make sure you order the soup dumpling rather than the regular dumplings. i also order the shanghai rice cakes here which are really yummy, and usually a vegetable. the garlic sauteed green beans are my favorite, otherwise the pea sprouts are a good choice. make sure to make  your sauce for the dumplings: equal parts vinegar and soy sauce with the ginger julienne. when eating the soupy dumplings, take a small bite on the top, then allow some of the steam to come out so you do not burn yourself. i usually like to then dump the soup out onto my spoon, then eat the dumpling and soup separately.. . beware the wait, although it is less now that there's two locations. also beware that they only have soupy dumplings on the weekends, so if you go during the weekdays they may not have it on the menu.
