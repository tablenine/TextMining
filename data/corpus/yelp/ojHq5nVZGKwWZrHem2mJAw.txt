This place has restaurants and bar and lounge, so it's really cool place to hang-out or having a drink after work.....sangria is their best! They have the red and white sangria!. Also the mojito in here is great...it's HUGE (like beer size glass) with only $10! such a bargain! also they have regular coctails, e.g. cosmopolitan etc. They have 2 (two) huge screen flat TV. The DJ is the best, mixed the music of trance, hip hop, and R&amp;B so we wont get bored!
