Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria

Like other yelpers have said, their pumpkin and butternut squash ravioli was to die for!  If vegetables tasted like that all the time, I would be eating more of it.  My boyfriend had the pesto with cream sauce pasta which was excellent.  It was flavorful but not to heavy at all.  . . Sapori Trattoria is also BYOB even though they have a full bar ($15 corkage fee).. . Service was awesome.  Just make sure you have a reservation as they fill up fast.  Also, get on their mailing list as they give out gift certificates and such around your birthday.  I will definitely be coming here to eat more vegetables!
