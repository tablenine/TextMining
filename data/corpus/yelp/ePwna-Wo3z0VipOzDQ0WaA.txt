Restaurant: Busy Bee Cafe
Category: Soul Food
Good Soulfood for a decent price! Good Location for Lunch or dinner. The cafe is small but it feels like home! I always get the fried chicken w/ mash potatoes and macaroni and cheese. It is a delight everytime I pull in. Great Location for the AUC and even better for people who like good food regardless of the location! Thanks for servicing me and my colleagues during my stay in the AUC.
