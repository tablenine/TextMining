Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The new side of the restaurant is definitely nice for this type of restaurant.  But I don't like the steamed dumplings here as much as the other Yelpers.  (I am speaking specifically about the XLB and the crab filled XLB) I think they're overrated.  I honestly like J &amp; J better.  Don't get me wrong, the Din Tai Fung in Taiwan is awesome.  I have great childhood memories about going to the chain in Taipei and enjoying my meals.  it's just not the same here.  It's not that tasty to me.  Slightly overpriced.  The chicken soup here is fantastic, though.  The red bean steamed dumplings are pretty good but I wish we could order four instead of and entire order.
