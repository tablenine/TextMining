Sunday brunch at this place is great. I usually have the same thing for brunch...some version of eggs with cheese and a cinnamon roll. That was not really an option here so I had the breakfast sandwich. It is made with eggs and cheese so I was happy...but I was still longing for a cinnamon roll. There are not too many sweet options on the menu but I did have a fried dough thingy covered in sugar. Not too shaby.. The food was great. (I tried a little of everything at the table). The coffee was great, and I assumed it to be Intelligenstia but I was wrong. I asked the brand and promptly forgot it.. .  Our server was funny...it made some great jokes and really earned his tip in that way. However, he cut his tip in half when he forgot our drink order twice. Twice. Lucky for him, my friends and I decided to leave a big tip in hopes it does not happen to the next table.. . By the way, we arrived at 10 on a Sunday and were seated right away. If you arrive any later you will be waiting!
