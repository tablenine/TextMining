Restaurant: Nakato
Category: Japanese
My Japanese friend told me about this restaurant.. i mean, she is from Japan, she should know if the restaurant is good or not :). . And she was right! I like Nakato so much! I didn't try the sushi, but i had a chicken teriyaki, with white fried rice.. I went there with other 10 people, and we stayed in the Hibachi Grill Side, then the chef cooked in front of us. It was fun to see the chef and i really liked the fried rice.. . It's not expensive at all and the place is cool.. i will go back there for sure!
