been here about 10 times and still so torn on how to rate it.. . if ratings were based purely on food, it would be 5 stars for sure. . if ratings were based purely on atmosphere, again - 5 stars.. if ratings were based on feeling welcome and valued as a patron, 2 stars? maybe?. . luckily for me, the food wins.. . don't expect to go here anytime from 6pm on and have a relaxing dinner. expect to have a long wait and probably stand, crammed with dozens of others, against one of the walls with a tiny counter to eat on. . . that being said, i really, truly, love the place. you just have to go into it knowing what to expect. the door man is going to make you feel like there's no possible way you're going to get a seat. and that they could care less if you do. . . the service once you're in is usually pretty nice. everyone is pleasant, but not necessarily fast. (there are many people waiting for service and not that many servers).. . if you're in a hurry, or really hungry, go someplace else. if you have no time constraints, are looking for a fun atmosphere with awesome music, just want to chill for a while with a hip crowd and eventually eat amazing, amazing tacos, this place is a must.. . the pork belly tacos - to die for. the fish tostada - ditto. . although, you really can't go wrong with any of it. . . i know this seems like a kind of negative review, but i just wanted to be upfront with what you'll experience. it's really a great place and i want for everyone that goes there to enjoy it as much as i do. which is why i felt it necessary to point out some obstacles you will probably encounter. . . bottom line - go there and eat your face off. but don't expect to be pampered. . . p.s. its cash only.
