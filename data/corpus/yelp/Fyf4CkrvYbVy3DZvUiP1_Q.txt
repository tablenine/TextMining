Restaurant: Red Light
Category: Asian Fusion
This is technically a 3 and a half rating.  I'm torn because I liked the general feel and ambience at Red Light and had a good time but I am against a lot of Asian fusion-type restaurants that pull a lot of the things that Red Light does.  . . The pluses: I was here on a date and it's a warm, slightly sexy setting for that.  I loved the miso glazed salmon I had as an entree - it was pan seared PERFECTLY.  We had a great bottle of wine.  The service was knowledgable and attentive without being part of our dinner party.. . The cons: How on earth is a random crab cake considered Asian fusion?? The only thing that made a crab cake with "chili" mayo Asian fusion was the fact that I am Chinese and I took a bite.  It really bugs me when restaurants go too far down the Asian fusion route because it's trendy and in to be fusion.  Don't get me wrong, I love the swanky, sexy feel of all the Asian fusion done right - but I don't think they would plop some crab cake on their Asian fusion menu.  But I digress.  (You may be wondering why I ordered that... I didn't.  My date did.  And yes, I judged him for that).  I felt like the food was slightly overpriced for what it was - $20 for pad thai?  Yikes.  . . Overall though, I did have a good time and I did leave happy.  I also love sweet potato fries almost as much as I love truffle fries.  So I figured that was worth a half star.
