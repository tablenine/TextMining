Wow I can't believe I didn't review this place! Great ramen, just the right texture with the perfect broth. Service can be a bit meh sometimes but I'm a little more forgiving when it comes to hole in the wall joints. The wait is ridiculous sometimes, and now that street parking lasts until 8pm ($2/hr, bring plenty of quarters or make sure to park on a meter that accepts cards), your meal will be a little more expensive than you originally anticipated. Just carpool and head on over.
