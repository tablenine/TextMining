Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
If you're in the area and your friends are raving about Tito's Tacos... get new friends and take them here instead. . . Johnnie's is a perfect place to get a Pastrami sandwich. It's so damn big and so delicious. It's also dipped. So it'll be soaked beyond all belief. . . It took me some time to eat at Johnnies. I mean, I actually went to a lot of other choices in Culver City, a non-city that I seldom spent time at. So when I finally got to eat here I was wondering why it took so long. How did I live with myself for so long with out eating here? . . Now don't get me wrong, The Hat. I love what you have to offer. But Johnnies is just different and good in its own right. What's so wrong about having the options to choose? It's my buck being spent! . . There's also Cinco De Mayo next door. So if you have friends who are craving real Mexican, drop them off there and enjoy yourself a nice delicious pastrami with a pickle on the side. You'll wonder why you aren't eating it more often... besides the fact that you'd have a Â heart attack by age 25 if you did.
