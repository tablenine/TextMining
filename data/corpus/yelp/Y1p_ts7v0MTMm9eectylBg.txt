I have driven by quite a few times and decided to go here for dessert one night. It was everything I expected and more, in a city that is pinkberry and cupcake obsessed I am certainly ready for something new and something with variety and this place has it. While it seems to be mostly and icecream place with home made icecream in interesting flavors (honeydew and sweet corn were 2 of the dozen that they offered) they also had the traditional flavors. I think they are known for the ice cream sandwhiches which are made with 2 french cookies and the ice cream in between, I tried one which was delicious. I would recommend the ice cream bar, the banana toffee one was unbelievable, I am still thinking about it 24 hours later... (that is bad!). We also tried the cookies and cream one which is also good, if you want chocolate. My friend got a shake that was good, but I am not much a shake person and we all shared the brownie sundae that I couldnt stop eating, someone had to take my spoon away from me. While I am raving about the ice cream desserts they also have a variety of baked goods, which I will have to try next time, including a blue velvet cake! Overall if you have a sweet tooth and are sick of waiting in line for cupcakes or fro yo then go here!
