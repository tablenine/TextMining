Restaurant: Kamehachi
Category: Sushi Bars
Authentic Japanese!  I love coming here to get the bento baxes.  They are a delicious mix of everything you'd want in a Japaneses lunch.  I've been to many Japanese restaurants in Chicago, and you can never go wrong with Kamehachi.  The prices are fair, the fish is FRESH, and the service is courteous and quick.  A restaurant with a focus on the food, I've never had a bad experience here.
