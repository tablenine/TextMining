Went here with a friend and a visitor from SF.  . . The place is very trendy..  Upstairs is a bar that you can hang out at while waiting for a table..  Drinks are a bit pricey but not bad.  But this review isn't about the drinks or the bar.. it's about it's food.. . We ordered a couple of their special rolls.  I ordered a traditional Spicy Tuna roll.  All three were exceptionally made.  Wasn't the best that I've tasted, but close to it.  . . They had this type of fusion theme with there menu and I didn't really feel it.  Let me tell you why..... . The reason why I feel that this place was average was because of the Gyoza.  Looked more like chef boyardi ravioli to me than steamed potsickers.  How can you mess up Gyoza? You can go to jewel and buy gyoza and not jack it up.  What were you guys thinking about adding a canned item to the menu...  . . Maybe I'll make an attempt to come back and try something different.. but I'll make sure to stay away from the Chef Boyardi Gyoza.
