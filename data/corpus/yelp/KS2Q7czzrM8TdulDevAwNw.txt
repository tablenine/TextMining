Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Every patron who eats at Joan's is undeniably fashionable and hot. It makes you wonder who these hot people are and why they are dressed up at 3pm on a Tuesday acting like carefree Parisians. I enjoy their chicken milanese sandwich (hot) and had small talk with Anne Hathaway in the bakery line last month.
