Restaurant: Mercer Kitchen
Category: American (New)
The appeal of Mercer Kitchen I suppose is the fact that its located in the heart of Soho and has great atmosphere. That aside, I was mildly surprised to say that I really enjoyed the brunch I had here a couple weeks back. While it may be overpriced, its to be expected in the area and while I would no means recommend going out of your way to head here, its definitely a nice place to stop off after a busy day of shopping in SoHo. But again, great atmosphere and pretty good food--not that much different than Jean-Georges other restaurants right?
