Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I think this is a place that you go to more for the experience than the food.  I visited LA for the first time a couple weeks ago, went to the Dodger/Yankees game and our crew wanted a midnight snack afterwards.  My boyfriend recommended Pink's as he always used to go when he was in LA and insisted I needed to expierence their world famous hot dogs.  We got there and the line was HUGE, I turned to my boyfriend and said "this better be the best darn hot dog I've ever had if we're waiting in this line!".  I must admit, the time passed fast because they have hundreds of signed celebrity headshots located all around the place...it was fun to see what celebs have experienced the art of  the Pink's hot dog (I have to admit, it is also great marketing).  All the hot dogs have witty names to them, like the "Lord of the Rings" dog which of course included yummy onion rings piled on top.  After close examination, I decided on the nacho cheese dog.  We luckily found seating as I snagged a table right as someone was leaving.  I took a bite of my hot dog and was not impressed.  The hot dog tasted a bit tough for my liking.  I had about 3 bites and called it quits.  I leaned over to my boyfriend and said "I liked the Dodger Dog better!".  He, on the other hand, looove his hot dog choice, of course I can't remember what he got.  The couple that was with us are LA residents, and they too were less than impressed with their hot dog selections.  All in all, Pink's is great for the experience, but not great on the food!
