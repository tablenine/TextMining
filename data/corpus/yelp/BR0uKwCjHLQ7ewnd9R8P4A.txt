Last night, had one of the worst service and food experiences I've had in a long while. Let's see.... . Waited about 13min until our waitress came to our table (only after my friend asked another waitress to get ours).. . Was asked what do you want....um, maybe some water in this tin box (do they not believe in air condition, or are we to imagine we are on an island with the fans and flies). . Finally received some water which arrived with no ice (may not be a bad thing, according to another friend and his anti-ice machine policy).. . Order the Raspberry Royale Mojito, very good, hence the second star.. . Finally ordered a couple of tapas and taco dishes. Blah blah and blah:. --Calamari: Cold. -- Blackbean Hummus: came with 4 tortilla chips and was actually not that bad. We asked for more chips...I'm still waiting on my darn chips.. -- Grilled skirt steak skewers: lukewarm. -- Chicken tacos: dry dry dry. . The first time I visited LL was for Cinco de Mayo this year. The self serve taco bar had WAY MORE FLAVOR than their regular menu items. Take a wild guess if I'll be back. Drinks sure, dressed really skimpy so I won't be a sweaty mess, yea, for food, hell nah.
