I've been meaning to come here for a while, and I must say, the line out the door was really scary.  However, my friends and I found that it moved pretty quickly.  Pricing structure is fabulously simple, although thinking back on it, it's a little teensy bit too expensive for what you get.  All of the salads looked wonderful.  I opted to order the smoked salmon salad which was a daily special.  Yum yum.  Butter leaf lettuce, radish, cucumber, roasted fingerling potatoes, and top quality smoked salmon.  . . Jesus H., that salad was friggin' amazing!. . I also tried my friend's Chicken Caesar, very tasty dressing and awesome croutons.  Iced tea tasted good, but I heard some complaints from my dining companions re: the lemonade.  I got really annoyed at the two guys on a business lunch hogging a table for four FOREVER (a cleared table, they had been done eating for quite some time)!!!  And also the nightmare party of four (double set of moms and daughters) who stood in line and asked the salad maker girl about every single thing on the menu.  Are you kidding me?  Order a f'ing salad and move on.  Later on, her daughter would laugh constantly, flinging bits of food across the restaurant as a result of her dog torturing high pitched cackles.
