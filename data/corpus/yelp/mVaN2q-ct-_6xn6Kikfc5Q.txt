Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
A Chicago landmark... if you want an authentic Chicago hot dog this is the place to go. The Wiener's Circle has a true "hole in the wall" ambiance where the emphasis is on a quality product. The staff is super rude, and they all curse like sailors but from what I hear this is part of the appeal/charm? The relish on our dogs were a very unnatural bright green.. I'm talking fluorescent. I was a little turned off, but then again.. who questions what they're eating when enjoying a hot dog? My advice: just eat it. :). By the way... try to put ketchup on your hot dog and the employees, patrons, and even people on the street will jump you.
