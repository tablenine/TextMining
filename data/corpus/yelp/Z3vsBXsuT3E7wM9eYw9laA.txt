Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
The goods: Moderately priced and good sushi (Try the Freightened Geisha).  Excellent decor and great service.  All the waitresses are beautiful.. . The bads: Most of the specialty rolls are good, but there were a few that just should be completely taken off the menu.  I forget the names, bc they were forgettable.  Too bland and tasteless - like something I could've made myself at home and my dog would've even turned it away.  Okay, not that bad.. but you get it.  It wasn't just my taste buds opinions either, my friends all agreed.  . . Tips: Ask for a booth - this seating is better for people watching and are in good spots.  I sat on the 2nd floor at a table once and felt really isolated.
