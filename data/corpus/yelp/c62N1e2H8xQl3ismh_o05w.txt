Category: Steakhouses
The good:. The service. Everyone was friendly and just about fell over themselves to help and make me feel welcome. . The filet - Perfectiion.. The food overall was excellently prepared and perfectly seasoned with one exception. We loved the mac-n-cheese (not as heavy tasting as you'd expect) and the chopped salad...holy yummy. The sin cake...yeah, sinfully delicious. . . The not as good:. My New York Strip just wasn't really yummy. I loved everything else we had but was quite disappointed in my steak. Something in the sauce they put on it or the seasonings...just not right.. Noisy. We were sitting downstairs and still I thought it was a bit too loud. But maybe that's just me.
