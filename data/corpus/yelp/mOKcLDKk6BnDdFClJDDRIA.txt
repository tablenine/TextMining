After eating at Valhalla's Table in Costa Mesa, I realized that I had to up my rating for Wurstkuche...or as Ching T. would pronounce it: Worst Coochie :)))  . . Reasons for rating upgrade: . -you get TWO toppings. -prices are cheaper than Valhalla's. -more charming, artsy dining space. -dining area is bigger. -beer selection is off the hook!!. -fries are so crispy and delicious, I can't stop eating them. . Since I discovered Wurstkuche, I've been back several times.  There's a lot of sausages I still have yet to try, so looks like I will keep going back. Hellz yeah!
