I'm not articulate enough to write about food this impressive! . . Atmosphere is lovely with warm lighting, cool furniture and photography, and cozy seating.. . I have no idea what the appetizer was called, but it was wonderful: slightly sweet grilled squash and flavorful cheese on flatbread. The rolls were awesome -- really pretty, whole grain, served warm. For my entree, I had the chickpea crepes, which were full of harvesty flavors: some kind of greens, pine nuts, lots of small mushrooms. It had a slightly sweet tomato topping, and this lemony cream sauce. Like I said, I am not articulate enough for this food, but it was so so so good.  . . I had a great cocktail too -- something involving vodka, ginger and mint? Delicious. . . Service was super --  very nice staff who go out of their way to make your experience relaxing and fun.. . The recap: mind-blowing food. Seriously, seriously good. Pretty setting. Perfect place for a special date or fancy party.. . Also, carnivores: the meat that my dining companions ordered looked mouth-watering. A delight for all palates!
