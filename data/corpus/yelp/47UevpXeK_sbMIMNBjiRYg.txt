Ok. So among the other 600 reviews of this place, my comment cannot be that significant so I will keep it short.. . 1.) Culver City location is infinitely better than the Santa Monica location due to a greater amount of seating (including outdoor with heat lamps) and more room to move around.. . 2.) Huge beer selection, with an informative beer menu so you can experiment with knowledge.. . 3.) FO burger and Sweet Potato Fries. Enough said.. . This place is a great place for a date or a night out with a few people. Not a huge veggie menu, but appetizers are good, and you can always find a bite to eat. It's all about the FO burger and the beer though. Enjoy!
