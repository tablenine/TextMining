Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
this place has NOVELTY and GIMMICK written all over it.  i'm serious, you can probably find those words written somewhere on the walls covered with other customer graffiti that is supposed to add to the fun of the place.  . . i have to admit that its a good place for some beer and food-playing fun in an atmosphere somewhere between a sports bar and a family restaurant.  its cajun food done by asian americans with a twist.  you get to sit down, have a bib tied on you, and order shrimp, crawfish, sausages, corn on the cob, crab, etc by the pound with your sauce of choice (i recommend you just go all the way and get the "whole sha-bang").  the food comes to you in piping hot bags, no utensils except for a small mallet and a roll of paper towels, plan to use your hands (ladies, don't do your nails the day you plan to visit this place).  all etiquette is left at the door as everyone sucks on shell fish, peel and grab with their hands, and burp after washing it all down with beer.  hence, its FUN! . . now honestly though...the sauce is spicy, salty, and garlicy...not that great and the seafood often is frozen, not fresh.  the shrimp are usually a better bet than the crawfish and you leave almost certainly bloated from the sodium consumption.  . . another downer: the wait is absolutely RIDICULOUS! we're talking a completely unnecessary one hour minimum and they MAKE SURE that your whole party is there before they start the wait.
