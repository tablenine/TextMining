I love Philippe's!  My dad took me here when I was a kid and I'm still eating here. Maybe it's a little nostalgic for me.  But the food is great!!  So why not.  Back in the day, if you tipped the girls just a little bit more, you would piles of meat in your sandwich.  Like all things, it's now pre-measured. =( . . I prefer the pork sandwich double dipped with a side of large straight chili (no beans).  The pickles are fresh and crisp.  I've never had a bad meal here.  Actually, I don't think I ever strayed from having either a beef or pork sandwich!  The meat is always so tender and flavorful. . . The atmosphere and set-up is great.  I like the large tables that you can share with all your friends or make new ones!  If you go for lunch, you get all the business people, jurors, lawyers and everyone else you can think of.  When you go at night, you get all the before mentioned and everyone going to the shows, concerts and such.  It's a great experience and a wonderful mix of all the different people in LA.
