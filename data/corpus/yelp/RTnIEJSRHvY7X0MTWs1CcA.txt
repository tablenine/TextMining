Two words- HAPPY HOUR!. Honestly, how can you beat $3 tacos and $5 Sangria?. If spice is your vice, I highly recommend the Chorizo Taco. Though I would have a hard time saying which of the tacos is my favorite. . Ciudad has a cool and casual vibe going on in the bar area and friendly waitstaff. Service was fairly prompt and we were given ample warning for last calls on the happy hour deals so we could push thorough our last requests.. Overall, was an awesome way to spent the evening with mah ladies before catching the show at the Ahmanson Theatre- Â Ciudad also provides a free limo service to and from several venues in the downtown area, and will validate your parking for their underground garage which ends up being $5. Nice.
