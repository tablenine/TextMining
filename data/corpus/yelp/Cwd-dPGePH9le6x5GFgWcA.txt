MMMMMM greasy, huge, cheesy, with an awesome crust. The customer service is a little rough around the edges, but what can you expect. The slices are gigantic, cheap, and make you feel bad about yourself when you consume an entire one in about 6 minutes. Don't worry about toppings, cheese is enough. I was only in here for about 2.5 min so i didn't soak in anything else, just the important stuff. $3.25 a slice and you're out. Don't forget to grab some napkins, fold it and you're off!
