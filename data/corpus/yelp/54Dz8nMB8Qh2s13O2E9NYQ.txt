Category: Tapas Bars
Pura Vida has it all - great food, great drinks, great ambiance.. . Last night I went for my second visit and was once again very pleased.  I will say our server was one of the worst I've ever had, but the bad service did not overshadow the delicious food.. . So many tapas places in Atlanta are just the same - unauthentic, unoriginal, overpriced.  Pura Vida has a small menu with something for everyone - and it does not disappoint.  Their tapas are some of the more generous portions I've seen.. . We ordered the mushrooms which were delectable (there are raves below from other Yelpers - and I couldn't agree more).  Also, mussels (yum), pizza (pretty good), and root chips with truffle dip (yum again). . . Cannot wait to go back again!
