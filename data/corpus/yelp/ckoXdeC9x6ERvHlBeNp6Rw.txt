This is my favorite restaurant by far in LA.  I bring everyone here when they are visiting in LA. . . The only down side is the wait can be a while.  . . The reason why i like this restaurant, b/c of the ambiance - high ceiling, market place, chique bar area;  great food - portebello fries, trenne pasta, bianco pizza with vinegar on top, clam pizza, good drinks- mojito ; good service - everyone is super nice here and recommends great entree.  . . This place is also very good for breakfast - i would recommend the smoked salmon benedict, or the normal benedict :)  . . Amazing food.  Amazing atmosphere.. it reminds me of europe all over again esp france!
