Restaurant: Fado Irish Pub
Category: Pubs
This place is a rip off! $5 valet parking. The service is slow (~10 minutes at the bar). In the first five minutes a bunch of drunks started confrontational talk with me while I was waiting at the bar for a table. The drink prices are average. No Guinness 250.The food is average. When asked why they charge for valet when restaurant parking is usually free in Atlanta (excluding tips if there is valet) they just gave me an empty look. Going to 5 Seasons now... never coming back!
