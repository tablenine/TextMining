Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
3:00pm Friday ---- try again!. 1:30am Saturday ---- don't even try it! The line is wrapped around the building AGAIN!!. 9:00am Saturday --- still closed but there's one person in line!. 9:30am Saturday --- I'm the fourth person in line BUT who really wants to eat a LOADED hot dog in the morning. Well, I guess I do! This is my only chance to try their infamous hot dogs.. . Not really sure what all the hype is but I was not that impressed. Perhaps I ordered the wrong hot dog from the menu?! I plan to give it another try during my next visit down south. And perhaps I'll stand in line the next time.....they probably taste better after an hour and a half wait in line!
