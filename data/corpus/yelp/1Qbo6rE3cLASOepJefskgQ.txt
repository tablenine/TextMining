I love this place-good food, relaxing atmosphere and cute stuff to shop for in the back!. . The wait staff has always been really nice and the prices are reasonable. The pesto baguette (get it on the wholegrain baguette!) is a meal in and of itself. I am not a huge fan of pumpkin pie and theirs is AMAZING. I also love the lemon blossom cookies and the rugalach, especially when it is warmed up and they sprinkle cinnamon on top. . . There is a large selection of teas and juices as well as coffees, which are sold by the pound so you can make your own at home.. . It is usually busy and full of conversation though so not exactly the kind of spot to go and study if you are at all easily distracted.
