I took my girl here for her birthday on Halloween night, right before the boy's town halloween parade. At the table by the window was a a group of rowdy pirates. A couple of risque poodles dipped in to rawkus applause. We also saw at least a dozetn cross dressing sarah palin costumes parade by the window.. . The place itself is very cute and cozy, with many small mirrors decorating the walls and low lighting. It has that dillapadated old home feel to it that I love so well.. . As for the food, the entrees were superb and the appetizers were average. We had the gouda cheese platter (which was served with matzoh, to our jewish hearts delight), and the salmon fritatta (boring- i'd skip it).. . As for the main courses, I we split the lamb burger with melted gouda (with a side of truffle-fries) and the moroccan chicken, which was one of the specials. Both were tasty and delicious, although both were very rich (almost ruining my after dinner plans for ice-skating).. . Another plus is the BYOB status (no corkage)- we saved a ton on booze, and the food's reasonably priced to boot. Our tab for two was about 60 bucks. . . So HB was great, and if not for the blah appetizers, it'd be five stars for sure. I'll surely be back, although it won't be quite teh same without the poodles!
