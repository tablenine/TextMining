Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
Delicious!  Though a bit pricey when you add everything together (appetizer, wine, entree, dessert, coffee) this restaurant is amazing and should not be missed. Sat in the back room, which is indoors and painted dark blue. The walls are covered in stained glass and it gives the room a very romantic feeling. The food was amazing! Had the rack of lamb, heirloom tomato/buffalo mozzarella salad, calamari, flourless chocolate cake, and a great cup of coffee to top it all off. I would recommend everything, and wish I could have tried everything!  Make sure to make reservations though, they were busy on the Saturday night I was there.
