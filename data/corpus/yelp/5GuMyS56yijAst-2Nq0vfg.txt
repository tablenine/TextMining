Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
If you're looking for mind-blowing Italian food Bottega Louie is not the place to go. With that being said, it is a perfect place to unwind for a mid-week dinner that won't blow your weekend budget. The food is decent and the place is pristine, although it sometimes feels like more of a cafeteria dining hall than intimate restaurant. Don't expect a romantic dinner for two when dining here. I suggest bringing a group of friends and splitting a bottle of wine because their wine by the glass selection is very limited. The staff is friendly, the place is casual, and all in all, it is a nice new addition to downtown. Check it out and see for yourself.. . For a bonus and good laugh - our waiter mumbled "Oh Lord" when two LC look-a-likes walked in. I should add an extra star for that!
