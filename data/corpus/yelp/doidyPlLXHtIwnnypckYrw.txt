Restaurant: FLIP Burger Boutique
Category: Burgers
The ambience is great, very LA feel to it.  Definately something new that Atlanta needed.  The food is alright, not worth the three hour wait to get a table though!!! . I was disappointed to find out that they don't take reservations, so make sure you are ready to run up a tab at the bar or wait the long lines till you get a table!. The milkshakes look awesome, I am yet to try them but I hear they are really good!!. Overall FLIP is good....I just wish they took reservations!!
