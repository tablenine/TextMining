Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Sawdust on the floor, old-fashioned telephone booths, and a general store in the back~ you feel a little like you've just stepped into a 1930s eatery. Workers assemble your sandwich in short order (less than five minutes) from behind the counter and you find a spot on one of the picnic benches to eat.. . If you get there before 10:30 AM, they serve eggs, bacon, and pancakes. As far as lunch goes, they do one thing and they do it well. Their French dip is pretty delicious. Most recently, I tried the lamb... very nice, tender, moist meat. I found the sides to be forgettable. You get one free with your sandwich--coleslaw, potato salad, etc.. . So why three stars? Because while the rest of Phillipe's may recall the past, the prices are most definitely modern and way too high for what you're getting. My soda, sandwich, and a (very) small bowl of custard cost me almost $12. Still, if you've never been, it's an experience I recommend, and it's worth the occasional return trip for some more.
