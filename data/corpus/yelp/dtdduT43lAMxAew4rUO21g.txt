After frequenting Dong Il Jang and Chosun (conveniently across the street), it's safe to say that I'm really over this place.  Some of my friends who obsess over the whole frugal college student mindset love this place because it truly is a bang for your buck.  For me, its really not.  . . Does smelling like oily burnt cow compensate for the extra bulgogi plates?  The strange selection of beer and soju really throw me off as well.. . So 2 stars for me. 1 for disgusting air quality and chewy meat and 1 for getting wasted at dinner and not really noticing the depressing techno music.. . Do you really enjoy your meat frozen to the plate?. . EDIT ::::::. . SNEAKY BITCHES RAISED THEIR PRICE TO 16 DOLLARS (a friend informed me i would never come here again regardless...)! i'd recommend woo ri jip (or woo ri restaurant on Yelp) instead for better meat and better salad!
