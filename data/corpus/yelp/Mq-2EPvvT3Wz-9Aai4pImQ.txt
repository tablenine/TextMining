Restaurant: Baraonda Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
My wife and I have been to Baraonda a few times over the past couple of years, and every time we have gone there it's been a pleasant experience. Their pizzas are baked in a wood fire oven creating a pleasantly crunchy thin crust (If you love only deep dish then you may want to get a pasta dish instead.), and the toppings they use are both high quality and creative. To top it all off their coffee is rich, full flavored, and a nice way to end such a tasty meal.  . . The service here is extremely friendly, and in fact our waitress remembered us from the last time we were there 3 months ago.  . . The only warning I have for Baraonda is that you keep a close eye on whether or not there is something going on at the Fox Theater because people like to come here before and after shows. . . They also validate your parking ticket from the Bank of America lot, but it is about a half block away, so if you have someone with you who has mobility issues, you may want to drop them off at the door first and then park.
