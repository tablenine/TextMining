Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
After dining at The Apple Pan, a debate on whether or not the establishment deserves the crowds that hover around its horseshoe of diner seats still rages in my head. Certain items on the menu seem better than others so if you come, come informed. . . Food: The apple pan serves burgers, sandwiches, fries, and pies. I think the best item on the menu is the hickory burger which features a juicy, freshly cooked ground beef patty and a bbq flavored sauce that resembles ketchup. The steak burger supposedly tastes like a standard burger while the ham sandwiches are nothing to get giddy over either. I personally liked the fries. They're prepared the way fries should be: crispy on the outside with minimal oil and fluffy on the inside. As for the pies, I think they're overrated for the most part, although the cream they use tastes incredibly fresh. . . Service: Everything is very personal; the older fellows take your order fairly casually and ring you up using an ancient cash register. The service definitely ranks higher than that at most diners. Extra points for serving food on small plates that are either washed and reused or made from recyclable materials. . . Atmosphere: Seating is limited and there are no convenient places to wait either in or out of the diner. Personally, I felt weird eating while other people watched me, salivating from the sidelines. It was uncomfortable being a ravenous eating-machine on display for that half an hour. . . Parking: There's a lot in the back and lots of meters on Pico and the side streets. Also, a Guitar Center just opened up nearby which has it's own structure... hint hint. . . Synopsis: The hickory burger is the only thing on the menu worth coming for, but that sauce was good enough for four stars.
