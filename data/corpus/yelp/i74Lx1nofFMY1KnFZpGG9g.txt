Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
I have been here countless times and each time I regret it. I have no idea why people enjoy this place so much. The chicken is always disappointing. All the dishes I have had here are extremely DRY and bland. The chicken is hands down the most dry I have ever had anywhere, which is quite an accomplishment considering its been covered with a very vinegary garlic type sauce. My friend is a vegetarian and had a lot of trouble finding a suitable item on the menu. She chose the avocado salad which came out to literally be a plate with a few slices of tomatoes and onions, thats it. I find that repugnant and insulting. Veggies should not come here. Please don't believe the hype coming from those over excited, cant wait to go back to versailles assholes. They have no taste and have probably never been to a good cuban restaurant. This place is a total scam and rip off. Â . Bottom Line: If you want a better caribbean cuisine experience try Cha Cha Chicken.
