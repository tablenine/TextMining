*Four stars for happy hour but only 3 for nonhappy hour.. This is pretty much a for girls only bar (and gay boyfriends or lonely boys trying to pick up on classy chicks). If you don't drink serious martinis, this place is probably not for you. I love dressing up and coming here for a night out with the girls (though I have been known to drag my bf here once or twice to keep me company while I sipped on the wonderful vials of vodka bliss).  The martini menu has over 135 martini varieties (yes I counted them the last time I was here). Even when I come for the happy hour from 4-7 ($5 select ketel 1 martinis and great appetizers) , I usually end up staying and having more because this is one of those places where  I just can't control myself. My all time favorite concoction is the strawberry milkshake martini, garnished with a fresh strawberry and whipped cream. I also like their signature lychee martini with a giant tootpick of fresh sweet lychees, key lime pie martini with graham cracker pie crust on the rim, and the godiva chocolate martini  infused with with frangelico. The prices beyond happy hour are $$$ for drinks but during you can sample an array of them for $5 during hh. .      The food is great. Personal pizzas are $5 during happy hour. They have great calamari fritto as well. . There is a separate room with a free pool tables and the players are very nice, not rowdy.  Interior is full of intimate tables and booths as well a bar in front and one in the back. Valet parking in a private lot adjacent to entrance. The service can be pretty slow when it's busy but if you bring good company and are not in a hurry you won't really notice. It's a martini bar, relax and enjoy your classy dressed up evening out. Fun, fun, fun!!!
