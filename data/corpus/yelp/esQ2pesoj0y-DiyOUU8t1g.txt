absolutely yum!!!! after watching ramen girl last year(RIP brit) my cousin n i tried to look for the best ramen place n we stumbled in front of daikokuya! we were addicted the first time we went and we were so happy that we went for 3 days straight -_- it was during summer and sweating from the heat outside didnt phase us, just the fact that we needed extra tissue to wipe our sweat from both the heat n the soup was a lil extra work but it was way worth it!! . . went here 3weeks ago n we had the fried spicy tuna, i believe thats the name n oh man!! its was really different but oh so good, slightly crispy n just right... i think the best part of the ramen has to be the egg!! its not hard boiled to the max but the yellow part is like a medium well or so... once u eat that egg ull be stuffed!! haha i think its soy sauce marinated or something but its yumm!! my cousin gets his soup with all that extra back fat n he loves it but i just like it regular.. the noodles ar al dente n Â perfecto n its just a real small joint that satisfies the ramen craving... this is prolly the closest im getting to ramen like in the ramen girl movie with the bar and all that but yes this place is my number 1!!!. . oh ps: make sure u write ur name down n ur whole party is there cuz they wont let u sit unless all of u are present ;]
