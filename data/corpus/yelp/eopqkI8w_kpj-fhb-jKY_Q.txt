Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
I thought Joy's had a great, quaint atmosphere, with solid food. I ordered the drunken noodles with tofu. I asked for it with medium spice, but I ended up putting additional chili sauce on it. Big bonus goes to the restaurant for having fresh looking jalapenos. They were very green, not that sickly looking yellow-green that you usually find at restaurants. . . Prices were so reasonable, I was absolutely shocked. My noodles cost just $6.50 and I had leftovers to eat the next day. Plus, I ordered hot tea and our server returned with a giant teapot full for just $1.50. . . Service was great and quick. Our food came out much faster than I anticipated. When we entered, there was a sign that said that our entire party had to be present before we could be seated. However, they were willing to seat us right away. I guess it only applies when the restaurant is packed.
