Went to get brunch on a Sunday morning and the overall experience was good!! The food was great; I still have some problems with places that serve crazy amounts of food cause I don't like taking leftovers but don't like just throwing food away either, but I guess that's something personal. The place was packed so it took a while to get a table; I really don't mind waiting unless I have a reservation but you might!! :) The service was also kinda crappy, I'm not saying the waiter did a bad job, the problem was that the place was so crowded that it was very very hard to get a hold of him. . I'm giving this place 4 stars cause I still think that it is worth waiting, even for a long time.
