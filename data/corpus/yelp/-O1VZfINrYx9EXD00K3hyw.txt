Ok, I have now had the Earl Burger and must say that it is excellent.  The bacon cheddar burger I had is definitely one of my favorite burgers in the A.  The bun, bacon, and cheddar are great and the lettuce and tomato are fresh.  The patty itself is thick enough and was cooked medium-rare like I requested.  I think not overcooking the patty is crucial to the overall burger experience.  . . This will be blasphemous to some, but I have to say that I like it more than the Ghetto Burger at Ann's.  To me, the Ghetto Burger is pretty tasty, but it's also kinda a novelty/monstrosity burger and I feel that when you break it down it's really just a couple big hunks of low grade, well-done beef, some weak bacon, average/subpar ingredients for the rest, and some decent chili on top.  Good, but not amazing.  I think the Earl Burger is just a higher quality burger that's actually cooked properly.  If the Earl was smart, they'd offer a double stack bacon cheddar burger with chili - it'd be a Ghetto Burger slayer I think.  For me it would knock the Ghetto Burger out of the park.  Apparently they already have awesome chili at the Earl - why are they not doing this already???. . Anyway, I was a big fan of the burger, but unfortunately the shoestring-style fries that came with totally sucked - thin, flavorless, boring.  Such a good burger needs good fries to match.    . . Earl Ghetto Burger ftw? *fingers crossed*. . 5
