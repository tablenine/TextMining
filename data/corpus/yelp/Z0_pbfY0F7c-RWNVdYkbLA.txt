I 'yelped' brunch one Saturday morning before I went condo searching and this place was the choice. Thanks yelpers!. Although there was a small wait (they give free coffee while you wait, how nice is that?) it was definitely worth it. We sat at the bar for he first available seat and very much enjoyed our meal. The service was fast despite how busy it was and the refills endless.. Although not a place to sit and chitchat, we didn't feel rushed or hurried along. . My bf had the breakfast burrito and I had the veg omelet- both tasty tasty! ( I hope you can tell that I try everything he orders whenever we go out together, so I yelp on his behalf too!). Definitely worth it if you live nearby, but nothing to haul ass too.
