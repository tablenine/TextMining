I have to admit....I hardly ever get out of the River North, Gold Coast, Streeterville, West Loop area when it comes to dining out.  I tend to stick close by to the neighborhood I live in.  However, I am so glad I made an exception and took the long cab ride out to North Center to dine at Sola.  . . I loved everything about Sola, from the the comfortable and warmly lit atmosphere to the friendly service.  Most of all, I loved the food, which focuses on contemporary American with an Asian flare.  . . We started with the artichoke fritters and the potstickers.  I had short ribs for my main course and they were fabulous.  But, my favorites were the sides...they have the best macaroni and cheese ever!  And, I could not stop eating the truffle parmesan fries!  Even though I was absolutely stuffed I still made room for dessert and had the hot fudge sundae with homemade banana ice cream, which was a simple end to a great meal.  The restaurant also has a well thought out, moderately priced wine list.  . . I will definitely be back to Sola!
