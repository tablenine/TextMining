I have yet to have a real complaint about Baraonda, after several visits and several delivery orders through Zifty.  Whenever I'm actually in, I've already eaten or the ravioli du jour is lobster (nrom nrom nrom), so I've gotten that.  When I get delivery, it's usually pizza, which is good, but not nearly as good-looking as when it's pulled fresh out of the brick oven and piping hot.. . Decent wine selection, good service.  Ok but not write-home-about-it decor.  I'd take family or friends that were in town.  Not sure I'd bring a must-impress date or business colleague.  (Yet.  This could change.)
