The Biggest and Bestest Pancakes in the world.  The moment I walked into the Griddle and saw their pancakes for the first time I was blown away.  I knew I need to order me some of them delicious looking cakes.. . I have been to The Griddle multiple times and have tried The BluesBerry, The Golden Ticket, The Banana Nana and the Good Old Fashion Pancakes.  They are all good and I recommend you try one of them when you go in for your first time you can't go wrong.  If you not in the pancake mood you can order up their eggs Benedict they are delicious.. . I recommend sharing the order of pancakes they are very big and filling and worthy of at least 2 people to finish them.
