My dad and I went here before a Kings game at Staples Center (he already beat me to the review) and I have to confirm that this is hands down one of the greatest locations to prepare yourself for a good hockey match. This is within walking distance of the arena, simply walk across the street and *poof* you are there. . . The Happy Hour is ridiculously awesome as far as price and variety are concerned. My dad bought us food and we must have paid like, 20 bucks or something, and he had a beer.. .  I wasn't feeling too well so I didn't partake of the massive selection of beers being funneled from the ARMY OF KEGS made visible through the window looking in towards their back room, which may seem silly for me to neglect considering that the place is named after the crazy yards of beer you can buy.. . However, what I did enjoy was the incredible selection of food items on their Happy Hour menu including such totally awesome items as seared ahi sashimi, a tower of onion rings, garlic fries, buffalo wings and other sports STAPLES (see what I did there?). The price was seriously great, at last check it was only a few bucks for an item off the appetizer list and the entrees included a set of four sliders that we split.. . The environment was filled with the energy of dozens of friendly sports fans at the edge of their seat regarding the tiebreaker baseball game being broadcast on the big screens, and the service was friendly. I'm going to a Kings game tomorrow night with co-workers, and naturally I'm insisting we hit up this place again so I can devour half of the items on their happy hour menu... and of absolute importance, I'm not having to drive home. Rock on.
