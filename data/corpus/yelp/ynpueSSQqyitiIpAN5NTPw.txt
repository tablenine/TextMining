So I tried the famous wurstkuche.  Did it live up to the hype?  It did actually.  There are already more than 400 reviews of this place so I won't go into great detail.  But just shows you how popular this place is.  They need to expand their seating area.  As I recall, I read somewhere that this place actually doesn't make the sausages, that they import them.  Nevertheless, they cook them up well and the fries are good too.
