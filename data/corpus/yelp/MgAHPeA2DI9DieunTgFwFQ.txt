The shorter TL;DR review:. . Mind-blowing, wizardly elf food.  . . 5 . . The annoyingly long review (masochists only - get out while you still can!):. . [Act I]. . I found out in June or July that I was going to be in Chicago in October.  It's a little embarrassing but the first thing I thought to do was call Alinea to make a reservation.  Unfortunately, I found out that I had to wait until August I think to make one as they only book 3 (?) months in advance.  But I called back in August and was able to get a reservation for October.    . . The day arrived and I was pumped.  We headed over to the restaurant and were seated upstairs.  We opted for the smaller menu and skipped the wine pairings (we just ordered a couple of wines by the glass).  I thought this option ended up being pretty good as we weren't looking to get drunk or spend another couple hundred bucks on wine pairings.  I thought the smaller menu ended up being a good choice - double the number of courses seems like it would be a bit of a challenge as it would be a large quantity of very challenging food.  I mean, don't get it me wrong - it would be a pleasure, but just one I'd need to be a little more prepared for.. .
