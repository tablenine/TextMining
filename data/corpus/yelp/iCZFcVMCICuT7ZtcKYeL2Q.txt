One of the things that I love about LA is that just about any cuisine you'd want has a top-shelf representative.  Bonus, many of them are come as you are.. . Wurstkuche has fantastic food, including soy options for veggies such as myself, and dipping sauces for the fries that would be worth the trip in and of themselves.  My posse rolled in for lunch, hung out, had some drinks, and when more of "the gang" arrived closer to the dinner hour we went for round two.  It was THAT good.. . Between us all, sausages made from alligator, rabbit, and rattlesnake (among others) were represented, so if you have a taste for the exotic, bookmark this place right now.  They also have an awesome beer selection, many (if not all) of which are served in glasses representing their contents, which is fun.. . One final note, they play the Beta Band.  How do you not enjoy yourself while listening to "Dry the Rain"?
