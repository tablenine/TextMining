Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
So during a walk-away lunch @ Sunset Gower Studios, my friend and decided to eat @ Roscoe's.  This was my first experience of trying chicken and waffles..... . WoW!  What a concept!  The sweet from the maple syrup on the waffles plus the salty, but greasy yum chicken was an awesome combo!. . Needless to say, my first experience was great! :D
