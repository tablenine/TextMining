Chicken and waffles? The novelty indeed lived up to the hype.  This is a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts.  Starting with the waffles, they didn't seem much different than eggos; then again, I'm no waffle connoisseur.  And what's up with all that butter? Of the three big scoops, one did me just fine.  The fried chicken was tasty, but put it together with the waffle and syrup, and you have something really special. . . So how does one go about attacking these seemingly mismatched items?  Chicken first, and then the waffle for dessert? Waffle and then chicken? Alternating bites of chicken and waffle? Or *gasp* chicken and waffle in the same bite? These are the kinds of questions that keep me up at night.. . A few gripes.  I know these guys specialize in chicken and waffles, but coffee will be scrutinized.  This is breakfast after all, and the coffee just wasn't strong enough.  Another small bone to pick was that it took ages to get our food.  My friend said that the celeb who came in after us got food before we did, but I'm not the most observant person in the AM, especially after being served weak coffee.  Kind of lame if that's the case.  Fortunately, the nice mix of families, locals, tourists, and the celeb made for a nice vibe and somewhat tolerable wait.. . Fun experience overall, worth braving the long Sunday morning line.
