My husband took me here one Friday evening, because we were sick of eating in the lackluster town of Burbank.  It was a quick hop on the freeway, which only took about ten minutes.  My husband works downtown, and has been here a few times and said it was so good.  So, we were lucky enough to find a parking spot in the tiny lot behind the restaurant.  I ordered the beef french dip, because I was not in the mood to be adventurous, since that always backfire on me with food.  At first I was not too impressed with the look of it.  But I gave it a chance.  After a few bites, it left me wanting more.  I was still a bit hungry after my sandwich, but I guess I could have ordered some potato salad or cold slaw, but I was a bit intimidated by the ordering process when we got there.  Next time I will know what to do.  It is a simple and tasty sandwich, so I would recommend it, even if you are not a fan of french dips.
