Category: Mexican
Hadn't been to Gloria's in a long time and just had dinner there tonite w/a buddy. Food was incredible, as always. Gloria recommended the pork chops w/garlic and onions...with black beans, rice and salad. Of course we started w/the green corn tamales with sour cream...and ended w/flan. EVERYTHING was spectacular. And with beverages/coffee, it all came to around $40. Gloria and her sons (Renee and Carlos) make you feel like you're dining in their home. Overall, a wonderful and fun dining experience.
