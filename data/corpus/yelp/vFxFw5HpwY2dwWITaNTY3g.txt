Went here for lunch for the Neaux Bull Feast.  It's a 3 course menu (appetizer, entree, desert) all for the price of the entree with a great variety.  It was great deal.  Had the crab cake which was good, a little different than most, although I've had better.  The sirloin was 7oz a little overdone but tasty and it came with a choice of 2 sides.  I had the asparagus and the chorizo whipped potatoes which were both great.  The cheddar apple pie for dessert was delicious.  . . Overall it didn't blow me away but was a great value for lunch.  I would come back to try some of the other dishes on the menu.
