If you find yourself in Chicago and have a hankering for some classic Chi-Town deep-dish, then head over to the place where it all began. Pizzeria UNO or DUE. This historical spot has been here for over 50 years and is hailed as being the place were "Chicago Style" pizza began. It's the real deal. We ordered the classic "Uno" Combination.. . The crust was amazing for deep dish. much crispier than Zachary's in the East Bay. I still say that the cornmeal crust at Little Star in SF is the best deep dish crust that I've ever had - but the crust at Uno is a close second.
