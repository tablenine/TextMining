Absolutely blew my mind.  No joke -- I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken sandwich, ate every crumb on my plate, and got back in line for another while still chewing.  I figured I may never be here again, as I live in Northern California.  The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD.  They have no soda fountain -- a testament to the fact that their food is actually healthy -- their menu layout is simple and pleasing to the eye, their sit-down area clean and stylish, and their staff was super friendly and FAST!  I would totally give this a million stars if I could.  BLEW.  MY.  MIND.
