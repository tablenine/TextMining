Quick, Joe, let's race down to the Old Sawmill to see if the man with the eyepatch is still lurking about! No, not the HARDY Boys, the HEARTY Boys. The Hearty Boys have a popular catering business in Chicagoland that's reviewed elsewhere here on Yelp, and have now taken over a defunct restaurant in Boystown with delightful results. It's a funky, fresh place with a casual, relaxed feel that's still a little special in its storefront location. They offer unusual menu items, like my duck breast on a peach puree. It's a no-corkage BYOB place and it works well that way. We brought a chilled bottle of white and a red, and even as we were being seated, coasters for the bottles, a corkscrew, and appropriate wine glasses for each appeared, in mere seconds. The entire crew fawned over Max, my friends' delightful toddler, as he chowed on Cheerios while we zipped through some fig and gorgonzola spread and moved on to stuffed porkchops with smoked oysters and other delicious fare. Service was friendly and efficient and the waitstaff included some nice eyecandy too! I'm jealous that Marc and Beth, my Old Country-via-San Francisco-transplanted to Chicago friends, live just around the corner from this great new place. When they really hit their stride, watch out for this place, it should be a landmark.
