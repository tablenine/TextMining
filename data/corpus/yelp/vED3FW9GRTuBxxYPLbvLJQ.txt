Restaurant: No Mas Cantina
Category: Mexican
I'm a Californian with great experience in Mexican food, so i've been looking for a place to really grub. No Mas Cantina seemed like the perfect place.. . Walking through the maze of scuplture, and huge chairs was actually a fun journey towards my final food destination. Staying to look at the great art pieces and home furnishins would have been awesome but my stomach was on the verge of suing my backbone for non support so I had to move and quickly.. .  The salsa was a smoky chipotle that wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, but then again I love habeneros and have been eating jalepenos since I was five, so nothing is ever really hot enough. I ordered the steak quesdillas at the servers suggestion and it was such a huge portion. Â It was good but not great. The steak was extremly tender, a huge plus but it was something I could have whipped up at home.. . The service was great and the food was good. I would go back but I'm still looking for that certain taste in Atlanta Mexican Cuisine.
