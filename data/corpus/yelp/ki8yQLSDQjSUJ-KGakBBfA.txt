Each time I go here, it is always busy and yet I always get seated quite promptly (just nice to know). I haven't varied my orders that much, omelet spring rolls and pho with meat...I suggest asking for mushrooms with any pho order (shitake and white), but I love shitake as it is. When ordering the rolls for a couple of people, ask for an extra empty plate or two, the rice patties dry very quickly and will become difficult to pry apart. Reasonably priced, except a bottle of coke is only a dollar cheaper than beer (weird). Overall, you feel good about eating good food in an unmarked restaurant. . . Just ate the vermicelli noodles with egg rolls, shrimp, and beef....super yummy, and another note...great portions on their meals, will always leave you full
