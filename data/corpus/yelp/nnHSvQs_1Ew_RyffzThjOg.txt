Good lunch spot for both casual and business. It's not a huge restaurant, but for the area, there is a decent sized outdoor area. Definitely one of the better vegan places I have been to in LA. I had the Hot Mama chili and it was fantastic. The iced Roseberry tea was very refreshing. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly.
