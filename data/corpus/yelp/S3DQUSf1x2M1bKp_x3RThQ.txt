i love andies but i ordered the falafel hummus delivery and it was just lame, the bread wasn't so fresh (maybe cause the car and time went by) but the falafel sandwich had like no veggies it was just falafel in pita with a side of sauce, the chicken shawarma was rockin' anyway i'll try again i do like them.. you know what' i'm gonna order right now! yea sure i'm hungry.
