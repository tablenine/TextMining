I went at around 7:00 on a Saturday for dinner and had to wait 45 minutes - an hour in the cold (because the tiny foyer was already packed with other people) for a table.. . But. . I love that if you order the chadeolbaegi (apparently what they're known for), not only do they give you a LOT, in the end they cook the left overs with rice and sauce to make something like a fried rice that is also delicious! Â . . Though I didn't ever get my water refilled throughout the entire dinner, and they don't give as many banchan as I would like, I was really stuffed and pleased at the end.
