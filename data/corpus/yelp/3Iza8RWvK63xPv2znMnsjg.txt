Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
4-stars for the first few times I went, but eventually that rating fell to 3-stars. . . I'm a meat lover, so I love the fact that I can enjoy as much marinated meat as possible. The selection of meat is quite narrow compared to the selection at Brazilian BBQ restaurants. The two meats that I eat the most are chicken and the special Korean BBQ ribs. Unfortunately, after stuffing myself with the same thing over and over again, the food starts to become boring. Manna in my opinion is good to eat once every few months, especially after being acquainted to it.. . - The service here is mediocre. - Price isn't too bad for all you can eat. - Environment is good for a casual hang out (be loud if you like). - A lot of UCLA &amp; USC students. - Meat is good, but I've had better
