Restaurant: Pasta Da Pulcinella
Category: Italian
I also picked this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews and was disappointed.  Luckily the tab was boistered with a coupon that I got off . http://Restaurant.com. .. . The Caprese appetizer was lackluster with pale tomatoes and rubbery mozzarella.  The arugula salad was pretty good.  . . For entrees, My husband ordered the granny smith apple and sausage ravioli which was way more tasty than my salmon rissoto.  The ravioli dish had a great white balsamic sauce.  The risotto was run of the mill stuff that I whip up in my own kitchen and didn't seem like it warranted to be on the specials menu.. . Overall, it didn't seem like the food took much effort.  I would not bring anyone to this place only because the selection for good pasta in Atlanta is so much better than what we encountered here.
