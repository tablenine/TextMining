By far the best of the best in terms of Chicago style pizza. It's a damn shame the chains outside of the two original Chicago locations suck! I really can't understand why they don't serve the same pizza. The other locations just serve pre-processed garbage that they try to call as chicago style pizza. It's like comparing apples and oranges. The only thing they have in common is that they're fruit. You can get my point. . . This pizza is so popular they opened a second location Due's down the the block several years back. and Due's (the second location get it One and Two). Serve some of the best pies on Earth...Now that's a fact!
