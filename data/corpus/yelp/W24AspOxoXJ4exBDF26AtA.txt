Visiting LA I was told to try MILK for their Blue Velvet Cake. I must say the cake was delicious, but what I really enjoyed was the 3X chocolate cake. Not as sweet as some chocolate cakes, and absolutely delicious. The server was friendly and helped me find my way around. . . The blue velvet cakes comes with fresh blueberries in the cake which makes it delicious but also a little sweet. The white chocolate frosting is good. Recommend having it with a non sweetened tea, or hot water. . . The 3x chocolate cake is fantastic! Must try.
