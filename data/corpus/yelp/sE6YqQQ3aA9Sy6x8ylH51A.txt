Restaurant: La Tavola Trattoria
Category: Italian
Comparable in menu, wine list, and location to Sotto Sotto, but much less pretentious. La Tavola has a very intimate atmosphere, and feels quite romantic and cozy, particularly when it's cold outside (as it was today, the day of Atl's big snowstorm). . . We ordered the mushroom tagliatelle and trout, both of which were quite good. I also had the bean soup and broccoli rabe on the side (soup was OK, the vegetable acceptable). . . Although we didn't order drinks, the restaurant does feature an extensive wine selection, and some very nice-sounding cocktails. . . The service was fine--very prompt water refills.. . I'm very sad that Allegro has closed (it was my favorite Italian in Atlanta), but La Tavola is not a bad choice for similar cuisine.
