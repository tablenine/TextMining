Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
I went to the SF Stinking Rose a looong time ago, and that was really the only reason I went along when my friends invited me tonight. Make sure you look at the menu before you go so you know what you're getting into! The food is all pretty pricey, and not particularly worth it. It seems like you're just paying a surcharge for the garlic decor and ATTITUDE. . . We got the bagna cauda, which was just stewed, soft garlic cloves to spread on your bread. Nothing particularly exciting. I got the halibut, with cherry tomatoes, roasted garlic, and calamata olives. I was actually kind of impressed, because the portions were right on (ie not huge). Too bad I was paying $20. The cherry tomatoes were nice, a mix of red, yellow, and orange ones, but in the end, it just wasn't anything exciting. . . We ended with the garlic ice cream, which was fine. Mostly just tasted like you were eating vanilla ice cream and you've got killer garlic breath--the garlic flavor sneaks up you at the end.. . Overall, I wasn't impressed with the Stinking Rose. Really, the only thing separating this place from a chain is that they only have two locations. Apart from that, the food is all uninspired and unoriginal.
