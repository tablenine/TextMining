Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
Want to spend some money? Want to over do things? Want massive amounts of meat? (wait, that last one didn't sound right... but you know what I mean). . . If you've answered yes to all those, then go to CUT. . . Trendy place with a lot of good looking people eating and serving you. My only complaint would probably be that it's a tab bit over priced and you can get stuff almost (not saying just as but almost) as good at a lower cost at other steakhouses. However, overall, it was still pretty good. . . Food: . Bone marrow flan - yeah, it was amazing, get it!!! . Kobe beef sashimi - get this too, it's pretty good. . Spicy tuna tar-tare - yeah, must get too... . Also had one of the salads which was good but nothing special. . . I had the 10oz American Wagu rib-eye and for $85/order, it was good but not as good as the rib-eye I had at Stark. My friend had the 16oz 35 day aged rib-eye and that was pretty good too but you can definitely tell the American Wagu was more buttery. . . Also had a bunch of sides, can't remember them all but all were pretty good. . . Dessert - the chocolate souffle was just okay in my opinion, I like the one at Roy's more. And also has the baked Alaska, which was good but our favorite was the berry cobbler. . . Service was excellent and again, overall it was great. Just a little pricey... came out to a little less than $200/person with all that food and two bottles of wine.
