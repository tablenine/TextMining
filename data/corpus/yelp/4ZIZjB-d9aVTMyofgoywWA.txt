While I do love some good sushi, and this place definitely has some, it won't come cheap. The decor is pretty urban and modern, and is actually appropriate for the cuisine. I love the chairs. All in all, if you want to treat yourself to a pretty expensive sushi meal, this is your place, but if you are like me, and it takes A LOT of sushi to make you feel satisfied and full, then I would probably go somewhere else. Your wallet will thank you.
