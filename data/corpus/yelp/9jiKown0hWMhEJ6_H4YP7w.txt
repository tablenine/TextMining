Coming here again made me think why did I give them 3 stars before?!!  They deserve 4!. . They are a great place if you want to try the juicy dumplings!  Yum!  Filled with heavenly tasting soups... you just can't enough!  Coming here with a party of 6, we ordered . . 2 juicy pork dumplings - I think these are the best!. . 2 juicy crab and pork dumplings - Not my favorites. . 1 small juicy dumplings - These are pretty good if you just want them bite size. . 1 pork fried rice - the pork is pretty tasty. . 3 shanghai noodles - these were pretty good!  i never had them before and i really liked these. . 1 beef noodle steamed - i could skip out on this one next time, i thought it was slightly a little bland. . 3 orders of sesame buns - if they were a little smaller that would be great.  it's good it's just it's filled with too much black sesame.  i think 1 bun can be shared between two people. . 1 xiu mai - these were pretty cool!  they had some juicy soup at the bottom which made it really interesting!
