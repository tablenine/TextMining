I like this restaurant! The space feels good when you walk in the door, open and inviting. There is a fantastic chandelier hanging over the bar and a really nice bar tender named Andrea. I spoke to her at length about wines and life because it was early and the crowds hadn't starting rolling in yet. I had a nice, crisp Italian white while waiting for my friend. . . We sat in a booth and munched on a pizza and some pasta. The pizza was delicious, buffalo mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto. The only improvement I would make is to ease up on the salt in the crust. It was a little too much! I also agree with the Yelper that wants to smuggle in a pizza cutter. It is rough getting through that prosciutto with a steak knife. . . We also shared a lovely linguine dish loaded with mussels, clams, calamari, scallops and shrimp in a light, spicy tomato sauce. It was just the right amount of spice and not too much sauce, very well balanced. I have not attempted to name these dishes because they were written in Italian and I didn't right it down. . . This is a good choice for a pre-movie bite or patio dining on a summer evening.
