Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and had a wonderful time. I'm from NYC and when I peeked at the wine list, I was pleasantly surprised. They had a very nice selection of affordable wines. This was a definite plus for me as most places in the city have too many expensive mediocre wines.. . We ordered a giant seafood tower which was screaming fresh. The oysters were delicious. The steaks were wonderful (altho it tasted a bit too much of butter). The lobster mashed potatoes were to die for. Wonderfully decadent. . . The only con I could think of was when some actress (ER or something my gf said) sat next to us. Their party was very loud but oh well, that's not the restaurants fault. I will come again.
