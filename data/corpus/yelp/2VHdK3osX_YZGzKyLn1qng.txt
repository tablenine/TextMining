I have been to this location twice, and both times had "T" (Tenishala) as my waitress. She does a great job constantly checking up, filling up the $3 Blue Moons, and being sociable. The burgers resemble that of any other burger I have had. The potato chip fries served with them were a bit cold. the ice cream brownie sunday was pretty good, large enough for 2 people (or 3). . . I didn't find the restaurant dirty, the staff was nice, never have been when it's all too much busy. Seated promptly and greeted with a warm greeting upon entering. Overall, not a bad place for a regular burger, but again, T is a great server.
