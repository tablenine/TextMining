When I walked in I thought; this is either Heaven or Hell. Well OK I was pretty sure it wasn't heaven (no hot-tubs) but there were fairy-lights.... . Then the loud, shitty, drunk-at-wedding 'disco' started, the crap, over-priced sushi came out and the warm, watered-down beer was poured and I was in no doubt - . . THIS IS HELL. . If you're the kind of person that enjoys standing up on your chair half way through your meal to prance around to the 'Birdy Song' and 'I will Survive' while you feel your life blood draining away - then go here.. . If you enjoy not being able to talk to the person next to you because some talentless prat with a head-set is shouting to 'Eye of the Tiger' whilst dressed like a pantomime 'Rocky' (this is part of what they refer to as the main 'Show') - then go here. . . If you think having your birthday 'shouted out', incohrantly, in quick succession along with the 20 or so others who are also celebrating their birthdays would make you feel all special and warm inside - then go here.. . If you have any sense whatsoever please don't Â go here. These cynical, talentless crooks don't deserve you're time or your money.
