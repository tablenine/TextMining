after we got out of the Flight of the Conchords concert at 1030pm we didn't have much choices in terms of a very late dinner. so who in LA is open 24hrs, CANTERS! and it was close by.... . we shared a bowl of matzo ball soup first before ordering. in 6yrs i've never ordered anything but a pastrami on rye which i wasn't feeling at 11pm, so i ordered the Brooklyn Ave with swiss, it was canters version of Langers #19. took my first bite without any guldens mustard and it was very good but as usual the coleslaw and dressing takes away from the flavors of canters pastrami. would i order it again,  maybe, but next time i'll stick with the pastrami on rye.  . . can't leave canters without a quick stop at the bakery for challah and sliver of russian coffee cake...
