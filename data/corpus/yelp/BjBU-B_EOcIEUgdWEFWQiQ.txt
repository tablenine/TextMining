I loved this place from the moment I walked in the door. The space itself is fun and has great balance. The service was great -- the server was friendly, was available when you needed him and not annoying when you didn't. The pizza was delicious and I can't say enough about the cocktails. They have a smorgasbord of infused vodkas that were flavorful and full of yum. . . The whole experience was fun, positive, and I can't wait to go back!
