This place seems to have as many haters as it does fans I was expecting some ultra stuck-up, overpriced Hollywood club, but overall my experience wasn't too bad.  It actually felt a lot like any Vegas club I've been to.. . Speaking of Vegas clubs, the door operates just like one.  There's no line, per se, rather a bunch of people just all mashed up at ropes.  As expected, groups of all women, or groups that had a large number of girls to guy ratio were all let in first.  . . My buddy and I were first in "line" and had to wait a half hour to get in, and that was with each of us being on a different guest list from a different promoter.  I felt bad for a group of four foreign guys standing behind me, being told that they only way they could get in was by getting a table with bottle service.. . Once inside, it got crowded real fast.  The beers were a standard $6 each, at least the Dos Equis and Bud Light I was drinking.  Standard dance music, people making a dance floor out of any available space.. . The women were pretty good-looking, a lot of foreigners on vacation.  There were standard douchey guys, but not too many.  I did notice that as the crowd got packed there were a ton more guys than girls, but my friend who was a regular told me that this was pretty uncommon and that the ratio is much better.. . This place falls somewhere between full-on dance club and a lounge.  The ambiance on the front patio is pretty nice, the rest of the club is pretty standard.. . Not the greatest, not the worst.  Kind of standard if you're into the club scene if you ask me.
