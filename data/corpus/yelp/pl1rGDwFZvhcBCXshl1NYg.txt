Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Lots of little kids (and some full-grown adults) love to eat pizza but leave their crusts untouched.  If you think a pizza's crust is just as good as its toppings, check out the individual 'pies' at Coalfire.. . The pizzas are made exactly as you would think: in a real coal-burning oven reaching temperatures of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.  The high heat chars the crust and traps the moisture inside, making it moist and bendable (a la New York).  Quality toppings--goat cheese, gorgonzola, fresh basil, prosciutto, calabrese salami, and tons more--are available, though the restaurant suggests a "less is more" approach.  Too many toppings could result in soggy dough. . . The restaurant has a limited number of tables, so be sure to arrive early for dinner as they do not accept reservations.  The deep red walls are just as warm as the namesake flames, though admittedly, the decor is kept to a minimum.  If you can help it, try to find a seat farthest from the oven; that hot, hot fire can make the room a little toasty.
