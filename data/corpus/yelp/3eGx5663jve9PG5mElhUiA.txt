Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie

I figured since i made a pizza list and had yet to review this place i should get to it. I was turned on to the 'Bianc by my buddy who is my resident east coast pizza expert, i seriously doubt there is a pizza joint in LA he hasn't been to.  This place is conveniently located walking distance from the Chalet (see my older reviews) and open late as hell so after imbibing copious amounts of sauce you can stumble hear for...well...more sauce.  The pie here is "thin crust" but not the kind where you have to fold it to eat it, rather what i would term a medium crust. Great sauce, just the right balance of sweet and tart, good topping selection and i dig how they crisscross cut it.  I have only deviated from the pie once, a stumbly night after Chalet i had a pasta with pees and pancetta, as i recall it was good but it's slightly hazy. I like this place, great vibe, good service but one star lost for price.
