This is one of my favorite restaurants, especially for special occasions. The main dining room is downstairs, I've eaten there and by the bar which is less formal but the layout is still very nice. As soon as you sit down they give you a delicious pastry that looks like a biscuit with a sweet butter dipping side. Nice treat to start of your lunch/dinner. Â . . I usually always get the lobster bisque which has just the right spicy kick to it. You must order the shrimp enchiladas it's very tasty without being pretentious. Very cool contemporary twist. I'm Mexican and I have ordered my fair share of enchiladas in restaurants but these are definately are in my top 5.. . As far as the service, the hostesses and waitstaff I've encountered have all been courteous and friendly.
