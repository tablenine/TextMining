Went here for my birthday back in August. As is my custom, I don't think we went on a "typical" night. There was a ridiculous storm that evening, leaving on TWO other guests in the bar. The nine or so of us were able to line up a bunch of tables in the back room, which was very comfortable and pleasant, amidst the mayhem outside. Beer selection isn't the biggest in the city, but still ample, with lots of nice choices - especially the doppelschteik. Food was pretty light fare, but tasty all around; good cheeses, flatbread pizzas, and mussels. For an upscale Bucktown bar, wasn't especially pretentious, or terribly expensive. I'd love to gorge at HotChocolate then get sloshed her, next door.
