Great old school diner.  Had breakfast here before I moved to Chicago, waiting for the ApartmentPeople to open.  Great friendly waitresses who went out of their way to get me a paper.  The food was perfect after a late night out before....meaning greasy and delcious.. . A tad expensive, but sometimes it's good to go out for a real breakfast not at a Denny's.
