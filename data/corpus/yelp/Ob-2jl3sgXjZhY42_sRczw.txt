Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I can't lie. Pink's is pretty awesome.. But listen, if you're gonna go, expect to wait in line. And if you don't love hot dogs, or if Â you don't appreciate kitschy, nostalgic novelty spots like this, then don't bother. You're just gonna be pissed about the wait. However, I went and waited well over an hour and felt it was totally worth it. It wasn't just about getting a hot dog, it was an event. We ended up ordering four dogs: The coleslaw dog, the Huell Howser dawg, the Martha Stewart dog, and the Lord of the Rings dog. All were photo worthy, all were delicious. My favorite one was, oddly enough, the coleslaw dog. But the Huell Howser Dawg was also "amazing!" We stuffed ourselves silly and had a great time. I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't yet experienced eating at this iconic Hollywood hot spot.
