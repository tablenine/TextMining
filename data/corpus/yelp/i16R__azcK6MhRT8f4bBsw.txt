Restaurant: Coobah
Category: Latin American
My friend and I went to Coobah on a snowy night with a groupon. It was no so crowded, so our waiter greeted us upon arrival and took our drink orders. We decided on two glasses of wine and split the scallops and chicken dish. The scallops were delicious, but I was a little disappointed with the lack of flavor in the chicken dish. I've been to Coobah before, and have had a less than par (overly salty pork) and then an above average meal, indicating the Coobah's consistency in their dishes lacks. On a side note, the ambience is nice.
