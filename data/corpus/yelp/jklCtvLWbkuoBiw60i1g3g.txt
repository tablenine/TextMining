Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
the regular (non dessert) foods i've had there are good, but not incredible.  (except for the potato balls.  i love their potato balls!)  . . but the dessert SELECTION and PRICE are awesome!  the first time i walked in i almost cried from happiness.  it was like walking into my version of heaven.  there were cakes, pastries, cheesecakes, etc flying everywhere.  as soon as a cake was taken out of the case another one went in to replace it!  . . you can't beat the price for what you get.  i got a large fresh cheesecake covered in a mountain of strawberries for $21.  all the cakes LOOK beautiful (like they should be more expensive), and they taste sensational.
