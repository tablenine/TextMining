You know when you are a true foodie when all you don't mind looking like a slob, eating with your hands, and getting dirtttty in public. At least they give you a bib to try to minimize the stains. . . Go early! Because there is always a long line. I love the cajun spicyness! I loved the sausage and shrimps. The fries were a perfect side dish. The drinks are free refills. Definitely a great place to go have fun with your friends. . . I'm soooo excited that a location is coming to San Jose. We need something like this in the Bay Area. CAN'T WAIT =)
