Really cool place and a fun atmosphere!  We came here on a Sunday night.  It was pretty lively, and we had to wait for a table for a bit.  . . The bar was great, so we didn't mind so much.  AMAZING selection of beers from all over the world.  They even had one from my favorite Northern California brewery (North Coast Brewing Co.)!  Interesting cocktails and infused vodkas.. . Pizzas were good with very interesting combinations of ingredients.  I went for a somewhat traditional pepperoni, provolone, and red peppers.  The thin crust was delicious and tasty.. . Service was great, both at the bar and at our table.
