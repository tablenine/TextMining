Mixed feelings about this place. My sammich was good. I had the Boricua and an Izze. The sammich was tasty, but needs to come with side plates and a poncho. No way it can be eaten like a sandwich. It's very messy. I ended up going at it with my fork. . . I think the prices are off. My sammich and drink, with a tip, hit fifteen bucks. And the sammich doesn't come with any sides.. . One other off-putting thing is that I sat by myself between two couples. Someone came out and gave both couples a dessert compliments of the chef. Seems they were trying out some new concoctions. Apparently, being single makes you a leper and unworthy of free dessert.
