The first thing I thought of when I walked in was how it looked like a restaurant you would find in Manhattan. Needless to say I was pleasantly pleased with the interior.. . I have yet to dislike anything that I have ordered.  My favorite dish by far is the chicken milanese. The pizzas are simple and delicious and are made in a completely different kitchen. You can get served by Robert Downey Jr. at the bar or get waited on by David Beckham.  Okay maybe not the actual celebs but damn close! . . I have been here for both lunch and for dinner. The menu doesn't change but the service and wait time definitely do. Dinner on Friday and Saturday nights are miserable.  A normal wait for a table of four is about two hours anytime past 7pm, and they don't take reservations. Then expect to be eating for another two hours because the food takes forever to come out and the service is almost nonexistent.  I definitely recommend this place for lunch or early dinners. . . Overall, I'd come here time and time again.
