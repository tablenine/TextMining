Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Roscoes is all about the waffles.  If they weren't rich and buttery enough, they hook you up with generous mini scoops of butter. The chicken's just ok.  Don't get me wrong.  They cook the chicken well.  Meat is moist.  Skin is crispy.  There's just nothing too special about it.  The gravy (if you get Scoe's #2) tastes like regular store bought quick mix gravy.  I recommend getting it on the side and dunking your pieces of chicken versus getting it slathered and risking the cripsy skin getting soggy.
