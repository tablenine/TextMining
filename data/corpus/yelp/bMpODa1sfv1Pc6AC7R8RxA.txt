Love love love this taco truck.  Had it for the first time 5.9.09 and we're hooked.  The line sucks, but other than that its worth it.  We've tried the spicy pork, chicken, and beef tacos as well as the short rib burrito, kimchi quesadilla, and Korean street fries.  All are amazing!!!!!!!!!. . P.S. You can avoid the lines by grabbing some Kogi at the Alibi Room...
