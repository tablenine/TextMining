Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
I don't know why, but I love this place. I go there with the same two guys all the time. We basically order 3 or 4 plates, and split them between the 3 of us. It works out well and is pretty damn cheap. Love the patio seating also.. . As for the food, they have a wide selection of typical Hawaiian and Japanese items. I recommend the katsu (Japanese fried pork or chicken cutlet) and the house special fried rice. By the way, spam isn't that bad like this. This is far from gourmet food, but it's a extremely relaxing environment and the owner is really chill. Also has a really good selection of beer for a fast-food type place.. . He told us that his restaurant was voted best high food in High Times also lol!
