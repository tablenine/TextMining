Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
My family and I celebrated Thanksgiving here and all of us thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at David's Burke's Primehouse. The restaurant is located inside the James hotel, a boutique hotel in the River North. The restaurant is decorated much like traditional steakhouse with leather and dark wood but with a very sleek and modern style. The service here is awesome from the host to the servers. But what's really important is the food. I have got to say- the food here is amazing! My dad ordered the 55 Day Aged Rib eye which was phenomenal and bursting with flavor! The rest of us opted for the prefixed Thanksgiving menu which included prime rib, turkey, and ham all served family style. The sides included asparagus, green beans, mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce (served in a can), and 2 kinds of gravy. Everything and I mean everything was scrumptious! The starter was a choice of a salad or soup and both were delicious. The popovers that they served fresh from the oven were so flaky and oh so good. The desserts were creative and decadent. One savory dessert that we tried was the apple cheddar pie. I enjoyed the creme brulee. I absolutely loved everything here and although it was a bit pricey, I believe it was worth it. Our waiter even gave each of us turkey sandwiches to go, which we enjoyed the next day for lunch. The sandwich was delicious- they stuffed two pieces of white bread with turkey and all the thanksgiving sides (mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce, etc). . . If you're looking for a great steak house, you have to try this place at least once!
