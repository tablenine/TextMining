Restaurant: Ria&#39;s Bluebird
Category: Southern
Ria's is my favorite breakfast place in Atlanta.  They have good pancakes that are served with hot maple syrup.  I think that really makes a difference.  I try to avoid going there on the weekends.  I don't like to wait.  I would rather drive all over town looking for a less busy place, even if it takes longer then it would to just wait for a table.  If you're like me and don't like to wait on the weekends, I recommend the new Thumbs Up Diner on Marietta St. or Atkins Park for brunch after 11am.  But this is supposed to be about Ria's.  It's good.  Go there.  They close at 3pm.
