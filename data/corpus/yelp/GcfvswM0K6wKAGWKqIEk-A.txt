yes it is a bit too hipster for my taste but the tacos are tasty and revolving, the beer is cold and most importantly the michelada and chelada mixes are the most authentic I have seen in the midwest. . I am not sure it is worth an hour wait but if you are in the neighborhood drop by see if you can stop in.  It is worth at least a 15 minutes wait.  Plus when the weather is warm the outdoor seating is prime.
