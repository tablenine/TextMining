Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
We waited in line for about 20 minutes and when we finally got in, we sat at the bar.  This place was packed like sardines.  Like other Japanese restaurants, the staff yells hello and goodbye and thank you when you come and go.  Very lively :)  Our server was friendly and helpful, but it was apparent that he was in a hurry because there were so many people to serve. . . I kinda had a hard time understanding to menu, so i asked out waiter. . I ended up getting "the popular one". I still dont' know what I had but I think it was the first thing on the menu with medium oil, firmness of noodles, and broth "saltiness".  Everything was really good.. . I'm going to admit that a few years ago, the only time I had Ramen was when it was in a packet for a dime at the market.  Not that this compares to that; of course the ramen was delicious and I was very pleased with how it came out, but honestly, I don't think it was worth nine bucks.. . But I'll be back anyway :)
