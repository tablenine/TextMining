Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
Hands down the best bakery in L.A. Yes I said L.A!!!! Quite possibly the best bakery in California. . . This place is most notably known for its exquisite Cuban sandwiches, but Portos is much more than that. The pastries that are made here can only be compared to sweet orgasmic delight. Â Everything is made fresh, nothing dull or stale. One bite of the tres leches cake, mango cake, or the cheese balls will keep you coming, coming, coming for more (you get the picture).. . If I could only eat at one place for the rest of my life, Portos would definitely be it.
