Restaurant: Zenkichi
Category: Japanese
Walking into Zenkichi I felt instantly transported from Brooklyn to Tokyo. Everything about Zenkichi is incredibly authentic from the soft jazz music playing to the service button on the table. Our server was very friendly and allowed me to order everything in Japanese. She offered us helpful menu recommendations and even suggested a karaoke spot for my friends and I to check out. Although the food was also authentic, it was a bit simple for the price. With that said I thought my tuna carpaccio Â appetizer was the best dish of the evening, while my friends favored the sesame mousse dessert. .
