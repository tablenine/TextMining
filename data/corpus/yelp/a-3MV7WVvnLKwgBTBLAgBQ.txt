Why aren't there more ramen places in Chicago?  More importantly, why is a good ramen joint like this in Logan Square of all places??. . Went by with a friend in the middle of the afternoon.  It's on a fairly quiet street in a strip mall next to the cleaners, near some auto shops.  Very different from what it looks like inside.  I like the dark, wood-heavy, barebones decor.  You order up front and seat yourself.  I can see how this place can get a bit tight since there are only 4 community tables.  . . We got the . *scallop soba - good broth; . *pork belloy ramen - fantastic.  Fatty pork, ramen, and dark bak kut teh-like broth are a great combination.. *kalbi and fried race side dish - fried rice also had SE Asian influence.. The noodles are 12-13, seems high but since there's no competition I guess you can get away with it.. . Great place to get a ramen fix, just leave the ginger candy at the end alone.  Too bad it's so far away.  This place would be packed for lunch and dinner if it were near the loop.
