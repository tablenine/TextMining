I really like this place.  It is hokey, touristy and the old thai elvis is just the icing on the cake.   The food is good and they serve you pretty quick.  The roast pork and duck soup are among my favorites, but I really haven't had a miss yet.  Whenever I have out of town guests who want a "unique experience" I take them here.  Even though prices are a little higher than most Thai places, it is still pretty good and you know the food will be solid.
