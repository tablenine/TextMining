I went here for Easter Brunch, and loved it!  It was one of the only places taking reservations, although with the pouring rain a reservation wasn't necessary.  We had Rising Sun martinis: sake, mango, pomegranate, and blood orange.  They're all about mango and pomegranate on their drink menu.  They were strong and yummy!  I got the steak and eggs, simply delicious.  But I was really jealous of my roommate's huevos benedictos: chorizo, cornbread, eggs and spicy hollandaise.  Phenomenal.  I can't wait to try Sola for dinner.
