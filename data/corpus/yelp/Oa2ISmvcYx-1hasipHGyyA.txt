Joy Yee's is a farce. Their so-called Asian fusion food is satisfactory at best.  My Pad Thai was dry and tasted as if they confused the tamarind  with soy sauce.  Their bubble teas are good; but not particularly spectacular.  They may be arguably one of the best in the Chicago area. . . Wait staff service was typical of most places in Chinatown - dismal.  When we found a hair in one of the dishes, a manager did substitute in an order of pot stickers at no charge; but did not apologize in the matter.. . If you're looking for Chinese food; certainly go elsewhere as Joy Yee's is not the place to go for authentic Chinese food in Chinatown.  If you're looking for wannabe Asain fusion, I suppose Joy Yee's is passable.  Or if you're a tourist who doesn't know any better and is looking for a so-called trendy spot in Chinatown, go to Joy Yee's.  Otherwise, go elsewhere for better food and the same crappy service.
