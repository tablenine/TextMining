I went here a few months ago because it's close to my new apartment.  I'm blogging about it now because I saw how many good reviews it got and I was appalled.  I'll say that I'm not a huge fan of chicken -- I pretty much consider it the red-headed stepchild of food.  I decided to try Birds because, I mean, it's called Birds so how could possibly screw up chicken?  I can't even tell you what I ordered (it's that unmemorable if that's any indication of what's about to come next).  The chicken dish that I had was cold and bland.  Why was it cold?  Because our waitress was more interested in flirting with the boys at the table next to ours than being aware of that our order was up.  Why was it bland?  Who the eff knows.  Totally inexcusable.  Why did I give it 2 stars?  Because I remember those delicious fried pickles that started off what turned out to be a tremendous disappointment.  I still cannot get over how you can call yourself Birds and your chicken be so terribly dry and tasteless.  I'll never eat there again.
