Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
TARJETA!!! TARJETA!!! . . Luckily found some parking on Alvarado St. right next to Langer's and as I took my first step out of the car was immediately offered a fake social security card, driver's license, and birth certificate by a small tiny old Mexican lady. She was adorable.  . . Ohhh snap!!!  Birth certificates... that's new, but I think I'm good for today... I do have some illegal immigrant cousins...  but when worst comes to worst, a pastrami sandwich comes first!!!. . We arrived at the delicatessen at 3:30pm because my lady friend refused to get out of bed.... this is somewhat an issue, as the restaurant closes at 4pm.  Ordered the #19, a side of potato salad, and a bowl of Matzo Ball soup.  We split the portions down the middle like a nasty divorce. And later reconciled over a Mango Mousse at Porto's Bakery.. . The pastrami sandwich on rye was incredible and calmed any thoughts of disappointment.  The thickly sliced meat was not greasy, but rather succulent and juicy.  The equally important rye bread was soft in the middle with a great crust.  Swiss cheese and Russian dressing coleslaw components came together like a family reunion.  The sandwich exceeded all expectations and is on another plane of existence when compared to any other Jew deli in LA.  . . Matzo Ball soup was very tasty, but was served to us lukewarm.... we let this one slide as the infamous #19 pastrami sandwich picked up all the slack and made all else seem irrelevant.  The potato salad provided a nice starch in between bites but is nothing to write home about.. . Aside from this place closing at 4pm and lukewarm soup, this place is worth all the hype and serves the BEST pastrami sandwich in Los Angeles.  . . Highly Recommended
