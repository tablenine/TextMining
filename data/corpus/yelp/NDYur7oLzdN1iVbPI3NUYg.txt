although it gets very crowded and sometimes you have to wait to get a table here, i like to go in the evenings when its not as busy. anyhow, ive always had good service here, and i am definitely a fan of the food. if you are having a chocolate craving, come here for some chocolate chip pancakes. the sandwiches are delicious as well as my two favorites: the side salad and a cup of soup (all the soups are great. my favorites here are chicken noodle and vegetable). so. if you want to check this place out and not have to wait, just come in the evening. as for brunch, you might just have to head out a bit earlier, before 11am.
