I don't know about the lines that everyone speaks of, so I can't subtract a star for that... but the Red Velvet Cake is UNREAL. Absolutely unreal. I'm sure it's probably a death trap, but wow. Unreal. . . I've only ever had the cakes, for birthdays, but I definitely need to try their sandwiches. I'm a little concerned about the lines tho!. . I'll report back after I've checked the store out in person.
