Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
OMG! I wish they had a Penny's Noodle Shop by my house in Pilsen.. . I was never a fan of Thai food. Either it was tooooo sweet or toooo spicy and it never worked for me, but Penny's Noddle Shop has put thai food on the top of my list. . . Me and three of my friends decided to try out this noodle place when one of my friends moved to the Wicker Park area a few weeks ago. The restaurant decor was very cute and spacious. But the food was the best. I had the Pad Thai which was very good. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. We also ordered the Pot Stickers and Crab Ragoon. I would pass on the Crab Ragoon a little dry and fried a little to hard, but the main courses made up for the appetizers.. . My friend had the BBQ Pork Ramen bowl which was delicious from the few bites that I stole from her plate :), but overall the food was good and I will be heading back to Penny's Noodle Shop before the snow comes in :). . If you want cheap Thai food...please go to Penny's, . . BUT be aware of the wait staff. I completely understand keeping your wait staff authentic...which is what I love, but the wait staff must speak English very well and also understand it. We ordered some extra things off the menu that she did not bring. My friend asked for a doggy bag for her food...which we did not receive. I guess you have to speak loud and speak clearly.
