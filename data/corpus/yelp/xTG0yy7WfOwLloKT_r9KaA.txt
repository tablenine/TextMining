I heard so many good things about this place that I decided to organize my company's holiday dinner here.  First, I went to go check it out. . . . . The first time I went the seasonal soup was some type of fancy pants tomato and it was awesome (even served with a classy side of mini grilled cheese).  For my main course, I had the poussin (which I learned was a mini-hen and since I did not want to keep calling it a "poussin" I kept calling it a mini-hen.  I am sure my server was impressed with my sophistication level).  Anyhoo, the mini-hen was not for me as most small game birds are not.  However, the service was great and classy.  . . We ended up going back as a company and all had a blast (and a lot of wine).  The service again was great and they set us up with a semi-private room that looked over the rest of the dining room (if we wanted to open the curtain and see everyone else, it was no longer "private").  They were also very accommodating to the special dietary needs of our party (veagans, vegetarians, etc).  . . I recommend Naha for a fun evening out AND for a hip twist on stuffy corporate dinners.
