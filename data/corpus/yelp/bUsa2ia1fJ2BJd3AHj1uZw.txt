This was really good. I had the salmon and it was easily on of the best salmon dishes I've had in a long time.  My dinner partner's meal (roasted chicken with gnocchi was equally impressive.  The wine we had was excellent (Tandem).  This was my second visit to Feast and the first time was good, as well.. . (I only review places after having been to them twice. This applies to this review and all previous reviews.)
