A friend invited me to this place last week, it was a Wednesday night.  We hit the medium line at about 7:30pm and put in for two at the counter then took seats outside, the wait wasn't more than 10 minutes considering the size of the crowd!. . I'm your basic sushi consumer, nothing fancy.  I got the standard tuna, salmon, yellow tail orders.  A spicy tuna which came in a block of 6, and we split a spider roll as well.. . The sushi portions where the biggest I've ever had!  I can lay the big chomp on a burger with the best of them so I can say that having a little extra sushi with each portion was sweet!. . We ate our fill with two runs on the menu, 2 bottles of saki and a Saporo for me, the bill with tip came to about $120.  Not cheep but reasonable for the portions, I've had less for more definitly with some finer places along the coast...  Service was astute!. . I recomend that when going here to not have to go anywhere in a hurry and leave your stress at home!  :o)
