Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Trendy, cozy and reasonably priced. I was about to try the Earth Burger because the menu description seemed to be stuff with endless amounts of ingredient which instantly sold me. Right when I was about to order it..I realized, when people call it "Earth"-something it has a connotation of being vegetarian..something I'm not (I love my meat!). So instead Â I tried the truffle burger and I couldn't have been more happier. I might try the Earth burger eventually, it did sound really good and the fact they use an edemame patty IS intriguing. The thin cut and thick cut fries are a must with any of the burgers. Also try the ice cream sandwich, a group next to us made us drool over it!
