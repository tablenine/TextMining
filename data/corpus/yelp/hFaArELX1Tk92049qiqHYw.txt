Four of us dined pre-theatre.  I've been trying a number of downtown restaurants lately  - as more and more of our evenings are spent near Staples or the Music Center.  We ordered 4 different appetizers - two of which were so salty as not to be edible - but we could not get the attention of our waitress (a common theme through out the evening).  The dishes were picked up and main course delivered - when I could finally tell our waitress that several of our appetizers weren't edible - and she said she would check with the chef.  She never got back to us.  Of the main courses - two had way way way too much salt. Again no one to talk to.  The lack of service, finding the appetizers on our bill that we couldn't eat (and we were now in a rush for the theatre and didn't have time to speak about it) - and a waitress that couldn't tell us what the chef said.... too many other great downtown places to eat.  I did leave a comment card with the management - we'll see.
