This is overall a great place to have dinner at. First off, the view itself is amazing. It overlooks the entire city and there is a pathway outside the restaurant that you walk to. Inside, is even more elegant and mod. There is an actual Japanese garden inside!!!! Their cocktails and beer quenched my thirst. If you want to order something quite exotic and good, order their Darth Vadar Sushi Roll. Black caviar sounded gross to me but it was one of the best sushi I've had in a while. Another great thing to try is their seafood combination platter. Their lobster, shrimp, and scallops were cooked to perfection! I would go back again for sure!!!!
