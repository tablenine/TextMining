Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I tried this place and I found that it is worth many more visits. I had their beef jerky, papaya salad (som tam) with salted crab, and the spicy green beans over rice (pad prik king). The taste was very good, the service was great, and most importantly the price was fair. However, I found it offensive to pay the valet parking especially I have an old vehicle with a lot of my personal junk inside. So rather than enter the valet parking, I decided to park on the street. This could be a little tricky especially on weekends.. . The place deserves 5 points but I am deducting 1 point because of the parking situation.
