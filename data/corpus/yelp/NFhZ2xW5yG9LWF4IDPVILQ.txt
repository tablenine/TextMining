I used to like TAP. This was very early on so they had a vested interest in making a good impression.  The menus were crisp and unstained.  The staff was attentive and went as far as providing us with sunglasses for the dizzying sunshine.  . . They had a gritty and unique drink concoction called Dirty Tap Water.  But they did away with that with no explanation.. . They offered fried pickles with buttermilk bleu cheese dip. But they've replaced the bleu cheese with piddling creole 1000 island.. . They boasted a fantastic Pork Belly Eggs Benedict.  But they swapped the pork belly for the sirloin standard.. . They had hospitable hosts and servers.  But they've exchanged them for insipid dolts. . . It initially showed promise, but it threw it all away for striped shirts, egregious cologne and blingy belt buckles.  They shouldn't bother providing food any longer; I mean, other than the meat market it prominently features.
