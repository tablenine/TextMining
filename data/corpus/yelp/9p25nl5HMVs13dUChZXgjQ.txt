I would give this place 5 stars for the food but 0 stars for the service!!!! I wanted to try the tacos arabes.. but ironically they are made with pork. Not to assume that all Arabs don't eat pork of course!!! . . The owner was more concerned in accommodating the people that came to dine in than me.. maybe asking for chicken tacos was too complicated of a request for the cooks~~~ The waitress did not speak a word of English which made it harder for them to explain to me why my chicken tacos cost $4 and the tacos arabes cost $2.36. I swear I am not a cheap person either.. . . Anyhow, my tacos were finally ready and they just sat there since the waitress was looking around doing nothing. So after I paid of course.. I just grabbed my tacos and left. No need for a bag.. since I would have to wait another 10 mins of course. . . The tacos were tasty. The chicken had a smokey flavor to it... I will go back there instead of take out I will eat in.. and hope to not have to wait for ever!!
