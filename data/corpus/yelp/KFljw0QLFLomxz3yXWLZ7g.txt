Apparently the left over fried chicken was so good even my cats ate pieces of it up!! And I definitely have to agree with all the previous reviewers, get the fried chicken! Going to eat here is like going to go eat at your favorite Auntie's house ( minus getting hit up for change on the way in and out of the restaurant.) I learned that homeless people who are supposedly starving would rather have a dollar, than my leftovers I tried to offer him. Hmph! I suppose he was on some sort of "liquid diet". Anyhow, back to the food which was amazing. The day that we were there they were packed for lunch, and I swear they gave my skinny Caucasian boyfriend the largest piece of chicken I had ever seen- It's kinda like your grandmother saying "here eat more/ you need more meat on your bones!" Which I found hilarious! We were served some table wine of the south (sweet tea), cornbread, Baked mac and cheese, collard greens (which he ate up before I could even taste!), and yams. All of which were delish! You can get orders to go, and they even give a 10% discount to students!
