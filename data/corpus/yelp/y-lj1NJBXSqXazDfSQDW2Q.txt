Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Designer Dumplings: finesse, famous, and favored by those who apparently don't mind paying for it. Ambiance of DFT, esp. its new 2-story location is a big plus over other dumpling places. But what good is that when wait time outside exceeds enjoyment on the inside?
