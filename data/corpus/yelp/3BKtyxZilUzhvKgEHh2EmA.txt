Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
My first time at Hakata Ramen was at the end of last month.  I went with a bunch of friends and we waited for quite some time before we were seated at the rear table (the one where you have to take off your shoes).  I had never been to a ramen restaurant in the States, though I did visit one in Japan 10 years ago.  This place had a lot of people standing around outside just waiting to be seated so they could eat - that told me right off the bat that this place was going to be awesome.  Don't let the line discourage you; their food is well worth the wait.. . Once seated, you're able to order drinks and appetizers.  We had the chicken rice ball (which, literally was a rice ball with chicken in it -- somehow my friend and I thought it was a rice ball wrapped around a chicken), and something that was fishball-like, but I can't remember the name of it and I can't locate their menu online.  But it was good.. . When it came time to order ramen, I had no idea what I was doing marking off my preferences on a little white paper.  I marked normal everything - soup base, oil, and ramen.  I ordered the #1 Hakata Ramen and added an egg to it.  When it came, it was so unbelievably yummy and the portions were generous!  I couldn't even finish it, though I wanted to because it tasted so good.. . Some of the girls ordered desssert, but I skipped out because I was about to burst open already with all the ramen goodness.. . I plan to go back sometime soon for more!
