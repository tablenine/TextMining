Category: Pubs
The sangria and beer garden are the reasons to go to Moody's. It also helps that they have a parking lot! Love this beer garden, intimate without being too close to other guests. Love the sangria.. . Burgers and home fries are pretty good, good price.. . Eating indoors here is miserable. Its so dark and dank. YUck. . . Definitely recommend it for a simple night out.
