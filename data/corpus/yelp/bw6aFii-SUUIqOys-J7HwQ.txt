Vegans Beware! . . I ate so much I thought I was gonna die.. . Be ready for the swarm when you flip that coaster from red to green.  Know which cuts are the best cuz you might fill up on the weaker dishes just to try them.. . Don't waste your time on the salad bar.  You're just wasting space reserved for red meat.
