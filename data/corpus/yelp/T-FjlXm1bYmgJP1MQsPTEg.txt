One of my roommates chose to come here during our trip to LA for spring break. Before entering this place, I was skeptical.  I thought this was yet another overrated breakfast joint located on Sunset Blvd that all the stars go to and overly priced.  This doesn't happen much, but for once, I was wrong! I love hole in the walls!. . I ordered the Kicking and Screaming Tacos while my roommates ordered the Bluesberry, and the Omelette Pomodoro.  For the table, we agreed on the Addicted to Noisella stuffed french toast which is just nutella. I absolutely loved my tacos!  The eggs were perfectly cooked, and drenched with chipotle cream sauce.  It looked so cute and yummy.  . . I'm not a fan of pancakes or blueberries in them but these ones were quite fluffy and chewy.  It came in about 2 or 3 huge layers and was topped with blueberry sour cream, an odd concoction but a nice compliment nonetheless.   The Omelette was pretty good too.  I was too full to enjoy the french toast, but the few bites I had of it was delish!  Who doesn't love nutella? Too bad most of it was devoured before I got a chance to really enjoy it when I was hungry again. . . Overall, this is an excellent place.  The servers are friendly and the prices aren't bad for the huge amount of food you get. You will definitely have leftovers for the road. Oh yeah, we also got a glimpse of Anne Hathaway and Fred Durst.  But we rather take pics of our food than of them.
