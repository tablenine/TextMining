I typically only eat mexican food at places that have the biggest margarita glasses.  What a mistake!  Adobo serves great food.  And the guacamole that they prepare tableside is wonderful.  Yes, I promise.  You wont forget to order it, because they ask you as soon as you sit down.  The margaritas, while not enormous, are delicious and pack a punch, so don't worry that they aren't bigger than your face.
