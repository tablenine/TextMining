I can't seem to figure out what is it that people love so much? The only thing i loved was the service other than that I'm not sure what the hype is about. So you can get chicken and waffles for breakfast/lunch.... The chicken wasn't crispy, no flavor. The waffles were just an average waffle. Maybe the gravy was good, but nothing here I can say was great. Just your average soul food joint, nothing special. Maybe I wasn't hungry enough..
