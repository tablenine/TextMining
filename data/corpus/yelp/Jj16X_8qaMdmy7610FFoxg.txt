The quality of the food - was the best that I have had in Atlanta.. . Great variety of drinks and food.. . Head chef was welcoming and very friendly.. . If you want faster/better service, make a reservation for the sushi bar during the weekdays/nights (or when its not so busy). Â The weekends tend to be more busy.. . FYI - we ordered a variety of nigiri sushi, rainbow roll, squid salad, wasabi tobiko, sake, and a sweet potato vodka on ice, closed the eve with 1 green tea ice cream.. . . http://www.atlantasush.... . . http://blissfulglutton.... . . http://atlanta.creativ.... . . http://www.urbanspoon.....
