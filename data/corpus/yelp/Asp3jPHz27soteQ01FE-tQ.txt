I'm tempted to give this place5 stars but I think it was the company that I had that makes this dinner 5 stars. . . I've been here once before, about 2 years ago when I lived in LA. Thought it was good, but I didn't really think it was THAT good. My friend from DC is back in town, and she was craving this place. She calls me up to see if I'd be willing to drive up to LA from Orange County to eat here and see her. uhhh YEA I would!. . Six of us from all over [LA, OC, DC, and even Davis] met up for a meal here, and it was a good ole' fun time.. . The boys ordered the #2 which is chicken and 2 waffles. The girls ordered #22 which is greens, cornbread, 2 chicken pieces, and mac n cheese. I got the #18 which is one chicken leg or thigh and one waffle with gravy on the side. It was PERFECT. I ate everything on my plate and tried some mac n cheese and cornbread. . . Seriously, it's just chicken and waffles. Simple. But it was perfect. Dark meat is juicy and the skin is crispy. Waffles were soft and buttery. oooh and don't forget the sweet tea!!!. . Good food for the soul. Good friends are also good for the soul, especially at Roscoe's.
