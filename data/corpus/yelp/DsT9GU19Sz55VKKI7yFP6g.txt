Maybe it was the Marc Jacbos sighting in the lobby or the classically california style menu, but when I finally walked into Mercer kitchen Ii was expecting a lot.  Before I can comment on the food, it must be noted that the room was gorgeous.  Long counters with high stools, sort of like a communal table but with a little more sophistication.  The counters lead to a large, pristine, white tiled, open kitchen.  The room was annoyingly loud, but whatever I was willing to put that aside because I was looking forward to what I thought was going to be an amazing meal.  The menu was not adventurous, but full of delicious sounding classics.  For an appetizer, the fried squid with chili mayonnaise was a perfect combination of hot and cold and crunchy and smooth.  My friends butternut squash soup with black trumpets oddly tasted a little too much like chicken broth.  My entree was a melt in your mouth piece of salmon with what was advertised as brussels sprouts and truffle mashed potatoes.  The salmon was perfect, with just the right amount of salt and pepper on the top, very simple but with such a good piece of salmon that was sufficient.  But the brussels sprouts were almost blanched, stripped of flavor and the mashed potatoes had not a hint of truffle.  So the entree was basically a dissapointment.  The best part of the dinner, the most memorable moment of the evening, had to be when a cockroach crawled across the table in front of me.  I could further explain about the bizarre french waiter, the dessert....But I think the last memory says enough on its own. Mercer Kitchen did not live up to its reputation nor its sophistacted decor.  Disappointing.
