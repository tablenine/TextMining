Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
Sushi Gen is an authentic sushi-ya for the counter sitting fishy. They are always spot on. Make sure to ask what is fresh today before ordering away. Unlike Sasabune, who has fresh fish every day (liars), Gen will actually tell you the truth which is good because the truth always comes out in the flavor and texture of the fish. They seem to always have amazing yellowtail belly, and the Uni here has never let me down. They have quail egg in abundance, so put it on your Ikura &amp; Natto handroll, delish! The rice is also suprisingly high grade, this place hits it right on the nose.
