Restaurant: May Street Market
Category: American (New)
Update:  We went here to celebrate my start of medical school with my parents.  While the food was very good, no mention was made of our special occasion, whereas previously a huge fuss was made over my birthday.  No one even said anything about it.  The waitress also spilled wine on the table, and didn't split the check correctly (we wanted the wine on our bill instead of my parents).  The valet was nowhere to be found when we drove up, so after waiting a while, my husband ended up having to drive around to find street parking.   That being said, our wine was excellent (suggested by the server), the food was nice, and we had a lovely time.  May street market was good, just not spectactular like it was before.  I would probably wait a while before coming back and wouldn't trust it for a flawless occasion.
