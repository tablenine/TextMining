Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
Gave it another chance at the Brig last night. There was absolutely no line, so that kinda had me concerned.. . We ordered a bacon and gruyere grilled cheese sandwich and a dessert melt. The bacon and gruyere was nice and greasy as it should be. But then the cheese wasnt melted. Bacon wasnt good but whats the point of non melted cheese. weak. Then the dessert melt tasted ok, but its just bread and nutella.. . you can make this stuff at home. and for the price, you can make it at home for days.. . and they charge tax instead of having a nice rounded off price. stick with a real roach coach, or something with a better hook.
