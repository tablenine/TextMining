Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
I had a Forrest Gump moment today. I was on North Ave. near Melrose/Elmwood Park, and for no reason at all I just kept RUN-NING (driving actually) east, and ended up in Humboldt. Okay, okay maybe subconsciously I knew I'd eventually pass Cemitas Puebla and gravitate toward some food. . . I first learned about this place on our very own Yelp, and subsequently viewed the DD&amp;D segment. Like everybody else, I figuratively drooled and considered the possibility that this food could be so good, it'll make me redefine food itself. Well, it didn't quite do that. In my world, it's not the mecca of all things authentic Mexican. It is, however, authentic and really good. . . I still have much more of the menu that I need to sample, but as far as what I did order (Cemita Milanesa and taco arabes), I was quite satisfied. The Cemita is a funky twist on your basic Mexican torta. I actually didn't taste the papalo. That could be because I scarfed it down too fast. The bread is almost like a hamburger bun on steroids. Soft, but not too soft. There's plenty of avacado taste, but the chipotle and cheese is what makes the Cemita. . . As for the taco arabes? I will go as far as to say it's THE reason to come here. There's not much out there quite like it that I've experienced. So simple, yet unique. Cooked meat, onions in a pillowey soft tortilla and covered in chipotle hot sauce? Always a good combination in my book.. . After months of curiosity, the Cemita craving beast in me has finally been quieted...for now. I will definitely be back with some friends.
