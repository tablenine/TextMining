Way over priced!  Should be $$$. Small portions. I paid $17.50 for fish and chips and got four pieces of fish that each measured 3 inches by 1.5 inches. (supposed to be Cod; it was not - probably mahi, it had yucky brown flesh streaks). The chips were exactly one cup of frozen Ore Ida's. Tartar sauce was good. Wife's pork chop ($20) was good (about a six once chop). Daughter's chicken and mac n cheese was tasteless and salty.  Don't bother.
