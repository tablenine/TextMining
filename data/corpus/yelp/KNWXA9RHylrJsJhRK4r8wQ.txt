There are times when I just want to get out of my house and wander around.  Some of these wandering around times include a visit to New Wave.  . . I'm not really one to hang out in a coffee shop and even if I were, I don't think I would choose New Wave.  It's like the 80's threw up in this joint.  Not that there's anything wrong with that...but I was around in the 80's and kinda think this whole 80's "retro" movement is stupid.  . . I will grab a carmel latte from here to sip while I wander aimlessly around "the Square" because they make a decent cup o' joe.
