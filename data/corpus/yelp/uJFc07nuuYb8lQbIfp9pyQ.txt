Their Lamb Noodle Soup was to die for.  I could live without the leek pie or the pan-fried pork buns, which were pretty good, but the lamb noodle soup was incredible!  It had a meaty flavor without being too salty and the noodles tasted fresh and had a wonderful slight chewiness to them.  Soup is not generally a reliable choice in restaurants due to use of some non-home-made base, but this was heaven.
