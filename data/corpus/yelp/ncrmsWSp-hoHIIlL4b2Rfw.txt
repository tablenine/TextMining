Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Mmm... Father's Office.... . I remember hearing about Father's Office from one of my friends sometime in mid-2007.. . I heard about it again sometime later that year.. . I finally tried the place in the Spring of 2008. This was the Santa Monica location- I do not believe the Culver location was open yet.. . Let me just say that, yes, I though the burger was pretty awesome, and their Beer selection was amazing... BUT- I was not impressed. Waiting in line for 30 minutes to enter this cramped little place, where it was impossible to find a seat definitely ruined the experience. In fact- this was supposed to be the experience. This experience was not worth the awesome burger and beer.. . Fast foreword a few months and low and behold, a new location opens. I check it out. Now this is an experience I can handle... the rewards of the original without all the fuss.. . Sure, it may be a bit pricey... but what do you expect at a bar in LA?. . By the way- I am hesitant to write this review- I do not want to be required to wait in line next time I go because everyone realizes the ease of coming here vs the Santa Monica location.
