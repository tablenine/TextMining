Whhaaaattt? How have I not reviewed Gibsons?? Probably because I just don't appreciate a good steak. I know, I know...how dare I live in Chicago and not appreciate a good steak. . . I do love Gibson's seafood friendly sister Hugo's...so much so that I always order off of Hugo's menu when eating at Gibson's (they conveniently share a kitchen). This has never been a problem in the past, but tonight when I asked for Hugo's menu my waitress glared at me like I had just run off with her husband. Well, excuse me for not being a meat lover!. . Much to my waitress's dismay Hugo's made me some delicious grilled shrimp. The rest of the meal was just eh- i'm guessing that the fact we just walked in at 9:30 on a Wednesday night had something to do with it. The salad was actually kind of inedible, the double baked potato (usually so good) wasn't anything special, and the side of broccoli was just broccoli (I expect more from Gibsons). Â And....when it came time for dessert they didn't have my favorite banana cake. My, oh my....what has happened to Gibsons?. . Tonight's experience at Gibsons was 3 stars (if even that), but because they share a kitchen with my beloved Hugo's and it's not really fair for me to judge a steakhouse when I'm not a steak lover I'll be generous with 4 stars. And they may actually earn that 4th star if they put that banana cake back on the dessert menu!
