I love this place - everything is amazing, I've never had a bad meal.  And the garlic on the table, I swear I could just have that for dinner.  (And sometimes I have and had my meal boxed up for leftovers!). . Also this is a great place for groups.  I've had a couple b-day gatherings there and everyone has walked away saying what a great place it was!
