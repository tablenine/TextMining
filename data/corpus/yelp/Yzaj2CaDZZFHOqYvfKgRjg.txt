Restaurant: Feast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
We went to Feast randomly on a Sunday night and were pleasantly surprised. It has a enormous outside patio which was nice to enjoy a nice summer night. We only had a bottle of wine and a few appetizers but everything we had was great. We had the tuna napoleon and the mussels. Both were great tasting large portions and only $10 a piece. Apparently Monday and Tuesdays are half price bottles of wine. We will be back to try out the entrees and cheap wine soon.
