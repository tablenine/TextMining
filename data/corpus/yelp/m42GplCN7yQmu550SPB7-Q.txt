First and foremost: the service.  Reviews I read of this place before going frequently mentioned poor service, so I went with fairly low expectations.  I was utterly blown away by the exact opposite.  We went with a strict vegetarian in the party, which turned out to be a problem because many seemingly Japanese vegetarian dishes are often cooked with bonito  broth.  The waiter went through every vegetable dish on the menu with my friend, and even went and spoke to the cooks just to double-check.  He even had a special vegetarian dish made and brought up.  He went above and beyond most waitstaff service I have experienced at the best restaurants I have been to.. . That said, the decor is incredible - it's dark, quiet, mysterious and makes you feel like you stepped through a door to a different dimension.  Don't expect complete privacy, but the booths offer much more than most restaurants, and are ideal for dates.  I'm sure the bad service reviews may be due to waiters thinking intimate parties would prefer to be interrupted less.  Watch where you're stepping, though - I tripped on some steps twice.  Then again, that could just be me.. . Now for the food - delicious, solid Japanese dishes, but nothing I was totally blown away by.  The cream cheese/eel tempura rolls were my favorite, and I had a really amazing daikon soup-type dish.  The desserts, however, were exquisite.  The grapefruit agar was one of the most incredible desserts I've ever had, and I will absolutely go back just for that.  The green tea creme brulee was interesting and delicious, and the cheesecake was refreshingly different and also completely amazing.  Everything I think was well worth the price.  . . I will be going back, and bringing friends.  You should check it out.
