Different Experience. Great Atmosphere. The Food was only ok. The service....absolutely horrible. It makes no sense for a group of people who ordered food at the same time to receive their orders an hour apart. I never even got a refill on my drink during the 3 hours I was there. If you do go here to try the food, I recommend the Mediterranean chicken or the beef shish kabobs. The belly dancer was kind of cool, but I will not be attending this restaurant again.
