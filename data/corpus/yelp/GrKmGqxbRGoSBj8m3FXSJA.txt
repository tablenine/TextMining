Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
I just don't get this place--it isn't really a diner but it isn't a "nice" restaurant either.  It is old, but not in a good, retro-chic kind of way.  Upon entering it felt a bit dirty/run-down.  Overall feels outdated and overly pretentious for what it is.  Breads were boring.  Famous Maytag Potato Chips were so doused in sauce we couldn't taste/find the chips.  Both entrees were lame (fries had a "freezer" taste) so we decided to cut our losses and skip dessert.  I'd spend the same and get SO much more at Floataway or Cakes and Ale or really almost any higher end restaurant in the city.  A mediocre restaurant with extra waiters to increase the level of service (oh and a guy who comes around mispronouncing your name and making assumptions about your marital status).  Classy?  Meh.
