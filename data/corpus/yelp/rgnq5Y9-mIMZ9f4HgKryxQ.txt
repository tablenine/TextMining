A group of us went yesterday evening to try out their "happy hour" special.  For $15.00 you get to choose a cocktail off of the happy hour list and then 5 "small plates".  The small plates turned out to be substantial and REALLY delicious.  I ordered calamari, spicy tuna roll, panko shrimp,  seafood roll &amp; pork dumplings.  Everything was just fantastic &amp; the service was attentive &amp; gracious.. . I've passed by this restaurant a million times (well, that's maybe a bit of an exaggeration) and am really glad that I finally made a point of trying it.. . BTW, if you don't want to valet park, they seem to have a self-park lot on the Piedmont Road side.
