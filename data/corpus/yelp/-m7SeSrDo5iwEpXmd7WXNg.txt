Restaurant: Green Zebra
Category: Vegetarian
I brought my family here from out of town, which included my sister's four-year-old son. I told the hostess over the phone when I place the reservation that we would have a child in our group, and she warned me that "it wasn't really a kids' restaurant." But since we were going at 5 PM on a Sunday (and he is extremely well behaved) I figured it would be fine. . . It was great. The service at Green Zebra was professional and attentive. They were very sweet to my nephew and even made him a special fruit and cheese plate. . . The rest of the food was good, too. I had one of the only non-vegetarian entries, a trout dish that was delicious. The portions are small; the idea is to order about three things per person, but I think we averaged about two per person. While small, the portions are so good and satisfying that you don't leave feeling deprived at all.. . It's definitely a good spot to bring vegetarians who want something a little special. And the wine and beer list is great too. I would love to go back!
