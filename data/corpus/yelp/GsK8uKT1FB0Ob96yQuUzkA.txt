Category: Bakeries
Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner or Bakery...It's ALL Good!. . Want a throwback to NY delis? Make your way to Canter's! The surly vintage waitresses will make you feel like you are in the 5 boroughs. The pastrami, corned beef and reubens melt in your mouth and the traditional deli fare will make you wish you could visit this place more often (it's an hour drive for me).. . Nosh on lox and bagels. Try the pancakes or eggs. Heck I love all of the breakfast options. Don't be afraid to explore. Go with a group and order many different items so that you can share and sample.. . Stop by the bakery on the way out and take some Canters baked love home with you to enjoy for a day or two.
