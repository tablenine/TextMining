Restaurant: Nick&#39;s Food To Go
Category: Greek
Not much I can add about this place that isn't already covered by other reviewers... but I still have to say it.. . The lamb gyro is delicious. and deliciously messy!. . Google maps is confusing (it's on the corner of Hill St and MLK Jr Blvd).. . I wasn't a fan of the fries, but I dont love fries in general. I did like the tzatziki sauce.. it was quite saucy, in a good way.. . If you're craving meaty tasty cheap Greek food, this is the place to go!
