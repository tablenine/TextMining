The food was amazing. The portions were beyond belief - particularly the pancakes. We had to share a stack because not only were there a lot, they were just slightly larger than the dinner plate it sat on. It tasted fresh, not created from some pre-made batter stored in a refrigerator somewhere in the back. The burgers were also huge and tasty. The service, to my surprise, was actually pretty good and we were a pretty big group. The wait for a table was about 10 minutes and you'd have to wait outside. But that didn't bother me as much. Our server kept refilling our drinks and were easy to call upon.
