cucumber margaritas!!!  ciudad is the most flavorful south american cuisine conveniently located near the MOCA.  i was impressed with the following flavors of the night after celebrating MOCA's first 30 years:. . poblano salad with seared white tuna. tuna ceviche with banana chips. spinach with corn and black beans (i had the bacon removed). shishito pepers with lemon. beet salad with bee pollen. . and once again the cucumber margarita!!!
