When I don't feel like driving all the way to Ocean Star for dim sum, this is a great place to get dumplings.  I'm not all that well versed in the names of the dishes, but I do love the pork buns and the shu mai (sorry if I'm misspelling, but Chinese isn't my first language.)  The prices are great, and I get filled up really quickly.  If you get here during peak hours, it can be agonizing to watch the kitchen staff make dumplings while you're starving your ass off and smelling the appetizing aromas.  Therefore, I strive to get here right when they open, 5:00, I think.  The place is not as big as you'd like and fills up quickly early.  Just writing this review is making me hungry, and it's only 8:30 AM!
