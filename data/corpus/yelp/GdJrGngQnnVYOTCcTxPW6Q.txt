I went back thrice and each time the taste and service was a bit lacking than the time before. have they become too popular? have my tastebuds gotten used to their ingredients and therefore, not rejoicing anymore? . . i can't believe the line is still hella long. one thing is for sure, kogi ignited the food truck craze and now i'm on a hunt for anything new. great. thanks man.
