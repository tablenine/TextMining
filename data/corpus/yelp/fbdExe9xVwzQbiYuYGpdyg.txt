A great little sushi dinner was had here-- Sashimi Deluxe on my end, and Sushi Deluxe for the lady.  In summation:  Portions are fantastic, the fish is fresh, and service was excellent.  Price is also definitely a great value.. . I've been told that the waits here can be horrendous, but we were lucky and got seated right away.. . Our server was very quick, and was helpful with suggestions regarding the menu.  She was very attentive, despite a very crowded and full restaurant.  The chefs were all quick and skilled from what I saw.  Our dinners arrived-- the lady's sushi deluxe platter looked wonderful, and the Sashimi Deluxe platter was loaded with at least 10 different varieties of fish.  . . Do try to come early, since by the time we left, the line was completely and utterly full.  That said, I highly recommend it!
