Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I do believe it's been seven (7) years since I've had breakfast at Flo! In fact, when I moved to the City in the year 2000, my apt. hunter recommended Flo upon securing me my place. When I was breaking in the Ukey Village for y'all back then and living at Chicago and Leavitt, I used to go all the time! Walking into Flo for the first time in a long time, I felt my breath taken away. Kind of like seeing the same person, but years have passed, and they've broken from their coccoon as a beautiful butterfly! Yeah, it was like that....They've opened up the space a bit since then, but the food has not changed: it's still incredible. . . This was the perfect spot for my post-Holiday Bash Hangover Brunch! I do believe they're still serving the Intelligentsia "Flo Blend", and it was just what I needed to awaken brain cells that took a Shiner Bock beating the night before. I'm a big fan of New Mexican-style breakfast and was tempted to get the Chilaquiles to see if they were still as good as I remembered. But the Breakfast Burrito was my old fave and did not dissapoint on this visit either! Each layer of egg, sour cream, jalapeno, pico de gallo and spinach tortilla added to the fresh whole. It was filling without seeming heavy.. . My dining partner opted for the Flo Style eggs and must've liked them, as she saved Flo's a dishwasher cycle by cleaning her plate completely! The homestyle fries are great little potatoes with just the right amount of seasoning. Our waitress was super-attentive without being overbearing. She kept the Flo Blend flowing, and it was much appreciated!. . I plan on visiting Flo again in seven (7) years to see if I still love it....No way man, I'll be back in seven days!
