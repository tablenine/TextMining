i ordered the happy vegan salad and i couldn't be happier with my salad. the hummus, farrow wheat, and tabboleuh were perfect. the pasta pearls couldve used a little bit more seasoning. the salads here are made with expertise and precision. once i can eat poultry again (taking medicine) i need to try the rest of the menu.
