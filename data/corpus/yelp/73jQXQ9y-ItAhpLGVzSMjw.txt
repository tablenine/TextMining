The best subs in the city!  Bread is great with fresh meats and trimmings.   While you are getting a sandwich make sure to pick up some olives on the side.  They have some solid veggie options.  You can call a head and place your order and avoid the lunch lines.. They also have a nice selection of meats for the grill.  Can't go wrong with the Italian sausage; perfect on the grill!
