Okay, fine. Their pizzas are pretty darn good. =D. . The BIANCO is very refreshing but it is a little strange to have fresh veggies sprinkled on the top of my pizza like a salad. The MEATBALL pizza is recommended for people who like a little more meat on their pizza. Seriously, the cheese on all of these are SO good they just stretch on and on forever when you bite into them =). . We also got the special which had prosciutto, broccolini and berrata cheese? Whatever cheese...it was GOOD! =D All the pizzas are decent size to share and only $16 for a superb quality pizza! =) . . Their clams and mussels were surprisingly good too, and I'm not really a huge seafood fan. I realize I sometimes make myself sound like I don't like ANY food except at these places I try but...I mean, that's why I go to GOOD restaurants to try food right?? haha =D. . Modena salad was very refreshing and yummy too :). . And of course, we had to get the portobello fries again. Love those.. . Overall, much better experience this time with a bigger group of people. Go for the pizza. Yay!
