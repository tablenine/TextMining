Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
It's just a hot dog, but it is also part of LA / Hollywood that you need to see - eat.. . I road trip up here the other day and saw it out of the corner of my eye.  Line of people standing outside a fairly small building.  Plastic chairs to eat on.  I need to tell you that you need to be ready to order when your time comes,  do be slow. . . I had a basic chilli dog and it was good.  4 star good.
