Went there yesterday night with a couple of guys, one of the few bbq places that stay open pretty late. . . The food ordered is a pretty big portion and the sides are terrific. I had the tips w/ collard greens and beans. The rest of them had ribs w/ mac n cheese and sweet potato fries. Last guy had a brisket sandwich that was quite dry. . . But the reason for 3 stars. Everyone at my table who ordered ribs including Spare, Babyback, and Tips... we all agree there was this unavoidable taste of gas. We tried using the mustard blend bbq sauce and the other sauces.. it was still there. It's been twelve hours and the taste is still in my Â mouth. When i burp, I still smell it. My friend has washed his hands 5 times and showered; the smell still lingers.. If that's the smoked flavor, then call me a noob.. . The live band is quite loud and I was yelling over them even though I didn't get a drink..  I might be back but we'll see. Maybe yesterday was just a bad night. Our server was very pleasant and she checked up on us every 10-15mins.
