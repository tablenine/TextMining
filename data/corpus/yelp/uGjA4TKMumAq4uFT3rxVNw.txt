Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
i am not a vegetarian nor a vegan.  but if all vegetarian or vegan dishes tasted like veggie grill...i would be converted.  I had the santa fe chicken sandwich...oh my goodness...it was so tasty and totally 100% plant based.  It's better than any actual bird chicken sandwich I've ever eaten.  I also had the sweet potato fries..another delicious dish.  All it lacked was some sort of dipping sauce.  I ended up using my friend's southwestern spiced vegan mayo as a dipping alternative.  Also had their fresh lemonade...cold and quenching.  overall..it was grand.  wish they would open one up here in san francisco.  would be there everyday.
