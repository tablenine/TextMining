well i finally got to trying the mozza.. . first off your reservation system blows. i don't want to hear what caller # I am and I don't want to wait 15 mins to make a reso. let me leave my # and call me back when I can talk to a person.. . now then.. the staff from the minute i walk in the door is attentive and friendly. great vibe great atmosphere.. . The service from the minute we sat down was attentive and amazing. but the table we sat at had a small swarm of fruit flies. ;( and one flew right into my wine. The manager was on it... saw my distress and quickly replaced it. . . we were then met with a taste of mozzarella with tapenade compliments of the mozzarella bar...YUM. . we then ordered the grilled prawns which was delightful and the buffalo mozzarella with proscuitto....you just cant go wrong with this dish.. . then my friend ordered the halibut and i ordered the Grilled Whole Orata wrapped in radicchio and shared. . . i would not order the orata again. i think the radicchio just overpowered everything and i was just not excited about any of it. . . Good thing my friend ordered the halibut over bok choy it was amazing down to the last bite. . . we should of went with our first instinct and shared the halibut as neither of us could finish our plates.. . but we saved roomed for dessert or at least i did... nom nom nom. . The Strawberry Crepini was the perfect way to end the night.. . the two dishes that stand out here were the halibut and the strawberry crepini. . I took away two stars for the Orata and the menacing fruit flies but then added a star bc your Strawberry crepini was so damn good!
