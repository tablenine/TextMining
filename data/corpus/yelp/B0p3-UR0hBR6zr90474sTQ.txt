I'm with Rachel T -- this place is amazing. The service is good, the food is consistently GREAT, and I always leave happy (the important part). Others have complained about the Pho... There are certain things that I would expect Gingergrass to do better than a tiny run-down Pho place, but Pho is not one of them. Get a noodle bowl instead -- the vermicelli without broth -- and you will be happy. At about $8, it's even competitive with the hole-in-the-wall spots. The beef noodle bowl is particularly good, as is the tofu. I also dig the Bo Sate. You'll probably have to wait, but the Red Lion and Silverlake Wine are both great places to be stranded for half an hour. If you just want the food in a hurry, you can call ahead for pickup.
