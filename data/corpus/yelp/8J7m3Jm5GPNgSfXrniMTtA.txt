Restaurant: Roasters
Category: Southern
So as a vegetarian, I usually hate going to restaurants where I can only order side dishes.  Roasters, however, is a different story.  The sides here are deeee-freaking-licious!  Let's see:. . - All you can eat cornbread. - Stuffing w/ cranberry sauce. - Sweet potato souffle. - Creamed spinach. . All for less than $6! . . The only con is that they close at 9:30 - why so early Roasters?
