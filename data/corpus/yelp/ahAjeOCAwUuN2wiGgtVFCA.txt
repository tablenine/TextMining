The cutest restaurant w/ a nice outdoor sitting area. . The Hainan Chicken was tender, juicy, flavorful and the rice was just busting with intensity. MmMmmmmmmmmm. . THe pork chop curry was "okay" but the baked Halibut in cheesy cream sauce was unbelievable. I practically ate the whole thing myself!
