I've always wanted to try this place, but honestly after dining there..I wasn't satisfied!. . The decor and ambiance is wonderful. Once you step into the restaurant, there is a big aquarium and a glass floor pathway with Koi(?) swimming around.. . Food is way too overpriced. Perhaps, it's because I've had delicious Asian food elsewhere for a fraction of the cost at Crustacean. . . Great date place, but not worth the money.
