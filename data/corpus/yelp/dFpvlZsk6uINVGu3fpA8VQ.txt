Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Just got back from my first Griddle experience, and I'm already thinkin about what I'm gonna try next time.  Arguably the BEST breakfast I have ever had.  From the fresh, french-pressed-at-your-table-coffee to the ridiculously enormous pancakes, everything was top-notch.  We had the pumpkin pankcakes (AMAZING), but I found myself jealously staring at some espresso-chocolate versions next to us...it seems that any pancake/french toast/waffle option will fail to disappoint.  Next time, I will be bringing many friends and forcing them to each order something different that I will then sample.. . A couple tips from a first-timer.... . -Get there early...it was packed by the time we left at around 10:30.. -Order coffee...the French press is fun.. -Skip the egg dishes...they were tasty (especially the breakfast tacos), but you're better off saving all the room for the pancakes.
