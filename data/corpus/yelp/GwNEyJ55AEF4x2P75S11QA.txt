I'm torn with how to rate this place.. . I love the veggie and bean salads.  HATED some of the meat offerings in the deli case.  LOVED a buttery and fantastic lemon square.  DESPISED a dry crumbly Betty-Crocker tasting cupcake.. . But I come back, not for a meal, but for the cheese.. . The cheeeeeeeessssssssseeeeeeeeeeeee.  Oh lord, the cheese.. . I've shopped that little shop next to the Alcove in Los Feliz.  Unimpressive, no sampling, and pushy sales.  I've shopped the La Brea bakery.  Limited options there.  I've shopped Monsieur Marcels.  Generic and pedantic.. . But the cheese case at Joans is always a delight.  And the staff actually KNOWS what they're shilling!  I casually mentioned that I like Morbier, and a certain blue, and from nowhere the girl behind the counter handed me three samples of some of the most fantastic cheese I've had on this continent, perfectly geared towards my taste and inclination at that moment.  That's some skill, because I'm a picky, and fickle cheese-eater. . . There's always something surprising, and always something new for me to fall in love with there.. . So I love the cheese.   Best cheese counter in L.A.. . But the crowds, the waits, the crazy prices for other stuff, the everything else that makes coming to Joans tedious and cumbersome?  Neh.  I'm just here for the cheese.
