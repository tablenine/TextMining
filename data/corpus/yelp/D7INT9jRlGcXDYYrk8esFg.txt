Went here for lunch with a friend because our friend is the bartender.  I must say I love the decor...super swanky.  Its nice.  We sat down and chatted for a little and then we decided to try out the lobster soup and the rock shrimp.  Both were GREAT!  YUM!!!  The shrimp were really flavorful and the soup wasnt too heavy but nice.  Then on to the entrees.  I dont eat meat but I do eat seafood...unfortunately, there menu is very much catered to the meat eater, which is totally ok but I would have liked at least an option to go to.  I ended up getting the nicose salad....must say, not impressed at all.  I didnt even eat half.  It was kind of gross if you ask me.  The tuna didnt even taste good.  There was like only three little pieces and I think I ate like one...not good.  Plus, the dressing was really weird.  I usually like nicose salad but not this one.  My friend did the mini lobster sandwich and filet sandwich.  I had a bite of the lobster and it was great!  BONUS.  Overall, I think this is a great spot if you are a meat eater.  However, for me, I dont think I will go back for the food but for the decor and company of friends, maybe....
