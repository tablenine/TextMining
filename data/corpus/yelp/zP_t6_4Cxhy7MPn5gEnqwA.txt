Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
And you Kitsch'n, I think I will miss you most of all! . . I have spent many a morning healing hangovers at my local Roscoe Kitsch'n.  Sadly, I am moving shortly to Andersonville.  Already I can forsee that there will be many trips back to the old neighborhood just to get a bite of coconut french toast, or to hang out at the tiki-beer-garden out back. . . There is more to the Kitsch'n than a hangover brunch!  Yummy chicken sandwiches, rosemary mashed potatoes,  and club sadwiches, just to name a few. I still have to go back to try the twinkie-tiramisu! It looks soooooo good.
