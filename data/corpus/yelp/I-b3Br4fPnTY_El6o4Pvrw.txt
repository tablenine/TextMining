When fast food becomes an overwhelming experience, is it still delicious? You bet it is, when coming from this infamous hunk of "Hotlanta's" history. It was one of the cheesiest -- but tastiest -- pit stops of my area tour. Just stay away from that sweet tea nonsense. I still feel a little diabetic from sampling that vile stuff.
