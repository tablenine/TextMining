I've only been once and it was a long time ago which is very disappointing, especially considering how close this place is.  I remember a pretty decent meal with a crazy bread basket.  I was really excited to see they had a particularly bottle of Sicilian wine as I had brought back the same one from Italy and did not think it was available in the U.S.  That was definitely an awesome surprise.  Anyway, it's definitely worth checking out and better than Two Urban Licks in my opinion.. . 4
