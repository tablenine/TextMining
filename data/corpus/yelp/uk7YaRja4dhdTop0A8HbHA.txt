The huge line in front of the restaurant all the time was what attracted me this place.  Something must be that good to have a line day in and day out.  So we walked in, signed up and sat in a crowded, dingy restaurant that seems to have been there for years.  Decor probably has not been changed or even repainted since they opened.  Not too impressed so far.  . . But the food was impressive.  We ordered the ramen with fried rice combo.  Yum!  Yes the ramen broth and cut pork is fatty but it is soooo good.  The fried rice with ramen broth was phenomenal.  I couldn't believe how fast I inhaled the food.  It could be that we did wait over an hour and was absolutely starving.  . . I only gave it a 4 stars because the decor and grease soaked walls seriously needs a make over.
