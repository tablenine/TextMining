All else aside... two words:  strawberry roulade.  You are to die for... You are a dream dessert come true.  And this, coming from a serious chocolate fan, is truly saying something.  I do love this place, although you'd best be prepared to wait awhile if you show up for weekend brunch.  But their food is delicious, their coffee is just right, and the desserts are enough to make you want to press your ugly mug right up against the glass counter and drool.
