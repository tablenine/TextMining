Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
I vaguely remember eating at Joy's when I first moved to Chicago a few years ago and I never went back.  I honestly can't remember why.  I guess it just didn't stand out in my mind as being really fantastic or enjoyable.  Or maybe I took a date there that went horribly wrong and I blocked it out?  Possibly I ordered something that didn't agree with my tummy and the argument between food and said tummy caused a memory lapse?  . . Well whatever happened, I made a return visit this weekend and my 5-star rating is based on one thing, and one thing only:  Phuket Noodles w/ Beef.  I might need a drool-guard for my keyboard as I'm typing this.  They were just that good.  I love Thai.  I try new Thai places any chance I get and as I said, previously this place didn't stand out in my mind.  But now when I'm craving Thai I think those delicious spinach noodles and seared slices of beef will immediately come to mind.  And the fact that you can also order online and have it delivered is just plain genius.
