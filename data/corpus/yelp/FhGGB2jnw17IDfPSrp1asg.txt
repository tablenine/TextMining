Restaurant: The Earl
Category: Dive Bars
This is my favorite place to see a show.  They always have a fantastic line-up.  I usually go to eat at the Earl before shows and I've loved everything I've gotten.  It's also one of the few places that I usually can't finish my meal.  The portions are huge.. The venue itself is a bit smoky, but not too bad.  It's a trade-off since if it wasn't 21+ and smoking allowed, there would be quite a few hipster high-school kids there.  A la the Tabernacle and the Variety Playhouse.
