One of the better places that serves up traditional Vietnamese food.  The sandwiches aren't your typical Viet sandwiches, these are headcheese meats (almost like cold cuts but better) and have a lighter taste.  Needless to say, I always end up getting 1 on every visit.  This is also a good place to buy small baquettes to take home to make your own little sandwiches.  They bake them fresh and other restaurants even buy their breads from Lee's Bakery.  . . I would recommend one of my favorite dishes, and the one I tend to always order, the "hu tieu nam vang" noodle.  I prefer to get this noodle dry, meaning they do not add the broth and instead bring a small bowl with the broth on the side for you to sip on.  My usual order consists of this noodle and a sandwich.  Admittedly this combination leaves me very full at the end, but doesn't tend to way me down.  This is typical of Viet food, gets you full, but doesn't kill you 1 hour later.  Light and tasty!. . Enjoy!
