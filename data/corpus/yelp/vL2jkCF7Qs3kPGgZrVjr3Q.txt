Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
I've been to the Little Door a handful of times over the past year and every time it's spectacular. The food and the wine are always perfect! This is my go to place for a date. The ambiance is incredibly romantic and paves the way for a beautiful night. The minute I sit I order the . "Mezze" Assorted Mediterranean Appetizers with Basket of Homemade Pita, Flatbread, Kibbeh, Falafel and Spanakopita. You can pick at this for a good 45 minutes while you chat and figure out your meal plan together.. On this last trip I had the Roasted Duck Breast &amp; Duck Leg Confit with a Honey, Lemon and Lavender Sauce Basmati Rice and Steamed Asparagus which was off the charts!. Thank you for another great meal Little Door.
