Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
Uncle Julio's House of Crap, is more like it. I know it's a chain, but I grew up with Chi-Chi's, and THAT was a Mexican chain, gall darn't. Uncle Julio's *does* put pork in just about everything, and being (semi-)kosher it made it hard to find anything worth eating. The enchiladas were not very good, but I will say the chips and salsa were quite delish. The margarita was good, but definitely not worth the price. We went during the middle of the day, so there wasn't a line and the place wasn't packed out, but there WERE a lot of screaming children. My advice? Avoid the mid-afternoon/early evening crowd ... better yet, avoid Uncle Julio all together unless you like mass produced, pre-packaged, unauthentic Mexican.
