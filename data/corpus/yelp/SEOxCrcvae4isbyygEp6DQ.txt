I returned to Dogwood for dinner with my parents. Once again it was excellent all around.. Being non-adventurous (and craving the fried chicken since the last time I was here), I personally didn't try anything new.. My mother started with the cauliflower soup - at first she found it a bit strong, but once she stirred in the sherry cream topping she found it quite good, and very rich. For her entree she got the Seared sea scallops. "melt in your mouth tender", she cleaned her plate including the braised cabbage with pork belly and cream that she was questionable about when she ordered.. My father had the "Benton's" prosciutto wrapped arugula salad and really enjoyed it - especially the unique wrapped presentation. For his entree he had the seared salmon. He found it cooked to perfection and very enjoyable. He was surprised he liked the garlic spinach with caviar-vermouth butter, as he usually doesn't like cooked spinach.. We finished off the meal with the Maple Cheesecake, which was again delicious (as was my meal of tomato bisque soup and the fried chicken - see earlier review).. Service was wonderful, although I didn't catch our waiter's name.. In addition, the prices seem very reasonable for the quantity and quality of food. . . I'm upgrading to 5 stars, as I don't think there would be a single thing I would have changed about my dining experience either of the times I have been to Dogwood.
