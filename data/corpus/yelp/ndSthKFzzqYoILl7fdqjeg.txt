Be prepared for two things: waiting up to an hour if you don't have a reservation and a DELICIOUS meal. I think its worth the wait but make a reservation or call ahead to put your name on the list. I went there with 3 friends last Saturday and the place was packed at 6:30pm. We almost ate the plates because the food was so tasty and including drinks, we only paid $100/couple. Many people rave about the fried chicken and its good but the pasta with brussels sprouts and mushrooms was easily the best thing on the menu. I have one issue with the menu. It must be the name but I would have preferred buttermilk bisuits and gravy with the chicken instead of waffles-waffles and chicken really don't go together, it has always perplexed my palate.
