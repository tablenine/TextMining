Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Best Japanese Ramen ever!!! Service = fast and friendly!!!. You can customize how you like the noodles cooked (soft, normal, or hard), how much oil and flavor to put (low, normal, a lot).. The broth is always freshly serve hot! My kids love the spam musubi which is only served during lunch.. Great lunch prices! Great to hang out for dinner &amp; drinks.. One thing that I love most about 'Shinsengumi' is that no matter which restaurant you go to... they take pride in their food. They take the time to train each chef to ensure that each and every one that cooks the food are an expert to that specific field (ramen, yakitori...)!!!. Btw, again we're soo happy we found this rosemead location so we don't have to drive all the way to Gardena and/or Torrance.
