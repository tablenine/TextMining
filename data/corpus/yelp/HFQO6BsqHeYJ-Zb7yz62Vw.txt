Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I adore breweries and bar and grills. There's just something so nice about their comfortable atmosphere, as well as the filling food and great drink selection. . . I was very disappointed with Father's Office. . . If you're looking for a really trendy brewery, this place is it. It's also overcrowded, has no waiter service and, while the drink selection is good, the food is overall mediocre. My friends and I spent god knows how long trying to find a table, and it was only through sheer cunning that we managed to snag one. I saw people standing along the walls of the place, waiting for a table for something like close to an hour. If you're not quick enough or lucky enough, you're not going to get a table on a really busy weekend night. . . Father's Office attempts to serve a refined bar menu that includes burgers and fries along side with duck confit and bone marrow. That sounds interesting but in execution it falls flat. The menu is sparse, there is a no substitution policy because they're that arrogant about their food, and the portions are small - running completely counter to the whole point of going to a bar and grill, where one is looking to get full on food and beer. . . They're famous for their cheeseburger but I don't eat beef and I'm allergic to dairy products so obviously that was an out. I picked the duck prosciutto salad because it sounded interesting. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again. It was a little too greasy for my taste, which is odd in a salad. My friends got the famous cheeseburger and they said it was good - but they wouldn't pay for it again. . . Overall, over-priced, over-hyped and not worth standing along a wall for almost an hour waiting for a table to open up for. All of this runs counter to what I would consider a great dining experience.
