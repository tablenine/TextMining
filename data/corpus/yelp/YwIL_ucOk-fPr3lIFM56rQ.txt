I'm a native Angelino and have not once heard of or been to this place until I had seen the episode of Man vs. Food just like all the rest of the reviewers have stated.  IMHO, I wasn't impressed at all.  Don't get me wrong, if you want spicy then come here, but if you're looking for a quality Ramen house and are not just looking for the hype then quickly turn the other way.  It wasn't that it was an unpleasant experience but more so that my expectations of the place were way too high.  I've been to several other Ramen houses and have had much greater tasting dishes.  . . It states that each dish comes with pork.  At least they didn't lie about it but 2 pieces doesn't qualify the dish as a meat dish to me.  I ordered a Miso #3 with bean sprouts and garlic and regretted the decision once i had seen my friends get theirs with egg and "extra" cha shu.  Why would anyone need to purchase extra meat for their dish?!?!  It was hard to find my noodles in the nest of bean sprouts so it irked me when I saw how cheap they went on the noodles.  . . Again, if you want to come for the experience and burn your mouth off then this is the place, but if you're really craving a good Ramen dish then you're better off elsewhere.
