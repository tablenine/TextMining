a well-kept secret of wrigleyville! their menu is a bit pricey (at least for my poor college student standards), but definitely worth it. they have live music in the back room, an ever-changing selection of artwork in the middle room around the coffee bar (which serves BOWLS of coffee and cocoa!), and a fully stocked bar in the front room. and with their warm, charming atmosphere and staff, this is a great little getaway!
