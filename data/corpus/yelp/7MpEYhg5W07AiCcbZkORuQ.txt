Restaurant: Caf√© Santorini
Category: Greek
Enjoyed a late lunch at Cafe Santorini. Liked the warm, toasty cheesy bread they brought to the table. We shared the Mediterranean sampler and porcini risotto. The portions are very filling. The sampler had quite a bit of everything, but it wasn't quite Chicken Maison. Risotto could have been a little softer, I could tell I wasn't in Italy.
