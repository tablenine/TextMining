Still all-out fantastic. In fact, my latest experience really mirrored my inaugural brush with HB food ecstasy, which is obviously a very, very good thing.. . So, what did I learn? That HB can execute perfection, and repeatedly. Too often I have returned to a restaurant for my favorite dish only to be disappointed by 'second-time fail syndrome'. Have no fear diners, HB gets it done!. . The condensed 'what you need to know' aka 'what you should order': you will never go wrong with the edam artichoke fritters, bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and brown sugar, smoked eggplant crostini, pan-roasted trout, 'Amsterdam-style' mussels, any of their chicken dishes, and housemade Belgian chocolate and the bread pudding for dessert.. . Thanks for reading. Now go and conquer... er, devour!
