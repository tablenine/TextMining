Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I love pinks and can't get enough of their hot dogs....but I hate damn lines.. . So what can I do so I don't have to wait in line and get those awesome hot dogs? . . Get my ass up early and go to Pinks when they opened cause that is the only time that there is no line.  . . For the people that don't like waiting in line for a pink's hot dog.  I am almost sure there is a HOT DOG lady around every corner late at night selling Hot dogs wrapped in bacon. . . Pinks is awesome, they have many different types of styles and sizes.  But if for some reason you are not interested in a hot dog, then they have some awesome burgers that might be a better option. . . Burgers and hot dogs can be messy at times, but what good food is not messy.
