Big Star.  You took over Pontiac's lot which made me a little sad, but I could get past it.  You are a taqueria, which made me happy because I like tacos.  You are the brainchild of some very successful people, which is always promising.  But Big Star, after the three tacos you served me today I wouldn't even be your friend on facebook.  . . Big Star would really like to be an upscale taco joint like de cero, but the flavors at de cero are well worth the price.  Instead, I was served 3 tiny, tiny taco-bites with a super salty pastor, bland rajas, and pork belly that was somehow dry and tough.  How one cooks pork belly to dry and tough is beyond me, but good job Big Star, you did it.  . . The salsas that came with my to-go order were delicious, so it wasn't a total loss.  I didn't step foot inside the joint so the decor, bar offerings, and service were lost on me.  For my money though, if I want a taco from a walk up taqueria in Wicker Park I'll head to Picante on Division.  Sorry Big Star, your food just ain't worth the hype.
