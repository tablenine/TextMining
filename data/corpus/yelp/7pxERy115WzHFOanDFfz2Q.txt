Restaurant: Willy&#39;s Mexicana Grill
Category: Mexican
I went once and I was hooked.  I am a Chipotle LOVER, but the ingredients here are far fresher and more flavorful than the typical ingredients of a Chipotle burrito (and you thought that was impossible!).  They use actual Spanish rice, and while they have all the standard tasty meat choices, they offer more vegetarian-friendly possibilities (like tofu and such) so everybody's happy!. . The service was quick and efficient, and the staff was very friendly.  I even had to ask someone to refill the sweet tea (I'm not a native Southern girl, but I have to say when I go back to the Midwest I will ache for readily available sweet tea), and he quickly obliged, joking and smiling along the way, even.. . Smiling while refilling the sweet tea?  Points, my friend, points.  Then he held the door open for my friend and I as we struggled out to the comfy patio with our arms full of our yummy lunches.. . My biggest sell: Willy's passed the tummy test.  Bad Mexican food will quickly and surely give me a tummyache, and I felt nothing but satisfied after this meal.. . For a fresh, fun, fill-you-up meal for a GREAT price, you should definitely check out Willy's.  YUM.
