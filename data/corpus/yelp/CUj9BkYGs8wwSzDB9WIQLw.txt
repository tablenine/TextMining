Great little place.  Been coming here for years.  Hainan Chicken Rice is the best in the area.  Not alot of seating inside but they've added some "curbside seating".   There's a reason why there's always a large crowd at this corner restaurant.  I usually just pick up a meal to go now since I can't ever get a seat without waiting.
