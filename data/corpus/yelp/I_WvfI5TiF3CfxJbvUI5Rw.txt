Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
Great seafood, classic diner food, decent prices.. . Glenn's started out less than great but in the past year they've really stepped up and become a great spot for seafood and the classic breakfast/brunch stuff:omlettes, french toast, pancakes, the usual.. . I like the low-key decor and I really dig the little baskets of crackers that greet you at the table. And the proprietor is polite, but always seems to be slightly annoyed by something or someone, which I find rather charming.. . In the past few months, they've introduced booze! And they are really strong! The Living Large Bloody Mary is great, and packed with goodies like veggies, shrimp, etc. But it nearly killed me; I couldn't finsh it.. . Definitely a great place for brunch, fun place to bring out of town friend for a taste of Chicago neighborhoods.
