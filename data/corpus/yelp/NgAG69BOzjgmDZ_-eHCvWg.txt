So honestly, I feel somewhat lost writing this review. One, because none of the pizzas really stood out as something I'd have to come back feening for. Secondly, my palette is not refined enough to appreciate the organicness (is that even a word?) of all the ingredients I can't even pronounce - whether that's a good thing or not I don't know.. . I will say the carbonara (bacon, peas and fried egg) and Mexicali blues (provolone, roasted shrimp, cilantro and lime) were rather interesting and new. The outdoor patio is also a great chill space.. . Overall, I have to give it at least a three star review. It would just be wrong to give Crust any less stars than what I gave Ian's pizza, and plus I feel like they're actually trying to put together some original recipes, not the what-can-I-put-on-a-pizza concept at Ian's. Ironically though, I'm kinda craving a Philly Steak pizza as I'm writing this.. . Note: The best way to maximize your money here is to go with a large group and order a pizza for each of you and share family style. Other wise, you'll be out $12-$16 with small single pizza you might not even like. Sit in the outdoor patio too!
