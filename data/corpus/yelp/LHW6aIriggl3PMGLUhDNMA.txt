Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
This cheesecake factory is not unlike any of the others. The portions are big, the food is fattie, and the prices are out of control. Â But they have the best shrimp pasta dish that I order ALL the time. Its so good I cant even remember the name!!! The cheesecake is delicious and I usually leave bloated, unable to walk, with a doggie bag in hand.
