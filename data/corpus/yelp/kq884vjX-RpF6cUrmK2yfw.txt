Restaurant: Mi Barrio Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
Quien es mas macho? Mi Barro o El Azteca? (waiting....) Si! Mi Barrio es muy macho!. . Why oh why do Atlantans prefer to spend their hard earned dinero in subprime Mexican joints when places like Mi Barrio can be found in, well, mi barrio? As others have noted, the building won't win any beauty contests. Generously described as "shack-like" from the outside, the inside is festooned with the finest faux wood siding and hanging Christmas lights this side of The Clermont Lounge. But the food is good and not too pricey. It's like eating at a long lost Mexican relative's home. Unfortunately, just like eating at a relative's house, your order may get screwed up when it gets busy. For example, I ordered the two taco combination plate but only received one taco. A problem easily rectified, but a problem nonetheless. But I don't see no beef tongue tacos available at The Azteca. And a whole fried fish.  Or pozole. Or menudo. Yes, menudo is the Sunday especial and this menudo will still have you even if you're older than 16. However, you will still need to be 21 to order their margaritas.  They're not the best margaritas in the world, but they're not the worst.  Finally, you can order a shrimp cocktail here that's (and this is a very important unit of measurement to me) as big as your head.. . Don't discount the power of food as big as your head.
