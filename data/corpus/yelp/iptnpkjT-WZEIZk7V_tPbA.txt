Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
its a cute local joint. parking sucks and theres a bit of a wait depending when you go and since the place is kind of small. . . We split the umami, pork and lamb burger. I'd have to say the umami was the best tasting one and pork 2nd. But overall i thought it was just okay altho my other friends really liked it. . . we did get a nice surprise and saw rose mcgowan or someone that looked like her lol
