Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
A true test of South Texas, Taco Cabana is open 24 hours and offers some of the best fast Mexican food one can imagine. I recommend the Beef Fajita, a Bean &amp; Cheese Taco, and a Bacon &amp; Egg for breakfast. Throw in a Diet Coke &amp; you're good to go. Thank goodness for Taco Cabana in Atlanta, the only one I know of outside Texas.
