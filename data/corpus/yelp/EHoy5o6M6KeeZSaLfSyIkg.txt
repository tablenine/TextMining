3.5 stars.  . . I really like this place.  The banana pudding is fantastic, as are the sides of black eyed peas, collards, mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, pickled beats--if they have a gumbo or jambalaya special consider it your lucky day and go for it!  BYOB and make an evening of it, or grab something down home and tasty in a hurry.  The chicken/rooster/egg decor is out of this world.
