Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
This place ain't so tender with my greens (my money, that is). I spent eleven plus dollars on a grilled vegetable salad (it would have been a whopping fifteen dollars with meat) and I was just not impressed. . . I really don't mind spending extra money on Â organic ingredients but can it at least taste good? My grilled veggie salad was a little flavorless and very boring. Even though I'm a fan of vegetables I found the taste to be overwhelming where all I tasted was the sickening sweet taste of squash. Yuck! I like squash but this was ridiculous. After eating a few chunks of this stuff I was done. . . While I don't drown my salad in dressing I feel that they could have given me a bigger container of the vinaigrette. The salad is pretty big and the amount of dressing they give you barley covers it. I believe it would have been more appropriate for a side salad. . . The workers here are very friendly and cheery so that's a plus. Of course, the lady working the line where customers place their order totally overlooked the fact that I had ordered chicken. Not so great listening skills. That's ok though because I really don't think an extra five bucks for meat would have been worth it. I doubt it could have saved this lame salad.. . In the end just go to Skratch instead. This will be my next review because today I just had the best salad ever from there.
