after re-opening, i came back and absolutely glad that they did. i love their food and prices are well worth it (they're not pricey to start with anyway). my fave would be their pork chop fried rice (i love how they added the vegetables and the corn, i love the combination so much!) and their fried chicken...as well as their sausages.... . they are said to be famous for their shaved ice, but i've tried better...
