Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib

Yeah, i know we've all been here for many special occasions, but i thought i'd write a little something today because i learned something there.. . for all you dog lovers - ask if they have any ribs for your pet, and they will pack up a few meaty pieces for you.. . it all came about because the meat carver guy just messed up so many  of our plates.  i noticed my friend "bowl cut" (their biggest cut)  was the same size as the standard lawry's cut and commented on it...  and then i asked if we can keep it to give it to my dog instead of them throwing it away.. . they offered us the bones instead :D
