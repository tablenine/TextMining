Ate here today, Ive heard so much about it an my family who actually lives near San Diego had eaten there before so they made the suggestion. Sunday afternoon, way crowded! But I didnt mind, it builds up more excitement and tells you one thing right there: its good stuff. The line went by super fast and the service was great. I got the pork sandwhich with garlic and onions. Oh my heaven! The best sandwich I have ever had. It was perfection. I tried the others and they were tasty too, but I must say mine was the best by a mile! I do want to try so much more. I will be back very soon. AKA tomorrow? And its not pricey at all!!!
