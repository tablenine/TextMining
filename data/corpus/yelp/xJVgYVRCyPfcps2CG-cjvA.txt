3.5 Awesome queso... . I have eaten here a few times, the queso is suprisingly delicious (has chorizo in it) pretty disgusting but really tasty!  I had the talapia tacos once and they were NOT good. Wouldn't get those again, eek.  . . Tasty tater tots(are these hard to mess up though? not really.) . . definitely true about men eyeing women the whole time. . . definitely go back for the queso.  mmmmm yummy. what else have I had there? hmph will update when memory comes back..
