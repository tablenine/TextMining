Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
It sometimes seems that keeping things simple can be a very hard thing to do for some. At this taco shop, just two choices, fish or shrimp are offered, and it's plenty. The salsa bar provides endless opportunities for spicing things up/cooling things down. I'm also a fan of their jamaica. The price is right, and the byob option is nice, especially with cap'n cork right up the street.
