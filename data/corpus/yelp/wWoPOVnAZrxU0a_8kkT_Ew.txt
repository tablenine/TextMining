Overrated and hard to get into.  As a gay man, it is funny to see just how many women can not dress AND to hear them complain about how there is no men in the club!  All Hollywood clubs suffer from too many women and not enough men, but I suppose that is how it goes.  right?  Drinks are a little pricey at this spot.  The venue is very nice.  I love the whole house vibe.  Music is pretty good too!  Downfall is the ONE bathroom inside that has a a line with a 10 minute wait!  Overall a so, so spot.
