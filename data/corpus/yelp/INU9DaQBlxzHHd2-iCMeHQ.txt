Category: Steakhouses
Great steaks on par with the other great Chicago steak houses. . . What made the difference for me were the appetizers, desserts and our waiter. That combination made for a fun evening with great food and wine. . . Our party of 4 spent over $600 ($90 for wine and included 3 appetizers and 3 desserts). That's the only reason it is not 5 stars in my review.
