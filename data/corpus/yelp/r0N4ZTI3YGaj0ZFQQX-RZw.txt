this place is hyped up a lot. since i spent a couple years in miami, i wasn't super impressed. their papa rellena (aka potato balls -- nobody says that in MIA) are good, with a perfect crisped outside and soft mashed inside, but i've had better meat flavoring. ran out of cuban sandwiches/medianoches :(. had the empanada de pollo and pastel de chorizo which were all right. Â while the crusts were very flaky, only problem was too much crust to meat ratio.. anyways, quite a successful business and the other pastries looked yummy
