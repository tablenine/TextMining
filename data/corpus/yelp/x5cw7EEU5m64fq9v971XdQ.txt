Man, I've got to be missing something...because everyone loves this place.  Or, maybe they just love grease.  My oh my; from traditional dishes to sandwiches (how does one get grease into a sandwich?  Just ask them!) it surrounds all meals.  Items overcooked, over-fried, you name it.. . Yet there were all the tables, surrounding me, shoving it all in.  In front of me, mushy grease.  Same as last time.  . . People have mentioned the waiters...and I've had the same problem...after they take your order, you're lucky to ever see them again.  Only time we did is when he brought the credit card back (yet he didn't take it).  . . Sometimes, reputation keeps a restaurant in business...and if these other reviews are any indication, they'll keep packing 'em in while nothing else changes.
