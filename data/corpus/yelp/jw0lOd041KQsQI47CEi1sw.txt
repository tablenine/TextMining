Category: Seafood
I ordered the whole sha bang mild . (even mild has enough spice!) . Crawfish doesn't have much meat in it. . Try the crab and king crab legs. . I always get it with potato, corn and a pound of shrimp for two.. Their fried shrimp &amp; sweet potato are also excellent! . . If you don't want to wait, go around 8:30. Â You will get in within 15 min.
