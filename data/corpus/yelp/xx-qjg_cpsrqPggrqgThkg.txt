I love shaved ice!  and this place is the place to go!  This is the real deal original shaved ice with tons of condensed milk and toppings of my choice!  They make a simple syrup with brown sugar thats yummy.  I like to come here and have sausage and rice with corn,...it reminds me of spam and rice i used to make afterschool when i was a kid.  The service is good, and its always really busy here.  Its cheap, and perfect for a summer day.  I need to go back and try more things on the menu.
