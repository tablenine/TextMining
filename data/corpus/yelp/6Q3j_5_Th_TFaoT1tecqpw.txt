Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I can't remember too much about Father's Office, but from what I can remember, I wasn't too impressed. A couple of friends raved about their burgers...but all I can rave about is how sweet Augusta is for buying fries for everyone!! Thanks again Augusta! The burger was ok...it seemed too greasy...and not in the good way...it was a dry greasy...like it had been sitting out for a few hours and the coagulated grease was re-distributed around the burger like it was butter. Sounds nasty huh? It didn't taste that bad...it just reminded me of something like that. The fries were ok too. But damn...that Coke was the best coke I've ever had!! Not really but I thought I'd try to rave about something. So since I'm not supposed to give +1 stars for the people we came with...this Father's Office will have to settle for 3 stars. I might come back...might...
