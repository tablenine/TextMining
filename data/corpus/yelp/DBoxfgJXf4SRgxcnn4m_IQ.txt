Restaurant: La Crêperie

I have a special place in my heart for La Creperie as my dad worked there while he was a starving teacher like myself.  I've been going there for birthdays and special occasions my whole life.  It was always fun to take my homecoming and turnabout dates into the city for an escape from the suburbs.   . . Three words... chicken, cream, mushrooms.  Done!  I always want to try something new, but end up with the chicken cream.  My dad likes the spinach and swiss, my mom gets the seafood, and we all devour the great salad with that delicious anchovy based dressing.  . . We all miss Sarah but are glad to honor her memory with a big bite of the Banana crepe that still bears her namesake.  Yum!
