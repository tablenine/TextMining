add whatever you want ramen!!! mMm mMm mMm!!! =) !!!. . funny place to eat..... the employees there are VERY loud and welcoming. they speak REALLY loudly in japanese when you ask for the bill, walk in, and leave. quite interesting. haha..... . their lunches are more worth it... cause it comes with a side. hehe.... i like my ramen soft noodles, strong soup base, light oil hehe =) !!! adding teh egg in there is delicious too. the char siew is yummeRsss!!! very thinly sliced.. and soft. none of those hard meat -_- !! yaaay =) as for sides... i like the rice with meat on top... mMmm... it's usually a toss up between that and the spam (which are limited) they only have a number of spam sides they selll during lunch.. once they're out.. they're out!! but the rice side is delicious toO! ^_^ very yummy food!!! Â they have desert toO! =) . . along with delicious comes LONG LINE!!! if you come during prime time.... be prepared to wait...... my opinion? i dont' have too much patience...anything less than 20 minute wait.. worth it =) !!!!
