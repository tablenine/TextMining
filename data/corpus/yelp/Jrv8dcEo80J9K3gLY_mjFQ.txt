I came here for lunch while at work and while I was tempted to get breakfast since it all looked so good, Im not the type to order breakfast mid day. So I ordered the soup of the day, which was Cream of Broccoli and a classic burger. The burger was really good, better than I would have expected. The soup was excellent!! I can't wait to go back and try this spot for breakfast!!
