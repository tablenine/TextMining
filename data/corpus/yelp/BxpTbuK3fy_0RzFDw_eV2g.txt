This small stand is curiously located in the main lobby of Water Tower Place. It features Chinese-style steamed buns that can be good snacks for on-the-go shoppers. It's a cute little outlet, but there is absolutely no seating in this area. A sign points the way to seating once you ride the escalators up to the next level.
