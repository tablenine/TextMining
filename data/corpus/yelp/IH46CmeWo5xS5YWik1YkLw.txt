The holy grail of pastrami. Comparable to what I would imagine that first heroin high feels like. The feeling of pure ecstasy that you chase as you spiral down into a life of full-fledged addiction. It's the best I've had. Even better than Katz in NY.  Smoky, Tender, Joyous. Seriously Pastrami Nirvana. . . But WTH is this 'close at 4 pm' BS??? And closed ALL DAY on Sunday??                   It's cruel.. . Still, I can only dock one star for this because the pastrami is so freaking orgasmic. 5 stars for the pastrami. Get the #19. Words can't describe it. You just have to experience it. The matzo ball soup is great too.
