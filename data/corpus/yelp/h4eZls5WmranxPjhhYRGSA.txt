Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Little Tokyo in down town LA have sevreal ramen (Japanese style noodles), and Daikokuya is one of them.  Some people praise this place as really good, but I don't think it is not super good.  It is ok.  If you happen to be near by, then it might be a good choice to eat here. . . I didn't like the service at all, because my friend ordered a ramen, but they gave her Katsu-don (Pork cutlet with egg over rice).  However, it should be a good lunch spot if you work anywhere close and got bored with your ordinary lunch spot.
