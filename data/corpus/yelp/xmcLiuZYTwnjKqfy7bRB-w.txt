Craving authentic italian? Holy crap, delicious. . . Went here last night for the first time, and I will definitely be back to explore more of the options. I'll tell you what I know as of now. There were three of us so we split 2 appeteasers and 2 entrees - here goes:. . The bread was freakin fabulous! It came with a sort of garlic-basil butter that i couldnt stop eating, i would come here for just bread alone, no joke.. . Butternut Squash Soup with Goat Cheese Crouton - WHAT!? this was such a wonderful creation - i love halloween simply because of all the pumpkin/squash food creations - why dont these stay in season all the time???? anyway, the goat cheese idea could not have been more brilliant, the goat cheese melted perfectly into the soup creating a bit of a sweet/salty taste that simply flourished on my tongue.. . Calamari fritti- classic italian tease, i use this as a test to see if the italian place is Irina-worthy and these were made to perfection! not greasy, lightly crispy and fabulous spicy marinara.... . Mushroom Cream Dumplings (dont remember what they're called in italian lol) - essentially square gnocci in a creamy mushroom sauce, and they did NOT jip me on the mushrooms, we basically licked the plate clean.. . Linguine al pescatore/frutti del mare - fabulouso - spinach, tomatoes, scallops, shrimp, mussels, and plenty of it! We had a pescatarian in our group but this definitely pleased all our palates!. . Overall, great atmosphere, big place, comfy, fabulous service, I only have it one star less than a perfect because their dessert menu was pretty generic, but we didnt try it either, so who knows? Next time, I'll be experimenting with the wine and dessert menu in addition to the food, but as far as it goes for food alone, AWESOME. . . The end. :). Fettucini
