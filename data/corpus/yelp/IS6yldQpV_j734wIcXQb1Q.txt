Restaurant: Manny&#39;s Coffee Shop &amp; Deli
Category: Delis
Nothing else like it in Chicago, but Manny's is pricy.  A plate of beef stew is $13.95.  It's a lot of food, but damn near 14 bucks for stew at a cafeteria?  That's just plain expensive.. . Recently they awkwardly leased some floor space inside the dining room to a ticket broker.  A ticket broker!  I've uploaded a photo.  Very weird.
