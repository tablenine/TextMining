No douche bags with polo's at this yacht club.  Huzzah.  Definitely an odd place, and I think It's the kitsch that makes it good.  Normally I get all itchy and paranoid when there is this much useless shit tacked up around me (ala irwin st market), but it made me feel at home here at this fine dive bar.. . I mean really I would probably give this place 3 stars in terms of comparing to other establishments, but because of the originality and the fact that it seems like a nice dive bar to me, I'm kicking it up to 4.   . . Had a few beers here, and was adventurous enough to get a veggie burger to sop up the brews.  Actually the v-burger wasn't too bad!  Didn't gag!  Not even once :)  Nothing I would seek out of course, but I wouldn't be afraid to order it again.. . Wasn't too smoky in the non-smoking section, and the seating makes it possible to gather with a reasonably sized group of friends.  Eclectic mix of people are guaranteed in L5P - making for an interesting evening. . . Can't offer you much more than that, so check it out sometime.
