Restaurant: Kevin Rathbun Steak
Category: Steakhouses
Decided to give it another try...... If your idea is to go to dinner in a loud, over crowded, restaurant that serves hit or miss food then this is your place. . The mussels smelled fishy which is not a good thing, they did not taste good either. The over worked waiter did not ask why they were uneaten as he was too busy hoping the nearby large party of Japanese tourists would tip well to compensate for the 10% we would end up leaving him due to poor service. Ordered a NY strip which should be a good size piece o'meat but it's the size of a small filet. Mine was requested medium but was served as a charred piece of leather. I was so disappointed that I sent it back and did not give them another chance. They wanted to prepare something else for me but they already had 2 strikes so why tempt fate. . If I am dropping $100 per person then I may as well head intown to better established steakhouses...which I will.
