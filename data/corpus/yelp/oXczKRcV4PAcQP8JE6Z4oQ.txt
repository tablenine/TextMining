Should have read the other yelp reviews before venturing out here for a burger.  I second all the comments that say this place is overhyped and overpriced!   I paid $6.35 for a regular old hamburger with lettuce only.  Juicy? Hardly.  And $2.15 for fries that were twice fried and greasy.  The apple pie had a burnt crust, was really watery and not worth $7.50 with the a la mode.  For one slice!  Unfortunately, I sat at the counter by the drinks and let me say that the ice was being fetched in what looks like a stainless steel sink and if there were any cubes on the counter, it was pushed right back into the sink (and into your drinks, my friends).  Gross.  Please help me understand why this place is always so packed?
