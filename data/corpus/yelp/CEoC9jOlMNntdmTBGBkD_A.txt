Classic burger stand that I am sure you have seen on the food network a few times.  . . What do you order?  Burger, fries and a coke please.  ** That would be the hickory burger **. . I like the waiters behind the counter here.  They are always nice and will sometimes help you out by pouring your ketchup and drink for you.. . Long waits can be common, so wear some good shoes because there are no seats to do this waiting in.  Everyone stands in the back of the bar stools waiting in the order they arrived.  The smaller your group, the better chance you have of eating before the sun goes down.. . The burger is good and consistent every time I go.  I do not think it is as good as it is made out to be, but it is a solid burger you will enjoy.. . Check it out.  Next time it is on TV, you can say, "I ate there!". . Good job Apple Pan.. . I will visit again.
