Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
One of my OG favorite restaurants, Versailles stands as a great Cuban restaurant for the West LA area.  . . Can't go wrong with the garlic chicken; so much food it can feed you today AND tomorrow.  And how can you resist a platter that comes with friend plantains?  The Rabo Encendido(oxtail) dish is solid, but I'd still recommend the one at Havanna Mania.   The shakes are also pretty good.  . . Very roomy locale, friendly service, and room for big parties.  A good find in my book.  . . I used to live in the apartment complex immediately behind this place when I was a little tyke, but sadly, I didn't discover Versailles until my senior year in high school, 10 years later!  So make sure you always venture about your home and seek out those great places to eat!
