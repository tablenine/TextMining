Not my favorite Thai joint, but they definitely get the job done.  I have sampled many foods from this place and they're all very standard dishes and pretty good.  The restaurant is cute and small and the staff is very attentive.  One of my friends had his water refilled 7 times.  Try their plum bubble tea late!
