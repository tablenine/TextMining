Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
yummmmm grilled cheese truck.  certainly one of the best trucks out there.. . its ok priced, for what it is.  i wasnt a fan of their signature grilled cheese with the bbq pork and onions.  it just had too much stuff in it for my own tastes.. . however, i love making my own sammie with the cheeses they offer.  i wish they had some better bread, but in the end, it honestly is just something i could have made at home for 1/4 the price.  . . i wouldnt go around hunting for this thing, but if it happens to be where im at, im for sure going to grab a snack.
