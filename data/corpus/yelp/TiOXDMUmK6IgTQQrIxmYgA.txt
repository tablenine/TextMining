I've had two separate experiences here.  The first one was fantastic, the second one was not so much. This is based on the second one. and has no reflection on their amazing open mic nights. this is a dinner review.. . starting off, the atmosphere is fantastic!!! Its warm, cozy, inviting and everyone is friendly.  There's a fireplace!! yesssss! And there seems to be a million rooms. No ending.  On open mic nights its fantastic. It is a must go to.. . The most recent experience was when my boyfriend and I chose this place for his birthday dinner location because the menu looked interesting, it was out of our normal price range, and we see it all the time.. . We literally waited at our waiter at our table for 15 minutes and the food was really good, but not worth the price.  The dessert menu is sub par.  For dinner, this place is not a complete fail but not the best in my book.
