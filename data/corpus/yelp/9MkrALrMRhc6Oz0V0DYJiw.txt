I've lived two blocks away from Gilber'ts for six months. How did it take me this long to eat here? . . Overall, I wouldn't make a destination out of this place for the food.. Appetizers are disproportioned: heavy on the centerpiece of rice, light on the lamb meatballs. . Meat felt undercooked. . Stick with cold appetizers with lots of fresh pita and you won't go wrong.. . The open air bar and dining room, the fabulous service, the friendly locals - these are the reasons I would go back.. . *Karaoke on Sundays at 6:30pm brought out the most talented amateurs I've ever seen step up to the microphone.
