Category: Sushi Bars
My best friend and I came here for lunch and enjoyed every bit of it. The gross attention from the sushi bar staff, the ice cold beer in the warm afternoon, and the stinking fresh sushi (oxymoron, I know. Had to do it!). I absolutely love it here.. . Fact: Only the top quality sushi restaurant get first pick of fresh fish in the LA area, ie. Sasabune. Â Sushi Gen is one of them.. . 4.5
