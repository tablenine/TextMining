If you go, order a round of Juicy Dumpings! This place is a dream come true for any DimSum lovers. Steamed Dumplings all day? YES! It's so delicious and it's worth the long 20 to (sometimes) an hour wait! The soups have a great, light flavor. The wrapping is somewhat thick, but not an issue to me. The dumplings are served piping hot and I'm an addict for the shredded ginger. Their noodle soups are delicious and end your night with those Taro Dumplings! I've never seen a place with dessert dumplings. So worth it!
