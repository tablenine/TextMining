We ate here for dinner on a Thursday around 7pm.  There were only a few people there...the place was mostly empty.. . We ordered a couple of rolls.  Keep in mind you don't get any miso soup or edamame with your meal, you have to order it separately.  The miso is about $4 each.  The rolls averaged around $15 each.  The drinks $12 each and totally NOT worth it.  None of the drinks we ordered had any tastable level of alcohol in it and were very small for the price.. . The atmosphere was interesting, I must admit.  Very well decorated but very small and the bathrooms downstairs were disgusting.  Bring a flashlight because you'll be sitting literally in the dark except for the candle on your table.  We had an impossible time reading the menu and it was still light outside.. . We visited because I had heard a lot of Geisha House but sadly I will never come back.  The sushi, while tasty, wasn't enough to justify the negatives.
