Holy frickin' menu!. . There are over 500 items on this menu. I was completely overwhelmed! It was like a game of "match" because they have pictures of the item with a number then you have to index the item in the back to find the price.. . They have everything from Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Indian and Vietnamese on the menu. I could not figure out for the life of me what to get so I went for something familiar that will allow me to judge the caliber of food based on my baseline.. . I ordered a Vietnamese Sandwich (Dac Biet/ Combination) and a mini Pho ($8.95) and a sugar cane drink ($4.50). The sandwich was alright. It was lacking the mayonnaise and liverwurst spread. I could taste soy sauce and that is not something that is usually added. The sliced deli meats were too thick! I couldn't even chew one of Â them. . . Moving on- the pho. I was disappointed just from the look and smell. It did not come with the traditional sprouts/basil and lime wedges. It also did not smell like pho. The brisket was not thinly sliced and had way too much muscle/tendons in it. They also had slices of daikon radishes in the broth and that is not customary either. . . I tasted the broth. ACK! Then had some noodles and they were WAY undercooked. I was done with this place. . . The sugar cane drink is missing the critical citrus element. Usually oranges or kumquats are pressed with the sugar cane. . . I wasn't impressed. I'm not sure what is the main cuisine specialty so it was hard to judge their main dishes. I will come back again because I did see some very interesting dishes. Maybe next time I will ask the locals what to order.
