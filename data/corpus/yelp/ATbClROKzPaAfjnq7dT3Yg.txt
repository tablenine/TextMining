its a bit overrated, but good when youre in the mood for it, ive been here a few times. The wait is not worth it though. dont even think about going there during the weekends during dinner time because you will eat at 9pm. if anything i will order out, the restroom are pretty nasty as well, they mix water with their liquid soap (unsanitary). but i know alot of people like this place but its a bit to much for some cajun style seafood. o yea parking is terrible also..
