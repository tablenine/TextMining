Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
if you've never tried the original one in taipei, the dumplings at din tai fung are def above avg for california, even LA. the decor isn't anything too fancy, but yet clean and comfortable. i love their lil appetizer dish. the chicken soup is also pretty good.
