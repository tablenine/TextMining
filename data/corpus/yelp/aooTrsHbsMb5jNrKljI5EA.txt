Wow, this place has a lot of reviews!  Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free.. . Went here for the first time one evening last week.  The place is small, with some seats at the bar and some tables.  From other reviews, it looks like the wait can be pretty bad here, but it wasn't too bad for us at 7:30 on a Wednesday night.  They have a pretty good menu, offering more than just ramen.  In addition, they have various appetizers, fried rice, chow mein, sushi, teriyaki, etc.  Of course, being a ramen joint, I had the ramen.  I got the Daikoku ramen, kotteri style (a little thicker broth).  You can tell them how firm you want the noodles, so I got mine a little soft.  The ramen comes with a hard boiled egg, chashu pork, bamboo shoots, etc.  . . My opinion among the 289 others currently here, it was a tiny bit above average (hence the 4 stars, I'm feeling generous).  It was good, and I would definitely come back, but it wasn't anything mind blowing.  The pork was kind of thin and the broth was bland.  I put some red pepper in to spice things up a little, but even then it was just average.   It wasn't a ton of food either.  I was still hungry afterwards.  I think next time I'll try the combination where you get a salad and a bowl of rice with your choice of a meat and egg on top.  One of the people I came with got that and it was good.  The rice had a good flavor from the pork juice and the salad had a really good dressing on it.  Also, you can get the noodles cold, with the broth and all the ingredients separate. . . As I said, it was good and I would come back, but given the choice I'd rather make the drive down to the South Bay and go to Asa for some 5 star ramen. . . Oh, yeah, we did see Kevin Sorbo from Hercules in here (at least I think it was him).  No Xena though!
