Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Was downtown getting my HARR DID.  Bottega Louie is right around the corner from the salon and I decided when I woke up that morning that I was going to try the place.  See, I watched the place being built and even strolled through several times to peruse.  I just never ordered anything.  I think I was a little intimidated by the glamour.  It totally reminds me of a someplace in New York.. . So while sitting under the hair dryer I pulled up the menu and made a firm decision about what to order:  The Gamber with no shrimp.  At $12 there was very little risk in trying the pasta dish.  First, I loved the experience of browsing the deli case, pastry case and breads.  There is so much hustle and bustle in there and the staff is beyond friendly and helpful.  Second, I loved my dish.  It was so well done, so full of flavor.  In addition to the pasta I took home a ficelle bread which was very fresh.. . Overall a top notch visit!
