Restaurant: Pizzeria Uno
Category: Pizza
my friend and i had to come here for work. we decided to do the whole "chicago" experience. this was first on our list of places to eat. we arrived around 8 on a Wednesday night. The wait was around 35 minutes, but they let you order your pizza (it takes 45 min to make) while you wait. You can also order a drink at the bad and enjoy it on the patio while you wait. It was great. . I had "The Uno" and it was delish! the crust wasnt greasy and was actually flaky and quite delectable. We got the onion strings with jalapeno dipping sauce as an app and it was great! we couldn't get enough of these little treasures. Even when our pizza came we kept eating! I will definitely be returning here on my next trip out. Pizza was so good I even brought one home to my husband in California!!
