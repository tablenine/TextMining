Yummy!! I'll keep it short since there are sooo many other reviews.. . I love the cute outdoor patio.  Such a pleasant experience on a sunny day!! . . I usually get a salad and an iced tea. I think my favorite so far is the asian scallop salad.  And the tea is always freshly-brewed!  But their breakfast dishes are SOOO GOOD.  That's what you really should be getting. The smoked salmon scramble is OH SO DELICIOUS.  Just know that the portions are HUGE, so if you're not like super-famished, you can definitely share with a friend and still come out satisfied, or even full!. . It's become a regular place for me.  And so far i haven't been disappointed!  Parking kind of sucks.  But...it's worth it.
