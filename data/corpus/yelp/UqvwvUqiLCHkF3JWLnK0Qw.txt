in a sense, i'm spoiled when it comes to banh mi. living in dc allows me to have immediate access to several restaurants and cafes dutifully creating this traditional vietnamese sandwich. to be honest, it was a combination of curiosity and greed that "forced" me to order a sandwich here. the classic (pork, terrine, pate) had all the makings of my expectations and it was perfectly fine, but for $5 and the accolades that preceded my visit, it wasn't worth it's weight. the pandan soft serve i ordered on the side was a different story. despite it's alarmingly green color, it was refreshing, creamy, and delicious.
