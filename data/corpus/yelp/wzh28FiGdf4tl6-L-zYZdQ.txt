I try to shy away from hyperbole, so don't confuse this statement as anything of the sort:. . This place is incredible.  When coupled with a Dodger's game there are few better afternoons/evenings one can spend in Los Angeles.  The sandwiches are great, especially with their spicy house mustard.  The food is cheap, the atmosphere is authentic and welcoming and there's so much history (which is, admittedly, hard to come by in Los Angeles).  There's also a railroad "museum" in the back room, which I'm still confused by to this day.. . ---. To get there, take anything (bus or rail) to Union Station.
