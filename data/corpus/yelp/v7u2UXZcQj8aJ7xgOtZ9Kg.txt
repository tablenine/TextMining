I'm a fan of their brunch so we gave their monthly supper club a try.  Sounded cute but just a bit pricey for what you get (after all, it's not fine dining).  The starter cocktail (gin-lemon-basil) was too strong to enjoy and actually ruined the rest of the meal for him.  The server placed the amuse in front of him (not in the middle of the table) and walked away.  -2 points already.  But the meal was tasty and worldly: focaccia, asparagus terrine, baby lettuce with grilled artichokes, lamb tagine, and banana egg rolls.  BYO + $5 corkage fee, but I'd rather them suggest/offer wine pairings.. . Confusing concept - the title suggests something more social &amp; underground but it really is just dinner.  I'll probably stick with their brunch.
