Restaurant: Front Page News
Category: Cajun/Creole
Front Page News has an awesome outdoor patio that is ideal for nice weather.  Although I've only ever had the chicken Philly, apple pecan chicken salad sandwich and the cheese burger, Front Page News is a New Orleans inspired restaurant with All American appetizers, salads, sandwiches, entrees and a large bar area.  Basically there is something for everyone.   Brunch, lunch and dinner is available and there is live music and special events every weekend. Visit . http://www.fpnnews.com.  for locations etc.
