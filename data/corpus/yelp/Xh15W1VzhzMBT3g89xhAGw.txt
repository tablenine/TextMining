Bravo!!! Bravo!!! . I went to Over Easy for the first time today, and it was a religious experience- AMAZING!! I read the Yelp reviews before I went, and YES, the Sassy Eggs are the thing that you should get. They live up to their reputation. I drove over 30 minutes to get there (with traffic) and it was worth it. When I put those eggs in my mouth, I closed my eyes and savored the flavor. Cheese, Guac, Potatoes, Chorizo??? What? You can't go wrong. I will DEFINITELY be back. I also had the blueberry crisp/crunch pancakes. They were perfect. They had a special butter that went on top, and granola inside, so it had a little bit of a crunch to it. Parking was super-easy - I got a spot right in front. Prices were a little higher than other breakfast places ($10 for the Sassy Eggs and $10 for the Pancakes), but they deserve every penny. The wait wasn't too bad when I arrived around 12:15ish on a Saturday- maybe 20 min (I think we lucked out b/c some folks left). . . Summary: Over Easy has been added to my shortlist for brunch places. Just go.
