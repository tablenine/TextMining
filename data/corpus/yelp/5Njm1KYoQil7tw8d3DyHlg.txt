Sigh.  I hate having to dock a star for rude service, but I have to!  Let me start out by saying what almost every other reviewer says: the food here is fantastic.  The guacamole is chunky and fresh, and the tacos are creative and flavorful.. . Now onto my kvetching.  I came last Saturday night w/ a friend, and we arrived very early (6:30pm) bc we couldn't get a reservation but were advised that walk-ins are accepted.  The place was practically empty.  Our waitress couldn't take our order fast enough, and when we finally ordered, our food flew out.  Normally, this is a good thing.  But we hadn't even had our guac for 5 minutes when our tacos arrived.  Overall we spent an hour and a half nibbling on food, chatting, and liberally enjoying margs (we ordered 3 each).  I think our waitress tried to take our plates away about a half dozen times.  I would have understood if there were people standing all over waiting to be seated, or if we hadn't continued to rack up our bill (or if our food was actually gone), but that was not the case.  So sorry, De Cero, but I have to deduct a star bc you blatantly were trying to kick me out!
