I have one stat for Stats: 0. Quite possibly my worst dining experience in the past year. Here's why:. . 1. No parking lot. No valet service. $10 to park in an overly-crowded lot across and down the street. We decided against parking on the train tracks behind the restaurant. Call us crazy.. 2. We ordered a few appetizers to start, but continued ordering more because we weren't happy with the prior round.. 3. I finally decided to order an entree since I was still hungry (see point #2). I ordered the Blackened Fish Tacos served with pico de gallo and salsa verde -- sounds like the healthiest of options, yes? They were served in fried taco shells and the fish was fried, too! Upon being questioned, the manager enlightened us: well, the fish is blackened, and then fried. Puh-lease! Just print the f-word on the menu and you won't deceive any more patrons.. 4. Only a handful of tables tout the much-desired tableside beer taps, despite all the hype.. 5. I don't care that this place is owned by 790 The Zone. In fact, I expected better simply because it is owned by 790 The Zone. . 6. My water glass was never refilled. Not once. . 7. The warm cookies served with ice cream for dessert tasted like re-heated, stale cookies. They left much to be desired.. 8. We had to buss our own table. Literally, we walked dishes to the kitchen because our server clearly wasn't planning on it.. 9. Don't pretend like you're the coolest spot in town by insisting a line form outside when it's not even crowded inside. What a joke. . 10. The rancid icing on the burnt cake? A guy relieving himself on the side of the building as we were (happily) leaving.. . I ate sweet potato fries for dinner. At least they were good (hence the one star).. . Needless to say, I won't be back.
