Not hating on Kogi at all.  It's true, Christa M., that there are a lot of haters out there.  It was good but I think I might take a different approach to it next time.  I will wait until towards the end to go so that I'm not in line for 2 hours.  Plus, I will order items without the garnish.  I love kimchee but by the 3rd item (i think it was the chicken taco) I was sick of it already.  The kalbi beef is very tasty so I want to taste it without the garnish and see how good it really is.  I love hot dogs so the Kogi Dog was perfecto!. . So yeah, different technique next time because I was soo hungry by the time I got to the front.  Thank goodness for having 2 trucks at the Rowland Heights location.  If it wasn't for that, I think we would've been there longer.  . . Yay for the Kogi people and keeping us in the loop on twitter.  It is a pleasure to buy food from you guys :)
