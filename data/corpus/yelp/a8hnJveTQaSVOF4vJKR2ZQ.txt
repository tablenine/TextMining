This cute corner store is near Insomnia coffee shop on Beverly. It has a little seating inside this bustling store, and some sidewalk tables.. . The specialities are the sorbets and ice-creams. They have cakes (lemon...ummm) and coffees and teas too. Oh, and salads and 'proper' food. But it's the ice-cream that brings the good-looking families here and trendy shoppers here.. . I got myself a vanilla and orange shake and some cake to take home. The service is still getting over some hiccups, but it's a very pleasant place to be if you can avoid the busy weekends. Thanks to Elizabeth for prising me away from my PC and satisfying my sweet tooth! ;-)
