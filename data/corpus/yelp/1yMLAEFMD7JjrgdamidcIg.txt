Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I have eaten here about 10 times over the past several years.  I love the juicy dumplings, and they are reason enough to eat here.  One time my wife and I went at opening on a Saturday in order to get the more rare soup dumplings, but I found them less interesting than the juicy dumplings.  Juicy pork is probably the best, but juicy pork &amp; crab is also good. The other dumplings are also quite fine - chicken dumplings, vegetable dumplings.. . To my pleasant surprise, we found that most other items on the menu are excellent as well: fried rice, shanghi rice cake (special noodle), the vegetable side dishes - all excellent.. . The crowd can be enormous, so I suggest going for early dinner on off nights - for example 6 PM on Wednesday.  I have been there with no wait when I went at slightly off times.  Otherwise, you will wait 1 hour plus.
