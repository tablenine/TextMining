Anyone Vegan or trying to be a little more conscious of the planet, this spot is awesome.. The name likely detracts many LA 405 fast food eaters ..very surprised how great the chop chop salad was and how close the chicken and steak seitan tasted like the real deal..They need a drive thru next to Jack In the Box off the LA freeways and I think the world would be a better place :)
