YUM.. when our enormous spread arrived, i was sure that we'd be taking home leftovers...buuuut our table of 4 devoured everything and left extremely fat and happy.. seafood pancake? delicious and sizzling hot, by far the best one i've had in atlanta.. dol sot was awesome and huge, with plenty of crispy rice bottom!. we also BBQ'd some shortrib and chicken, both tasty.. banchan were plentiful; standouts were the seasoned cabbage and shredded lettuce, and a nutty brown sauce. . we also had spicy tofu soup and a beef soup with noodles--beef soup wins.. i'd say this is definitely a place to bring a few friends--prices are steep but shared amongst the 4 of us, it didn't break the bank.
