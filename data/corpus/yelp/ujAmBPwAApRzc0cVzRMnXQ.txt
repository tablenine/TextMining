Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Ok.  So, this place has been hyped up to me by more than one person.  And that's probably the problem.  I expected a lot more.  We walked in to a restaurant that smelled like a combination of grease and broccoli, neither of which I'm a big fan of.  I had the chicken salad sandwich and potato salad, neither of which were all that great.  We also got an order of fries for the table and they were extremely soggy and stale.  . . I know, I know...that's what I get for not having chicken &amp; waffles, so I'm more than willing to give it another go and get what they're famous for.  If I have a better second experience I'll re-evaluate my rating.
