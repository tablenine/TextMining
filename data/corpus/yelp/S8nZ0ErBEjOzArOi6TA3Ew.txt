Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
My lowish rating really isn't aimed at the facility itself, it was clean, and had a pretty decent interior geared towards people who like checkered tablecloths. I come from Los Angeles, where the idea of a deep dish pizza is virtually unheard of. I was excited to approach this foreign behemoth with an open jaw and open mind. The pizza itself is really thick..layer after layer of cheese, way too many ingredients sandwiched in there, and yet you never taste them! The price and wait time (40 minutes) is pretty inconvenient and kind of ridiculous. At the the end of the day, this place is well-situated near Millennium Park and is a fixture for any Chicago visit.
