Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Went here tonight with the family.  Had to wait about 25 minutes to get seated, but that seems to be the norm when going to eat ramen these days. I got my ramen with spicy miso and was very pleased with the spicyness and overall flavor of my ramen.  I also shared some Okinawan beer with by brother and that was very good.    I'm glad I found really good noodle place by my house!
