Restaurant: Barney&#39;s Beanery
Category: Bars
good selection of beers, friendly but strict security [eric to be exact =)], chill bar staff, always open til late unlike most bars in old town, and a lot of stuff to keep you busy. . . the BAD STUFF = Â tends to be a TON of drunks, i mean wasted people and the food seems like they prep'd it in the microwave
