Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
For some reason, the hungry cat outpost in Santa Barbara works better for me than the one at Hollywood + Vine. Perhaps seafood just tastes better in Santa Barbara. Or my standards are higher in LA. Either way, it's still a great option for late dinner and drinks.. . The highlight reel includes everything from the raw bar, the mussels with chorizo, and the bacon-wrapped trout. When it's on the menu, I have to order the lobster roll - it may not be as generous, sweet, or buttery as the ones I grew up with on the Maine coast, but it's still pure summer nostalgia on a plate and makes me very happy.. . I've never tried the burger, but people seem to enjoy it. In the presence of such fresh seafood, it seems like a questionable choice. Like ordering sushi at the ballpark.. . The cocktail menu tips the scales to four stars. I can't say enough about the Greyhound. Â That and the cell phone policy, although it's often ignored.. . Come to think of it, that may be the most notable difference between the two locations; diners in Santa Barbara actually refrain from using their cell phones in the restaurant.
