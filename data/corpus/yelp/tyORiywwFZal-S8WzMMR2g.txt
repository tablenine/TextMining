Is there anybody left in this godforsaken town that isn't here with a laptop computer writing the 2nd draft of their screenplay?  . . How do  you afford to eat &amp; drink here all day?  I mean, it's excellent coffee, but c'mon.  You really think it's a good idea to be using that credit card of yours for $6 cups of coffee?   All that extra energy isn't doing anything but helping you crank out more pages of unintelligible drivel.   Sure, the environment is comfy and artistically conducive,  but don't you think you should go home and maybe wash your hair? Perhaps do a little laundry or something?  . . I seriously doubt Tom Strickler &amp; Ari Emanuel are going to look over your shoulder at the "riveting" pages of exposition you've been working on for the past  three hours.  I know you are just waiting for them to hand you a contract to option your hipster indie version of Die Hard on a spaceship just so you can afford last month's LA Mill coffee bill.  . . I'll be taking my $3 cup of exquisite Valrhona hot chocolate to go, back to the only place in L.A. that's guaranteed to be screenwriter free -  my apartment.
