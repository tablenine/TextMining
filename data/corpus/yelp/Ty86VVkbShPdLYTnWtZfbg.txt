Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine

I love Butterfly.  I think its the sushi in the city for the best value!  It's BYOB.  My order: Crunchy Spicy Tuna, Crunchy Shrimp, Godzilla, Crunchy Spicy Scallop -- awesome and cheap!  Keep in mind the tables are very close together -- noise level is usually OK, better than other crowded sushi joints.  I've been frequenting there for over a year... it's more and more becoming known how great it is and now it's tough to get a table without reservations for Friday and Saturdays.  The best time to go is early, when it's less crowded, service is much better and staff is more friendly.
