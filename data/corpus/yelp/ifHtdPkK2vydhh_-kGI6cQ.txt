I went to Sotto Sotto for a professional dinner and I wasn't disappointed. We had some good wine and the caesar salad came with real anchovies (if you want them)! Yum! So happy! Overall, the whole night was really enjoyable and a good place to wine and dine. . Caveat: I suspect that part of the reason I really liked this place is that, because it was a professional dinner, I didn't pay a dime.  If I had had to pay I bet the enjoyment factor would have been somewhat decreased.  So, if you're rolling in cash, or feel like splurging, give this place a shot.
