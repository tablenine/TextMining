Love it!  Great atmosphere, great service, great food and great drinks.  What more could you want?  I didn't take advantage of the $10 all you can eat tapas since I really wasn't super hungry.  I ordered the sangria ($5 special in a large glass...woo woo!) and my dinner companion ordered a beer which was served in a frosty mug which was perfect since it was pretty warm inside.  He had the grilled chicken and vegies which he said was amazing.  Upon the recommendation of our waitress I had the BBQ pork.  It was served between two plantain cakes and topped with onion strings.  Oh my gosh, the mix of flavors and textures was amazing.  The next time I go I am for sure getting the all you can eat and trying the "chef's selection!". . A cautionary note to those who don't like noisy crowds:  It gets packed and noisy!  I love the energetic atmosphere, but I understand that it's not for everyone.
