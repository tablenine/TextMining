Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Manuel, your burrito is so special to me. It's so big I don't think I can even wrap both of my hands around your massive girth. . . I thought two mouths would be enough to take you down but I was wrong. You are just too much to handle. Way too juicy and way too hot! They say you are big enough to feed two people, but you are massive enough for three mouths. It's just so muy grande!. . The way your juices dripped down my hands as I was taking you in my mouth... I was so relieved when the cream finally came. And such a mountain of a load you unleashed onto my table with a thud, commanding attention. You gave me a full scoop of your lovely sour cream! You looked just like a bowlful of vanilla ice cream on a hot summer day. . . We order this monstrous burrito suited for 2-3 people and they must weigh about 2 pounds each. I should know I couldn't breathe after eating here and my already loose dress was suddenly two sizes too small.. . I want to say the Manuel's special burrito base is a thick and rich meat stew. The beef was absolutely tender and slick with juices: a delicious stock made from beef, tomatoes, bell peppers and other veggies. Amazing! 5 Stars!. . The tortilla chips were stale. Boo! 1 Star.. . Side of sour cream was seriously a bowlful but the perfect accompaniment to the burrito!. . I like my burritos a little creamy. . . Manuel, you were just so good that lazy Sunday afternoon. I have to see you again.... . Burrito for two, one soda, a side of sour cream and a side of tortilla chips came out to $30.
