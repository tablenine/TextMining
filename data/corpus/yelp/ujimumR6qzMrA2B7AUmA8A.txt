Old 1990s expensive American restaurant and bar. Very mediocre to bad food. If you're a gourmand, don't bother. If you have taste buds don't enjoy abusing them, don't bother. Tried everyone's food at my table: veal supposedly medium rare (it was charred), chilean seabass was mediocre, and the fried lobster tail just looked gross. The sides were somehow overcooked and al dente at the same time (read: hard and tasteless) and I was served heat-lamped rice. Also i gets extremely packed sometimes AND on top of all of this its way too expensive to taste so bad.  . I say, who care's about atmosphere when the food sucks anyway and makes your wallet hungry?. We went here because we had some of those Buckhead dinner gift cards, but it actually cost more than we would have spent out due to gratuity (cannot be paid with gift cards) and valet. . . I hope I don't have to go back for any reason. If I do, I'll eat before.  . Service is good though.
