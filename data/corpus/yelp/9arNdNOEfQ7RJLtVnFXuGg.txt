After being pleasantly surprised at the Hollywood location, a few girlfriends and I met up at the 3rd St location Friday night. Dinner started out great. I got the jelly roll chili omelette. Sounds weird but was freakin good. That is... until I found an incredibly long blonde hair tucked inside my corn bread. So I brought this to the attention of the up to then super nice waitress and her response? "Um. So what do you want me to do? Did you want another one?" WTF?????? No. PLEASE lemme eat this contaminated piece of crap. Please? please?! So then I tell her the hair was blond. Her response "That's funny. All of us here have dark hair." . . Anyway.... I got the replacement meal and the end - she charged me for it. UGH. And the red velvet cake sucked. . . I'm definitely NOT coming back here ever again.. . Update: 03/07/08 - It has come to my attention that this restaurant has been SHUT DOWN. Dude.... do I feel vindicated or what?
