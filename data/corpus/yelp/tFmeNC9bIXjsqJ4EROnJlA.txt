Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
Overall 3.5 stars - 4 stars for the food, but 3 stars for price.. . Had the Sante Fe Crispy Chickin, sweet potato fries' and a bottled soda, which came out to about $15.  The Chickin was good as was the sweet potato fries.  I liked the ambiance of this place - to me, it feels like what jamba juice would be like if it were a restaurant (health conscious).. . It's on the pricier side for a diner-style restaurant.  i would probably go back, but once the nearby Counter opens up, I'd likely choose to go there over Veggie Grill.
