Had the pleasure of having lunch here today... and LOVE IT! If you're worried about parking, there is a lot directly behind it for $6. . . I must agree with you yelpers, the portabello fries are delish... what's on those? MSG or something? MmMmM. We also had the Louie salad, which they split into two dishes for us to share (we didn't even have to ask!) the meatballs- so AMAZING, the Brussel sprouts- DELISH!, the Clams Ortega (eh, these were so-so), and the red velvet cupcake (I hate frosting, but damn, that cream cheese frosting was SO good.) . . Best thing abou this place is the service. The Manager, Eric, was super friendly. +2. When the waiter came to the table he addressed me by name?! +5 . . I can't wait to eat here again. Please. someone. give me.
