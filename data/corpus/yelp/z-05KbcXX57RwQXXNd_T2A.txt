Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
I find this strip mall to be rather dull . (Not enough flashy lights?) Top Spice is however a gem among the rocks. The Thai &amp; Malaysian cuisine offers the usual dishes: pad thai, chicken fried rice, spicy seafood noodle, etc. They are well done and tasty. I wanted to try something different (different = healthy), so I had the spicy veggie entree. This bowl of surprises was filled with snow peas, broccoli, cabbage - an array of vegetables that are not typical taste bud pleasers. However, the spices and sauce made this a delicious dish. Four stars for the ability to make vegetables taste like a treat.
