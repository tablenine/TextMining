Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
One of the the few things that excused the prices of Jerry's fares was the unique beer selection they offer.  Then I experienced 'Giovanni' (or 'John,' depending on what night of the week you visit) the bartender as my liaison to Jerry's offerings not once, but TWO consecutive visits to the gourmet sandwich shop right across the street from my house.  Hey!  Bartender!  You SUCK!!!  I apologize my patronage is not as cool as the computer on the one end of your skimpy bar or the waitress who just got off of her shift (and yes, she really did!  You confirmed it with her twice by shouting across the floor before spending time chatting with her) on the other.. Two-stars is being generous because Jerry's does have a few incredibly nice and efficient wait-staff members.  But if you're looking for a good beer, SmallBar is right down the street (go West on Division.)  If you're looking for a good milkshake (but not at $7 for 12 to 16 oz,) Caffe Gelato is in the same direction on Division.  As far as Jerry's is concerned, I sincerely wish you luck.  With experiences like these, you're going to need a bigger claim-to-fame than some half-ass bartender, mediocre food, and high-prices to justify the 'gourmet' description to keep your vision up and running.. Please, please, please!  Prove me wrong.
