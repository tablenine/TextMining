Yum! I love Adobo! If you want the best guacamole you've ever tasted... look no further. The guac is made right in the middle of the restaurant and comes to your table in the huge bowl they mixed it in. The entree's are just as good and the margaritas are delicious and unique. Don't go to old town without trying Adobo.
