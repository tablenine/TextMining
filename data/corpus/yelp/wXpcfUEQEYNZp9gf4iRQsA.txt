Parking can suck.. . Food is good.. . Food is very expensive. Expect $150 out the door for two people with a full meal.. . Decor is top notch even for the area. If you've got the money, it is worth eating here to look at the restaurant. But you can do the same thing while having a couple of drinks at the bar and eating somewhere else.. . Yes, the wait staff does tend to "up sell" but don't expect to eat here at a reasonable price anyway. Â . . I would easily give this place 4 stars, but they do a poor job of making people feel comfortable. If you don't think twice about paying $300 for dinner at other places then you will not mind this. But the staff does pressure people to order more than they need. I've eaten at places and have had $600 plus bills for four people that make you feel comfortable and happy to pay for extra things. If you've experienced these other places and then come here you'll know the difference. Just not here.
