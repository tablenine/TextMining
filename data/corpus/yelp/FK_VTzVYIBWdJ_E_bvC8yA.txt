Burgers are damned good. Not that big-- a trifle smaller than I would like-- but damned good.. . Are they better than the usual places? I don't know. You get whatever's on the menu-- which is quite a decent selection, really-- and no other choices. Meat's well seasoned, and mmmmmm it's GOOD. But better than my very favorite spots? I'm not sure. One offers more customization, the other's just straight up awesome, etc.. . The hand cut fries are interesting. Good if you like thick fries, but only after you give 'em 5 minutes or so so the insides cool down from ZOMG BURNING HOT. The onion rings are DELICIOUS. Lightly battered-- among the only I've found in LA that are lightly battered-- and oh so tasty.. . Rootbeer float also looked good-- my friend devoured hers before I could even think about taking a sip. I was too busy eating my burger.. . The wait at 9pm on a Wednesday night was longer than expected, the valet was a necessity (no street parking) and pretty cheap at $2.50, and no alcohol was a surprise, but that's okay. This is definitely a tasty burger, although I'm not sure I would beat my way through a crowd to come back.
