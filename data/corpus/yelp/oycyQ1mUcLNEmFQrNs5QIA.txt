Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
This was the first sushi restaurant I ate at when I visited Los Angeles to look for a place to live back in 2003.  My old college friend brought me and my mom here for dinner and compared to any sushi restaurant back home (Texas), this place is amazing.. . This restaurant is what has been called a true sushi restaurant.. meaning there's no specialty rolls made with cream cheese, jalapenos, etc.  The fish here is fresh.  The salmon melted in my mouth.  Even my mom was impressed with the quality of the food.  The green tea looks like the genuine green tea from Japan.. . The wait during dinner time can be frustrating but its well worth it.  The place is definitely pricey so eating here once in a while is ok.
