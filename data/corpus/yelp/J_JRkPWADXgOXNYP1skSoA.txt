It has been a few months since my last visit to Spoon. A friend was kind enough to treat me to dinner and suggested we pay them a visit. We started with the Basil Roll and Chicken Satee appetizers. Both were good and I'd have them again. My entree was the Shrimp with Massaman sauce. OMG, if it wouldn't embarrass my friend I would have used the straw in my water glass to finish the sauce. Dessert consisted of Blueberry Spring Rolls and Coconut Ice Cream that was very good. Service was good though I think the server was fairly new. Regardless, the food is excellent and I will be back.
