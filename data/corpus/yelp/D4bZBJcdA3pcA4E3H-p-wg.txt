Restaurant: May Street Market
Category: American (New)
May Street is a class above the rest.  It's a hidden gem in the west town neighborhood, the hostess is absolutely refreshing, her greeting is subtle but sincere.  As I sat down at the bar waiting for my date, it perused the wine list and cocktails and decided on a lovely champagne cocktail.  What girl doesn't enjoy champagne... . As I sipped my cocktail, I was greeted by my guest with a warm smile and a tender hello.  What a way to start the night.  We were seated after catching up at the bar for a couple moments and presented with not only a pleasant but knowledgeable server.  He gave us recommendations on the wine and of course the menu.  . . I enjoyed the warm spinach salad with quail egg and followed with the duck confit... absolutely delightful... finished with a wonderful espresso... and wished we had a chance for dessert, but another time.. . . What I love most about May Street was the casual but elegant environment and the ease of the courses.  We were able to enjoy a bottle of wine while falling deep into conversation.  May Street is an intimate restaurant with warm undertones that should be shared with those you love.. . bon appetite..
