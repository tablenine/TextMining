I really like this place.  We went this time on Valentine's day after pulling an all nighter at The Do Lab's Lucent L'amore. A little hung and very hungry, we walked over from our hotel.. . We put our name in with the hostess, but decided instead to sit at the first come, first served tables in front of the bar.  As usual, the wait staff were genuinely friendly and attentive.  . . I still can't get over how small your check is when you're done eating.  We had the Seasonal Berries &amp; Yogurt, Eggs Benedict, a side of Bacon, two Latte's and four champagne drinks and the bill was under $100.. . My husband loved the Benedict.  The orange-honey yogurt they pour over the berries was exceptional and the applewood smoked bacon was cooked perfectly.  . . I recommend the Champagne Cobbler for breakfast. It's made with Prosecco, Luxardo maraschino liqueur, muddled lemon, orange and cherry.  All the fruit is fresh.  We watched them making each drink with care.  Your bottled water whether flat or with gas is complementary.. . I was further impressed that even though the place was packed for the dining room, the hostess still came and checked to see whether we wanted our table.
