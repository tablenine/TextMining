I Love garlic! This restaurant will only be a favorite for people who truly love garlic.. . I ordered the seafood combo. I believe it's shrimp, mussels and clams sauteed in a garlicky sauce and brought to you on a hot griddle. It was excellent and they give you a lot!! Two or three people could have shared it with me. The bread, appetizers(especially the fried calamari) were very good. The service was excellent, they catered to our every need!
