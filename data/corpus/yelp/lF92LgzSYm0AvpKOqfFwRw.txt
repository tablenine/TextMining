Restaurant: Cafe di Sol
Category: American (New)
First Impression: A sidewalk café that has all the sensory stimulation you would expect from a restaurant located in/near Little Five Points.It is immediately clear this place has a very cool vibe going for it.. . Service: Casual, comfortable, and everything correct. . Food: Certain you beat your expectation as it has mine each time.. . Conclusion: Been back about 4 times, you should at least give it a try ... especially if you like little funky little sidewalk cafés.
