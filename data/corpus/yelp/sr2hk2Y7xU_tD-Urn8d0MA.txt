Whilst in New York, my bff and I were hungry, so we set out to find some food within walking proximity.  We fond Bond St restaurant and decided to give it a go.  The ambiance of the place was nice and it's very upscale.  We were taken to our seats and had a few minutes to look over the menu.  I remember the service wasn't up to par, however, it may very well be, because we were both dressed like shit.  So, it's understandable.  The food however was muy delicioso!  Will love to come back the next time I journey to NYC, however with the vast amount of choices and such little time, it would be difficult.  I do highly recommend this place though!
