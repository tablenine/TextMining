Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
You can't visit Arcadia and not try Din Tai Fung. This place is has YUMMY GOODNESS written all over it. I've been going here for several years now and I'm excited they have expanded their place to another location, only seconds away. I go here to satisfy my Asian cravings! . All their foods are FRESH, DELICIOUS, and INSTANT. . . Of course you should try their dumplings to really get the full experience. They have chicken, beef, and vegetables. The dumplings here are made fresh. You can actually watch the men make them (they have a window looking inside the kitchen). There is broth inside the dumpling, so when you take a bite of your dumpling, it's just oozing in YUMMINESS! I also enjoy their red bean bun, their fried rice, and their green beans. They also have shumai, so that serves my dim sum fix! Â . . I go here at least once a month and I've enjoyed myself every single time! Service is good and fast. The food is delicious and the ambiance in their new location is pretty fancy.
