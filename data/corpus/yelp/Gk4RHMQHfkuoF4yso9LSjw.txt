Restaurant: Ben Pao
Category: Chinese
I almost snorted when the hostess asked if we had a reservation, the restaurant was mostly empty for our Sunday dinner. . . After being seated and glancing over the menu and the general decor of the place, I decided that BP attempts to be a pf changs type of restaurant. "upscale" americanized chinese grub. Dang it, I was hoping for a more authentic vibe. . . The servers have ridiculous outfits that I'm guessing they hate to wear, I think I would. But ours was nice and took pretty good care of us. Several of us ordered off the fireworks special menu which was 4 different combos of meals (starter, entree, dessert) which supposedly escalated in spiciness. Kung pao please.. . Shrimp dumplings, kung pao, and fried banana for dessert. Kung pao was listed as 3/4 spicy. . . The dumplings were good, slightly delicate, nothing special. If kung pao was supposed to be spicy, I missed it. I couldn't find the spice anywhere. My friend's 7 flavor chicken had a bit more kick and I actually liked it a bit better. I honestly thought 7 flavors would be muddled and confusing in the dish, but it ended up working well with each other. . All in all though, I think the food is similar to what you get at pei wei. It's not special or memorable, but it's good every once in a while. . . Random but I thought the bathroom sink basin at this place was really small. They had an automatic soap dispenser that I kept setting off as I washed my hands. Sigh, soap all over my forearm I was washing for quite a bit.
