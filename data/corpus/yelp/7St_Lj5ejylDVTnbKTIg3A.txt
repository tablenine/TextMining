OMG the Bloody Mary's!!. . Seriously, the best Bloody Mary I've ever had!  It was made with homemade mix, a lot of pepper, and GARNISH!  The garnish included some ham, salami, carrots, olives - I know, right?  Insanity!  Seriously delicious (and there's a veggie option for the vegetarians out there).  I love Bloody Mary's and this is seriously the best one ever.  . . AND they have a lot more going for them, as well.  We went on a Saturday night and I was surprised that there weren't very many people in there.  It is at a weird intersection (Grand and Ogden) with not much else around it, but I was still surprised.  Their website posts drink specials, which is why I suggested we meet here in the first place, and they actually have good weekend specials.  They had $3 Jameson cocktails, which is a steal on a Saturday night.  Their beer list was great and they had a full bar with an experienced bartender (she was making great cocktails all night).  . . Food was also excellent.  They had a full menu, but I was a little disappointed that the prices were pretty high for standard bar fare (hamburgers, fries, etc).  . . The bar itself had just recently been remodeled so everything was very clean and modern.  There's a bar in the front with a few window tables but mostly bar seating.  In the back there's tables and another bar.  There's also an upstairs, but I'm not sure what goes on up there.  There is an ATM, though.  All in all, seriously fierce liquor, service and Bloody Mary's.
