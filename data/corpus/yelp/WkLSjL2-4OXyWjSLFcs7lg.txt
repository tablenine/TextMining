Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Kopi gets bonus points for the following:. . *Having an Elvis Sandwich on the menu. *Having a grilled, not fried, Elvis Sandwich. *Having Reed's Ginger Brew. *Having a wide beverage selection at reasonable prices. *Ample street parking. . Kopi did not get bonus points in these areas:. . *The waitress tried to tell me that peanut butter isn't vegan because it contains peanut oil. After some conversation we did determine that the Elvis Sandwich wasn't buttered with actual butter and hence was indeed vegan.. *Tiny tables. *A million pieces of menu/information is confusing. I think they would benefit from having a regular menu page for the teas rather than have yet another loose item to look at (there were two loose items in a stand on the table, the menu, and a loose item presented with the menu, plus specials on a chalkboard that appeared on none of these items).. . Overall, I'm happy I tried this place. I had a nice lunch with a friend and yes, I love the Elvis Sandwich. One might say that the combination of smooth peanut butter, toasty bread, and just-right-ripe banana got me all shook up, oh yeah yeah.
