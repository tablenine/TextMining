My friend and I went during 1 PM on a weekday and were promptly seated.   Although this does appear to be a place known for breakfast, we both ordered the hamburger.. . 1. The waitress talked so quietly I had to have her repeat herself numerous times. It's a loud restaurant - speak up, honey!. . 2. I foolishly asked for my burger to be medium rare. I got raw. Aside from the edges, the burger was literally raw meat. I sent it back, and got a very tasty burger back.. . What I really liked was that the fruit is not just melon and grapes. You get strawberries, blackberries, bananas, etc. . . The burger (when cooked, hah) was extremely delicious.. . and their coffee is hella good. Aside from the overly quiet (and not very attentive waitress) and raw burger, I am actually giving this place four stars because the food really is that good.
