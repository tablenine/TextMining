I've been eating at Tito's since I was in the womb! :-D. . Seriously, we lived in Mar Vista until I was 4 and used to come down here often. After we moved, we'd always stop by here when in town. So despite not living here all my life, I've still been eating here all my life.. . The burritos are big and sloppy, but really yummy. They slow cook the beef for hours and hours until it's completely shredded and it soaks up the sauce. My personal favorite has always been the beef and cheese. The salsa is also pretty soupy (but I love it anyway!). Make sure you get plenty of napkins because you'll definitely need them!. . Also, Tito's only takes cash. They have an ATM to the side, but it might be easier to be prepared ahead of time. And since it is so popular, expect long lines at any time. Give yourself plenty of time to park as the lot is fairly small. And if you're there with someone else and planning to sit down and eat there, have your friend scout for tables while you wait in line (or vice versa). Finding a table might be the toughest part of all.. . Tito's may not float everyone's boat, but I've always been a big fan. It's greasy and inexpensive, but I think it's unfair to compare it to any fast food chain out there. Â Tito's has it's own unique flavor. It's got a cult following with a lot of repeat business for a great reason. Look at those lines and tell me: how can all of those people be wrong? ;)
