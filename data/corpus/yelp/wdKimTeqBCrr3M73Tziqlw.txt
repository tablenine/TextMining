This was definitely a winner and worth the drive from the Westside.. Met a friend for brunch and W. Hollywood is the 1/2 way point for each of us...we were not disappointed; walked out full, satisfied and didn't break the bank.. . Per previous reviews be prepared to wait for table, but it moved fairly quickly...about 20-25mins for party of two.
