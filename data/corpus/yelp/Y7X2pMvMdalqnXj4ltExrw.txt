This is a small place that has decent sushi. There were only a couple of fish that I noticed being really good, which are: yellowtail, blue fin tuna, and albacore.  We got the sashimi combo dinner which I think is a good deal.  Although it seemed like we just got little chunks of leftover spicy tuna or something.  But it had nice samples of other stuff, like octopus, squid, halibut, yellowtail, and crab.  So its a good little sampler platter, thats all.  Whatever you do, don't pay for getting cold sake in a box.  Bring your own little wooden box or something, but this is in no way worth paying double for.  Doesn't change the taste in my opinon at all.  Unless you want to imagine you're in a misty japanese tea garden or something i don't think its worth it.  I guess its for the experience and all, but you can experience that at home and pay much less.  So just get it in the regular sake cup if you're thinking about it.  . Other then that I recommend sushi gen for decent sushi on select fish at a little bit above the average price for dinner.  I think about half the fish is pretty good and fresh and half is just so so.  Also, decent atmosphere and good service.  I'd give it 3 1/2 stars really.
