Sweet jeebus.  It amazes me how you can masquerade yourself as a diner, when you are so much more than that!. . I came back like I said I would, and this time I feasted on your chicken pot pie. I would have given you five stars here - but the basil sauce kept attacking the white sweater that I was wearing, so no dice.  The funky pastry ring was stuffed full of yummy mashed potatoes, perfectly cooked veggies, and super moist chicken tenders.  All topped off with a creamy white sauce; it was nothing that I expected and yet - so freakin' good.
