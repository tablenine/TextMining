LOVE this place.. Parking is such a bitch but its worth it.. people who work here are really friendly and helpful - they give out great suggestions whenever you need it.. the menu is extensive - i don't bother which the food or coffees so I can't describe those but their desserts/cakes are great! . they used to have $5 sundaes but have since raised the price to like $6 or $7? I blame that on "the hills" exposure. their toffee ice cream bars are like $3 and really good. i tried another ice cream bar once and it was forgettable (it was the green color one?). also, try the shirley temple float ( i think its supposed to be on the kids menu) but its REALLY good.
