Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
My friends and I found them at First Fridays on Abbot Kinney Blvd. in Venice! There was a craaaazy long line of people waiting to try it. I think it was one of the longest lines out of all the trucks. . . We shared 3 different sandwiches:. . 1. The signature sandwich which had mac &amp; cheese, BBQ pulled pork, and caramelized onions. This was definitely the best one by far!! It sounds a little weird to put mac &amp; cheese in a sandwich, but trust me! It's sooo gooood! And it was perfectly toasted. We devoured it and wished there was more. . . 2. The Fajita sandwich. It was basically fajita ingredients in a grilled cheese sandwich. I'm not too big of a fajita fan so I just thought this one was okay. Not bad, not good, just alright. . . 3. Asian Pear &amp; Brie sandwich. I normally really like brie so I was a little disappointed when I took my first bite and discovered I didn't like this one at all. The flavors were a little too funky together for my taste. This was the only sandwich we didn't finish.. . Now that I know what's good, next time, I'm only going to get their mac &amp; cheese sandwich for sure! yum yum yum!
