Restaurant: Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s Red Hot Stand
Category: Fast Food
Gene &amp; Judes saved my life.   Lets just say that a LONG day of touring Frank Lloyd Wright buildings had left us starving, desperate, and at least 40 minutes of traffic outside of chicago, so we were THRILLED to find we were so close to the beloved Gene &amp; Judes.  I dont think I would travel out from Chicago just for one of them, but if you're in the area, they're great, especially loaded with fries.  If I lived nearby, Im sure i'd be a regular here. Nothing fancy, just a beautiful old school drive in building,  hot dogs that are tasty, with good crunch outside, great bun, and good fries.
