Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Jerry's on Division:. . hundreds of sandwiches to choose from.. . I've dined in/ordered out 6 times total.. . Inconceivably (but true) ordered the SAME sandwich the 1st FOUR times:  the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich. . . 5th time - Grilled Albacore Tuna w wasabi mayo (absolutely incredible) 5/5.. . 6th time - Grilled Bacon n Cheddar Cheese Burger on a Brioche (it's safe to say this burger was in the top five of all time burgers i've ever eaten and that's saying something) 5/5 and then some !!. . in a word: Incredible.. . A few more: this place is oppressively addicting.. . a final (pro) note:  pretty massive beer selection w. about 10 quite unique and varied draft choices.. . cons:. - for $10 the Southern Fried Chicken sandwich is relatively small. - Service can be hit or miss.  . - Fries have been soggy and semi-warm a few times.
