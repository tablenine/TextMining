Restaurant: Marlow&#39;s Tavern
Category: Pubs
I honestly cannot belive that I haven't reviewed Marlow's Tavern before now. I love this place. Every time I am trying to think of a quick, tasty and reasonably priced meal, Marlow's is always my first choice. Oh and did I mention that they have a FREE parking deck? Yes, free parking right in the heart of Midtown. Shocking, I know. . . The food is always good, the atmosphere is great and it really is the ideal place to go watch a game or catch up with friends. I would say all in all a pretty solid place.
