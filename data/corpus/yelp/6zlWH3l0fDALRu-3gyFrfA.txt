I requested a table upstairs since my friend said that's where the fun was...uhm, yeah...that's definitely where all the hip people were but be forewarned that it was LOUD!  . . Service was great even though our waiter dropped one of our plates at the end of the meal and it shattered glass everywhere.  They replaced our side dishes with brand new ones even though we had finished our meal already.  Now THAT's service!. . We started off with the Seafood Tower (you get to select what you want on it so the price varies so anyone who's price conscious, be careful because it can easily go over $100 for just that one tower) which tasted wonderfully fresh.  Then we moved onto some medium rare rib-eyes with sides of mac &amp; cheese (yeah, I'm like who the heck serves mac &amp; cheese at an upscale restaurant - but boy, it was GOOD...so cheesy - ok, I gotta stop because now I want to go back!), mashed potato &amp; asparagus.  We ended with strawberries &amp; whipped cream (which is so light &amp; fluffy - we had them bring another plate of just the cream).. . Definitely a fun place to go to just to even hang out at the bar upstairs, but if you're looking for a romantic dinner, make the reservation for downstairs (which we should've done for the b'day dinner because it was hard to hear each other over the piano man &amp; the hub bub of everyone else around us).
