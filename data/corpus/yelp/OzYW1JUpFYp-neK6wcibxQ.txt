I was so excited to try this place....seen it on the travel chanel for one of the best french dipped sandwhich places and ugh...boy oh boy travel chanel how you have let me down. I got the beef dip...nothing special...at all....a few friends got the pork dip, one got the beef double dip...we all thought this place was just ok....didnt enjoy it enough to come back. This place is part of LAs ongoing history, which is cool I guess but....was really let down...blah.
