I am still excited about my visit to this wonderful place. It is a toss up between here and Whole foods. As the place to go to when I die. The parking here is usually horrendous, but I am sure you will not have to park far away. Besides after over indulging on some lunch and pastries I am sure a little walk would be a perfect way to end your meal.. . My cousin Michael and I were en route around 9:30 am this past Saturday. I was on a mission to enjoy some pastry. I do not care much for donuts, but a pastry and I start to drool like Homer Simpson. I would sell my soul for a pastry from Portos. Okay so I dart out of the car finding some ridiculous front row parking spot. I already knew this was going to be an excellent experience. . . We stood in line, which went by unbelievably fast and ordered our lunch and some pastries. My cousin ordered half a dozen of their magnificent potato balls. I ordered a variety of pastries. I have to say that their cheese and guava, pear and cheese pastries are excellent. I Â ordered some other pastries and those were just as good also. . . I ordered a Pan con Lechon for lunch. I wish the bread was toasted like my cousin's Medianoche sandwich. However it was still very tasty. The pork was delicious and a little salty (not too much). A little hint if you order this sandwich, eat the cheese and guava pastry after and you will have an amazing fireworks display in your mouth. They compliment each other very nicely. Oh and if I may add this is some of the best coffee served here.
