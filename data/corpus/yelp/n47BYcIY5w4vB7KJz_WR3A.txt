I'm from Irvine but I don't mind driving down to glen-freakin'-dale. just for a bite of their yummy cheese rolls (again, melt-in-your-mouth. experience), tip: eat it straight from the oven.. They have a bunch of great tasting sandwiches and cool drinks,. from blended coffee to tasty shakes. Anyone who loves pork. like their grandmother will really enjoy their cubano sandwich,. it's slow cooked (as if I know) pulled pork greatness tucked in a lovely. Cuban bun, or whatever, hehehe, so awesome! Their potato balls have. loads of meaty goodness inside, I put a bit of tabasco sauce in every bite. and it made it much more appetizing.. They have great choices of pastries but my real fave is their plain. old cheese rolls, grab it while it's hot!. .    :)--- awesome cheese roll, cubano sandwich, very clean shop,.           a hit line-up of pastries and stuff..    :(--- metered parking at the back, long lines, closes early.
