I am from Seattle originally, so when it comes to fresh fish and sushi I can honestly say "I am an expert" That, and I am a chef and have been for over 20 years. That said I think that KatsuYa has some of the best sushi in LA. Very creative dishes and a line out the door. A couple of staples that you need in order to be a successful establishment, but.... the number one thing that you MUST bring strong is SERVICE! . If I have an 8:00 reservation for two, I can understand waiting for your table 10 maybe 20 minutes but 45 minutes is unacceptable. And when we finally did get sat, our waitress didn't arrive for about another 10 minutes. Being busy I understand, but stop by your tables and say "Hi" or "I'll be right with you" anything except the sound of other people enjoying their meal when you haven't even been asked what you want to drink yet. . Besides that, the sushi was divine! . Work out the kinks in service and you have every piece you need.
