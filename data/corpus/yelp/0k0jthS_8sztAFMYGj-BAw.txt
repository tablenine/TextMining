I liked the tapas, I liked the wine list, I liked the layout and ambiance, so you may be asking yourself why three stars?  It is the people that frequent the bar I have gone twice I dress well have a thing for nice shoes and nice things, my girl is along those samelines.  I dont like trendy 1st year outta college 325i driving UGA fraternal order sorta people.  It is pronounced mer-low not mer-lott
