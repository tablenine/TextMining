Restaurant: Ru San&#39;s
Category: Sushi Bars
Today was my first RuSan's visit  and I am somewhat indifferent about it. The all u can eat sushi seemed like a good idea at first.  I liked the fried shrimp roll BUT only got to get two slices before the entire plate was gone and replaced by something else that didn't look appetizing at all. The price was right and the service was pretty good.  I didn't try too much of the buffet because after I ate something that looked like eel, I was a little ill (no pun intended).  I will go back again because the price was right and there must have been something on that buffet that I missed. I'll just stay away from the eel next time.
