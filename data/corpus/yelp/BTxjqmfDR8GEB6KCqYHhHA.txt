Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
A friend and I shared the ooey-gooey hot fudge sundae only we substituted the coconut ice cream for banana dulce de leche ice cream.  The cookies were fresh from the oven and steaming hot.  The ice cream was pretty good (I still prefer Bi-rite).  . . All in all, considering how busy Milk was on a Thursday night, I'm surprised that most of LA is so thin.
