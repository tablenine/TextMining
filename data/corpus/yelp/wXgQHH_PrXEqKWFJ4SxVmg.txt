4.5 stars!. . have been here many times. i could eat here all the time!. . the good stuff: I think what they do best is take the classic and make it different in a better way.  flavors are so solid, complex and being noodles, soulful.  . - Always love the kimchi rice noodles.  Hot, flavorful, porkbelly -- can't go wrong and the saucer like rice cakes are fun to eat.  Not huge fan of the hominy, but that's just personal.. - Ramen:  I can't really agree with the description of being "pho" flavored, but nonetheless, flavors are amazing.  Pork belly is perfection.. - Phat rice:  a bit on the greasy side, but flavor packed and the ribs are delicious. - Young coconut "tom kha" soup:  THIS WAS AMAZING, sad to see it gone.  I will dream of you.  Best tom kha i've ever had!  . - BYOB. - Cool space. . negs: a bit on the pricey side for noodles, but the quality is high -- just limits my ability to go all the time!  dumplings overall are solid but not memorable.  disappointed in the duck (couldn't tell it was duck).  kimchi is delicious but expensive and not enough for $4. . need to try the foie gras and sweet breads.
