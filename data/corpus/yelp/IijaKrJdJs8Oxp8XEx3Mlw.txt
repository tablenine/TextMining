Its a bit pricey. And they can get a bit on you if you take too long since they want the table for other people. The pizzas are GOURMET so they are not huge. About 4-5 slices. They range in price from $16-23 bucks. . . The Bone Marrow was lame and expensive. That stuff would cost us a third the price at store. But i guess you pay for them to cook and presentation. You can bring your on WINE BOTTLES. but there is a $20 Service fee on each. Good to come with small party. . . I came with a party of 6 and it ended up being from $44-50 dollars a person.. . Not somewhere i would come by myself. MAYBE a date. BUT the food was GREAT. Loved the Goat cheese pizza and the Calimari one.
