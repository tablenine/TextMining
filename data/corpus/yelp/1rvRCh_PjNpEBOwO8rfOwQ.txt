Restaurant: Baoguette Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
Baoguette Cafe looks kind of like a (clean) Southeast Asian street food cafe, with ingredients on display, and people cooking right in front of you.  Seating is either on the bar facing the cooks, or on communal tables.. . Food-wise, there were some highs and lows:. . - The braised pork belly, which was part of the "street food" portion of the menu, was really good- I loved the flavor, and how the pork belly still had some skin on it, jus the way we eat it in SEA.  Unfortunately, it was extremely salty so I couldn't eat very much of it, and some of the pieces were dry and hard.. . - The spicy beef belly pho was...not spicy at all.  When I asked the woman at the cashier for a recommendation, she said that if I like spicy food I should get it, but I think they forgot to add a very important ingredient.  Luckily, they provide bottles of sriracha so I could add some heat to it on my own.  But that still does not make up for the fact that the broth was extremely bland, and the beef belly was kind of tough.  I've had better, more flavorful, cheaper pho in a hole in the wall in DC with rude waitstaff.. . - The Baoguette sandwich, however, was delicious!  The bread arrives parbaked, and they finish it off in the restaurant, which allows them to serve bread that's not stale throughout the day.  They hollow out some of the center of the bread, and stuff it with meaty goodness and sweet pickled vegetables, which balances the saltiness of the meat.  . . The sandwich was the best thing I've had here, which I guess is expected since they started off just doing the sandwiches before expanding to other options in Baoguette Cafe.  Next time, I'm definitely not going to waste my stomach on the other things on the menu.
