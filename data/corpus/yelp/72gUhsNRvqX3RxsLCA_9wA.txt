if you are an angry bull do not go into this place. You will definatley not enjoy the ambiance! (the decorator used massive amounts of red for the interior) that being said if your a hungry dude hankering for some Chinese check out ben pao!! The dishes are served family style so best experience is to come with yours so you can try more dishes. I came with the fam and got to sample several bits of there delishiousnous. Notable flavors was the cherry bomb shrimp and the crab Rangoon. They have a pretty nice bar with a good specialty cocktail menu. The prices are pretty reasonable for a restaurant trying to be as trendy as they are. My only real criticism is that the place lacks authenticity which I Â in a restaurant. The only Asian in the restaurant I saw was Yao Ming because incidently the rockets were playing the lakers in the bar.
