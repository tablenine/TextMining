Well I can tell you all the hype was worth it....lunch time that is.... . The food is great and taste as expected but went for lunch and waited about 1.15 hours...I can definitely tell though the food would taste awesome when your drunk after a club/bar but i am not sure if i'm gonna wait that long for food..any type of food.... . Definitely a must try at least once and whenever you catch it...
