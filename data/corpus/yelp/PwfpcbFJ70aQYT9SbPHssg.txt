Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Great steaks! We had reservations at 6:30, before the dinner rush on a Saturday night. The dining room upstairs was half empty at the time. This is a nice time to come if you like it a bit more quiet and get seated on time for your reservation. Later in the evening, the entire place is packed, the bar is packed, and a ton of people are hanging around the hostess stand waiting for their tables to open. Ladies, if you don't want to feel under dressed, you can never go wrong in a dress and heels.. . Onto the food, for two people, we had:. . Bread basket: of course they would have this - an assortment of breads to choose from - white, dark, soft, crisp, etc.. . Appetizers: Crab Stuffed Mushrooms - Generous serving of crab, a bit oily, but delicious. Breadcrumb topping.. . Meat: Two 22oz bone-in ribeyes. These babies come sizzling on 400 degree plates. My medium was cooked perfect and extremely juicy. I just trimmed off the excess fat on the sides.. . Sides: Steamed Asaparagus - like any other steakhouse. Nice cleanser for the palate. Lobster Mashed Potatoes - OMG!!!!!!! Amazing!!! There were huge chunks of lobster and lots of it. The mashed potatoes are already good, but when you add lobster to them, takes it to another level.. . Wine: Extensive wine list. We had a bottle of pinot in the lower price range and it complimented well. Don't be afraid to ask for suggestions.. . Dessert: Chocolate cake w/a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Nothing special about this, unfortunately.. . We ended up taking half our meal home cuz there was so much food. . . As for parking, I'm a huge fan of free street parking , but at a place like this, just valet.
