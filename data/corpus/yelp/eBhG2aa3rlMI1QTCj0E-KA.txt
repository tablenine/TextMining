Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I typically like Roscoe's but this past Saturday, my cousin, BF and I had the omelette the #5 and a case of FOOD POISIONING.  The rest of our party didn't get sick at all.  All three of us were up by 3AM.  Let's just say our stomach decided to reject the food. I called the manager that morning just to let them know that they may be serving bad eggs.  She was rude and told me just to call the Health Department.  WOW, what service.
