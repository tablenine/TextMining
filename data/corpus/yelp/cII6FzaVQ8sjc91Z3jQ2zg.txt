I pretty much call this place my second home. I always order the Duck and Bacon dog, plain, with fries and chipotle ketchup and a nice glass of Duvel beer. What an awesome combination. It does however get crowded early with lines out the door but I think it's definitely worth the wait. Also the parking can get annoying since they only have street parking.
