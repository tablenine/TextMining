Restaurant: Co&#39;m Vietnamese Grill
Category: Vietnamese
I have been a loyal Co'm goer for awhile now. My hubby and I always end up getting the rice vermicelli with the beef grilled grape leaves. I love the charcoal grilled flavor paired with the light noodles and vegetables. They also give you a light, slightly sweet sauce to pour over the whole dish. . . The staff is always very pleasant, even though they can be a bit slow at times when they get full. All they need is an extra waitress to solve that problem. Also, I was pleasantly surprised last time I went; we got a cute little coffee flavored cake desert after the meal and didn't have to pay for it! And who says nothing's free?
