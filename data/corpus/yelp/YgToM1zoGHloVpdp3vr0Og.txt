My review is quite late in coming but I have been here throughout it's existence so I will try to cull from all my visits there. . . Dipping sauces for fries. Ridiculously yummy hot dogs featuring gourmet sausages and exotic meats. Affligem Noel beer. I shit you not, I was WASTED after just one.  I was sick OK. . . I tried to visit a few times recently and was disheartened by the line. It's like Pink's East but if Pink's had good sausage and good beer. . . Local music, art and yuppie hipster crowd also kind of a turn off but I am very happy to see them doing so well. It's better them than like Hot Dog on A Stick I guess.
