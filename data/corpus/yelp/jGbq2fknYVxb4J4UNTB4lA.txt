Wow, it was like walking into "My Big Fat Greek Restaurant". There is parking in the back. I was not sure about this place looking at the area. Its a little sketchy but not you know, hit the deck dangerous or anything. So so worth it.. We walk in, and it is a store. Authentic. Then we walk up to the counter and the guy behind the corner was really nice. He helped us decide on what to get. I got a Lamb Chop plate and my husband a Gyro plate. We ordered a Carafe of house wine (costs less than two glasses). Oh my gosh so so good. We sat down at a small table and enjoyed ourselves...looking at the posters and various pieces of art around the area. . Simple and really good. Be sure you should mention yelp. We got a great deal because we did and I hear they change the offers weekly so check back before you go.
