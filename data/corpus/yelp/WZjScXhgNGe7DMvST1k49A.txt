Restaurant: Spring Restaurant
Category: American (New)
While our waitress seemed inexperienced (we asked her to tell us a little bit more about the "malts" on the menu and she replied, "I don't know"), the service was very friendly as a whole and definitely not pretentious. Â . . Now the FOOD...very well prepared and presented. I ordered the scallops and oxtail and the scallops were cooked to PERFECTION (Yummy ^4), and my boyfriend had the halibut and gnocci, and it the flavoring was delicious also. The boy never eats fish, and he loved it! . . Sadly, the ice cream sampler and cheese samplers were not worth it... the house-made green tea ice cream was downright grassy, the cheese was nothing special. Not going to say it was entirely worth our bill of $150, but Spring's main courses are definitely some of the best we've had in Chicago. Will be returning, sans dessert!
