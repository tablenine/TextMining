Went here for a birthday burger and wine (yeah, I know, but I can't drink beer). For those of you who are complaining about the no substitutions policy - think for a minute about the volume of meals served here and the speed with which said meals reach your table. . . I *totally* understand the no substitutions policy. Anything that slows down the kitchen is to be actively discouraged. . . This place is unbelievably crowded, and yet still manages to get the food out fairly quickly. And what food it is. This is possibly the best burger I've had in 10 years - it's not cheap, but it's well worth the money. . . Also, they've got beef marrow on the menu, which makes me love them even more. . . The staff are friendly, the food's awesome, and they've got a huge selection of beer, wine, cocktails and whiskey (seriously, I've never even heard of Three Roses before). . . If you haven't been here - there's no waitstaff. All orders must be placed at the bar, which means you have to stake out a table and then send one member of your party to the bar to order. You'll either need to pay upfront or have one person put the meal on their credit card. Â A runner will bring out your food sooner than you would have thought was possible given the crowd. . . Go there understanding just how busy the place is, enjoy it for what it is, and you'll have a great time. Oh, and order the beef marrow. It's delicious, as is the burger. And the fries. . . I'll be back.
