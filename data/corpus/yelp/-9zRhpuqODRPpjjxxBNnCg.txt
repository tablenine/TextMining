This place is one of the best sushi places I've been to in LA.  The sashimi is great.  Very fresh and good proportion of slices.  I always go during lunch but there is always a wait.  . . Another thing, that guy who talks real fast?  He doesn't work there anymore.  At least that is what this other guy/host said when another group asked.  . . The akimo is good but the garnish on top is a bit big spicy.. . The sashimi deluxe plate is great but the sashimi lunch special are just as good.
