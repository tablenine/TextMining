Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I went with a friend on the recommendation of some of her coworkers, and we were pleasantly surprised by this place. The atmosphere is decidedly non-LA, and that was a welcome change from many other spots in the surrounding area. . . I had a hickory burger, and split an order of fries with my friend. The burger was delicious, and certainly worth the extra 50 cents for cheese. The fries were good but nothing out of the ordinary - in fact, they could have used a tad more salt. I'm also not entirely sure about the way drinks are served in a small paper cone instead of a glass or even a cup, but that may just be part of the authenticity - though I'm fairly certain they did have glasses in the 40s and 50s. . . The apple pie for desert was possibly the best I've had, and I am not an apple pie fan at all. If you're in the Hollywood/West Hollywood area, this is definitely a place to stop for a good burger but be warned - seating is not reserved and the bar probably only seats about 20 at most. If you come during a busy time, you will have to stand and wait, either inside or out, to get a spot here, but it IS worth it.
