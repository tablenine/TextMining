Restaurant: LA Mill Coffee Boutique
Category: Desserts
LAMILL Coffee Boutique boasts one of the most impressive selections of Coffee and Tea in Los Angeles. With an extensive drink menu that offers five different extraction methods to choose from, it is apparent that these people are dead serious about their beans.     . . The modern eclectic interior design is mature, while still being fun and playful.  I was heavily impressed with the Faux-Gator Skin seats and electric chandeliers. Yup, I'm that kind of person. . . I was tempted to order one of their signature espresso beverages, such as the "Caramel Corn" or the uniquely concocted "Coffee and a Jelly Donut" beverage, made with donut infused milk, but opted for something more traditional and simple.    . . I settled on the Organic Black Onyx Coffee served in a classic French press and the platonic Lady friend ordered the Spiced Rooibos Milk Tea.  The coffee was rich, dark as night, and intensely flavorful.  The milk tea was distinctive and was like nothing I have ever had.  Needless to say, both drinks put a smile on our face and paired divinely with the dessert.        . . The Espresso Panna Cotta served with homemade Bailey's ice cream, coconut ravioli, and chocolate streusel was outrageously delicious.  This harmonious combination came together like a well-rehearsed gospel choir.  Hallelujah! So badass, it made me want to go to church. I'm talking Top Ten best desserts I have ever had material.  Effing amazing... . . I will be back to try the rest of their desserts. . . Lamill Coffee Boutique is great for coffee and tea enthusiasts, but is not for the feint of wallet.  This place is expensive.  I would reluctantly say that you get what you pay for.  I have yet to try any food off their lunch or dinner menu, but can whole-heartedly vouch for their beverages and dessert.     . . Highly Recommended
