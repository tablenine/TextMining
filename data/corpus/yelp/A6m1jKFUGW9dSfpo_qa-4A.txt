Restaurant: Blu Jam Café
Category: American (New)
Blu Jam is the best!!  Has a great NYC vibe with really quality, excellent food.  Everything is delicious and fresh, carefully prepared...the service is awesome too.  Very homie neighborhood feel...always a satisfying experience.  Another thing I so appreciate about the restaurant is that the owner is always there and really cares about the customers...it's the opposite of a try-hard L.A. spot that's about everything BUT the food and/or service.  It's much cooler than those kind of places...it's authentic, there's such variety in the menu, always new things to try...can't say enough great things about Blu Jam.  Check it out for sure!
