Gets a lil crazy on a Friday night. The pupusas were ok - I think the chicken, carne asada specialty plates were way better. The pork and cheese pupusa was salty! Rice and beans were awesome tho! Super fluffy rice and the black beans were excellent.. . Food was really slow to come out. Â This is a total hole in the wall place. Oh yea, they charge you a $2 split plate fee.
