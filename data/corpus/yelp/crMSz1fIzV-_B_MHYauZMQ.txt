Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Just wanted to point out- it's NOT authentic and it DOESN'T matter. . . that's not the point of this place. . . the point is that it's cheap and consistently good.. . word. i may or may not have made my own tito's taco t-shirt since they don't sell them.
