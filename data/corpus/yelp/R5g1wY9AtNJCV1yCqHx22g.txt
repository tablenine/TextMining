i REALLY wanted to try the other ramen spots nearby but after a nite at the farbar we were hungry and decided we would settle with suehiro.. . we went in and requested a table for 10. it was like 1-2am and they were still servin...in FACT the place was gettin beyond pACKED and it was heading towards 3am.... . the waitress is super cute. she took our orders with a smile altho at 2am i cant imagine that smile was sincere hahaha. neways i got a ramen and it was totallly MEH...i mean im no PRO @ japanese ramen but this was mediocre @ best. the beef udon was much tastier then the ramen tho! sooo if ur choosing between the two get that!!
