Restaurant: Twist A Tapas Cafe
Category: Tapas Bars
i think twist deserves 4.5 stars - a great dining experience!. . after purchasing tons o' . http://restaurant.com.  coupons in january, i just recently realized that they need to be used by next january - time to start using them stat!. . my bf and i went to twist last night around 7:30ish - we were given a choice of where to sit, so we thought we'd be cool and sit in the elevated area near the windows with little (tapas style?) tables.  too bad we couldn't stay up there - apparently 6'5 people do not fit in that space very well.  so tall-ies, stick to the regular seating.. . we were re-seated and attacked the menu.  we'd already looked on yelp to see what were must-haves.  my bf is now a yelp believer as well, as he kept mentioning yelp comments as we discussed which dishes to try.  we each ordered a glass of wine and settled on the following:. . baked goat cheese. bacon wrapped dates. jalepeno gnocci. braised beef on corncake. . SUPER impressed by everything - we didn't expect all four dishes to be as good as they were.  . . we also had never had bacon wrapped dates before (what are we, cavepeople???) and he really enjoyed them.  i think the beef on corncake really stole the show tho - we likened it to refined nachos.  the bf claims that the dish tasted almost identical to the beef nachos at the old hi-tops (rest in peace).  our theory is that the chef had these bomb nachos and recreated them grownup style with polenta, chipotle mayo, beef, feta, onion, and tomato.  they are a must-have at twist!. . we'll be back with more coupons - waitress was very cool with us using them and was attentive throughout the night.  go twist!
