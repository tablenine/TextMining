Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
This is an old school diner, with a Sex-in-the-City sophisticated feel. Only waited about 10 minutes to be seated (even tho it was Lollapalooza saturday morn) and was immediately greeted with a piping hot cup of coffee. We got a coveted booth (why diners don't just make their whole space booths is beyond me) and had a sarcastic, yet punctual waitress that was hitting on my brother-in-law without reserve. But she was about 50 and was a Keith Richard look-alike so we had a hearty laugh over our waffles! The menu items are a little pricey (since I'm used to grease-pits charging 3 bucks for eggs) but dear god, was the food good! They had homemade biscuits and gravy that I could've ordered two of, and fresh squeezed orange juice that wasn't too pulpy. We had to roll out of there, with doggy bags in hand, and didn't eat again until about 9 at night...we were that stuffed! I can't wait to head back for dinner one night, and start off with a can of Dr. Brown's Black Cherry soda, which can be found adorning the top of the cold deli case filled with sammichs. yum! UPDATE: Sadly, the next Â visit wasn't as stellar. We were seated right by the kitchen line and had to yell at each other over the noise back there. Plus, our waiter was clearly frazzled and hardly checked on us after our initial order. Oh, and we had to stir our coffee with forks since we never got spoons. Blah service this time, for sure~
