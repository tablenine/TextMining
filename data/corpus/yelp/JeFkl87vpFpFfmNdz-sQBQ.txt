Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
I felt obligated to have a reservation here, although the restaurant was not packed. The place is a Italian restaurant featuring a bunch of other Americanized dishes. I like Mondays here because it's half off. Cool scene with a cool lounge area/bar.
