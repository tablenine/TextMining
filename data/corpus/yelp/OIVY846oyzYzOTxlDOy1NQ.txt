What? my frozen pizza isn't real food? . . No, it's not. It really falls short. I had the stir it up with soba noodles and it totally exceeded my expectations of what I was going to get. Usually when I think vegan or vegetarian I think tofu dogs and tempeh that is either too salty or too bland. bleh. . . Well, my opinion changed at RFD. You can get tempeh and tofu at RFD, but they have the seasoning down. My veggies were delicious! Not too salty but flavorful enough. In fact, they were so good I ate them a little too quickly and my tummy hurt a bit after lunch. heh. . . I also tried a bit of the TV Dinner, which was equally delicious, but cheeky and fun at the same time. . . Anyway, I suggest coming and trying Real Food Daily even if you're leery of vegan/vegetarian food because, a of all, you can say you've had it finally, and b of all, boule is next door.
