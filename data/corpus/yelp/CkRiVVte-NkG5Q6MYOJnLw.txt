I'm addicted to pho. If I go more than a month without it, I start dreaming about it. My first pho ga experience was in the valley about 6 years ago while visiting a friend. Then I went back to New York and found a few places in Chinatown that rivaled my first bowl. About four years ago, I moved to LA. I have to admit, I forgot about pho for a while. I discovered "real" Mexican food. But after a few dozen margaritas and tamales, the cravings came back. . . Yes, if you want completely authentic &amp; cheap Vietnamese food, this isn't the place for you. But if you want pho that's made with higher quality ingredients (all white meat chicken with no fat/bone) or you're a vegetarian (mmmm veggie pho and Gingergrass Tofu), then this is the best place in town. . . The only downside is the crowd. They don't take reservations, so on a busy night you might have to wait a while (get a drink across the street at Silverlake Wine). I recommend doing take out, which is what I do 99% of the time. They take care of my order quickly and I don't have to deal with the scene.
