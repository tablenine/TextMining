Dear Cemitas Puebla,. . It's true I wanted to check you out after seeing you on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives - but now I would like to keep seeing you because you are amazing.. Your owner is quite possibly the most adorable and welcoming man I've ever met.  He could tell I was a first-timer right off the bat and went through the menu with me telling me what was popular and making recommendations.  The rest of your employees were also super friendly and seemed to really enjoy their work.. The food is definitely in a class of it's own.  We got two cemitas (al pastor and carne asada - upon Antonio's recommendation) and two taco arabes.  Holy. Flavor. Explosion. The al pastor was super tender and really tasty - but I have to say the carne asada was the star.  Wherever your cheese came from, please can I have some more?  As an avid-lover of cheese - I can say that I've never tasted any so delicious.  The taco arabes were also very good.. Briefly, can we talk about the trio of sauces on our table?  Each had a different flavor and complimented my cemita and taco arabes perfectly. (Though, I think the green sauce was my fave.  I almost took the bottle...except that I love you and didn't want to hurt you...). Here's the thing, Cemitas Puebla... I don't live in Chicago.  I'm going back to Boston on Monday and would very much like it if you came with me.  I think I am a very nice companion and I will treat you right.. . Think about it, OK?
