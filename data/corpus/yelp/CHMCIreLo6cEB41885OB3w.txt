Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
The good:. - pastas and entrees are reasonably priced ($15-$19). - food was decent overall.     - tasty: sand dabs, fried squash blossoms stuffed w/ goat cheese.     - ok: braised lamb shank, warm caprese.     - bad: nutella latte (had to try it). - lots of salads and cold appetizers on menu. - many outside tables, great for a warm nite. - full bar. . The bad:. - too few hot food choices (only 2-3 each of apps/pastas/entrees). - cocktails are expensive ($12-$14). - few inside tables, difficult to get on a cold nite. . In short, good if you want drinks and snacks (e.g., before/after a movie). But for a real italian meal in the same price range, I'd head to Il Forno (on Ocean Park).
