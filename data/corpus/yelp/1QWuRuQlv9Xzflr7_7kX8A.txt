My girlfriend told me about this place, so i decided to take her here the other day. We ordered the hainam chicken and beef curry. I have to say the Hainam chicken was great. The curry was ok, I've had better. This place is known for it's Hainam chicken though so i wasn't disappointed.. The price is pretty fair for the amount of food you get, so i would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a place to eat with good chicken for a good price.. . The con about this place is the available seating, which isn't very much.
