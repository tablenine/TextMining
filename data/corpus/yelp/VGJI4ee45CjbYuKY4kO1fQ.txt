one of the best sushi spots in LA...this isn't the same trendy Katsuya that SBE owns...this is the original.  Make sure to get the following: honey hand roll (soy paper), albacore w/crispy onion, red fin tuna sashimi (the best!!!), rock shrimp, and spicy tuna w/crispy rice.  . . Yes, you might need to wait a little, but it's worth it, and order a drink while you wait....make sure to make reservations or else you'll wait over an hour.
