Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Well, I've had all the best Korean BBQ's in Southern California.  Soowon had to be one of the best.  First of all, when it comes to Korean BBQ restaurants, you need to taste their signature Kalbi to begin with.  Being a picky eater all my life, I've always been searching for perfect Kalbi.  Soowon Kalbi had the perfect tenderness and marination I was looking for.  They also use charcoal which is how Kalbi should be cooked to get the best flavor.  I think they use good meat, too.  One of the reasons I do not go to "all u can eat" Korean BBQ restaurants because you don't know what kind of meat you are getting, probably lowest grade.  Whenever I go to a Korean restaurant, I look for cleanliness and their interior design/ventilation.  They were very clean, good ventilation and had nice new furnishings/chairs, which are hard to see in Korean BBQ restaurants.  Side dishes were very good and menu was perfect for first timers.  Call ahead for reservations, it gets packed on weekends.  I was there for the Valentine's day dinner.  It was a great experience.  They even gave us flowers ^^
