Short Version: Food Pretty Good, Service Pretty Bad. Long Version:. No complaints on the food.  Well, portion size is skimpy on some dishes like the ravioli or the branzino, but if the rating were for just the food Fraiche would get 4 stars.  So if all you want is good food and you don't care about bad service, head over to Fraiche. . So, the service.  Not being seated until 9:00 when we had a reservation for 8:30 is unacceptable for any serious restaurant.  Add to that a pretty apathetic attitude from the maitre d' and you have the start to a bad experience.  The delays continued after we were seated.  We wanted to get starters but 20 minutes had elapsed by the time our server took our orders.  Since we didn't want to be at dinner 'til 11:30, we decided to skip the starters.. Once we ordered, the food arrived promptly.  When we were done our dishes were cleared.  We were then handed dessert menus.  I was tempted to order dessert and others at the table wanted to order coffee, but our server did not return for 15 minutes, so by that point we all just wanted to get our of there.. It's a shame since the food is actually pretty good, but we won't be returning to Fraiche.  This was our second time there and service was lacking both times.  Some of the blame lies with the servers since I saw many of them chatting away with each other or with diners, but that wouldn't be such a problem if the restaurant cared enough to hire more servers to work the front of the house.  You have good food, a nice location, a steady stream of customers, why wouldn't you complete the puzzle and keep the restaurant well-staffed?  This is my big gripe with Fraiche.  Respect your customers, train your servers better, and hire more of them.
