Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
When drunk in Hollywood, late night, this place is like the mother ship, drawing you in. Then you get there, you wait in the line that is often times more than a few stores long. You wait and you wait, but it;s always well worth the wait.. . Pink's is a staple of Los Angeles, and nothing compares to the original Pink's. Personally, i think that the one in Vegas sucks! And they charge about triple the price.. . The Martha Stewart Dog, and the Shroom Swiss Dog are my two favorites.. . If you have the time, you always have the appetite, wait in line. It's worth it.
