Yamashiro is fabulous!!. . The food was to die for, great sushi. I've also had the BBQ ribs, filet, kobe beef, prawns, and chicken breast and they were all wonderful. The crunchy roll is my favorite... . They have a fabulous (hard to find) dessert menu with many unique selections.. my personal favorite is the chocolate suffle cake with strawberries and vanilla ice cream.. . The view are amazing, you can see from the Hollywood sign all the way to the ocean. I dont know of any other place in town that has such great views!. . The building and ambience were fabulous, the lounge was very laid back.. very romantic. . . Im a regular and usually take some friends up there on saturday nights.. They've started using a very chill DJ and they also showcase his artwork which is awesome.. . Saturday nights are good for a late-night spot to hang with friends.. its low key and they serve sushi and appetizers until 12:30 am! and drinks until 2 am.. . I definitely recommend Yamashiro for couples, groups and certainly toursists.. . . theres not a strict dresscode, but i'd recommend at least a button down for men and heels for women.. I wouldnt really recommend jeans either.. . . valet only, which is $6..
