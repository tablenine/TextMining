It's pretty rad that you can eat fine cuisine whilst viewing three plasma TVs featuring extremely raunchy music videos saturated with Latino hip-hop stars copulating with groupies in limo hot tubs.  What a great business concept!  Shitty burrito + sweaty ass in your face from all directions = the most Twilight Zone eating experience ever.  . . The health department should firebomb this place.
