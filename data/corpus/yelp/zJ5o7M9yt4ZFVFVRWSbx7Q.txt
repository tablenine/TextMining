So the hubby and I had to try this place out after hearing all about it's history and how people rave about the food.  We shared a pastrami sandwich and potato salad.  It was alright. The meat was a bit dry and not very tasty. The rye bread, however, was perfect. To me the food wasn't as good as Langers.  The environment of the restaurant was fun and nostalgic and I didn't have any complaints about the service.  I don't think I'll be returning there anytime soon, not unless we're out in Hollywood post-clubbing.
