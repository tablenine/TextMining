So we came back...twice? Three times? I've already lost count. At any rate, the burgers are delicious, especially the cheeseburger. The first time we came back I finished my fries and then dug into my boyfriend's. Yes, they make good fries. And their salads aren't bad either: the seafood salad comes with all sorts of "chopped vegetables" - including edamame beans! Not your typical salad.... . But my favorite new dish at Hub is on the lunch menu - the pulled chicken nachos! We stayed away from the nachos before because one Yelper said the chips were flimsy, but I am so glad we decided to try them anyway. These were the probably the best nachos I've ever had and they come in a huge mountain on a huge dish. Definitely enough for two people. The chicken was tasty and the sauce was good - they gave us a mini pitcher of sauce and I think we poured almost all of it on the plate. So good. I think we are definitely fans.
