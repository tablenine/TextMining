Really good coffee. But if they make such a big deal about it, let's hope so. Other reviewers have done a solid job of illustrating that LA Mill is what it claims to be as a coffee repository.. . So for my part, let's talk about their food and atmosphere. Both modernly petite. Tiny portions sat atop slender, low tables, that made me feel super cool and super hungry. The quality of service and food was good, but I eventually ate one of the sugar cubes to supplement the eggs, like some kind of common day heroine addict, which I assure you I am not. Just a caffeine addict, a weakness well enabled by LA Mill's wonderful beans.
