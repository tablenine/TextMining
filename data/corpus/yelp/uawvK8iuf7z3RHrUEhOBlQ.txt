Drawbacks: . 1) What the HELL is up with the valet parking here? First of all, the entrance is on an incline so steep my car almost rolled back down on the crowd of people waiting in line. Second, the valet parking guys look as though they'd like nothing better than to run you over with the cars.. 2) CROWDED.. . Despite these minor negatives, I still loved this place. You must go here with a rather larger group and drink soju and Hite all night. They start you off with a bunch of small appetizers such as kimchi and radishes. They also bring out a pretty tasty salad. . But the meat.... OH, the meat. I can still taste it in my mouth and I salivate doing so right now. They give you two dipping sauces for the beef. I forget what they are called, but the lighter, oily yellow one is a MUST to dip your beef in. . . As far as soju shots go, try the lemon and the pineapple. Just like candy.. . Service is pretty great and you can even push a button if you need assistance... like they do in airplanes.. . If you go, make sure to pretend it's the birthday of someone from your group. Basically, pick the victim for the night and make sure not to tell them a word about the birthday surprise. Suddenly, the cheesiest 'Happy Birthday' (is it techno-style?) will start playing and the waiters will approach the victim and pour the entire contents of a champagne bottle onto his/her head. Fun stuff.
