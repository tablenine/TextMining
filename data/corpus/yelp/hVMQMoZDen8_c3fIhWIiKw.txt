Category: Pizza
YUM, YUM, YUM! After waiting for literally four years to come to this place, it did not disappoint!. . I saw Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder's "Pizza Pot Pie" on food network literally four years ago and wanted to go ever since. Minor problem- I live in California. Major solution- best friend moved to Chicago! . . This place is homey and really cute. It looks like it could be a cottage where the dwarfs from "Snow White" live. . .  We didn't have the great experience of having the host memorize our faces because we came for lunch, but we did have a super nice waiter. . . Oh, the food! We started off with the Mediterranean bread. Sure, it sounds simple and like it wouldn't be anything special, but YUM! It's warm and soft and has a delicious spice mix sprinkled all over the top. Once we devoured that in three minutes flat, we had the vegetarian pizza pot pie. AAAAAAH, the heavens opened and little angels put pizza in my mouth for me. So good! The sauce was sweet and delicious, the crust was crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside, only the whole mushroom inside were a minor set-back for this perfect pie.. . And one of the waiters was nice enough to take a picture of us with the sign. Four years is a long time to wait for pizza!
