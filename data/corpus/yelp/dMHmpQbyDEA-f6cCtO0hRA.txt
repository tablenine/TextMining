Hahahaha. I love reading the prior reviews and hearing the negative and positive thoughts. I can understand the thoughts about the snootiness and pretentiousness of the place. Its definitely there. Putting that aside, I have to say my impressions are overall positive.. . A girl friend of mine introduced me to the place. She used to rave about the salads she would get there when she lived in the area. I tried it out one night and I admit I was very pleased with the food. I got stuck on one particular item (house salad with grilled shrimp) so I haven't ventured too far off into the menu, apart from a sandwich or two.. . My friend usually gets a veggie panini with grilled zucchini that they no longer offer on the printed menu, but they still accommodate the order.. The house salad I get, I toss in some grilled shrimp to balance out the candied pecans it comes with (you can throw in a variety of options for a price). It makes for a complete meal, tho by the end the balsamic gets a bit too tart. Both the Yukon fries and the sweet potato fries are very very good.. . I'm still laughing at the 'boogie' comment. The place does carry that attitude ~ depending on the staff and the customer you deal with. I take it for what it is. The food is good. The staff... eh. There are some highlight people, but I have mixed feelings. I have often gotten orders wrong, but I dismiss it because I am ordering off the menu. The service after you leave the counter is pretty chancey. You're left to your own if you needed anything further.. . The desserts and pastries really do look good. But they are really pricey. Not really in the mood for a 6 dollar cupcake. I'd like to try many other things but Alcove seems a little over priced. I still like the place. I will continue to go and take others, despite the shitty parking. :)
