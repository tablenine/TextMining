Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
For all the recommendations that I got to visit Bottega Louie, I walked away after my meal thinking, you've gotta be kidding me!?!?!. . There's no denying that the space is beautiful. It's bright, airy, has nice warm lighting and is just a great looking space overall. The layout is also pretty interesting but frankly I go to restaurants to eat, not to gawk at the hot maitre d' or to be in a beautiful space. At one point the maitre d' (not sure if that's what he even is) came over to talk to us and it seemed like he was making a point of doing that, like he's the Ken doll "face" of the restaurant. It's an interesting idea in theory, but in practice it seems really forced. . . Oh yes, and it's loud as all hell. I was sitting along the periphery and I could still barely hear. . . As for the food? It's incredibly mediocre. The only good thing we had was the pizza. Here's the rundown of everything we tried:. - mussels &amp; clams (rubbery shellfish &amp; way too big of a portion to be a primi). - asparagus &amp; fried egg (the asparagus wasn't that great of quality). - burrata &amp; grape tomatoes (really bland - this was by far the worst burrata I've ever had - I'm thinking quality issue again). - marinated anchovies (just a few spliced anchovies on half of a tomato - boring). - margherita pizza (by far the star of the night. It's neopolitan style and it's a nice balance of char and chewiness). - lasagna (sweet bottle-tasting tomato sauce, no nice slightly-crisp bits from being under a broiler - super boring). . It can be cheap if you want it to be and order pizza and a couple sides, but it was $140 for 3 of us, not including tip but including 1 drink each. If you don't really care that the food is mediocre but want to see and be seen, you should go to Bottega Louie. Otherwise, I'd steer clear.
