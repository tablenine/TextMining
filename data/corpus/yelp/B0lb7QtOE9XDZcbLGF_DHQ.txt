Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
Very good Cuban in Midtown, in a simple laid back space that looks like it used to be a garage?  Anyway, never had a bad thing off the menu, and great in warmer weather to eat out on their porch.  Service is very friendly and helpful. Is it as good as Palomillas?  No....but still one of the best for Cuban eats.
