Even though these subs aren't my thing, everyone else in my office considers them gourmet lunchtime fare.  I won't lie - they are good.  And they are cheap.  . . Everything else at Bari aside from the subs and their deli counter in the back is priced higher than a standard grocery store - but hey - I wouldn't recommend it as one either.  They have lots of Italian goodies.. . During lunch hours, which is everything from 10:30 AM to 2 PM in this neighborhood, you will wait.  Call in your order and make it a bit quicker if you don't want to stand in line.  But sometimes there's a wait to pick up as well!  If you've eaten the sandwiches here, you will know it's worth it.
