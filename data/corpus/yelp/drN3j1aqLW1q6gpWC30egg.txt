Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Wine Bars
This place really sucks.  With a name like "Rosa Mexicano" I was expecting some traditional mexican food....all I got was a fancy, watered-down menu that was trying too hard to be trendy.  What ever happened to just serving some good mexican food?  I don't hate many things, but I hated this place.  How can you call yourself "Rosa Mexicano" and not serve chips and salsa????  They should be ashamed of themselves.
