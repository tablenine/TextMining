i'm not a good judge of a good jewish deli being that i've only been to a few in my life, but my boyfriend is a jewish deli expert (being that he's a jew...haha) and he said that this place was pretty good. i mean on taste alone, i liked it. i had matzo ball soup and a rueben. other than the price, i couldn't complain ($11 for a sandwich!). i'd go back again for sure. it's a weird spot for a jewish deli but who cares. at least the street parking is cheap.
