Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Fusion Asian can be hit or miss and in this case, I am sad to say it leans towards the latter.. . Our appetizers were decent and hence the 2 star! We ordered the Red China, Grilled Sake Chicken and some chopsuey. My verdict: meh! The food wasn't spicy enough as the menu suggested it would be- I could have fed it to my 3 year old nephew and he wouldn't have found it hot!! . . Given that this is supposed to be a gourmet restaurant, the prices were pretty decent - but what's the point, if the food makes no impression whatsoever. *sigh*
