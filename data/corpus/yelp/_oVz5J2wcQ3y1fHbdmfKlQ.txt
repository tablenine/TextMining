Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
If you're ready for some down, dirty, and cheap Mexican food, there's no other place to go than Tito's. Without a doubt it has the best SALSA in the city, be sure to ask for extra, it's that good. Despite some saying the line is long, it goes quickly, however seating is usually a problem.
