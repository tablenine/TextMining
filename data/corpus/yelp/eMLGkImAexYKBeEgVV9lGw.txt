Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I was bamboozled in trying this place out after hearing it was overrated.  Shenanigans and tomfoolery ensued.  Mind you this was years ago and I'm finally writing up my take on this place.  My opinion hasn't changed and I have no intention of going back.. . A group of us decided to check it out since it's an LA icon.  After waiting in line to get on this joy ride, I ordered the chili cheese dog, which was devoid of flavor.  It was like I bit into a rubber chew toy for a dog - no pun intended.  The chili was ok - not the best but somewhat helped.  It boggles the mind why this hot dog stand is considered by many to be top notch.  I suppose it's the novelty and history of the place that attracts the crowds.  My friends weren't impressed with their dogs either - even my friend who wanted to try it!  I gave him a hard time about this place.  I'd rather get a Dodger or Costco dog.  Both of those are top notch.  Another LA icon is Tito's Tacos but there I could eat those tacos again, just not the dogs at this place.
