Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
veggie burger salad... yum.  variety of dressings/sauces... all yum.  fries-rings combo... super yum.  . the service is a bit slow so don't come here starving.  aside from the fried stuff, the counter makes an "unhealthy" meal a bit healthier by allowing you to lose the bun and instead serve your lean beef/non-beef patty as a salad with fresh veggies (all your choice).
