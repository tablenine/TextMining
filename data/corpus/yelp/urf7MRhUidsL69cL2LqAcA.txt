Thank you Atlanta Yelpers for warning me off the Peachtree location, L5P alone made my trip to Atlanta a hit!  I'm hesitant to say it because it's such a big step in a relationship....but yes, this was the best burger I've ever had :). . Everything here struck just the right tone.  The waitresses were edgy without being rude, the guidelines on the menu were informative and funny without being condescending, the nudie pictures in the bathroom hallway were, ahem, "entertaining", and the beer list was thorough without being over-the-top.. . And the food, my God the food.  What genius decided to replace nachos with tater tots and smother them with chili and cheese?  Amazing.  I can't wait to come back and try another burger (I had the black and blue).. . FYI, bring your appetite.  I didn't eat for exactly 20 hours after walking out the door - and that wasn't because I was trying to diet if you know what I mean....
