Oh so good!  Found this place from the Food Network's Diners Dives and Drive Thrus and am so glad that we gave it a try.  It's seriously seafood based, but offered a good option for me as a fettucini chicken dish with cherries, raisins, and blue cheese.. . The beer options were pretty good, and it's a bit dark, but a pretty cool ambiance.  Very easy to get to via the metro train and open until 10pm.. . My friend raved about the seafood, she actually dined there twice in the week before I arrived!
