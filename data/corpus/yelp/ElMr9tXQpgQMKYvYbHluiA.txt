What a great experience.  . . The views are killer... and the food was phenomenal when we went there.  The downside?  How often will we back with these prices?  Not much... but then again, it is meant for a once or twice a year experience only I think.  . . I do like the idea of coming here often and only ordering drinks... if I can pry my girlfriends hands away from the yummy food it might just be worth it!
