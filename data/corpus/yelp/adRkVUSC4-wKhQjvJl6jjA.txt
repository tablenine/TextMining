The broth tasted great and didn't take long to come out.  There was no wait when we went during lunch time so we got lucky.  The portion was large, but I think I like Shin-Sen-Gumi  broth better.  The broth here was nice and light, but Shin-Sen-Gumi was richer tasting.  Still give it 4 stars.  It was cheap, tasted good, and was fast.
