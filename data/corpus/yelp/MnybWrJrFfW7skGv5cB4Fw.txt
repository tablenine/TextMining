Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
We always walk there, since we live across the street knowing how horrible the parking can be. But we usually go early, we have kids, we can't afford to wait an hour. Food-wise, the dumplings are good, everything else are ok. I was born in Shanghai, my Mom can do a better job on some of the dishes they have.
