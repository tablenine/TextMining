Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I don't understand why there's always a long line at Pink's when the taste is just average... for some dog, even below average. I do have to say they got the most variety I've seen at any hot dog stand.. I'd say this place is a tourist spot... must go... but it doesn't guarantee you'd have a good time.
