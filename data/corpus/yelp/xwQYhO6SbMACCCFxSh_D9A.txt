i bet this place was fagulous in 1984. unfortunately, it's now a rackety mess hall. very loud, with a winter draft hitting my back every time a new couple entered. . having said that, the server was lovely, she was patient though busy and tired. unfortunately, our bill was incorrect, and the drinks were repriced from the menu. end-of-meal drama ensued. we'd just been to a nordic choir performance, so all were feeling pleasant and unprepared. . i had a small vegetable appetizer with a side of hummus and a glass of house red wine for 35 dollars. i'm fine with that, but others were very very upset. . i would return, but i'd ask to keep the menu for verification. but then again, who wants to worry about that during a dinner with friends?. . UPDATE: okay so i went back with a group who planned a dinner and the place was amazing. enormous portions, great drinks...really. i was wrong about this place. they have lovely dishes, the vegetarian platter is beautiful. i had chicken kabobs and vegetables, it was the largest serving of amazing chicken i have ever had...ever. so, i recant. AND we had an amazing time! see photos.
