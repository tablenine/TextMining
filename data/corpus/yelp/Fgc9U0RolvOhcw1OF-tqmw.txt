A lot of ppl told me to try Chicago stuffed style pizza when I go to Chicago. I did try it.. It tastes so good. I love the crust and we get to pick the topping we want for the stuffing;. Even though the wait is long, it worth it.. We need to preorder the stuffed pizza for 45 mins ahead, so it give them more time to bake the fresh pizza. . I am in love with Giordano's pizza. I won't be able to eat chicago style pizza as good as in Chicago.
