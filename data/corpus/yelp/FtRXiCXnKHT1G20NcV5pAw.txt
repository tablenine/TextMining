Such delicious food for so little money! And $1 Schlitz! What more could you ask for? Craft micro-brews? Yeah, they've got those too, and $3 whiskey specials each night. To top it off, they're usually playing some sweetly obscure country music, and the space has a great atmosphere, inside and out. I've only been on Monday and Tuesday nights though, and even then it's super-crowded. I can't imagime what it's like on the weekends!
