Hit or Miss.. . Atmosphere is definitely cool. Good music. It's open late. I've never had to wait for a table, and the bathrooms are not vomitous.. . The coffee is consistently mediocre. The entrees are okay. Desserts are bland. Do not order the huevos rancheros, unless you enjoy being disappointed.. . I don't know, i'd rather just go to a plain-old 24 hour diner. Of which there are a-plenty in this city.
