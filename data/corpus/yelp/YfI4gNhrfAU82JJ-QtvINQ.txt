Notes:. .      Kinda cool,but not all that. Do LA people even know what good food is?. Overpriced. . is this really considered a great hamburger in LA?. Pie is above average but way above average price. may as well go to Urth cafe or Susina or Milk or something..... . I'm kinda over the smart alecky oldtimer waiter thing-. .     OK, I do find my self going back to this old school hamburger joint- it kinda grows on you- but I still despise the grouchy old fart behind the counter. I thought his generation believed in good service and manners...the only people who think assholishness is charming are hipster kids who find so many things ironically cool....(you people are actually pretentious idiots)... . My first time there the old dude is annoyed with me  because I don't yet know how to order perfectly according to his arbitrary and non-logical stndard:. . Me: "I'll take the burger with everything". Him: "Cheese?". Me: "No Cheese". Him: (Scolding me in an irritable tone) "That's NOT a hamburger with everything then.". . Me:(In a don't-fuck-with-me-oldtimer- I'm not some wimpy LA girly-girl who is afraid to leave a 6% tip, smile really big at you, say "Thank you so much!" walk out leisurely- AND come back again- only to sit in your section once-again and before you have a chance to forget me..... . Me:"Yes, that IS a hamburger, otherwise I would have ordered a CHEESEBURGER.". . Him: Mumbling something argumentative again!. . Me: Staying for hours and then doing the above.
