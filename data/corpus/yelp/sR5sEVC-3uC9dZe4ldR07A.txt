Stepping into this place is like having one foot in a coffin, the other in 1980s Amarillo Texas. So I'm already freaked out by the atmosphere- I keep imagining "The Shining" or "No Country For Old Men."  Our waitress, bless her heart was equip with mullet, gaudy lipstick and picket fence teeth.  Hungover and hungry, we order sweet potato fries (on account of the table side advertisement regarding them as the 'healthy alternative' to regular fries.  I guess when given a choice between the devil and his minion, go with the lesser evil.)  They were decent, given the circumstances.  Of course we got the pastrami- best I've ever tasted, hands down.  The meat was perfectly seasoned, juicy and didn't have that annoying accordion- style fat distribution.  The bread was spongy, baked with flecks of oregano.. . I also had the spinach, jack, and mushroom omelet.  Maybe the mushrooms they used were awesome, but this thing was soaking wet. Like someone had sent the eggs down a water slide. And believe you me, slimy eggs on a queezy stomach just wasn't going down.  What the omelet lacked, the hash browns more than made up for. Sliced Au- grautin style with a crispy exterior. I rushed to evacuate them from the flooded plate, doused them with salt and went to town.  . . I can't even recommend this place on value. I'd much rather spend  little more and get better quality at any Hollywood status (insert name here) sidewalk cafe.
