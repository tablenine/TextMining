I love La Parilla off Howell Mill!  Service is always good and food comes out hot and tasty every time!. . The seafood burrito filled with shrimp, tilapia, pico de gallo, onions, peppers and topped with queso is really good. And it's the only item I get whenever I'm there. It's also served with rice and Mexi-beans.  The price is a bit expensive, but this burrito is really worth it!  The complimentary . . I've also called in and ordered for a pick up.  It takes minutes and my burrito is always ready by the time I get there.  My order always come with the complimentary chips and salsa.  The employees are so nice and they recognize me every time I walk into the restaurant.   . . If you're in the area, stop by and have the seafood burrito.  It's sure to make your belly full and if that doesn't work, there's always margaritas!!!
