Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I'll spare you the requisite rant from this NYer about how the only good pizza is in the east, blah blah...BUT I will say that, for the 6 years I lived in the LA area, the "Casa B" was by far the best pizza experience I ever had. I used to love their whole wheat pie (something I'd never order back home, but they have it down to an art), and they atmosphere is as much fun as the food is tasty. Pizza-loving visitors to the LA area should give it a chance, even if it's out of your way.
