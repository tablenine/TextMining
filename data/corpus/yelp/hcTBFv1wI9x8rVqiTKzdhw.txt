Went out to lunch with friends from work and while this would not have been my selection I really enjoyed it.  I'm not a big buffet fan usually because the food isn't that good, but mostly because I can't control my food intake.  They have a $10.95 lunch buffet that was pretty good.  A choice of 2 soups, 2 salads, 2 potatoes, and several meat options.  Don't ask me to give you the formal names, but the salad, potatoes and chicken was very tasty.  It's probably good that we all got the buffet since I think our waitress knew about 3 words of English.  She did seem nice enough.
