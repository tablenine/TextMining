They open late!!!!     My fave place to grab late night dinner after clubbing.   Portion is small, but it's priced well.     Some of my fave dishes are:   spicy fried thousand year old eggs,  sauteed chinese broccoli with crispy pork,  fried egg with shreded pickled radish,  papaya salad with raw shrimp (YUMS!! with capital YUMS). . Although the place is always crowded,   you don't have to wait long because they have doubled the space after renovation.   . . The only annoying thing is parking.   You have to valet no matter what.
