GARLIC ICE CREAM!!! I'm a GARLIC-FREAK and this place still hasn't topped the garlic meter for me.. . Pros:. -The first time I ever seen rabbit on the menu (I freaked out because I have 2 at home).. -A wide selection of food. Everyone was able to order food to satisfy their taste buds and wallet.. -They gave me GARLIC ICE CREAM for my birthday. That was weird! It was like vanilla ice cream with a note of garlic and the kick after you have swallowed the ice cream. =). -Cute little place and relaxing atmosphere.. . Cons:. --I had the "Zuppa de Pesce". It's like a think soup with different kinds of seafood in it in a tomato type sauce. It was good but it didn't stand out. The soup is a little on the sour bland side for me. It wasn't what I was expecting but maybe they could have added something to balance out the tomato. . . I wouldn't come here again.
