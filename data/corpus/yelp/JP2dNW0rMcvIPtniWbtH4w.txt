Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
This place has good meat. The jamuluk or whatever that dish was, it was the best meat I've ever tasted. It was flavored just right and tender!. . The galbi short ribs were good as well, but they fell short of the high expectations we had after eating the jamuluk.. . This place is pretty stingy with the side dishes though. That docked 1 star. They didn't want to bring us more side dishes after we vacuumed it up. They made excuses like...not right now, we're busy. Later, when I bring the meat. . . What kind of customer service is that? Don't make excuses..if there's a limit on the side dishes, let us know. Don't BS us with some excuse...later later...but later never came. We had to ask repeatedly for side dish refills, but even still, they didn't bring them.. . Service is pretty slow.... . but the meat made up for it.. . The highlights of the side dishes were the sweet potato-fresh and warm out of the oven; the white thing..dunno what it was called, but it had a mayonnaise type of dressing to it; fish cake not bad either; cucumbers, radish, all good =). . Will most likely come back again soon
