I freaking love this place! My old office was down the street and I was a regular at lunch time.  Sadly for me, I never got to experience much of hte menu because I struck gold on my first try - the Iceberg Wedge Salad and a chocolate chip cookie.  Sounds simple,I know, but I have yet to find a comparable wedge salad.  Their blue cheese dressing is to die for! While any baked good from Joan's is a safe bet, I am a huge fan of their chocolate chip cookie.  . . Downsides: somewhat inflated prices; very hectic breakfast and lunch rushes
