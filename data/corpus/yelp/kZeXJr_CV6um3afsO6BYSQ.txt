I used to be (and still am) a Moe's enthusiast, but since moving across the street Willy's has really been growing on me. I like the guacamole, the spicy chicken option is nice, and for whatever reason I think I like their cheese more than Moe's. Moe's certainly still has a warm place in my heart, but Willy's at least lives up to them in every respect!
