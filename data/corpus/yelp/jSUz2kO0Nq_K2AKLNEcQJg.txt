Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
Cobras was loud and bustling.  We sat on the patio/sidewalk area on a relatively warm night, so the ambience was nice.  The tapas were all tasty, with several being exceptional.  However, the price still seems a bit steep.  Great place for an upbeat group if you get reservations.  You'll have a lot of fun sharing, laughing, and talking the evening away.
