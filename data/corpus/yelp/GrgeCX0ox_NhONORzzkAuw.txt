Love it!  First of all the staff is very friendly!  My co worker and I started going there because it was one of the few places in the city that has a gluten free menu (almost everything there is gluten free).  We go there at least once a week for lunch.  It is a small restaurant with a lot of flavor!  The lunch buffet has about 8-10 different items and i really like how most of them are vegetarian options...there is typically 2-3 dishes that have meet.  The best ever!
