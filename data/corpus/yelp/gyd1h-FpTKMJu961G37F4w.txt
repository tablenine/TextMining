Restaurant: Rathbun&#39;s
Category: American (New)
AGREEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the taste of ATLANTA!!!!!!!. . It is the standard all 5 star restaurants should be held to.. There Lobster Taco was amazing and the special Rib Eye (from the painted hills region) I got was off the charts. I was amazed after driving thru atl's industrial district to find this place. . . My family celebrated my younger sisters 25 B day there. It was a special night for more reasons than I can begin to count. . . The wine list was superb, the food amazing, the atmosphere PERFECT, and with the wine bar next door, it proved to be a fun filled evening. . . The only downside is....now I can't wait to try Rathbun's Steak House.. I think someone's B-day is coming up, if today is yours send me a message and I will take you to Rathbun Steaks, I am dying for an excuse to go.. . Thanks Kevin for going out on a limb. Rathbun's eclipses all others...
