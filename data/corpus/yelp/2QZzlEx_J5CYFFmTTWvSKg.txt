The food and ambiance were good... not memorable.  The table service was pleasant enough too.  . . My only real problem was that I requested a table for two inside at 845, and the host told me only 830 or 915 was available, so I accepted the 830 reservation and rushed there so I would not lose my reservation.  When I arrived, she told me I would have to wait 10 minutes or sit on the patio... I agreed to wait 10 b/c that isn't very long!  (And I am rather patient.)  Then, I stood at the tiny, crowded bar until 9pm when a chair finally became available at the bar.  Our table was finally ready for us around 920.  This was REALLY annoying.   The hostess was friendly about it, but then again, she should have been... we waited forever.   In my opinion, for a wait that long past our reservation, they should have offered a glass of wine on the house or something.  But nothing.  . . I do not think I would go back just b/c it was only memorable in the waiting aspect.
