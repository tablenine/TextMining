Restaurant: El Barco
Category: Mexican
I used to live down the street from this restaurant, but I was afraid to go in it., mostly because It looks completely garish on the outside.  If I was Spongebob Squarepants, I would've fit right in. But I would always smell a pungent, fragrant aroma by my apartment.  I knew I had to go there.  And I've been here five times in the past year.. . El Barco is overall a good experience for me.  Many of the waiters are nice eye candy, which is a superficial plus for me.  I LOVE the huge portions; I never leave hungry an hour later.  I'm a creature of habit, so I usually get the cerviche de pescado (fish) or the grilled octopus as an appetizer.  Delicious.  Then I usually get one of the snapper dishes.  This food has never failed to please me nor guests I've invited.. . Now for why I can't give it five stars.  Service is not great at all.  I feel neglected a lot.  Also, the place is way too cramped.  I once had to make an entire side of a table move so I could get in my seat.  Not cool.  . . I'll put up with a lot for some good food, and El Barco keeps me coming back for more.
