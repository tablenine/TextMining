I absolutely love this place.. . Most of the time I come, the only thing I order is the ramen.. Sometimes the egg is great, sometimes a bit dry.. . I have tried the Kotteri version of the ramen, but it just wasn't for me. It's about as good as the the traditional ramen, but I still prefer traditional.. . The side dishes are more than I can handle along with the bowl of ramen, so I wouldn't say it's the greatest idea if you want to finish your bowl!. . The atmosphere is great, too. You would think having to wait for anywhere from 5-15 groups to get to you on the list would be a bother, but it's not! I enjoy standing outside with the crowd waiting for my turn to walk into that cozy little place. The service is great, and people there are very friendly.. . Ever since finding this place, I come about every week.. Definitely my favorite restaurant thus far.. . Enjoy!
