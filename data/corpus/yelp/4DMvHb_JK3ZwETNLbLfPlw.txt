My bf took me here for Vday this year (this is our second time here) and they had a special menu that was pretty affordable. A 4 course meal for around $90 for two people. This def beats ordering random things from the menu. The kobe steak was prob the best. I didn't like the surf and turf roll as much as how others raved about it. I'm upset we didn't see the geishas this time. We did get to take pictures with them last year though. Overall, I think people go here for the atmosphere and not as much for the food. The whole environment is really hip and they have a really nice bar area to chill at. My only complaint is prob the small cramped space. Its like a maze in there - 3 floors and different little hallways...you can get really lost in there.
