Yes, the wait is long.  Yes, the place is small.  Yes, the place can get  crowded.  But, the sushi is good and the rolls are creative.  It's casual and reasonably priced.  I have high expectations when it comes to sushi and am pleasantly surprised to have found a decent place in Chicago.  I'll definitely be coming back and bring a bottle of sake' with me.
