Great drinks and seafood, especially the snapper. The salsas on the table aren't to my taste, and the chips have always been slightly stale when I've been there, but ok. They do about everything on their (gigantic) menu well, but I would say the drinks are the best. Of course, the bar is about 10 feet long, but if you ever need a place to go in West Town/Ukie Village after the dinner rush with a few friends for a REALLY good margarita, this is it.
