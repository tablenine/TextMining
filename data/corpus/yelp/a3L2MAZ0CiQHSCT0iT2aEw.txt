The Little 5 Points area is awesome.  There are lots of really friendly people that hang out there on a daily basis, and despite not having anything in common with most of them, I generally feel pretty well accepted every time I visit the area.. . They have done a pretty good job running out most of the homeless people here also.  It is not that I hate the homeless or anything, it is they just used to gather here in large numbers begging for money or asking you to buy a newspaper which were all most likely stolen from a machine. It could really get annoying, especially to OTP suburban dwelling folk like myself who is not used to the downtown scene.. . The trendy shops and bars in the L5P area are just as unique and cool as the people who hang out there on a regular basis.. . I would not recommend coming here really late in the night on most occasions, because it can get a little shady from time to time.  But ever since the biker gangs have started to protect the area, I have felt an increased sense of safety every time I go back to visit.
