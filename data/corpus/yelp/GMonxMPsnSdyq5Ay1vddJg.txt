If I were to bite the dust tomorrow, and I'd have to list 5 places  to eat before the grim reaper comes to get me, Portos would be on that list.. . It's not a fancy place. Quite frankly it looks like a lunchroom/cafeteria which masses of people who have all heard the TRUEmor: Portos is THE shit. At any given time, this place is busy busy busy, which sucks but is indeed a true testament to the nom nom nom-ness of their food.. . Usually whenever I stop by, I leave with boxes of yummies for myself and for distribution just cause I know how damn far it is, and it might be months before another visit. My favorites are the potato beef balls, croquettes, chorizo pies, the cheese rolls, and even every once in a blue, the guava-cheese rolls (hormone-reliant of course). They also have a decent selection of sandwiches to suit every palate. . . Oh and their cakes/sweets are just as amazing. Try to call in your orders though to save yourself some time and hassle. I ain't kidding when I say the lines get super long. . . Overall, no complaints here about the food. the crowds/lines/parking suck but not enough to weigh Porto's score down.  Yay for 5 stars!. . somofabitch now my stomach is grumbling. time to head downstairs and settle for something less than mediocre. sigh.
