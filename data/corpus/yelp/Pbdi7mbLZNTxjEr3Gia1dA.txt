Mmmmmmmm . . . If you haven't been to Smoke Daddys yet-- Go Right Now!. . My advice: if you're there with a friend you feel comfortable sharing with, split the platter that allows you to get ribs, 2 open faced smoked meats (I'm partial to the brisket and the pork), and 2 sides (1 has to be the baked beans).. . You will be stuffed and completely satisfied.. . Quality for the Cost: 10. Service: 6
