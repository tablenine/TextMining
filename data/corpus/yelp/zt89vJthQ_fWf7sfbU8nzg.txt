Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Note: The food is not kosher, just kosher-style. With so much history and historic value to Los Angeles, you would think they would have kept it kosher, but alas, they serve B.L.T.s (and it's not turkey bacon). This is why it gets 4/5 stars.. . As said, interesting history, cozy and bustling establishment, great people-watching opportunities (especially late nights), and 24 hours. Los Angeles just doesn't have enough 24-hour establishments. . . The potato pancakes are good but not great, but the ruben is AMAZING. Just beware, don't expect to get the same ruben at the Canter's in Vegas; it's made differently. . . Also, the portions are huge! Very reasonable prices, and pleasant staff. Â Parking (validated/free after-hours) can be crowded sometimes, but it's usually not a problem. If the parking is full, sometimes the parking attendant will valet, or you can park around the block. Take-out orders are made very quickly.
