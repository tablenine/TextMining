All I can say is yummy!!!  We are generally a brunch crowd here so I will limit my review to the brunch menu.  We have gone two times and both times have been amazing.  We went most recently for Easter Brunch and we ate until we could not eat anymore.  The crab cakes were made with real lump crab and they were the best crab cakes I have had.  They did not have lots of breadcrumbs or mayo and they were just perfectly grilled.  The tenderloin was cooked to the exact temperature (as if a food fairy waived a wand over the food) and the grits were creamy gooey delicious.  The pulled pork sandwich was also great.  The service was perfect and the atmosphere was great.  I will say it is a little on the expensive side for brunch so make sure you plan appropriately.  I am a damn Yankee but I could eat this southern food for days.  I am not one to call many places "true southern food" but this would be one of them.
