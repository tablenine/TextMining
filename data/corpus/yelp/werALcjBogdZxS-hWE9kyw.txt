Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
You know what? Come here if you want to show off the art of Chinese dumplings to the unfamiliar. Check out the "authentic" looking people making the dumplings in the window. Who knew that the Hispanics were such experts on making Xiao Long Baos.  . . Be willing to wait for 2 hours with bad parking and loud Chinese people. Don't forget to count all the darth vader / welder mask visors that the moms are wearing.  That should make the time pass by quicker.. . Make sure to be nice to Jean, the hostess / manager. You can easily spot her because her chi pao is lavender while the other peon waitresses are in pink. Check out her waitress shoes. I love them.. . Eat:. Shanghainese Rice Cakes. Shrimp Fried Rice. Original Xiao Long Baos. Spinach sauteed in garlic. . Dont Eat:. Glutenous 8 treasures dessert. Glutenous rice shao mai. . This place is too expensive and too crowded. I'm too low class to come here often.
