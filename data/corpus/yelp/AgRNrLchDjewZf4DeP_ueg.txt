Blueberry pancakes were merely decent as were the egg dish (whichever Mexican-influenced one that's served with avocado, sour cream, etc.) but their Nutella-stuffed French toast was delicious! It's packed to GILLS with Nutella, they must put half a container in there. I'd probably go back for those again and maybe one of more creative pancakes. As noted by many, the portions are HUGE. I was impressed that four of us almost finished three dishes mentioned above! Good selection of coffee and tea. Service I'm sure can be spotty but we had a GREAT waiter who was spot-on with everything.
