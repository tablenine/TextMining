Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
Definitely worth the wait for the small venue, however the food is delicious. Some of the best BBQ you can find. I do still like Smoque better, but you can't turn down the sauce variety in Wicker Park. The live blues music brings an even better flavor to the ambiance. This review is making my mouth water.
