This place seems to get mixed reviews and I've only been there four or five times but I find myself having to stop in for lunch everytime I walk the Mile. The thai pasta is actually very good as another reviewer mentioned. The interior is cool-looking as well as the bathrooms. They also dish out a mean cappucino (I'm not sure if they still have the coffee bar but they did when I went there). All in all, I try to stop in here pretty hungry after walking the Mile and maybe a shopping binge at the Virgin Records Store. It's worth a try to decide for yourself.
