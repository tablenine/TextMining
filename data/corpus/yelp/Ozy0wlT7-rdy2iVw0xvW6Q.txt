Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Whenever I'm feeling nostalgic for Shanghai, I find myself taking a long drive to Din Tai Fung for their Xiao Long Bao and their pork and rice shiumai's. . . What can be said about these little treats... the dumpling skins are nice and thin, the broth and meat filling are well seasoned, and the selection of what I consider comfort food is great. . . Two reasons why Din Tai Fung doesn't earn it's fifth star from me - . . 1. The wait can be crazy... even after they've expanded, you can expect a wait of at least thirty minutes. . . 2. In Shanghai, you can get ten XLB's for about 12 RMB (a little under $2.00)... They are about a buck a piece here. While I understand this is America, dumplings should hardly cost so much.
