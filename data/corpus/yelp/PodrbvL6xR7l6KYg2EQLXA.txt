this ashton kutcher owned hotspot lives up to the hype....from the sake to the sushi everythin was good &amp; tasted authentic....the decor was stylish....customer service with the sushi &amp; bar was excellent...the crowd was young, hip, la style....the dj spinning was rockin~....u can also bar hop from here...its a good interlude before getting in trouble out on the streets of hollywood wit the papparazi
