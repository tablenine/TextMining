Good food, great comfortable space. The service was a little scattered while we were there but when I made the reservation earlier that evening the host was very pleasant and super nice. There were four of us for dinner and we had mussels and pork belly and brisket. The pork belly and brisket were very tender, cooked and seasoned to perfection, my mussels were a generous portion but when I reached towards the bottom of the bowl I found more and more unopened ones, I was pretty stuffed so it did not matter as much but those should have been pulled out. Our desserts made up for it, we had one of everything. Delicious bread pudding! Thanks for a great time HB, I will return very soon!
