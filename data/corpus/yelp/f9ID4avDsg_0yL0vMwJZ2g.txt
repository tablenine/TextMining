Delicious!!!! We came here on a whim one night and loved every bite. I recommend the pizzas and salads. My favorite was the margherita and the italian salad. . . The space is simple and beautiful, with high ceilings and thoughtful finishes. . . The only suggestion I have is to serve the bread on a plate or in a basket. It cheapens the experience to be given a little wax paper bag of 2 slices of bread. That was a bit strange...
