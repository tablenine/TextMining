Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
I am going to give this 3.5 for now. I used to go to Butterfly for lunch and enjoyed some tasty Thai food. Recently, I went there for sushi for dinner. Man, I did not know this was such a hot spot! It is BYOB so I think that is the main draw... lots of large parties, and a couple of big ones in the back. The place was packed... it is really skinny and small so it definitely felt cramped. The sushi was good, but not anything great. I think we ordered the wrong rolls. We definitely ordered one roll that I regret: the spicy scallop. First of all, I think it was chopped up or tiny cooked scallop. But most importantly, there were chopped up jalapenos in the sauce and it was unbearably spicy. My mouth was literally on fire... I couldn't stand it! There should have been a warning on there! We had the spicy tuna roll and it was fine. Didn't quite understand it. If I go back, I am going to go with the plain rolls... the ones I know I can handle and know I will enjoy. On a positive note, this place is very reasonably priced, is BYOB and takes reservations.
