you know, i cant hate on this place. It isnt a life changing experience but it was fun.... . Tue is a great night to go there. You can get in and there isnt any cover. The setup is kinda cool. Indoor and outdoor area. Its fair to say that this club had a good amount of pretty people there. Always a positive. I went there as a solo guy, so it definitely took me long than i liked to for me to get in. . . That said, the crowd was energetic and ready to party. . . Now I, like most of us, could share a story about a rude door man or woman who forgot their basic human manners and decency once they became the "gate keeper" to a semi hot club. Instead I will pass, because i think most of us know what to expect when you are dealing with door people at a club..they get their night of power and they abuse it. . . I just try to chill and party. I had a good time and will go back.
