Yup, yup, yup, I love to get some grub at The Oinkster.  . . The pulled pork sandwich is my go to order, I agree with the other reviews that it can sometimes be a little dry, but more often than not it is juicy and Delicious.. . I love their sauces, the Carolina style BBQ sauce is right up my alley and I could eat the garlic aioli with a spoon - it's that good.. . The Fries are tasty, the burgers are Juicy.  The lemonade is fresh and you are guaranteed a belly bomb after eating here.. . I love that they turned a mid century fast food building in to a top notch fresh-fast-food joint with quality and flair.  I like the design of the place, and I don't think it's "creepy"  what's so creepy about an A-Frame and pebble floors?  seriously, some yelpers have issues.. . Anyway,  I like it here, I think the food is good and consistent.  You won't be disappointed.
