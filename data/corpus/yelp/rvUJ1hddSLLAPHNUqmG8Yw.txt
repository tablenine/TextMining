So here I am in Chicago for work and I am craving nigiri-zushi and sashimi.  Everyone I ask tells me to go Toro for "the best" sushi.  Meh...i don't think so.  I'm a stickler for freshness and I am sorry...this ain't fresh and it is not creative. . . The great Uesegi of Sendai once told me to never eat sushi in a city that is more than 1 hr away from the sea by train.  I now believe him.
