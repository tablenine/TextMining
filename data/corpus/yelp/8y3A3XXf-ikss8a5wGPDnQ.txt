I had lunch here a little while ago.  This place is pretty busy at lunch time and we had maybe a 10 minute wait.  The service was pretty good.  . . I had the bison chili, the Blue Creek bison burger with onion rings and an Arnold Palmer.  The bison chili was pretty good, but not amazing and really just made me want the brisket chili from Fox Bros.  I've had bison burgers before, but it's been years.  Basically, I really don't think they taste drastically different from beef burgers, but the texture is different.  I'm not sure it's worth the extra money for me personally.  The burger came with a lot of bleu cheese and some bacon.  It was overcooked though as I ordered medium-rare and got medium-well to well-done.  It was a pretty good burger aside from that, but nothing special.  I was not a fan of the onion rings - I didn't like the batter much and I think they were heavy-handed with the salt &amp; pepper (mainly the salt).  The AP was pretty good.  I believe the server said they used freshly-squeezed lemonade and I think they use regular tea - the drink has a very tart, unsweet taste to it.  . . Overall, I thought the prices were slightly too high and the food was pretty decent but not fantastic.  Better than I was expecting so I'll probably go back at some point.  . . 3
