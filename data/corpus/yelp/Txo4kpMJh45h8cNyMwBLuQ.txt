Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Chris Kim likes their cheap prices compared to other places all you can eat BBQ. . . However, the service is lacking and if you ask for assistance, it's a real burden to them.. . Considering what he pays, he gets good quality meat compared to other all you can eat Korean BBQs... WHAT!?
