Went here with 6 friends during Restaurant Week. The food was ordered off of a fixed menu and included a good variety. However, this limits my review a little bit. . . As a whole, the food was fantastic - though the specifics of which are failing me. The watermelon and tuna appetizer was a standout though. As a group, we agreed that the sparkling sangria was good, but not as good as Cafe Ba Ba Reba's.. . The restaurant's atmosphere was dim and trendy. The place was very large, and with a high ceiling and tables appropriately spaced, it did not feel crammed in any way. . . At 11PM, the center of the restaurant was cleared revealing the dance floor. Promptly, the salsa music began and in no time the floor was packed with dancers.. . If you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner, be sure to arrive before 9PM, but if you want to stay for some booty shaking, try to get reservations after 9 or 9:30 so you can be done in time for some dancing.
