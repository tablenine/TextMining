I've never had a bad meal at this place (they've all been amazing... pizza, chicken, steak etc) and we always have a good time when we go.  It's great people watching, fairly inexpensive for the portions and always on the money...  I wanted to give it 4 stars at first but this place truly does deserve a 5... bravo!. . I'm actually a little pissed that this place franchised so much because I don't want to eat it anywhere but Hollywoooooood!
