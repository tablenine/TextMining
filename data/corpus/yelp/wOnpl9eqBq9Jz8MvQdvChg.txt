Restaurant: 5 Seasons Brewing
Category: American (New)
After seeing the "Coming Soon" sign for month after month after month, when 5 Seasons finally opened it was not very exciting for me or any of my friends. Nevertheless, we stopped by last night to check it out and were sorely disappointed. Dark and depressing decor, combined with very few guests made for a bleak backdrop as we waited way too long only to have our 3 simple drink orders messed up. The service was slow and incompetent, which was even more disappointing considering a) there was hardly anybody there and b) it was the first week. I understand that it takes a while to get  a restaurant/brewery up and running, but I do not understand why the staff wouldn't at least try their very best to make the first, poor experience a little better for the customers. . I'm sorry to say, as excited as I was when I found out 5 Seasons was coming to my neighborhood (which - by the way-  was about a year ago), I will probably never go back. . If you're looking for some good food and beer, and a fun atmosphere and competent service, then do yourself a huge favor and head just a few blocks away to Six Feet Under. . . I promise, you'll be much better off there.
