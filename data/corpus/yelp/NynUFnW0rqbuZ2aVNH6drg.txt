This place is still arguably the best bar in Uptown.  . . In my first review I forgot to mention the HUGE (it must be 6 feet tall) Jenga game they have outside in the summer -- by far my favorite thing about this place. . . I had brunch here for the first time today.  I had the Eggs in a Blanket:  proscuitto wrapped eggs with a touch of cream and fried sage leaves, baked and served with whole wheat toast.  It was tasty, but I think this place is better off sticking to the simple stuff.  My friend had The Curve:  bacon, two eggs, a sausage patty, house potatoes and toast.  His came on a U-shaped plate, a nice touch.  If you're not counting calories, the house potatoes are awesome -- homemade chips smothered in cheddar cheese. . . They also have a mobile Bloody Mary bar.  I didn't have a Bloody, so I wasn't able to really check it out.  It's no more than a table on wheels, but still a great idea.  They just wheel it right over to your table.  They're just asking you to be lazy here, which I can appreciate on a weekend morning.
