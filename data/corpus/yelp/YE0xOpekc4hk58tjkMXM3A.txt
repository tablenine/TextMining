carroll street cafe is PERFECT.  especially for brunch - try crab cakes benedict.  they are keen on the sweet/salty combos that i crave - pair your pancakes with soysage and fruit.  it's worth a 30 minute wait, i promise.. . i know this is irrelevant, but i always hear people speaking spanish or french at carroll street.  the international elite seem to know more about atlanta's hip cafes than locals.. . it's incredibly sexy at night.  a great bar with great tapas and somewhat pricey drinks.  i like the parmesan-encrused brie plate with fruit and french bread, although the brie is not really "encrusted".  make sure you try their citrus cake with cream cheese frosting.  . . avoid the waitress who calls everyone "sweetheart."
