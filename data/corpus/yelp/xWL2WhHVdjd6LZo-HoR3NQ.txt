Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
The good part.... great beer selection and really great spinach/artichoke dip that came with homemade potato chips and fried pita triangles. The dip had a creamy, basily taste that I didnt expect but it worked. I think was on the daily specials so they might not have it everyday.. . The less-good part.... the extensive list of sandwiches and unexpected combinations (chicken-peanut butter-cilantro!) sets pretty high bar so when your food comes and it doesnt blow you away you're a little disappointed. I had the fried green tomato... good but not great. Also, overpriced.
