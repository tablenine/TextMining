5 stars for taste.. . 3 stars for having prices so high that I can only go again if my in-laws come back into town.   . . The menu is a bit user-UNfriendly; it's a weird size, heavy, and the descriptions don't really sell you.  BUT, once our dishes arrived and the food traveled into our mouths via hand &amp; fork, we were happy,  happy eaters.  . . We tried:. . 1. White Shrimp flatbread with micro arugula and white bean hummus. 2. Pub burger with blue cheese and carmalized onions, paired with onion rings. 3. Flat Iron steak with rapina and broccoli. 4. Trout with rapina and potatoes.. . I can say nothing denigrating of these dishes.  On the contrary, we were all oooing and ahhhing about the tasty treats delivered.  The blue cheese on the burger is strong, which I love.  The onion rings have THE best batter ever and are not greasy.  The trout was so fresh and light and savory.  The steak was cooked well and the rapina (think kale) was soo good and fresh and healthy. . . When you decide to go, do NOT miss the flatbread.  The white shrimp flatbread is an interesting choice; it was definitely the first time we'd eaten hummus and shrimp together on the lightest, crispiest bread.  SOOO  yummy.  Perhaps I'll go back and just eat this for my entree. I could afford that! : ). . Overall a nice dinner (and a nice nice check for our parents).  One of the many great choices in Culver City.
