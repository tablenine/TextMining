I've been a couple of times now and really enjoyed both.  This last time we split some type of fish carpaccio that was wonderful.  It had some sort of spices that were the perfect mix of fresh and salty.  I could have eaten a pile of it.  Oof, it was that good.. I ordered salmon with asparagus and a poached egg on paparadelle.  It was really tasty as well.  My date ordered the crab legs and really liked them.  I had a bite and thought they were good, but I don't like mustard and the sauce was super mustardy so they were only so-so to me.. We finished with the bread pudding dessert that has a creme brulee type crust.  It was okay but I'm not a huge dessert person.. I left feeling perfectly full but not stuffed and had a great night.  Service was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu.  The wine was delish!
