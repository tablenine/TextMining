Two words: bad service. The food is mediocre bar food, the drinks are reasonably priced for the area. Not considering the poor service it's a perfectly fine average place to eat or hang out. Unfortunately all three times I've been there the service was just bad. The wait staff was unattentive, just didn't seem to listen or care much for the customers. I gave it one star b/c I will try to not go back there again.
