this is where i go if i am craving for GOOD steaks, or if there's any special occasions.... i've taken couple visitors from out of town there and they all oh-so-love-it!!!. . i've tried their filet, rib-eye, veal, and they are all SO good... i can never finish them and when i heat it up using my little oven at home the next day... still VERY YUMMY!!! . . sides are the bomb too, the last visit we ordered this lobster garlic mesh potato which isn't on the menu... OMG, my friend who does NOT usually like potato kept on eating those too! it was THAT good! (well, it's about 2/3 the price of the steak though, heads-up!)... . the only thing i would complain is prob. their desert lists.... their signature warm cake isn't too appealing... everything else on the menu are just so-so.... well, i haven't really tried 'everything', but u get the point... so if you have a sweet tooth.... maybe... order their chocolate-tini!. . good wine list, STRONG martinis, awesome services, live music.... LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!
