Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
You love it or you don't.  I've loved it since I was a little kid.  Don't expect authentic Mexican tacos like you can get in a thousand other places in L.A.  Tito's is it's own thing, definitely fast food, but so tasty and good!  My favorite is the meat and cheese burrito, no beans.  It's worth the food coma you will be in for the rest of the day.
