On Social's awning it states that it's a Resto/Cafe/Bar. I didn't eat when I went this weekend so I can't tell you about the food, but I did imbibe on the bar part. They had live music there on a Sunday night and had a great time. I was most impressed with the affordable wine list that wasn't chock-full of whatever the local distributor could throw in at a low cost and mark-up a ton, and found some wines I could get into at $7-$8/glass. I'm definitely going back to try couscous night that seems to have been well received
