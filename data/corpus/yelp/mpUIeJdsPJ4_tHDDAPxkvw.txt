I love their chicken! The chicken is what I really go there for. I often find myself craving their chicken at the most random times. The sides are okay, some are better than the others but my favorite is the potato salad. Yet another item I find myself craving. I havent had the chance to partake in the brunch or breakfast but the menu sounds fantastic. . . The prices for everything is so reasonable and you gotta love the BYOB!
