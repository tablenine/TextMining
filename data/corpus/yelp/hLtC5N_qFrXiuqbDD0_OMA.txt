Ok, I know there are a lot of mixed reviews about dinner - this review is only about brunch.. . Which was friggin fantastic.. . I made a reservation and was seated right on time, right next to the cheese bar. The smell of freshly made gougeres (little cheese puffs) hit me right away, and our waiter brought me a plate of them right as they came out of the little oven right in the cheese bar. . . I ordered a bloody mary which came with freshly-shaved horseradish and fresh tomato juice. I really appreciate these types of attention to detail - these are things I would do at home. I don't appreciate paying $14 for a cocktail at brunch when my entree is less than that..but oh well. It was yummy.. . Followed up with a plate of smoked salmon benedict on a homemade English muffin. The eggs were cooked perfectly (pet peeve about overcooked poached eggs over here), the hollandaise was fresh and creamy, and the muffins were toasted just right. The side of fruit I ordered had tons of berries, asian pears, bananas and sour apples.. . My friend had the Croque Madame which had melted gruyere with a perfect crunch, and another well-cooked egg on top.. . The service was attentive but not overbearing, and it was busy (and Easter for that matter).. . I didn't have a problem finding street parking, and there is a lot next door that was free, too.
