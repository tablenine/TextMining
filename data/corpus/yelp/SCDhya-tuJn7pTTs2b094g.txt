Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
Porto's is just simply awesome!. . The potato balls, meat pies, sandwiches and cakes are the best!  That probably explains why there's always a line of 100 people in front of you when you go there.  Patience is needed once you enter the joint, but it's so worth it.. We tend to get a large box of meat pies &amp; potato balls as well as a plate of mini sandwiches for parties we throw.  People love them as they are perfect as finger food, but they also do a fine job of soaking up the alcohol.  Just be sure to order a week or so ahead of time for a large order like that.. You really can't go wrong here...just give yourself plenty of time and take a few valium before you go.
