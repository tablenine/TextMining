I live in California and took a detour on a recent trip to Manhattan to visit Shopsin's after having bought Kenny Shopsin's cookbook. My wife and I, along with our 18 month old son, stopped in on a Thursday afternoon. We waited about half an hour for a table. There were actually a couple of people in front of us, but this is what happened:. . 2 tables opened up, and one of Kenny's kids started to seat another party. There was a bit of confusion as to who was there first (there's no seating list) so Kenny cleared it up by pointing to one group, and saying "You'll seat them first" then pointing to my wife, son and I and saying "Then you'll seat this couple with their child, and everyone else can go fuck themselves." I swear that's what happened word for word.. . I had the mac n' cheese pancakes and yes, they were completely amazing. My wife had some sort of pannini that was completely out of this world. Yes, the food is good but the atmosphere is freaking awesome. Kenny took a liking to my son, and we ended up talking about kids, traveling with kids, cooking, and life in general. I found him charming, even when he called my 18 month old son an asshole. You had to be there, but it was pretty funny. This guy is a gem. I've never met anyone quite like him. Once you get past the rough exterior, I found a guy with quite a few insights on life and what I sensed was a truly warm heart. . . I love this place. I wish I lived in NY so I could become a regular customer.
