Wow! Bam! Alakazaam! . . It really was a magical night and I came on a slow night (there was still a good crowd). You start out your first magic with "Open sesame" which opens the door to the magical mansion. I love magic, and going to a place where everyone is just so excited to be there is fun. THe magicians were really funny and the shows personal (they really want you to tallk to each other at times). The shows are a hit and miss, there are some done by professionals and you will be fooled, but there are others where you can see the tricks. If you go to the dungeon, you can practice some magic tricks. . . The food is mediocre but enjoyable, don't think you're here for the food. Cocktails were strong. People show up dressed up (cocktail dresses for girls). It does get pretty pricey: the $20 cover, the food $50+, the cocktails, be sure money is is not an issue for the night. Go there with a big party or with some of your fun friends who won't say "i think i know how it's done... it's so obvious" to every single magic trick. . . it's just an awesome new activity to do. Â If you decide to go there, say hi to Irma. Now if only magic is real...... !!
