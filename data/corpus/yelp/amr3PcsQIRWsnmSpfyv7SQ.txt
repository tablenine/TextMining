Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
when i think of the weiner's circle - two things come to mind.. . 1.)  i never thought that eating something made from pig, beef and chicken intestines could ever in a million years taste like velvet.  . . guess what...the hot dog has been perfected.  the only recommendation that i can make is - get the grilled onions.  all other toppings need to stay as is.. . 2.)  i am embarrassed to be a caucasian living in the 21st century. . . why?  please visit this link for an example and pay close attention to the second half of the video.  the first half may seem like fun, but....wait for it.. . . http://www.youtube.com.... . . i absolutely adore the char dogs and the cheesy fries.  i have also had the honor and privilege of being called "boo" by the employees who provide me with a tube of manna straight from heaven. . . five stars for the food and for the employees who put up with shit that i would never be able to.
