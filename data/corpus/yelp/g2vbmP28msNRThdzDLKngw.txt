Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
The only word to describe my lunch today from Top Spice is ......boring.. . It was particularly bad or anything, definitely edible, just boring!  I ordered delivery because I was stuck at home waiting for a service call that was 2 hours late and I was tired of  pizza so I decided on Top Spice.. . I had the cashew chicken.  It was bland, no spiciness.  The Thai spring rolls tasted like the frozen ones I make at home.. . I love their mango chicken but unfortunatly I didn't see it on the lunch menu.
