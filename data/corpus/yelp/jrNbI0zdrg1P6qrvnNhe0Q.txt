Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
My favorite Thai place on the north side, period. The Crab Rangoon is DELICIOUS, the curries (especially the yellow curry) are outstanding, the stock standards like Pad Thai are always impressive (even with shrimp, which always seems to be low-quality at Thai places, but is fresh and delicious at Duck Walk). Love the bubble teas, too - they're thicker and more "milk shakey" than your average Boba. The dining room is freaking tiny, but get there on the off-hours and you've got the place to yourself. . . One note; not to sound like a Red Stater, but if you're ordering over the phone, they quite simply cannot speak/understand English. I don't think I've ever had a phone order arrive correct and intact from them; there's always either something missing or something duplicated no matter how hard I try to stress "I want TWO orders of the Yellow Curry and ONE Crab Rangoon" etc. Do your best to enunciate and keep your fingers crossed!
