It's been a while since I'd been to RIse and Dine, and I guess some things don't stay the same. The sweet potato pancakes, although larger, taste like dry cinnamon pancakes with less sweet potato in them. They didn't come with the usual cinnamon and sugar on top- I had to request it myself and she brought it on the side. . . I then inquired about the lack of Vermont Maple Syrup (tiny bottle) that accompanied an order of SweetPotato pancakes-- the lady told me that they stopped giving those with the pancakes, and you now have to pay $1.75 extra for a 1 oz bottle of syrup. Are you kidding me???. . $1.75+ the price of the cakes-- almost $7/$8 for two dry pancakes?! . . Ordered the egg and Kielbasa on the side. Egg was fine, sausage was raw. What did me in was the rosemary that I found atop my pancakes. They didn't put cinnamon and sugar but they managed to get ROSEMARY sprinkled on my pancakes?! I think I'll wake up earlier and head to Highland Bakery instead of settling for Rise and Dine bc it's close to school.
