I'll give it 4, but we're really talking 3.5 here.  Letizia's and I have an up and down relationship.  She teases me with her goodness, but always somehow leaves me feeling slightly empty.. . The bakeables are generally great, sometimes too rich, and my friend once bought a blueberry muffin that contained exactly zero blueberries, but i'll give letizia's the benefit of a doubt and assume that was a fluke.  The chocolate chip cookie i had the other day was so loaded with chocolate chips i had to pick some off the top and throw them in the empty Clearly Canadian bottle that was sitting in the cup holder of my car.  I purchased a fantasticly fresh tasting hot apple cider with said cookie and was thoroughly enjoying it until i managed to spill it all over the floor of said car while trying to navigate the shit show that is the parking lot of Whole Foods on a Saturday afternoon.  . . Damn do i miss that cider, but one of the great things about Letizia's is that it's open till 11pm Sun-Wed, so I think i'm going to go retry the cider experiment and perhaps this time i'll be able to enjoy the whole thing as i suggest you do.. . The one problem I seem to encounter every time I go here is the general disinterest of the staff.  Nobody is ever talkative or seems like they're in any sort of hurry to serve their customers.  I've waited 10 minutes to be helped when there were 3 people working and only 1 other person in line.
