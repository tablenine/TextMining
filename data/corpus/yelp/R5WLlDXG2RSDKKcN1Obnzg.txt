Att: R.S., AKA Ruth,. . We don't always get it right, but we try. Like we did with you. Offered you multiple times to correct whatever issue with us you might have had, but for some reason, it was never good enough. Our employees work hard. College students mind the phones and don't need to be yelled at and called B***ches. Yes, this is Justin. You are in fact upset because we will no longer deliver to you just to have you calls us back to complain and ask for something free in return. You make all these remarks about how horrible we are, but you still try to call for a delivery. We must have good food. I got off the phone with you, and no more than twenty minutes later you made a post, not because we don't have good food or service, but because we have the right too refuse service, and we chose to express our right with you. Thankfully you can now go bother someone else and try and scam something from them. Good bye Ruth!
