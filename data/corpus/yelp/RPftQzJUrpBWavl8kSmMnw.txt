Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
What The Apple Pan lacks in ambiance it makes up with taste.  A combination (ham and cheese, without lettuce for me! ) tastes great with lots of yellow mustard, extra pickles (both sweet and classic) and fries.  The server caters to me, always pouring me extra ketchup and handing me napkins.  Sometimes I order dessert.  . . Come prepared with cash as The Apple Pan is "cash only."  The food is affordable and high quality.  I hear the burgers are excellent.  The coffee comes in fancy green cups.  The seating is a lunch counter.  Sometimes there is a wait.  I have never been inconvenienced as I always dine at The Apple Pan alone.  I just squeeze on in.
