"Dude, what the heck.". That's how I felt walking out of Philippe's. I felt let down and misled by my fellow yelpers. sigh.. . I had a Groupon for a $10 gift cert I bought for $5 in hand, waiting to try out some supposedly GOOD French Dip from this oh so famous Philippe guy. The bf and I each got a Beef Dip, he added swiss while I added jack cheese, plus an order of potato salad. The little old lady behind the counter quickly prepared our meals and within minutes we had our sandwiches and small refreshments on our trays.. . We both were kind of confused, thinking French Dip sandwiches would be served with a side of au jus, but these sandwiches are pre-dipped.. and I soon learned you can get your sammies double dipped or wet. Where the heck were those options when I was looking at the menu?? We couldn't even tell which sandwich was which, and they both tasted the same anyway. Honestly it's a pet peeve when an order of food comes out damn near room temperature. The cheese wasn't even melted and the beef wasn't anything special. It might've tasted better if the food was actually HOT.. Our potato salad looked really mushy and kind of barf-like but actually tasted good, probably the highlight of the meal.. . If it wasn't for my groupon, I probably would've been more pissed about spending an extra $5 for such mediocre food. and honestly, since you're in freakin Chinatown, you can get way better take out for the price, or even less! as I did around the corner moments later.. . 2.5 stars. OVERRATED.
