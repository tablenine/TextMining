Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
This is one of my favorite spots in LA. It is to me another Los Angeles landmark. With a huge selection of sandwiches, salads and deli specialties, you can find something for everyone at Canter's They make some decent breakfast dishes, but I always get a sandwich, it is hard to resist. If you are in a hurry, call ahead and pick up something from the deli counter. Wanna just grab something sweet, check out the bakery counter and take something home. If you are coming here for some late night dining, you may even want to pop into the Kibbitz Room next door for a drink and some live local music. Overall, this is my go to place when I want a good sandwich or simply when I cannot figure out what I want to eat!
