Back in the day, the roommates and I went here in the middle of the night...  that says something about the food. We wouldn't drive from Fullerton to LA at midnight just for hype.  Don't know why the la locals are so bitter toward this place, that's locals for ya. haha . . I wish it wasn't so far from Orange County!
