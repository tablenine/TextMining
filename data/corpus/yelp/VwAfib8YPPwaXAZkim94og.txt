Definitely the yummiest vegeterian meal iI've ever had! It's a cute casual place where you know you're going to get food that's good for you. Took two guy friends and they're both real meat burger kind of guys so they felt "empty" afterwards, but I still thought the portions were extremely generous. . . A better girls sunday lunch or dinner place; would definitely recommend.
