After reading the most current reviews on Yelp, I definitely walked into Adobo Grill with preconceived notions.  Actually, I figured that I could write my review before even tasting the food -- "Guac and margaritas were great.  Food was so-so."  That seems to be Adobo's undeserving reputation.. . Fortunately, Adobo far exceeded my expectations.  Sure, the guacamole was as good as advertised.  Not only are the ingredients themselves fresh, but the tortilla chips are apparently prepared fresh every morning and are served warm at the table.  Probably worth the trip alone.. . But our entrees were equally tasty.  We ordered the Enchiladas de Vegetal (and I'm not a vegetarian) and they were AWESOME!  For butternut squash fans, this is the ultimate enchilada.  We also tried the Adobo Chopped Salad -- pretty solid.  It's no Wildfire Chopped Salad (what really is?), but it was a nice lighter option to balance out the the enchiladas.  . . Beyond the food, our server Alfonso was amazing, and the atmosphere was fun and lively.  I'll definitely be returning to Adobo...and without the preconceived notion that I'm only in for a night of guac and margaritas.
