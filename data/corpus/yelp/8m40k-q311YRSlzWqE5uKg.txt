Okay so I know I have a really bad habit of just rating stuff I love but Alcove deserves all 5 stars plus more if it was possible! the food is always amazing.  I've had pretty much everything on the menu including omelettes, panini's, soups, salads, drinks, &amp; sweets. Everything I've had is amazing &amp; comes in large portions.  The price is so-so but for the quality, taste, &amp; wonderful service, it's definitely worth it.  I would especially recommend the steak sandwich which comes with sweet potato fires &amp; portobello mushrooms and the grilled salmon salad.  They can also put a dash of strawberry syrup into your lemonade too which is delicious!
