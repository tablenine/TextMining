This place is crazy! I went here for my birthday almost 2 years ago and I still haven't forgotten how much fun I had that night! The food is not that great, but the experience is really fun. What I remember the most is the barrels of beer and nonstop sake coming to our table. The entertainment is corny, but it's really fun if you're there to have a good time. Â would recommend to have a designated driver or get a nearby hotel room because you will definitely leave drunk! Great for big groups and celebrations. One of my most memorable birthday so far.
