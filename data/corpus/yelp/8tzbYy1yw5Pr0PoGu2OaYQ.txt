simply the best. there is no equal in los angeles. i've been to 'em all and no place even comes close to Gen. freshest fish in town.. . -deluxe sashimi platter for nights when you don't want to cough up $60/pop on sushi. good enough for 2 people to get their fill. comes w/ toro! i hear the lunch specials are awesome as well.. . -always get the yellowtail, halibut, toro, uni, scallop, mushroom miso, and whatever kind of cheek they have that evening.
