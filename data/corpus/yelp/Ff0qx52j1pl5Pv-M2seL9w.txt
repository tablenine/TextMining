Sitting in the sun on a beautiful morning with the lovely Mimi C. at their tables was awesome.. . Diner, friendly dogs, good food - excellent.. . Try their New Amsterdam with Grey Poupon.  . . Their buns are a little too bready, but hey...  other places in Los Feliz are like this.  I blame the bakery mafia.
