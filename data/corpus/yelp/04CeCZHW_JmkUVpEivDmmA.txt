Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Look everyone knows the dumplings here are good.  My only issue is that they could be soupy-er... I need these things to practically pop when I bite into them, spraying my face with scalding hot delicious broth overflowing the plastic asian soup spoon.  . . That out of the way, let's focus on something more significant (at least to me).... . Din Tai Fung is all about choices... and we're not JUST talking about choosing between juicy pork or crab pork, boiled or pan fried... you have to make a choice even before you walk through the door. I'm talking about old or new... or as I like to say fobby or not-so-fobby. . . Din Tai Fung is actually two semi-adjacent restaurants in the same strip-mall! There's the old side which is your basic 80s era tile floor rectangular room nondescript Asian restaurant... or the new super swank Chinese movin' on up late 2000s side. For me this presents a tremendously complicated dilemma: a lover of all things fobby... I generally feel the best Asian foods are found in the most utilitarian of establishments. Additionally, I take a long hard look at the clientele... if they are the namesake people of the establishment's food style... I know I have a good place. . . What makes DTF tough for me is this. The fobby side hits every mark for me: bare bones atmosphere, mostly Chinese people, but the downside is a HUGE long line. The non-fobby side is less crowded, more diverse crowd, but a REALLY REALLY nice atmosphere that despite my pretensions about nice places, my inner-whiteness takes over and it attracts me like brass to a doorknob. . . The dilemma always resolves itself the same way: under tremendous personal guilt I always attend the non-fobby side where you get the same food, with virtually no wait, in a very cool atmosphere. Hey... we all have vices.
