Wow, what a find. I was down in LA for a business trip and was meeting up with a friend near downtown LA. We decided to meet up in Little Tokyo and I used Yelp to find a place near the Japanese Plaza Mall. We get there around 6:30 and there's already a list going. We actually walk outside to catch up and within a couple minutes, they called our name to sit at the bar! Much faster than I expected.. . Didn't really read the reviews on Yelp, as I was accessing it on my phone, but I noticed that they highlighted the ramen. Totally reminded me of the ramen that I get up North called Santa Ramen. . . Doesn't have the stewed pork that Santa Ramen does, but the broth is just as tasty! We also ordered the Teriyaki chicken sampler and I ordered the ramen with a combo with a small teriyaki eel bowl. I thought that they would give me a smaller bowl of ramen since I got the combo, but nope...the bowl was just as big. SO MUCH FOOD! I ate everything and had some Asahi and had to run to the airport right after the meal. It was all great, but I don't think I was able to enjoy it as much because I rushed through the meal to get to the airport. It's definitely a place I want to come back to next time I'm in LA; I'll just make sure I order less and take my time eating. :)
