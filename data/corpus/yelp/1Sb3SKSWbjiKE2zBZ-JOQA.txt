Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
How you receive Father's Office entirely depends on your perception before you arrive.  Father's Office is more of a bar that happens to serve food as well and this point is made obvious by the many taps and bottles behind the counter when you walk inside, not to mention the I.D. check at the door.  I came expecting to meet a few friends for dinner, but found that would become a problem given that the place was completely packed.  Since there was a slight drizzle, there were a few unused tables at the far end of the bar where there was no overhang, but the staff had decided not to allow anyone to use that area.  When everyone arrived, we contemplated going somewhere else to eat.. . Through pure luck, a group left a table that we were able to grab to have a place to eat.  As for the actual food, I would give the burger 4 stars.  Yes, it's good, but whether its size and taste merits 12 dollars is up to your palate and wallet.  Their fries are good, but having tried sweet potato fries at other restaurants before, I believe they are a little overrated and just simply good without anything special (if you have never tried sweet potato fries, however, by all means, give them a shot).  I DID discover and enjoy a new beer, although this too was on the pricier side of brewed beverages.  I recognize part of the price comes with the allure of F.O., but given a choice, I would probably eat elsewhere then come for to try some new beers to avoid the hassle of trying to score a table.
