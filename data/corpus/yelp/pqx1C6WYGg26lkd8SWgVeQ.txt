Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Joan's On Third is a sweatheart of a place. More than decent food, very nice people, and it does feel extra pleasant inside.. . What I like: Their pastries are fantastic.. . What Grinds My Gears: Go ahead, order a salad... before it comes they serve you water in a tall glass, things are looking nice. Then they serve you your salad. The salad comes on such a nice looking plate but whats weird is the salad is separated by this plate with none other than a white paper plate. Why? That's what grinds my gears.
