Restaurant: Birds Rotisserie Chicken Cafe &amp; Bar
Category: American (New)
Probably my favorite place right of the Franklin strip (Franklin Ave between Gower and Western).  I usually go for drinks, and sometimes I will also eat there.  The menu is rotisserie chicken oriented (its called Birds).  The chicken itself is pretty good but there are wraps, salads and sandwiches as well.  The side dishes are what steal the show.  Drinks and food are both moderately priced.  They make a damn good bloody mary.  Fun place for happy hour. . There is a nice patio out front facing the Tom Cruise Scientology Mansion, and inside the atmosphere is homey and quaint.  In terms of a hangout the scene is usually pretty hip-trendy and is more of your local actors/writers/musicians types.  Usually good people but at times can be a bro-fest.  Thursday night is usually fun.. . Street Parking can be a bitch although there is usually valet.
