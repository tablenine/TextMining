BRING GUM OR MINTS WITH YOU! =P. . I recently went to The Stinking Rose after not dining there for a good while (over a year or two) and it was better than I remembered it to be. We were seated in the Garlic Lovers Lane area that was pretty romantic and designed for just a party of two. It was cute. . . You MUST order the sizzling mussels when you go. The garlic sauce it comes with is amazing. It smells so good and tastes even better. I wanted to get the shrimp with it too but it would've made me and my bf full before even getting our meal. We both ordered the spare ribs with creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes. The spare ribs didn't even need a knife. It was extremely flavorful, soft and tender. I barely touched the spinach and mashed potatoes because I wanted to eat as much of the meat before getting full. We topped our meal with garlic ice cream. Yum! I have to say it's a hate it or love it kind of thing. I love it. You really taste the garlic after you take the initial bites because the taste lingers in your tongue. Mixed with the chocolate syrup they put on top and perfecto! A great way to end the meal at The Stinking Rose. =)
