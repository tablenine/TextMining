I've been here twice; one of which resulted in my entire party (3 people plus myself) with digestive issues following our meal. Sure, the food is tasty going in, but not so much when it comes rushing out the other end a few hours later. I'd still go back, but I would be extremely wary and probably bring some Pepto-Bismol with me.. . On my first visit I went through the line 3 times-- and neglected to put the colored stick in my food to indicate it should be cooked in a separate pan (rather than on the massive hibachi station with 10-12 other dishes). First I had to pick a bit of chicken out of my (meat-free) food, then some beef was floating in there. Even when I had meat, I still found a green pepper (my MOST hated vegetable) in my bowl. So, regardless of your dietary needs or preferences-- if you just don't enjoy getting "samples" of other random diners' meals, put in the damn stick!. . It's also frustrating as hell when you're starving and waiting in line behind some slow-poke who feels the need to fill their bowl with rice one damn grain at a time.. . Assuming you don't leave Chow Baby wanting to vomit or spontaneously expel your bowels, the food actually is pretty good. Especially considering it's more or less a glorified buffet. Tip: The first time I went, I "suicided" the sauces and it came out tasting like sludge. After that, I stuck to no more than 2 sauces at a time-- personally I love to mix the coconut curry sauce with thai cilantro.
