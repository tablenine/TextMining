i'm not exactly BIG on fried chicken...but i'm such a FAN when it comes to ROSCOE's fried chicken breast with a sweet piece of waffle. that's my fave - the Carol C. specia: 1 piece of succulent chicken breast &amp; 1 large waffle...the perfect size for a mini-mouth eater like me! i am proud to say i ate 3/4 of my plate than my average 1/2 plate!! my MAMA would be proud! . . i loved the mac'n cheese as well. gravy mixed with rice is also one of my personal fave's! it's worth the wait!! this location is near a starbucks where we killed about a half hour of our wait drinking a late morning cup of joe &amp; time to read the paper!
