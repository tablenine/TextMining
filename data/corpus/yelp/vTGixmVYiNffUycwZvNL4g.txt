Two stars for the happy hour prices and terrific beer selection, but don't waste your time with this place. Two of my top reasons: . . (1)  Parking at the Paseo structure is godawful. It's like the Glendale Galleria on Christmas Eve every friggin' time I go. I literally just shuddered thinking of it. Park on a side-street if you're able. . . (2) The Yardhouse is a whorehouse of B.S. corporate policies. For starters, they scan all out-of-state IDs. But here's the kicker - their scanner doesn't seem to work. When I had just moved back to California from Ohio at the age of 25, I finished a rough day at a new job and was looking forward to a beer. My friend visiting from the East Coast and I went to the Yardhouse, sat down, and ordered drinks. Our waitress borrowed our IDs for scanning, and the manager came back to return them with a nasty glare, and told us our IDs were no good.  I asked her to please go ahead and call the police if she felt they were fake, so we could get our drinks.  No dice.  And I still had to pay for my already-served mozzarella sticks, which I washed down with water. I'm still pissed. . . If you do go, minimize your wait-time by using call-ahead seating. Sometimes they'll let you place your name on the wait-list when you phone in, sometimes they won't. Key is to tell them you're actually on your way (whether you are or not). Otherwise you'll often get stuck waiting right through happy hour, and I'll argue this place is not worth its standard menu prices.
