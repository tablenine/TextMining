My review is short and sweet:. . The happy hour drink prices were great. The drinks, minus the margarita, nothing too amazing, though their pisco sour was pretty close to the mark.. . The food itself was only OK, certainly not worth the price paid. The Carnitas were very dry, the mahi mahi was alright.. . What gets it low stars is the service. I went on a night it wasn't very crowded and the service from the door to the check was really bad. I even heard one table behind me cancel their postre because the server took so long, they then had to leave.
