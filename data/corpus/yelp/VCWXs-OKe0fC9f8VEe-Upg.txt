i had lunch here and was extremely disappointed overall. the waiter was quick to the table and filled our glasses with water with nearly all the ice melted away. i asked for a lime and more ice--never came. Â the waiter hovered over us like a blood-sucking mosquito and pressured us to order despite the fact there were only 10 other patrons.. . the flavor of all the food was somehow off...still can't really put my finger on it, but it was bad enough to make me steer clear forever.
