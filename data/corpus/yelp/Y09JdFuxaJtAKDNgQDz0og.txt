A very solid 3 stars.  . . Super sexy date spot!  Too bad I was dining with a co-worker...Oh well, there is always next time.. . At any rate, we shared some nigiri and maki.  The presentations were simple and not overly creative like some other sushi spots.  Maybe it's just me, but when I eat nigiri, I like it to be served cold.  Room temp raw fish scares me a bit. . . I had an exciting personal sushi discovery--the salmon skin maki tasted like bacon.  Who knew?!  . . After 3 pieces of nigiri, 3 maki, and one adult beverage, the damage was only $40.  Not bad.
