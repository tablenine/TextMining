Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
My first Umami experience did not live up to the hype.  Umami is walking the fine line between being expensive and overpriced.  I had the signature burger and thin fries.   The burger was good but certainly not a game changer.  The meat itself was nicely cooked with a little pink left in the center.  Unfortunately it could have been helped by being allowed to rest another minute or two before being plated because the bottom bun was soaked through with blood before I even bit into the burger.  Not a huge deal but it cause the bun to get a little too soggy too fast.  The charred tomato was a nice touch but the Parmesan crisp was a little more on the chewy side then the crisp side.  . The fries were good.  They reminded me of the skinny fries at Fatburger which isn't that bad of a thing.  The house made ketchup on the other hand tasted more like marinara sauce then ketchup.  There is none of the vinegar twang or sweetness that should be in ketchup.  It pretty much tastes like canned tomatoes that have been pureed without adding much else.  If you can't do it at least as good as Heinz then don't bother.  . With that said I'm sure I'll give them at least one more try, probably at the Los Feliz location closer to where I live.  I don't think I got the absolute best example of the burger they make so maybe it will be something more special the next time.
