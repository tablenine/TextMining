Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I like to consider myself a sandwich connoisseur...I like gross and greasy to grown up and gourmet.  This place has the right combo of both and it's a pretty good value for what you get.  My first visit I had a salmon sandwich with bacon, asaparagus and gouda.  YUM.  (I don't remember the real "name").   Although the bread I chose made it a little messy.  I've also tried the Salmon Burger...excellent.  Served with a yummy chipotle sauce, I could've drank the stuff.  The sides are always great and somewhat creative as well.  . . The only problem is that there are too many damn choices.  Although I have found a system.  First, pick a meat.  Next, choose your accoutrements by weeding out what you don't like.  Voila...you have your choice.  After my first miss with the bread choice, I've learned to take some advice from the server and it's working so far.  My goal when it opened initially was to go there once a week and get thru half the menu in a year.  I'm not getting too far...but hopefully soon.
