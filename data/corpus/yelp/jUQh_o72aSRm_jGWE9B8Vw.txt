This place is clearly amazing. My fiance and I were looking on Yelp to try and find a new and good restaurant in our area, and this one was so highly rated, we wanted to check it out. . . First of all, the service was great. They give you bread to start, and we did not have to wait very long for our food. We got to meet the chef, and he often came out to check and see how we liked everything. We liked supporting a small business.. . Even more importantly than the service, the food was wonderful. We started out eating those almond figs wrapped in bacon, and I almost died they were so good. Then, we ate the crab cake with this really great hot pepper sauce. For our main dish, we split the grouper in red sauce with oysters, and there was more than enough for the two of us. To finish off, we split the bread pudding, which is my new favorite dessert ever. They put heavy cream on top and the whole thing just melts in your mouth. We will definitely be back!
