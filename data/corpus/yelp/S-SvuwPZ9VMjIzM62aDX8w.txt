I've been here twice, both on nights when they had a deals going. . . First time was the buy one, get one pizza night. . . Pizzas were good. Not great, but not bad. If you're hungry you can finish the whole thing off. If not, you can take some home. Works for me. . . Second night was 1/2 priced bottles of wine night. Got the pizza again because I was too lazy to look into the other menus. Left feeling wine drunk and full, but not stuffed. . . Overall, it was a good experience, and I'll probably go back. It's a good place for the weeknights, catching up with a friend or ditching out on cooking. I wouldn't necessarily go there for a date, but it's good for a girls night out or a casul week night dinner.
