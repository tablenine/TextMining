The gyro plate was very good.  It isn't like the chain places where the meat is spinning around for hours or days before you get to it.  The lamb was perfectly seasoned and juicy and absolutely divine.  There was too much meat for the bread, which gave you some extra to eat separately.  It is a huge amount of food and I was stuffed by the end.  Everything is brought in from Greece and you can really taste it.  And they have a great section of things you can buy which all looked very good.
