Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I used to come here often when it opened a few years ago and it was good. Food was tasty, service fast, and the place was clean. I went back recently and had the chicken with basil and garlic.  The chicken was sliced too thick that it was chewy and unflavorable.  It was the worse Thai dish I've ever had. The service felt rush and the servers were less friendly.  The place still very clean.
