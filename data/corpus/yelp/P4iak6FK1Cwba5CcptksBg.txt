This is a good place. I found that the turkey burger was simply amazing and super tasty. Great selection of toppings, too, but I didn't like that many of the good ones cost extra. Garlic aioli wasn't extra, but it also wasn't as garlicky as I'd have liked it.. . The burgers may seem pricey, but I'd say they're worth it. Yum.. . I'll definitely come here again.
