alright, fellow yelpers please don't stone me, but I don't come here for their biscuits. I don't even eat them when they come with my meal. Yes, they are fluffy; yes, they are buttery; yes, they are huge, but they are also dry and maybe too big and too thick. . . To redeem myself, can I say that I love their cranberry apple butter, and sometimes I may pick at my biscuit and eat the innards... just a little bit. Â . . I love the high flyer meal w/ their yummy pancakes and warm peach compote. I always get extra on the side. Their sausage is to dye for (as in tye-dye, not good enough to actually die). . . Their shrimp and grits are a favorite amongst my friends. I, however, do not enjoy their creamy, dreamy grits. I think they must make them with buttermilk (b/c they have a sour taste that could only come from buttermilk). all my friends love them though. . . The fried egg salad is great as well as the moon dusted potatoes with rosemary. . . Now, if it wasn't so dang busy every time i went!!!
