Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
I loved Little Door!  We went there for our anniversary and I called ahead to request very romantic blue room!  Paul loved what he ordered, it was steak and he talked about it for several days after we ate there.  I didn't try the steak but I tried the potatoes that came with it and they were SO GOOD!  There were not a ton of vegetarian options but I got the couscous which came with a few different spices/toppings and assorted root vegetable...i loved it!  It was delicious....plus the bread that they give you is to die for!  It is pricey but worth it!  We had so much fun!  Plus, the blue room is so romantic....it was just a wonderfully delightful experience.  We street parked just a few blocks down the road.  Just a heads up, the restaurant is easy to miss the sign is almost non existent.
