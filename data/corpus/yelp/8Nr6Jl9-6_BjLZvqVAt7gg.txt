ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS HAPPY HOUR!!!! The prices are decent. I LOVE the Sliders especially the ones that come with the bernaise sauce (OMG, if i can learn how to make this sauce) also the chicken nachos are good. My ex used to get the steak and shrimp plate.. OMG I have never seen shrimp so big that they come on an onion skewer. Also the ciders (pear, peach, and raspberry) are very good and tasty.
