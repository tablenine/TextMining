we saw this place on man v. food so my gf and i had to check it out. . . the lines here are nuts but i didnt mind. there are about a dozen registers with about a dozen customers in each line at any given moment. im not one for patience but didnt really mind waiting. the anticipation made my food even better.. . couldnt pick between the beef dip or the lamb dip sandwich. so i got both... im a fatty. my gf got a beef. we got the slaw and a pickle. everything is a la carte.. . the super spicy mustard sets the sandwich off. we even bought a jar of mustard to go.. . i will be coming back speratically. when im craving a great homestyle sandwich and when im in the neighborhood.
