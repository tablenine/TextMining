I went here on the way to a blues club. . . The pastrami sandwich was fantastic, piled high, juicy and tender.  I love me a good pastrami sandwich, this place delivered that. . . The other items I got were just normal diner fare, the only thing that sticks out to me is the pastrami.  4 stars just for that.
