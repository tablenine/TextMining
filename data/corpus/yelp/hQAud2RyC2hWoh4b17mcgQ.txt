Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I had the umami burger with hand cut fries. . . I really wasn't impressed, the quality of the meat was good, the fries were nothing special. I was really disappointed in the overall burger. There just wasn't anything special about it, it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go there again. Â . . and the service was awful!
