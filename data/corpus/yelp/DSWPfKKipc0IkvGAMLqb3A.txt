I've been twice and enjoyed myself both times. I like the bar area, it's different...great to have a cocktail before dinner. The food was fabulous!! Service was great. the atmosphere....appears a little 'cold' not very comfy or warm feeling...I think that's the only downfall (personal opinion). I think it's an unexpected little treasure and I will be back. I think it's a great place to bring an out of town guest.. Cheers.
