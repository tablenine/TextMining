I braved the storm to eat here with my cool pal Eric (and new Yelp member as of this past half hour-- yay, peer pressure works again!). . I had the challah french toast with peach and blueberry compote. It was aiight, but I felt like the compote might be of the mass-manufactured cheap store-bought brand. I really hope not. It tasted good so whatever though right? I had the sausage links too but you should pass on these cuz they were really disgusting. I almost sent them back and I never send back food. . . My friend had the breakfast croissant with a side of oatmeal and apple-butter garnished pancakes and fruit in place of the homefries. I much preferred what he ordered. The oatmeal was totally Chuck Bass.. . Yeah, that's right. I'm using the term Chuck Bass in place of "badass", "money", "pimpjuice", "bomb diggity", "fly", "superfly", "fuck yeah", and "booyakasha****".. . Cuz Chuck Bass is THE MAN.. . ****Eric's 2 cents on this review
