I wanna dip my (potato) balls in it!. . I've never even been to Porto's... and I know it's the bomb. Whenever we have a co-worker's birthday, we pick up Porto's cakes. I am ashamed to say that even if I don't know the birthday boy/girl, I'm so happy they've aged another year so that I can stuff myself with Porto's. Yes, I'm a heartless fatty. I am also a fan of those potato balls. Gotta love those balls!. . Tips: They make party platters!
