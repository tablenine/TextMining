Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
2.5 stars. . meh, i don't know what the big deal about this place is.  i've had way better dumplings at other restaurants and this place is definitely no comparison to DTF in Taiwan.  . . i think it's dumb how there are NO prices on the menu.  i like that the plates are kind of smaller- it encourages variety BUT it's RIDICULOUS when these plates are like $9 each!  noodles for $9 and it won't even fill up 1 person.  what the heck.. . anyway.  they are clean though.  and i guess it would be ok to take people who think panda express is REAL chinese food.  :) although, i've taken a couple of people like that here, and they absolutely abhorred it.
