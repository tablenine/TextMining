I came here on Valentine's Day this year, and the sight was breathtaking. It was delightful to eat dinner while watching the sunset with my valentine by my side. Romantic indeed. . . The menu, however, was already set and there was not a lot of variety to it. Not to mention that since it was Valentine's day, many people were ordering the same thing, so I guess all the food were just haphazardly assembled and cooked. It wasn't that special, but like I said, the view was great.
