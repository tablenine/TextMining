Another place that I need to go to more often!  Seriously the last time I was here was at the 02 Decatur Beer Festival and I was wasted and somehow managed to buy some fish and chips.  My friends found me sitting in the middle of the street eating my food off of myself since I spilled it all over me!  Embarrassing!. . Anyway, jump back to 08...came here last night with Leslie, Anthony, Kaitlin and every ones favorite Tulie (long pause) Le!  It was packed but we were instantly seated!  The beer list is amazing!  My favorite beers are Belgian Beers and they have a bunch of them on tap.  The Belgian White...I believe they called it the Kira and the Drakkan Guuld were fantastic.  I love the menu since there are so many good choices to choose from.  Of course, how can you steer away from their fish and chips!?  I also got a side of their pretzels and ordered the strawberry cheesecake for dessert.  All this for a mere $25...whoa I felt like I was a bit like Rachel Ray there with the whole eat for a day for less than $40 bucks.
