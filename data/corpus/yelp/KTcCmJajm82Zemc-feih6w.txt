hmm where to start..first of all... my mouth is still burning from the spicyness of the food and i love it!!!  get the fries with the spiciest seasoning, its worth it!. sweet potato fries in the end help with the burning.. . i had the fried shrimp plate... it was gooood... the crab and other stuff was a little overpriced for me...  maybe next time when i feel like spending a lot of money... Ill go here again anyday!
