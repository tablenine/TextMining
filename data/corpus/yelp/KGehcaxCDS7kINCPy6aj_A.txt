Restaurant: Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s Red Hot Stand
Category: Fast Food
Want to know one of the many reasons why I'm cooler than you?. . I've used the employee bathroom at Gene's &amp; Jude's.*  That's right...... I have people that know people!  Now how many of you can say the same?. . (The bathroom was surprisingly clean, though my memory is slightly hazy since I was drunk at the time said usage occurred.). . I used to eat here almost every single day while I was in high school, (and for several years thereafter) so I can say with absolute authority that this is the best hotdog in the Chicagoland area HANDS-DOWN.  They do not mess around here, as clearly evidenced by the total dearth of ketchup on the premises.  (If you want ketchup 'for your fries' [sure you do], you can go next door to McDonald's where they will charge you 25 cents a packet.). . Have I mentioned that the fresh-cut fries are gloriously greasy and sublimely delicious?  And that the tamales would make the Tamale Guy weep with shame?. . Truly an institution.  If you've never been here you're missing out.. . *Please note that the sign says 'Gene's and Jude's', NOT 'Gene and Jude's'.  Even though the latter is easier to say.
