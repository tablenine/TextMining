Restaurant: Fortune Cookie Restaurant
Category: Chinese
The Fortune Cookie presents consistently high-quality, affordable Chinese food, at a convenient location in Loehmann's Plaza at North Druid Hills and Briarcliff Road in DeKalb County.  Restaurant interior is well-kept and service is attentive and gracious.  Lunches are especially reasonable and served quickly.. . Also, big thumbs up for the "dinner meal for two" offered in three courses for about $25.00, which Ms. D and I split tonight.  She wouldn't stop raving about the sizzling rice soup.  Try it!
