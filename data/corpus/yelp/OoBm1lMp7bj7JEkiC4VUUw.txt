Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This may be blasphemy, but I still think this is the best ramen in all of Los Angeles. I've tried every ramen place on Sawtelle, I've been to Mitsuya and about half of the places downtown, but Orochon is still my number 1.. . I don't look for authentic, I look for delicious. I love spiciness, and Orochon adds spiciness to their ramen, which I can't find anywhere else. There are tons of more authentic ramen shops out there, but none that make my mouth water like Orochon's.. . I always go for the #4 soy, always with the extra noodles, and always with a slice of melt-in-your-mouth chashu. Coupled with a couple of friends (including the obligatory special #2 victim), it's a great experience.. . Seating is low and service can be rushed sometimes, but the food is worth it.
