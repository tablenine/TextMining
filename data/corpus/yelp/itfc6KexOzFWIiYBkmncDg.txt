Used to be a regular lunch spot, since I had a friend living at Park La Brea...he'd get there early, save us a table/put us on the list, and we'd be good to go.... . I suggest going when the weather is nice enough to sit outside (as it usually is in LA), cause inside it is stuffy...and if you're special (or think you're special...) enough to get the couches in the back...you're a sucker. . . That's where all the flies that are trapped in the damn restaurant hang out.. . -2 stars for flies (if you're sitting in the back, on the couch).
