Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
My gal pals and I decided to eat an early dinner at Milk after seeing a long matinee opera.  We were all starving when we got there!. . I ordered the special for the day which was a shrimp ceviche with avocados and mixed greens in a rice cracker bowl dressed with passion fruit/lime dressing.  First off, the presentation was amazing! You can see for yourself with the picture I uploaded. :) The taste was divine....who would have thought to mix all these things together?!  I just wish this was on their regular menu.  My gal pals got the panini sandwiches which they all seemed to enjoy.. . After the main meal, we all shared some of their famous ice cream sandwiches.  The grasshopper is the best...ice cream placed between two flat macroons...a moment of heaven on earth to say the least.  The homemade cookies (especially the molasses) were also yummy!  . . Overall a great place for a bite to eat...I would definitely come back to try more things!  Next on my list is the blue velvet cake...never seen anything so incredibly blue!
