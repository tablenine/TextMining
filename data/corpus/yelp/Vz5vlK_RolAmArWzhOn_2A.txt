I like the Yardhouse.   I love the beer and beer choices and I love going on gameday afternoons.  I do not like, however, going when there as a nice quiet evening dinner.  And one should know better than to go to a sports bar type place for such.  . . Customer service goes from really, really, good to downright shitty.  Everything from getting a great server who gets you everything you need and more to a server who forgets you exist then gets a pissy attitude when you have to ask another server for an order and refills and everything else a server should do to SERVE you.  . . Overall, I will keep going back though I will try to avoid particular servers.  I won't mention any names.....this time.
