so a couple of friends and i came here for dinner and it was my first time!  I was excited...I ordered the pulled pork combo, which came with fries and a huge drink.  my friend ordered the pastrami sandwich.  both looked like a huge chunk of meat slabbed in between two buns...i just realized that sounded kinda dirty, haha.  anyhow, the fries were yummy and so was the chipotle ketchup and aioli sauce.  i thought the pulled pork sandwich was good, but not the best sandwich i've ever had...it was ok...not to die for.  i'm sure others would disagree.  But I was hungry, and if i thought it was just ok when i was hungry, it must be just ok...
