Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
I tried Taste after initially cancelling my brunch reservation due to last minute schedule changes. FYI, for large parties they do charge you a fee for cancellations within 24hrs of the reservation, luckily I was informed this when I called and they requested my credit card for a brunch reservation. . . Anyway, took my out of town guests to Taste last Sunday, parking was a plenty. We parked on the cross street, not a long walk at all. The restaurant was small, but on the cozy side and definitely cute. The only thing is that we ended up sitting inside which was a tad dark, which was unexpected for a 2pm meal, but we quickly were accustomed to it. We immediately ordered a pitcher of mimosa, bloody mary, and beer. Gotta say, the mimosa was yummy! But I've yet to find one that's failed me completely. However, the consensus for the group was that the bloody mary was absolutely PERFECT! We had a total of 3 for the party during that meal, yes we enjoy the beverages with brunch, enough said. . . For the meal, here are the thoughts:. . Brioche french toast - yummy, portions are not gigantic, but are comfortably filling. It was ordered w/ nutella and toasted almonds. Not necessarily to die for though.. . Crab Benedict Â (w/ hollandaise on the side - my pref) - the crab cakes were quite sizable and delish (not to dry and definitely plenty of tender crab meat and not filler), eggs were perfect and I prefer the brioche slices the entire concoction was sitting on rather than the typical english muffin. Much much better. Definitely worth the price, and very filling. Good choice for me. . . No room for dessert, maybe next time.. . Con: since the place is so tiny, there is one bathroom, which is nice, clean and cute, but TINY!
