Wow that was tasty. Great place to catch up with a friend Friday during lunch with no wait (unlike weekends) and phenomenal tacos. Wow.. . Got the guac free (very tasty, a little too much lime but one of the best i've had) because our order was late, so i'm not complaining.. . Will definitely be back here.
