While in LA yesterday we were taken to Fred's for dinner.  They had a huge menu and our local buddy said that pretty much everything he's had has been good.  I got the Juicy Lucy Burger and was pretty satisfied.  It was huge, so after that and the fries, I was stuffed.  Pretty much your basic burger &amp; fries.  Nothing special, but good.  One of the other guys got pancakes and eggs which looked pretty tasty.  Seems like this is the local drunk spot for everyone, so I'm sure I'd want to give a higher rating if I had that to factor in. The prices are pretty reasonable and given the huge selection, I could see myself showing up here after the bars more than a few times.  I wish there was a place like this near my house.
