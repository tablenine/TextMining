Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Probably my #3 pizza in LA. Good thin crust, great cheese. Prices are average. Here are the cons. You can never get a table during reasonable hours and the parking sucks. Best bet is to make this your off hours and pick up pizza spot. Service was questionable but I was really stoned and I went alone...
