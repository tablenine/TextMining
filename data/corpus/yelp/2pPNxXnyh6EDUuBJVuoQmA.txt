Restaurant: Fortune Cookie Restaurant
Category: Chinese
My dad and I checked out Fortune Cookie a couple days ago....this is some damn good chinese food.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is very quaint, clean and pleasant.  Our waitress was EXTREMELY attentive and quick, and our food portions were more than ample.  We had the "dinner for 2" special which included sizzling rice soup, spring rolls, teriyaki beef skewer, mongolian beef and kung pao chicken.  Everything tasted great and I was pleasantly surprised.  Our total bill was roughly $30-$35 including drinks.  I will DEFINITELY be going back!
