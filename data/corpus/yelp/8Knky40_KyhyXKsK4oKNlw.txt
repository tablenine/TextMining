So good, so delicious.  It is kinda of a small place so expect a small wait for a table or if you are super hungry just eat at the bar.  Both times I have been here I've never been disappointed by the service or the food.  The gyoza is amazing and the Tsukemen is perfect for a hot day and everything is super tasty reasonable.  I wish I lived closer!
