FREAK OUT.  This is the worst restaurant I've been to since discovering the world of Yelp.  Needless to say, here's my chance to use this for the forces of good!  Foodies, stay away!  . . Zagat had the audacity to give this place a 23 (food).  Like, did they just drop the food critic on his/her head from the top of the Empire State Bldg? repeatedly? Somehow, Zagat can rate the best French, contemporary American, Italian, pastry shop, and delis with cured hams anywhere in the world. This restaurant shows Zagat is dead in the water on Asian food.  Say it ain't so!  Same goes for NY Times, New Yorker, Daily News, and NY Post which apparently means, their crits need to spend more time in Asia proper, not in Asian establishments in America.  Duh.. . (1) Low wages and staff that hate their jobs enough to picket WILL affect your food quality and service (just IMAGINE how...). . (2) Adding fish sauce does not a good dish make, can we say, Vietnamese stir fry?. . (3) Papaya salad was embarrassingly unfinished. Salad on top, sauce on bottom = fatally bland. Toss my own salad?  Do I have to pluck my own chicken back there too? . . (4) Wait staff brought ngoc mum straight out of the bottle, not the concoction which is served at the table after mixing with lime, sugar, garlic, water, and a bit of carrot. But wait, maybe he's expecting me to cook at the table?. . (5) Where's the vietnamese food? The ever cheap, ever tasty BUN XEO -- thin egg crepe with sprouts, chicken/shrimp, scallions served with ngoc mum -- is NOT on the menu???? . . If it's raining really hard and you're pretty soaked after a 30 minute walk, see Saigon Grill? Keep walking pal.  . . Trendy yes. Serious food? No, nada, nyet, not on your life.
