The portabella fries are NOT overrated!  I recommend getting 2 orders if there's more people.  . The clam pizza we ordered was delicious, although I'm usually a fan of thick pan crust so I wasn't too fond of the super thin crust.. For dessert I'd recommend the flat apple tart, I think it was honey glazed or something but it was delicious!  They also had it in their bakery on the way out, I so should have picked one up to take it with me!. The decor is really cool, as they have an open kitchen right in the middle of the restaurant.  But I wouldn't recommend this place if you're actually planning to have conversation with people, it was pretty loud mostly due to the echo of the marble floor i guess.  Classy place, would definitely go again!  There's so much more on the menu I that I haven't tried.
