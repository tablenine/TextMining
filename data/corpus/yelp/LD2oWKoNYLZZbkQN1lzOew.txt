This place is almost always packed from what I hear. When we were there it was about 10 lines that were all about 8-12 deep. It does take a bit of time to get through the line, but it's worth it. It's one of those spots that are extremely unique and not many tourists know about.. . This was the only french dip sandwich that I have had, so there is no doubt that you could call it the best. I had the beef with bleu cheese, which was on a fresh bun dipped in au jus (but not soggy), hence the name "french dip". They also have their own (crazy hot) mustard that they have served since 1912 - you have to try it on at least one bite, even if it burns the nostrils. Â And make sure that you get the pickles as the side order.
