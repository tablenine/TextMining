After living in Atlanta 4 years, then moving away to the north and then midwest... coming back for a visit and coming here was a wonderful delicious "Welcome back to the South!". If you are looking for some amazing southern comfort food, this is the place to go.. . I went with some family, who go often, and we all loved what we got. You really can't go wrong. I had the pork chops, which were great. Beware: servings are large! The breads are great, the sides are great, the fresh lemonade is great. The wait staff is also great. The ordering system is interesting - they give you an order sheet and pencils and each person writes in what they want. I suppose less chance of your order being screwed up =)
