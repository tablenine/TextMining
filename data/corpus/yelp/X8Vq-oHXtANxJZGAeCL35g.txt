I've always had good pizza every time I come here. Even though I'm not a fan of thinner crust pizza, I enjoy Fritti's crust that's thin, but not crispy flat. . . FOOD: I had the Insalata Mista salad, Maialona and the Funghi di Bosco pizzas. The salad was mixed greens with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It also had some cucumber and radish slices with thinly sliced red onion on top. Yummy. The Maialona pizza was the meat pizza with salami, pancetta, black olives, sausage and ham. It was full of meat especially the huge pieces of salami. The Funghi pizza was full of crimini and portobello mushrooms with a drizzle of truffle oil. Both were very good. . . TIP: Since you have to cut your own pizza, you can request a pizza slicer.
