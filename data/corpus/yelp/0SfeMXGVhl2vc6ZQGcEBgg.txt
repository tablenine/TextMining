Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
I'm updating because Sapori has really grown on me.  So much so that I'd have to say that this is my go to spot for Italian.  I'm sure there are many great Italian places out there that I haven't tried and some of them may in fact be better than Sapori but every time I go there's always something a little better than before.. . Aside from the fact that if you get on their mailing list they often send out coupons for $15 off your meal or some other discount it's just a great place to eat.  The decor could use a little help here and there but the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing for the most part (try to get in the back room for a quieter dinner).  I was in for dinner again this past weekend and a dinner for two was very reasonable.  We started with the Caprese which was fresh and light, entrees were Cappellacci all'Aragosta which was amazing and the hugely portioned Pinette Carindale (I'm sure I spelled that wrong) but it was a delicious chicken and pasta dish that could easily feed two people.  Dessert was bread pudding and the Tiramasu which my partner loves.  Even our wine was great.  I find myself never saying no to dinner at Sapori and it's always one of the first on the list when I have guests in for the weekend.
