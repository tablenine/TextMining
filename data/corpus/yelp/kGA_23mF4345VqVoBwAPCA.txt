Normally I don't like small restaurants but the cramped setting is what makes this restaurant great. . It's a cozy place to go, drink beer, and have food with friends.. More of a friends place than a date place. . . They are obviously known for their anorexic yet crispy chicken wings - which are addicting - which is why you have to end up ordering either 2 dinner boxes (of the chicken wings) or a few orders of the chicken wing alone. . . Their Hanpen cheese - is yummers. Fried or lightly battered fish cake with cheese inside - I don't even feel guilty eating it.. It lacks taste but who cares when you are crunching down on the light fried batter that oozes cheese from the fluffy middle?. . Yakitori Combo - comes with rice, salad, and soup . Chicken, Ground Chicken, Liver, Beef, Gizzards . All of these come on skewers . $16 but worth trying because you get to try all the meats. . Pros . 1. Simple but tasty food - no frills. 2. Fast Service . . Cons. 1. Waiting to be seated around dinner time. 2. Service is fast but not necessarily good
