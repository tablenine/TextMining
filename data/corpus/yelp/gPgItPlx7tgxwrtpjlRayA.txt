I was freakin' starving by the time we got seated here, so I waited till today to write an objective review because anything would have tasted good last night! Â So here goes....My burger was good, but small. I also ordered the tempura fried okra--which was greasy and bland. My nutella and burnt marshmallow milkshake was really no better than any fast food restaurant, which disappointed me. Service wasn't real attentive although the owner (?) did stop by and chat. In retrospect, this restaurant is ok, and very hipster-ish....but don't bring a really hungry person here.
