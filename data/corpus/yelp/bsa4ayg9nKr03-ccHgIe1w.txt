It was a late night at work and having pizza the night earlier, the dev team and I decided to have some Asian food and landed on Thai this particular night (we were limited to the restaurants . http://Zifty.com.  offered).. . We ordered: Kang Keaw Wan (Green Curry Chicken), Pad Kraprao (Basil Stir Fry w/Beef), Basil Rolls and Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp. Though the food was good, I cannot justify the price. It costs 2.49 per plate to add meat per plate and the amount of food per plate was minute. My Tom Yum Soup must have been 12 ounces at much and cost $6.. . Where are half stars?! I give this place 2.5 for overall experience.
