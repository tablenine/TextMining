Restaurant: FLIP Burger Boutique
Category: Burgers
Recently visited Flip. Thought the place was really neat. A little loud for my taste, but the joint sure was hoppin'. Had a seat at the bar, with the big video screens cleverly trimmed in a faux mirror frame. Had the Vodka Onion Rings, Burnt Marshmallow/Nutella shake &amp; a rBQ burger. Everything was good and done nicely. The rBQ was awesome. The shake was delish...the onion rings were a little on the greasy side, but they were good and tasted fresh. . Visually Flip is a stunning restaurant, and the food is worth the visit too.
