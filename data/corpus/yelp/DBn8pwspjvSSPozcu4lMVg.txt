Is the best pho in the universe? No. But it is tasty, fresh and quick to come to your table. Prices have gone up and cash only is annoying, but it always hits the spot. . . The harsh lighting and general din make make this place one to avoid on a get-to-know-ya kind of date. But with people you're comfortable slurping in front of - go for it!
