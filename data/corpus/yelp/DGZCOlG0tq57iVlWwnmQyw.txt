Ok... not loving the fact that the bartenders are very inattentive and never friendly.  Seems you have to grovel to get a drink refill or pay your tab (even if they are not busy).  What the heck is up with that???. . ARGH!!!!!  Aggravating. . Could use some more vibrant music too!. . I still love the vibe of this place somehow and live so close I will go back.
