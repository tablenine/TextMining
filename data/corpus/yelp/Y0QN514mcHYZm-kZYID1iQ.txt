Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
This sushi restaurant has a modern look.  The food was good.  The service was standard.  It was not bad but was not exceptional.  MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A RESERVATION!!!  Otherwise it can be a two hour wait on Saturday nights.  A bonus to this place is that there is easy street parking and also a parkinglot across the street which is pretty cheap.
