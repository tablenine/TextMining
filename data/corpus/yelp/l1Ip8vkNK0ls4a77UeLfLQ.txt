3 words: white wine sangria! . . I learned an important lesson after visit #1: come hungry or split the dish between 2 people, because their portions are obtuse - even during the lunch hours. I had chicken + rice + black beans + sangria for less than $10! Oh, and I can't forget about the plantains. Everything goes great with plantains!. . It's an extremely chill environment, where you seat yourself and lounge around in an indoor patio type setting. And so long as this dig keeps their doors open, I'm a guaranteed repeat offender.
