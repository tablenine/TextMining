To all other criticism: Yes I agree wholeheartedly, but for some reason I just can't seem to stop loving those Flash enchiladas. Especially to go since they seem to stuff a lot more extra goodies in when you get it in those styrofoam boxes. It's a lot more greazy goodness than a 6+ dollar burger at Swank Frank and I've enjoyed these both sober and drunk.
