This is a regular spot for my husband and I.  My husband loves the falafel here, having owned a Mediterranean restaurant, he is extremely picky about falafel. His search for the best falafel is like my search for the best taco... We have fun :). . Anyway, the hubby was hiking this weekend with the guys, so I spent Saturday night with a good friend who hadn't yet eaten at spitz.  . Just as I told her, if  you haven't eaten here, you should. . . It really is a great neighborhood spot and if your a student or alumni from Occidental you will appreciate that your fellow alumni are keeping it in the 'hood ;). . I usually get the classic doner I haven't swayed yet to try anything else, and I'm a fan of the sweet potato fries which I dunk in the extra side of tzatziki I usually request. . . They have a new spicy feta cheese dip that is really flavorful. Because of the feta, the flavor can be a bit overpowering and it wasn't so good with the fries because of the density.  It was a nice compliment  with my classic doner.  I just dipped my sandwich between bites.  Yummy!. . If you haven't eaten here yet, you should!
