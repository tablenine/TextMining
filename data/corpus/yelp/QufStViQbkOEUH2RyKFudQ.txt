My favorite breakfast place in Los Angeles.  Their scrambled eggs are so amazing it almost converted me to Scientology (location, location).  I always gross myself out eating steak and eggs at the crack of dawn but the skirt steak here is thinly sliced and portioned just right so it doesn't make me feel like a cow for the rest of the day.
