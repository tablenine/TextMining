Restaurant: Antico Pizza
Category: Pizza
Can't help it--this place is top notch!  . . I was kind of confused when we first walked in--there are some benches along the wall and one big table in a glassed in area, but this is set up more for take out rather than a sit-down restaurant.  That said, if it isn't too crowded, go ahead and sit down at the big table with everyone.. . Pizza was excellent--great dough, great sauce--it was huge, too.  I had read reviews implying that a pizza just feeds one or two?  These are pretty large pizzas--we each had a couple slices and were stuffed.. . I love the family feel of this restaurant and can't wait to go again.  Very impressed!
