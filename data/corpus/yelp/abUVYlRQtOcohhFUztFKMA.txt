Back in the day, i ended up here on Prom Night! I was going through my uber-earth loving vegetarian stage and found nothing on the menu to eat except for a plate of steamed veggies- yuck. . . I asked the server if i could order a grilled cheese. He asked me to hold on, checked with the chef, and returned to tell me the chef would do it- but was very nervous because he hadnt made a grilled cheese for his kids in quite some time. It came out perfect. . . The point of this story? I cant tell you much about the food here, but i can say the service is excellent! Would you be so nice to an annoying 17 year old trying to order a kids menu item in your 5 star restaurant? I dont think so. I would have rolled my now-judgmental eyeballs and sighed.
