The atmosphere is weird and cool, like most people have pointed out. But it is also amazingly loud in there (acoustics for a bank = not good for a restaurant?). Don't bring someone here on a first date - you guys won't be able to have a decent conversation.. . As for the food, it's half price most of the time, which makes it a pretty good deal, albeit, for mediocre sushi. Stick to rolls and appetizers and you'll be good. Stay away from sashimi salad, sashimi, and uni. Could not resist the uni for 4 dollars, and it was A MISTAKE. Sweet shrimp sushi on the other hand, was a pleasant surprise.
