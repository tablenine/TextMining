I like the history, I like the burger, I like the feel but I'm just not sold on the value.. . My friend ordered the steak burger, I got the hickory burger some fries and some cream soda. The bill with tip was like $25. I mean it's not a lot but I wasn't even full.. . The steak burger was juicy and tasted like a classic no-frills hamburger done right. The hickory burger was nice and smoky and the bun was toasted to a crisp perfection. Everything was good but I suppose I wanted more than good, I wanted pan-tastic!. . Maybe I'm doing something wrong. If I'm supposed to order the burger some special way, someone needs to let me know. The highlight was the Tillamook cheese that they use for the burgers. Spend the extra change to get it, it's a damn good addition to the burger.
