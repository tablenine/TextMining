i'm come here for brunch and for dinner. both experiences were so different..but equally great. brunch was great because of the great windows they have. it brings so much light into the place...oh yes, and the food was good. we had some of the breakfast dishes, but what i remember the most is the meatball pizza. yum!. . what i found most great about brunch was that i was there with an infant child and 4 other adults, and there was so much room around the tables that we were able to have the stroller near the table. we didn't feel cramped at all, and i think that is rare in LA. . . for dinner i came for a large party, and we ordered so much food. but everything tasted so great. pizza, pork chops, pasta...i couldn't ask for more. i would definitely come here again if i were celebrating something. but to be honest, it's a bit expensive for just Â a random dinner out...
