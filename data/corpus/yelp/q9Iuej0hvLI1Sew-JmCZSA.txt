UG is one of my favorite places to visit in summer and fall.  The hummus platter is a great start, and any of their salads are huge and filling.  Live music sometimes fills the place, and I've never not had a good meal and a good time.  For being so close to Wrigley, it certainly doesn't feel like Wrigleyville.  Definitely a gem worth investigating.
