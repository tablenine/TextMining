When someone utters the words 'Asian Fusion' to me, I usually cringe.  Just because something is a dumpling or has 5 spice on it does NOT necessarily mean that it's semi-Asian.  So when Nadina D. made reservations here for Chicago Chef's Week, I was kinda expecting it to be disappointing.  . . But, oh no - I was competely and honestly wrong!. . Best meal ever.  Not to mention the impeccable service from EVERYONE.  Even though we ordered off the Chef's Week menu ($32 for three courses!), no one shunned us!  We felt seriously special.. . The soup was a lemongrass/coconut milk soup with shrimp dumplings - with just enough spiciness.  So good.  The main course was tuna on top of some delicious gnocchi.  LIke, I'm drooling thinking of it.  And, for dessert, we were served a coffee panna cotta and beignets.  Delicious.  Plus, we just had to try the shortrib dumplings.  Sooo yummy.  . . I love how the layout of Spring...cozy booths, even for larger parties.  And, it's so elegantly decorated with flowers and paintings and light fixtures. *sigh*  I love this place.
