Ok, so I love seafood. This place is relatively close to where we reside and a friend of mine wanted us to try it out. This place was crowded and quite small. We thought we were going to have to wait for an hour before a table opened up but to our surprise... we only had to wait for 7 minutes. As we entered, I thought...."OMG, I just got a freakin' manicure!". No joke, everyone had on bibs and stuff all over their hands/fingers and faces. Normally, after doing a 360 I would have geared up to make a U-TURN out the door. Now don't get me wrong.... I'm an eater so usually I can take the mess but in this case.... I wasn't prepared. Most of the customers were young to middle aged Asians. Anyway, I was a good sport and just sucked it up since I was so impressed with the Cajun fries. Of course, my friend ordered the most messiest items on the menu... 2-3 different flavored/seasoned craw fish and shrimps which came in huge clear plastic bags. We also ordered oysters which were "mediocre".... I'd rather go to Redondo Beach for that and at least they'll have tapatio with their lemons (it's a MUST for me when eating oysters). Overall, I give this place 3 stars since I did not like the fact that we had to park in the residential street and walk in the dark for what seems to have been 5 minutes. If the table space was much bigger and if they supply wet napkins or optional paper thin gloves or something... that would have helped A LOT. I almost walked out with the bib still on. Next time, we're going to try one of their rivals down the street: Captain Crab =).
