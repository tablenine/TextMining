Restaurant: Blu Jam Caf√©
Category: American (New)
man i was always going "duh, where should i go to breakfast" because i was sick of 101, griddle, village coffee shop, etc.. . so i got adventurous and tried vienna cafe and blu jam. it is awesome they are right across the street from each other on melrose. i tried them on separate days. the winner is vienna cafe but they are both great places for breakfast.. . blu jam has a million different choices, we got the $7.95 specials, muscle beach and something else with eggs/mushrooms/onions. Tasty. coffee tastes normal and is refilled at a good rate. server was a nice lady.
