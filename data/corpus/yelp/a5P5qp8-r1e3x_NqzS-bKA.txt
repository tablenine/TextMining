Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I was disappointed that I could not substitute a veggie burger or the portobello mushroom for any of the choices. The only one they would allow to be vegetarian in option is the Umami speciality burger which comes out to a portobello mushroom with a baked tomato slice on a oil greased bun.  The hamburger comes on a square white plate and is the about 4" in diameter...about the size of a 1$ burger at McDonalds. This burger costs $9.  $9!!! (only the burger) It was tasty but not it was definitely not OMG, *drool, I HAVE to come here again.  However, it was tasty.. If you feel like spending more you can add drinks and some other options in appetizers or meal companions like what I ordered...fries and onion rings.  The fries were thick and were neither crispy nor soft ...they were some strange middle ground of a little crispy and kind of sandy soft...sorry I might be losing some of you here.  Anyway, not good.. The onion rings are those lightly battered kind that dont completely cover the onion and DRIP with oil.. I do admit the garlic aioli sauce tastes pretty good but after too much sauces I want to puke.  Not to mention the guy forgot to bring the sauce. But I guess we give him some slack because when he did bring it he gave us the mustard too. . Place is small but comfortable.  Order at the counter for take out or take a seat and they will bring you a menu although there is no sign that tells you this and you might have to stand in line or stand around and be utterly confused of what to do or where to go...  Nice atmosphere. Parking lot can be for about 10 cars max shared with other stores. Too oily in general.
