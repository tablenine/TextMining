DEEE-LICIOUS!  Went for Brunch on Sunday and was afraid there would be a line - so I showed up by 9:20 (they open at 9am) and there was NO WAIT!  . . Excellent and unique tasting Bloody Mary - more sweet than savory and with a giant skewer of cocktail shrimp!  . . LOVED LOVED LOVED my Louisana Omelette - would you like some eggs with your shrimp?  My whole plate was full of succulent spicy shrimp!  My next visit will entail trying out their crab cake eggs benedict.  From a distance, I could see that the crab cake was the size of a hockey puck!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.. . Too bad this place isn't closer to me. I'd be there for breakfast lunch and dinner. Worth the trek to Montrose/Damen!
