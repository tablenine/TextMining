Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
What Pinks did for the Hot Dog, Titos did for the taco.  There's a reason why this place has so many people reviewing it... Simply... the best place in LA for a greesy taco with cheese.. . The lines are long, so be prepared and just take a friend to chat.  Or don't be surprised if you see someone you know in line for their guilty pleasure.  . . The tacos are shredded beef in a hard shell, you can add cheese.  It comes with chips, so I recommend that you order extras salsa.  I just love their salsa.  It's kind of pureed tomato with a little kick.. . Bring cash.  They do not accept cards.. . Other people I know also like the burritos and enchiladas.  But, to me, this is like ordering a hamburger at Pinks.. . Definitly, Tito's is an experience for the locals.  And we love it.
