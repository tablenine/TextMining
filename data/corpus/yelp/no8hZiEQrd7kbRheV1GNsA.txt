I hadn't been here in ages, so I thought I'd return for some yummy greasy food in a cool atmosphere.. . BZZZZZZZZ!!  Wrong!. . Terrible service.  No greeting, no seating, had to beg for a glass of water.  Servers couldn't seem to care less.  Food was OK - it's hard to screw up a BLT - but the vibe of negligence and arrogance sapped much of the flavor.  Yes, it's full of hipsters, but when's the last time they warmed up a place?. . It'll be many more years before I go again.
