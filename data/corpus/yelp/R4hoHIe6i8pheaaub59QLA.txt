I brought a party of four here for dinner a couple of weeks ago, and everything about this place was wonderful. The decor was festive without being clownish. The service was excellent from the explanation of the soup of the day to the way plates disappeared and water was refilled without the party noticing. . . The food was absolutely delicious and can only be described as upscale Chinese. I have to point out that each dish tasted significantly different while being delicious. Usually, Chinese food has a common base, so everything tastes the same. Not here. And that's what makes this place so good.. . I have to agree with Maurice Y. concerning the food. Every bite is so flavorful, that you'll need a couple cups of water to clean your palate over the course of the dinner.. . Overall, I would not hesitate to go here again. I would give this place 5 stars if their portions were a bit larger, though I do commend them for not catering to the obese mindset.. . Oh! I almost forgot to mention the vaults. At first, I asked that we be seated in a vault, but after seeing how closed-in the vault actually was, we opted to sit elsewhere.
