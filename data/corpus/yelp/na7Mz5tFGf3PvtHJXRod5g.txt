Okay, first and foremost, this is a review on their Monday BBQ only! Nothing else.... . I have to say, for the last 3 Monday nights, I have been eating the BBQ here and I crave it the rest of the week. I feel like I have gone through the whole menu now, and have spent a number of hours during eat outing to do so... It always helps to have a beer and good friends around you as well.... . My favorites thus far are the "Wangs", the "Died and Gone to Bacon", and the pulled pork sandwich. Their wings are just amazing... They are smoked forever, not saucy, great texture and taste great. The "Died and Gone to Bacon" is layers of bacon around sausage, and a nice spicy sauce to top it off. The sandwich has a nice kick to it, and just tastes great as well.. . Talking to the guys here, I understand they like Harold's a whole lot... While it's been a while since I've been there, I have to say that this is my new favorite cue and wing place... Now I just need to order 7x as much so I can keep it in the fridge for mid-week cravings...
