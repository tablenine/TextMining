Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Parking is sometimes a pain, lines are really long, and seating is sometimes hard to come by but that's how good the taco's are. I just love this place. I've been going there for probably over 20 years. It's not for everyone but I just think these americanized tacos are just plan good! Three tacos with cheese, large salsa and a large soda. That's it, enjoy!
