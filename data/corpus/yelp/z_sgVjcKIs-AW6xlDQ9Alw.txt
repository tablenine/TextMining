Restaurant: The Boundary
Category: Sports Bars
I think I could eat at The Boundary everyday. I live in the neighborhood and The Boundary has become a frequent meeting spot for me and my friends. . . First off, the food is always great. Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Mac and Cheese Bites, Buffalo Chicken, Pulled Pork, Tator Tots, Salads... I like it all. My only complaint would be the burgers. Two out of the three times I have ordered a burger it has come out burnt. I order medium.  My medium is pink in the middle.  Their medium has no pink in the middle and is very charred on the outside with a slight burnt taste.  Yuck.  A sports bar must have a good burger. Please give the burger chef some lessons... . . Our service has always been outstanding. Yesterday I was there with a group of 10. The waitress was 5 star. Not only did she get everyones orders right (with many adjustments), she also did 10 separate checks without asking us. That was GREAT! Saved us from a headache in the end of trying to divy up the bill. That alone can ruin a good lunch. Everyone enjoyed their meals. . . The Sunday Bloody Mary Bar also looks amazing!  There are a zillion (well, maybe not quite) toppings you can add to your drink.  My friends that have tried it have given it rave reviews.. . Boundary... keep the good stuff comin'! Just please, please work on your burgers...
