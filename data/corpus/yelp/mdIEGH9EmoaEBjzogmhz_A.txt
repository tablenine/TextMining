Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
portions are out of control ridonkulous. there are places where you pay $$$ and get what amounts to gourmet art that leaves you yearning for some in-n-out afterwards. then there are places like griddle cafe that have portions that are just plain silly. ann &amp; i came here for brunch and split the golden ticket pancakes and the caballero. and by split i mean we ate 10% of those 2 dishes. seriously, at $12, the golden ticket is enough to feed a family of 6. i hate wasting food, so we took about 2 pounds of the leftovers home, but most people just make a tiny dent in the pancakes then just throw the rest away. i mean seriously, if the portions are this big, just freaking charge me $1.20 and i will gladly finish the 2000 calorie 1/10 slice of your mammoth pancakes. don't get me wrong, the food is awesome, but something about wasting that much just knocks a few stars off in my book.
