Tomatobasil Soup- deeelish... Veggie Quesadilla- yummy but standard... huge portions.... ooo and the fries were pretty darn good too!. . Cupcakes?! MMMMM!!! Redvelvet was moist and not too much frosting... the lemon was equally yum! heaven!. . Overall, the place was decent. The service was kinda strange- definitely have that wanna-be actor vibe going on... it was a bit pricey for what we ate, but hey, it is a "scene" type of place... I'd go again...
