Restaurant: Community Q BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I'm stuck, I just don't see it-- maybe I would have had the sides if they wouldn't have added so much on, but the sandwiches we got were insanely expensive to begin with! I lived in Memphis for 5 years and while I don't buy in to the fact that they're the BBQ capital of the world, I sure had a hell of a lot better BBQ there, here, and in Austin, TX!. . My husband and I went to Community for lunch one day, we got one pork sandwich and one brisket so that we could try a little of both. The plates that have the extra sides were way too expensive, which was too bad because apparently the mac and cheese could have saved our meal. . . Both the pork and the brisket were extremely dry, and the sauces were so weak that even though they were doused in an aenemic, vinegar based dressing the sandwiches were rough and tasteless. I know that part of the problem here is that I'm not big on the vinegary, SC style BBQ sauces, but there wasn't really anything to them so I don't even have an opinion on it-- if you can't even make the effort to make something stand out, why make it at all?. . The decor was kinda cute, but a little kitschy for my taste, and the people behind the counter were very nice. . . We're willing to go back and try the ribs when we have the cash to drop, but if those don't hit it out of the park, we probably won't go back.
