Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Go here. If you're within 20 miles of this place, go.. . Reason one: Apple Pan has survived intact and unchanged in West LA for 60 years. It's like a friggin' time machine. That alone is worth the price of admission. Things in WLA don't survive this long due to the mindless loyalty of the local blue collar residents (because there are none). . . Reason two: The menu and the food are also from a time warp- in a good way. Nobody messed with the formula or recipes over the years and now it seems like a gimmick. Gimmicks are fine sometimes, but Apple Pan is not one of them. . . And please, don't put this (or any historic restaurant) in the race for "best" whatever in town. Honestly, are you comparing nouveau fare like Father's Office burgers (which I like) to the stuff your grampa used to eat back in the day? (when he had teeth)
