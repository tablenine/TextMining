Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So I went for my first time to Pinks expecting a really really good hot dog. And they have a nice variety and special themes (The Have a Lord of the Rings hot dogs for all your Middle Earth fans) and the prices weren't so bad. . . Unfortunately it isn't the best damn hot dog I've ever had, not even close. I have say even Costco probably has better hot dogs for half the price. It's nice to go there to experience it once and to get a little bit of the LA feel, but do note that you can wait up to an hour in line to finally get your order in. And the hot dog i got which had swiss cheese, mayo, and mushrooms wasn't worth the wait. If I went again I'd definitely get something else.
