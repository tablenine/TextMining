Category: Thai
Judging by the huge variety and crowd of people who pack into this place on a nightly basis, I'm not the only one who's impressed by Joya.. . This place is a neighborhood treasure. When you get home and you're tired, there's nothing like being able to order up a heaping serving of scrumptious Thai food for $6-8 that will easily last for two meals.. . It's also a neighborhood hotspot: the inside can be a little chaotic, depending on the night--sometimes just to move past the bar to the kiosque to be seated can turn into a 5-minute affair--but, on the upside, it feels stylish, modern, and clean. The back terrace is lovely.. .  For takeout, it also cannot be beat. They're efficient, friendly, and accurate with your orders. Also: curries and such come with white rice included (in a separate container) which in my experience is a rarity.. . Hooray for Joya!
