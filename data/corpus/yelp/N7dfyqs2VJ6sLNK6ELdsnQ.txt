Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
1.you have to be invited by a performer or have a ticket given to you by a member. I went as a guest of a magician since i work at the comedy and magic club. . 2. Cocktail attire . . but Seriously ...one of the cheesiest places ever...BUT a good time.. . . It's super dated and it feels like you fell into the twilight zone with all the creepy magicians and dated furniture.. besides all that some of the acts are really good and extremely quick. The "big show" was super cheesy but my friend i went with said the assistant was super hot, you can't beat a cute girl running around in fishnets and thong haha. So guys theres a plus+++ . . The food was good at the restaurant and they had decent drinks, kinda pricey but fun server and fun atmosphere..they have 11 some bars around the castle and the shows get better when your drinking a little. . . It was a once and a life time evening. i wouldn't go again just because it was so cheesy but it was fun..go with people that actually follow the dress code otherwise they will lend you clothes
