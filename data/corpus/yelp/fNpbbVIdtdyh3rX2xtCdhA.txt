With all the great reviews, I could not help but come here to try their lunch with a friend. We ordered roti appetizer, beef rendang, and chicken panang curry. I asked for the Beef to be spicy, and they delivered it very well.. They gave us a dish, each with a round shaped rice on the plate.. and our meals came out in serving bowls.. so this is family style w/ a touch of American-style.. since the rice were on plates.. Plenty of food..especially for lunch, we both were able to try eachother's meals and there was a little leftover.. . The ambiance is nice, a little dark and cozy.. a nice place to go with friends or on a casual date.  The waiters and waitresses were all Asian, and they looked pretty young.  . The waiter was very good at refilling my diet coke, for this I would give the waiter that served us 5 stars.. I would come back just for the beef rendang.. the sauce was nice and thick, and the beef was pretty tender without being mushy.. some places over cook the beef where it is way too cooked.. that you can't even tell it's beef anymore.. this place the chunks of beef you can see it.. but when you bite into it , it's not too chewy.. so I like that... The service was great, but it was a late lunch and the place wasn't crowded.. it's a hidden gem in a weird strip mall .. I wouldn't even imagine it would be that nice, but once you step in..it's really soothing and charming..
