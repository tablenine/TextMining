Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Being a connoisseur of Japanese food, and hearing of their Special 2 challenge, I was reasonably surprised that Orochon's food was rather ho-hum. I will confess that I had the teriyaki chicken (not their specialty) but it was dull and bland, not to mention barely filling. . . My friends who had the soups (based on salt, miso, and soy) were similarly unimpressed and didn't find their lower levels to offer much in the way of spicy. The restaurant was also small and had a very rushed vibe...the service was pretty disappointing.. . The two things that brightened up the place: the spicy scallop I ordered, which was rather delicious, and the sight of a poor soul finishing his Special 2 challenge. I took a tremendous amount of Schadenfreude watching his face flush red and hearing him babble about his pets since the heat in the soup left him so disoriented he was acting like he was blackout drunk. Fun times.. . I only wish the food gave me as much amusement.
