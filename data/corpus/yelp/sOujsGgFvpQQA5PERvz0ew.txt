I so cannot believe I have yet to review Fogo.  I have never had a bad experience here.. Firstly, if you don't like meat, stay away!  LOL. . Secondly, never ever overload at the salad bar.  anything more then 1 tomato or 1 asparagus stalk is overloading  :D.. . Now Thirdly for those keeping track, any buffet that has the food come to you is A+ in my book, but one with something as delicious as the meat served her is Hors catagory!. . They are all good, but my favorites have to be:. the Picanha. Bacon wrapped Filet. Garlic Picanha. Bottom Sirloin. Lamb Chops. . Their Flan is good, and I one of my friends said their turtle cheesecake is the best she has ever tasted.. . I have to come back here every chance i get.
