Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
This place is probably a bit too trendy for me. I don't find any satisfaction in having to lurk around the tables to get a seat, or fighting through the crowd so I can order my food. I am old fashioned and I prefer to be seated by a hostess and served by a waiter. And I definately don't like to be surrounded by yuppies while I eat, so there are very few things that I like about the atmosphere of the place.. . However, I did enjoy their signature burger and yellow fin tuna, even though I'd take a Carl's Jr. Six-Dollar burger over that any day for the price. I also found some satisfaction in sitting under the overhang as it started raining while a few parties to my right had to enjoy their food and drinks in light rain. . . This is not really my scene but if you're looking for a trendy place to grab some decent food and drinks, then check out Father's Office.
