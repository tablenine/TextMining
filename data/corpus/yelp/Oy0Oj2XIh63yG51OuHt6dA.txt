as i may have mentioned before, i HEART kopi.  so delicious.. . my best best friend is here for the weekend, and as it was her birthday yesterday, i wanted to do something nice for her.  she moved to the east coast about two years ago now and i don't really see her much.  i feel extremely special when she comes for a visit and i am the first person (besides her momma) she visits when she gets off the plane.  hooray for me!!  we were gonna check out lalibela, but seeing as it's saturday night and the wait for food there can sometimes exceed two+ hours, i didn't want to take that chance.  so on to the fallback... go somewhere proven and easy.   we ended up having dinner at T's (a regular go-to when she still lived in RP/LS, and hopeful reminder of good times), cheesed it up, and then desserts at kopi.  the tiramisu for her, and the (newly put-out) blueberry pie (warmed up) for me, w a lil bit of whipped cream on the side.  sweet sweet mother of heaven and everything holy.  that is some excellent shit.  never had blueberry pie before and cheesus is that crust good.  the tiramisu was tasty and so GI-normous that she had to cut it in half and box the rest for mummie.  thank you awesome server for the suggestions!. . I LOVE KOPI.. . ps. get the rugelach to go... you won't regret it.  and tell em i sent ya.
