Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I can safely say that Umami Burger is one of my new favorite Los Angeles eateries - despite the fact that: . . (A) I've only eaten there once. and . (B) the experience was influenced (positively) by a fluke bit of luck - namely: our waiter mistakenly bringing us an un-ordered burger and then offering it to us for free - which could, I realize, be construed as a strike against their service, but I digress. . . My lunch date and I tried the Truffle Burger (delicious), Pork Belly Burger (winsome) and the eponymous Umami Burger (adequate), along with side orders of their triple-cooked steak fries (forgettable) and malt liquor tempura onion rings (killer). . . The long and short of it is: the food - though modestly portioned - makes the place worthy of a second and third visit so long as you know that its richness and absolute lack of regard for caloric frugality will have you feeling the rumblings of a minor cardiac event immediately thereafter. But if you don't mind that - and I don't - you should absolutely give Umami Burger a try.
