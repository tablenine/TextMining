Fabo-lust mana is! This new fangled word was purely created by mawah to express my love and lust for Manas unique and delicious menu. Besides the menu being amazing the restraunt is small,dark and sexy! I loved the feel and you can sit at the "food bar", A long wooden bar with lil stools to plop down and get some great service from the hot bartender/waitress.. . I hit this B up with my gal Candy pie for a late night bite to eat. We were celebrating a special lil something so we started out by trying some Sake cocktails.We got the pear nectar sake,rhubarb with nigori sake,cucumber sakerita. Yum yum! . . After the drinks started flowing we ordered a little bit of everything on the menu.GYOZA-oh yea,BI BIM BOP--yes please ,CURRY -omg pow pow pow,BAKED GOAT CHEESE-uuhh huh,FIVE SPICE TOFU-yea we are fat. All of the above we sooo good and filling we ended up taking a lot of it home in a doggie bag:). . Since its so itty bitty I'd reccomend calling ahead for a res. just in case its jammin'
