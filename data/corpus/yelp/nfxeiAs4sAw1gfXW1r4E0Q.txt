Category: Steakhouses
Hands down the best porterhouse I've ever had.. . The steak was also very delicious as I got to stare at Jessica Simpson at the table right next to us!!! She came in with Donald Faison and his girlfriend Cacee Cobb. . . When I saw Donald came in with two girls I was thinking, who are these two groupie's he is with?!? I was talking all this smack to my friends about how these girls are just trying to get a free meal off him! Then Jessica turned her head and she showed me up big time. . . =P Â  -----I'm an idiot!
