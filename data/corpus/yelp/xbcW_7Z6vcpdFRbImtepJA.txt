Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
If there was a reason why the stereotypical view of a Mexican is a fat bearded fella with a sombro sleeping under a tree it's because they just finished off a Manual's Special from El Tepeyac. Now with a couple other locations the original still holds strong as one of the best places to eat in East L.A. But that's only because Yelp doesn't have the technology to follow all the movements of the 'roach coaches' that wander around the land serving up tasty tacos.. . I'm reading a lot on here that folks are afraid of the area because it's those mean streets of East L.A. Maybe I'm just used to the area living near it for the majority of my life but I really have never seen anything bad go down near here. So pay no mind to the warnings of the area. Besides, after eating here you'll be well prepared to meet your maker. . . The place is small and you will have to wait in line outside at peak hours and even most non peak hours. But it's worth it. Tuesday was when it was always closed but I swear the other week when I drove by there was a line outside on a Tuesday. Maybe they couldn't read a closed sign? . . The burritos are great, have they be on the super human portions that you have no chance in hell in finishing off. That's not to say that large portions make good food. You're not losing anything in the quality when you're bumping up the quality. . . Forget the outside dinning here. It's really taking away from the experience and from my attempt to try it once, the taste in the food was slightly different. So brave the line and you'll be rewarded with your just desserts.. or at the very least a huge serving of good Mexican food.
