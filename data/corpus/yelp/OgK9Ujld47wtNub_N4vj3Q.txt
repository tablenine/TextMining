Weiners are awesome.  And Wurstkuche proves it.  They have a solid selection of sausages that range from your standard bockwurst to novelties like rabbit and rattlesnake.. . Though the front seems crowded, the back opens up like an indoor beergarden.  Their draft beer selection is just as impressive, featuring a wide Belgian and German beers.  I sampled a few different beers and settled with a glass of the Houblan Chouffe and the Maredsous 8.. . To eat, I had the Bratwurst, the Mango Jalapeno, and the Duck &amp; Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers.  All three were perfectly grilled and tasted extremely hearty.  The Duck &amp; Bacon tastes like a chili dog topped with jalapenos, but easier to eat.  It literally melts in your mouth.  I was most impressed by how solid their regular bratwurst was.  It's one of the best I've had.. . As a side, I had the mouthwatering Belgian Fries.  Seriously, my mouth is watering as i type this.  For sauces, I had the Curry Ketchup, the Chipotle Aioli, and the Pesto Mayo.  Curry Ketchup blew my mind, and the Pesto Mayo was also good in its own right.. . If Brats Brothers is the king of lunchtime sausages, then Wurstkuche rules the dinnertime hours.. . GET:  Bratwurst, Duck &amp; Bacon with Jalapeno, Belgian Fries (with Curry Ketchup), Whole Grain Mustard, Houblan Chouffe
