I'm sold.  . . Fried pickles = good.  And the sauce they came with was unexpected (sort of like a sweet &amp; sour sauce) but delicious.. . Burger = perfectly cooked and delicious.  And, I think they put cheese on the top and bottom of my burger because it was my only topping choice.  Besides the garlic aioli.  . . Garlic aioli = amazing on fried pickles, fries or a burger.  Overall, made my meal.. . Fries = not a fan of sweet potato fries, but i did try one and it seemed like it would be good for those that like this.  The regular fries were tasty, thin and very slightly spiced.  Fun for dipping.. . As a side note, a member of our group got the grilled cheese, which i tried and loved.  Will be getting that next time.. . And to top it off, they had an oversized chocolate chip cookie as a dessert, which is an easy way to win me over.  It came out warm, with whole chips sprinkled on it melting on the top.  It is DELICIOUS.  Highly recommend.. . I can't wait to go back.
