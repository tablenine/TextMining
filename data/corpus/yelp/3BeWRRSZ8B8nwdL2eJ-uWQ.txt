I was impressed with this  latest restaurant hotspot in L.A.   Initially, I thought to could be b/c it owned by both by celebrity chef Nancy Silverton of La Brea Bakery and Campanile and Mario Batali.  But this place is actually really good.  Since we couldn't get same day lunch reservation, the hostess on the phone suggested to us to come early prior 12pm because there will be a long line waiting for the restaurant to open.  Although my boyfriend and I were the first people in line, true enough, many followe.  There were at least 10 people even before the door opened. We were seated at the bar overlooking the cooks who made the pizzas.  It was enjoyable watching them make the pizzas and trying to determine the ingredients that went on it. . . We got the winter caprese salad- very good and we shared a pizza- leeks, bacon and goat cheese.  The pizza is intended to be for one person, but it  can be shared by two people especially when you don't want to be stuffed. However, next time, I think I'll probably get one all to myself.  Also, service is friendly and unpretentious.  The clientele was mixed- different ethinicities, age groups and some with families- it reminded me of Berkeley.  I will definitely go back.
