The place was literally a hole in the wall. The building exterior was akin to that of a rundown, brick-laid warehouse. The interior was modern and had an interesting design. Orders were placed at the front counter and customers then proceeded down a dark hallway to the "back" room where all the seats were. While the place wasn't exactly packed when we went, I can definitely see it being crowded during peak hours. We got lucky with parking too, I can definitely see that being a problem during busy times. Their menu mainly comprises of sausages but they have amazing Belgian Fries and a pretty extensive beer selection. I had the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage and the Fruli beer and my friend had the Kielbasa and Apple Ale. We split an order of the Belgian Fries with Chipotle Ketchup and Sundried Tomato Mayo (BOMB!). The beers were pretty fruity and tasted like candy as opposed to regular beer. I'm not a huge fan of beer in general so I liked the beverage choices we made. I'm sure the selection of German beers would satisfy those who prefer more normal? beers.. . Would be five stars, but the meal gets a tad expensive for the amount of food given. Our totals were roughly $20 per person, although it'd be significantly cheaper if we hadn't ordered the beers.. . tl;dr. Rattlesnake/Rabbit - Tasty and even more so with some mustard.. Kielbasa - I'll take my friends word that it was good. Fruli - stawberry flavored beer, also refreshing.. Apple Ale - Tastes like cider, which I like. Belgian Fries - amazing, especially with the Tomato Mayo. The Chipotle Ketchup isn't that amazing. It tasted like a ketchup with some pepper.
