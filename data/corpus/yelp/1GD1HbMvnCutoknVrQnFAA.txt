Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
So much greens that my cows are buried in the jungle. $10.50 + tax and it took forever to like find like the cows. I had to turn to my wife and lament "Honey, I think the cows are still hiding...". . And when I found the flanks, there were 0.5" by 4" long. All four whooping strips. . . I never get places that serve salad. As if piling a bunch of greens on a plate requires such a skill. The cows aren't all that either. The chicken and albacore are all prepared and piled for the next order. So what's the difference is this and fastfood? . . Watch it TenderGreens, Â I just might open a restaurant next to you call it TenderMeats. We will see who's who with what's what then.
