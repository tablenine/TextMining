Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Yummy, yummy in my tummy.. . The chicken was good.  Even better dipped in the onion gravy that the smothered potatoes came in.  They were awesome.  Perfectly seasoned &amp; not overcooked.  The mac &amp; cheese was ok.  The waffles were soggy &amp; a bit more sweet than savory.  I love fired chicken &amp; I wish there was a Roscoe's here in Las Vegas.
