We celebrated our 9th anniversary here last night. I loved their prime rib. My husband had their lobster set dinner with lobster salad and a mousse dessert. I had their trio appetizer which is excellent. The decor is nice and the service is great as well. Their warm mini baguettes are great. I'll return for our company party here.
