Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
this was the first time I've been here. my boyfriend and i drove past this place three times before I was able to spot it. There is no sign, just a faded address. I was hesitant as we approached the restaurant and wondered if we really were at the right place because all I saw were white diners. Not like it matters, but I'm just use to seeing Asians at Vietnamese restaurants. But then i realized oh well, it is silverlake. The place was packed. I ordered spring rolls and Pho with tendon, tripe, steak and meatballs. There's no rice plates. The food is okay. I've eaten at many Pho restaurants before and this place is nothing special, and nothing bad about it either.
