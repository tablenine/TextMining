Salvadoran food on the Westside, oh yeah!  I have loved this place even when it was housed in this little shack around the corner from the Ralph's at Olympic and Barrington.  The location might have changed but the food is still great.  I like everything I have had, but the pupusas still steal my heart.  Although the tamales that she makes around the holidays do have a funny way of putting a smile on my face.
