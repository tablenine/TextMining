This restaurant has a ok service. They should clean the bathroom and keep it sanitary .The restaurant has a diverse choice of different. dishes.To my perspective this restaurant is only good enough to go to if you have a large group of people.The food and drinks make a good enough attempt to stay in buisness.I recommend you to not visit there. the waiter smells so bad Â I`m eeeeeeeeeeeeeeemmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmooooooooooooo
