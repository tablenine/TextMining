who'd a thought a girl not too fond of pizza would give 4 stars to a pizza joint? i've been converted. this place deserves it. . . the wait was a bit much. i was a little suprised to see tens of people sitting outside on the steps. but the food and ambiance make up for it. this place is not for the clostrophobic.. . a must is the mediteranean bread, served on a tiny plate, this flabread over flows. i ate the bread and salad (huge!), enough to fill me. i tried a bite of the cute little pizza pot pie. it tasted like grandma's spaghetti sauce. . . i admit i have no grounds to rate the food here entirely, but if everything is as good as the mediteranean bread, i'm giving it two thumbs up!
