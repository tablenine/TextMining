Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
There burger is amazing, best burger I've had to date. It's more of a gourmet burger than a down and dirty one. I have many friends that love it too and many that don't. They only make it one way and if you don't like blue cheese or onions then you'll hate this bad boy. . The Fathers office in Santa Monica is a better burger but it's such a small place it's not really worth it, so I'd rather hit up the Culver City Father's office for more seating.. . There Sweet potato fries are also the best I've had in LA, it comes with a great dipping sauce in a tiny little grocery cart. . . There beer selection is amazing, craft beers lining the wall. Over 20 different ones. . . Finding a table can be a bitch. You have to hawk a table down waiting for people to leave since it's a seat yourself place.. . GOOD: burger, sweet potato fries, beer. BAD: hard to find a seat descent wait, burger not as good as the Santa Monica. OVERALL: It's worth the wait for me, I love the beer and the burger enough to do it.
