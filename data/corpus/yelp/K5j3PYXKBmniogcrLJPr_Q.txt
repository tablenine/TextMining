I've tried the sandwiches with beef, pork, and lamb (I didn't eat all 3 myself or in one sitting ;P), and I would have to say my favorite was the beef. I thought the lamb was a bit too dry. Also, if you like your sandwich a little soggy and with a little more flavor, I would ask them to double dip it. For the sides I would recommend the pickled beets, potato salad, or macaroni salad. . . Also, so you don't look like a total noob (1) I learned from watching a little fight go down that you need to make sure you stand in a line that lines up with the cash registers (2) don't try to hand them the cash immediately after you order, they'll will give you a little tray to put your money on.
