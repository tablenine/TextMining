Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
Mmmmm.......corn bread, sweet potato fries, ribs, greens, beans, brisket and chicken sandwiches....... . I've only eaten here once a couple weeks ago, but it only seems like yesterday....It was just that good!!!  . . We did however get it to go due to the long line on a Saturday night....and plus, we were starved after 8 hrs. of moving out of my old and into the new apt.....(so I guess anything would've tasted good) . . Since I live down the street, I always pass Smoke Daddy and it's ALWAYS busy....so I'm sure it's not just me thinking it's a fabulous place for some BBQ  :o)
