Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
The Apple Pan takes you out of LA completely once you're inside.  It's authentic and I mean a legit authentic old school burger joint.  The cash register is pre-1960, the plates feel like they have been passed down the generations, the workers look like they have been there since the place first opened, and the food is like something out of your favorite local restaurant in a small midwestern town (reminds me of the places presidential candidates are always shown eating at in Iowa just before the caucuses).  I still can't believe this place exists in LA and I applaud the local residents for giving the Apple Pan your money because the Apple Pan doesn't seem to fit with the Westside culture and you still embraced it.. . Note: It's cash only!. . 5 stars for the atmosphere.. 4 stars for very small seating area (you need to stand against the wall and wait for someone to finish before grabbing their seat...it's honor system seating).. 4 stars for the burgers and fries.. 5 stars for the pies.. 4 stars for the wait to sit and eat.. 5 stars for doing the math manually to write out your bill in pencil and use that ancient cash register.
