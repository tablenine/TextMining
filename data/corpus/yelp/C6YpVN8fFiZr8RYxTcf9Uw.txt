With so many reviews, mine won't even make a dent.. . Nevertheless,  I HAVE FOUND THE ULTIMATE LATE NIGHT SPOT IN LA, EVER!!!!!!!  . . Thank Jesus!    Yeah that's right, this is a Jewish deli and Jesus was a Jew, so thank Jesus!. . I LOL'd when I tried to order buttermilk.  It's a weird thing to order, but they had it on the menu and I love it.  . . So the waiter gave me this kind of look    O_o       because clearly, he had never even heard of the stuff.    After he consulted with various other staff, he produced an ice cold glass of buttermilk, yum.  . Anyway, Canter's has everything you'd expect, and my reuben sandwich was the fuken bomb!  Also..... Buttermilk FTW!. . (SHUT UP you jerks, and you know who you are, thinking buttermilk is gross, and therefore I am gross for liking it.   Well, it's NOT GROSS, it is delicious.   I assume you already know it's not really butter in the milk, it's more like yogurt... and if you don't like it it's probably because your palatte needs another 100 years of training before it can compare with mine, muhahaha)    ;)
