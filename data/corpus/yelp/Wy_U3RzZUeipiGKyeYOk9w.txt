Restaurant: Tom&#39;s
Category: Diners
I've eaten at Tom's literally dozens of times, though only exclusively for breakfast. . . Tom's food is good, solid diner fare - the pancakes and omelets are great, and new creations keep popping up as specials. I'm partial to the fishcakes (deep fried and served with a mildly spicy dipping sauce), the pumpkin pancakes and the chili cheese omelet. Oh, and their turkey bacon is absolutely killer - give it a try! . . The servers are very accommodating, running customers' strollers to a storage space in the back, bringing endless coffee refills and providing service with genuine smiles. Gus and Noni (the owners) are absolute sweethearts. The people are really what makes Tom's Restaurant a gem of the neighborhood.. . (And for the record: Suzanne Vega wrote "Tom's Diner" about the restaurant in Manhattan, despite the signed lyrics hung up on the wall. She's gone on record in the NYT as saying so. I firmly believe that she should visit "the other Tom's" and enjoy what we Brooklynites have in our backyard!)
