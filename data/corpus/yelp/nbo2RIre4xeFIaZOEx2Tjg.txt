Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
So last weekend we had the lunch buffet on Saturday .. it was not very crowded .. after hearing all the reviews I thought I would try Reza's out because I'm super biased towards Noon O Kabab ... . . The food was ok 2/5 ish ... The 2 stars are for the spread .. there was a lot of variety ... even the quality was not great at all ... i like the kababs at Noon O Kabab much better ... I liked the brunch concept that Reza's has because they give you a glass of champagne too so they are trying to please the general brunch crowd which is gr8!. . The service was very very bad no1 attended to us .. the only time the waitress smiled was when she came to give us the check HULLO. . I will come back but not for the buffet
