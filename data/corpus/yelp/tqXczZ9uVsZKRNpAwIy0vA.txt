I like Fat Cat.  That said, I get frustrated with its lack of identity.  It's too loud to chat; there are either too many tables or not enough; there are either too many TVs or not enough.  The food is very tasty and creative, but you might not be able to have any because so many tables are occupied by people just drinking.  The brunch menu is wonderful, but the DJ thinks it is still late-night dance party on Sunday after church.  I like the beer menu -- I always feel encouraged to try something new.  The standard gin martinis are too wet, which is odd given its image.  Odd little fact: a few of the waitstaff are gender-ambiguous, making it fun to guess.
