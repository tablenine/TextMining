I eat here a lot.  The place is busy, but if you're in the mood for a late dinner, show up around 9pm and you will never have to wait (at least I haven't had to yet).  Their Chicago branch is just as good.  Be a member and get discounts and invitations to their special events!. . My favorite is the Diamond Cut - you can take home the bone for your dog if you want to spoil him/her.
