Yes they've got a line, yes you'll get a talking-to if you don't follow the order-then-sit rule, but they've got a system and they're sticking to it. They've got tasty tacos, not quite Mexican, but not quite taco bell either. I love the fish tacos - simple but tasty. The house margaritas keep me coming back. Their occasional specials can be a special treat too.
