Category: Bakeries
What can be said about Canter's that hasn't been said already?. . Nothing, that's what.. . There's a reason this is not just a Hollywood staple, but a SoCal one as well. It's legendary. And not just because of the name-dropping you can do after your lunch. It's not just a hot spot to be seen- it's a place to go for killer food. . . The matzo ball soup is something you'll be telling your grandkids about.. . If you survive the hot pastrami sandwich, then you didn't put Beaver's deli mustard on it.. . And don't get me started on the complimentary pickles. That's right. Complimentary pickles.
