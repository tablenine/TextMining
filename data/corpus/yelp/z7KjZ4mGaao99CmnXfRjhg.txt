Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Burgers are to die for.  The fries will require a reincarnation and a second death.  . . But seriously, the fries and the dipping sauce...probably one of the best that money can buy.. . If you like thin fries, Father's office is the place to go!
