This the kind of place where you feel like you have to try it because of the concept (and the hype) and the well-presented sweet treats, but once you try it, it's just.. okay.. . felt really excited to come here- got the coffee toffee milkshake, 1/2 burger sandwhich, and a slice of chocolate cake, all to split.. cake was good, but for $5 nothing out of this world. the milkshake was $6 and was also tasty, but not spectacular. it was a bit over done with tons of toffee. the burger was really good. but overall, meat + a bunch of milk and sweets = ehh. the inside smelled like wiped-down milk too and put me off. . . i kinda regret spending ~$21 and don't think I'll be coming back, sorry Milk.
