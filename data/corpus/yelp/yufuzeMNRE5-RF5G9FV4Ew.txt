My grandfather used to eat here with his old cronies, surrounded by all the other Chicago cronies and politcos, chowing down on massive corned beef sandwiches or meat loaf or slippery eggs and greasy meat breakfasts, slurping coffee after mediocre coffee. Yea, my grandpa's ticker took a beating from years of eating at this place, but I am sure, where ever he is now, he'd say it was worth it. Burp.
