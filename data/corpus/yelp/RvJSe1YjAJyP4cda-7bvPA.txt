I went here last night and it was my second time around so my repeat business should tell ya something. The food is soooo great. I had the grilled pork chops and let me tell ya I really am not a fan of pork chops but eating this could make me easily convert. The portion was big and full of flavor and so juicy. It came with a side of the best mac and cheese ever! This is southern comfort at it's best! The service is alright. Nothing to write home about. If you go mos def try the pomegranite martini it's great! I have not tried their famous fried chicken yet but hell that just gives me an excuse to go back again!
