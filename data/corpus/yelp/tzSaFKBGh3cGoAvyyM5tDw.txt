Restaurant: Veerasway
Category: Indian
After a couple of beers at Paramount Saturday evening, we rode down to Veerasway at around 7:00. The restaurant looked busy but not full, and so we locked up our bikes and went inside. It became clear reservations are recommended when dining here on Saturday, the wait was an hour and a half. We were told we would only be able to get seats at the bar, even after the wait. I live just a few blocks away, so we rode to my place and hung out for a bit.. . Upon returning, the dining room was packed and we had to wait another 15 minutes for seats at the bar. We were served lentil flour chips with three sauces, tasty, but we were hungry for dinner!. . I had a glass of nice pinot noir, slightly smoky with a lot of vanilla. My dinner date had the bollywood rehab, and it was one of the most unusual cocktails I have ever tried. Most of their cocktails looked unusual and worth a try, but I was in a wine mood.. . Veerasway is not your basic Indian fare, though they do have a few traditional favorites. Most of the menu is filled with highly stylized takes on Indian food. We were interested to try the coconut scallops, but were disappointed when informed they were out of them, so we ordered the tandoori tofu, crab cakes, and arugula and chick pea salad. All three were amazing. The crab cakes had so much lime, and were topped with diced avocado and cilantro. The arugula was fresh and fragrant.. . Overall, I really liked Veerasway a lot. Typical for a trendy West Loop restaurant, you have to be willing to put up with an above average noise level, long waits, and somewhat marginal, but at least attentive service. At least in the case of Veerasway, the payoff is worth it.
