Easily the best sushi I have had in a very long time. We went early and did not have to wait at all. Although by the time we left it was very crowded. It would have been worth the wait! We ordered a variety of rolls and brought wine, always a plus! The only downside was the limit to the number of bottles allowed.... . Anyway, we ordered the spider roll (very good), california tempura, mj, sunset galz, and yellow submarine. All were incredibly delicious. I hope to try the volcano next time. They bring it out with sparklers! Will definitely be back, and soon.
