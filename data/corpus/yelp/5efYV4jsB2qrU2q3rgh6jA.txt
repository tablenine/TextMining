Went for brunch on a Sunday. The decor is very subtle and nice. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. My husband's eggs benedict were a bit overcooked but he didn't seem to mind too much. We went with a friend who is a chef and he chose this place he frequents. Good service, good food, not outrageously priced.
