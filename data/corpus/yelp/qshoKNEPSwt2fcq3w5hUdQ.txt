Bossa Nova, or Bossa YESva!  Great food.  Great atmosphere.  Service is usually good, but tends to be on the slower side.  It's a great place for hungry people looking for a big meal.  You can play it safe and order pizza, salads, sandwiches and pasta.  For the adventurer in you, go with the ethnic varieties and order from the very last page of the menu.  I believe it is the "a la carte" section.  The chicken is always satisfying, but the shrimp is killer, and the salmon is great.  This is definitely large enough to share.. . Also, make sure to stick with the Bossa Nova on Sunset, it has a much better layout with way better seating options.  Also, this Bossa Nova gives you the delicious bread prior to the meal.
