Some friends took us here while visiting... Overall I think our consensus was it was in the "just OK" territory, especially given that it's in NY and there are so many choices.. . The food here was good...  well most of it.   The four of us all really really enjoyed our appetizers.  I had a cold corn soup that was good, someone else had the oxtail which he liked, someone else had the carpaccio which was tasty, and the 4th had a gnocchi special appetizer w/ stuffed morel's.    Had we all just had the appetizers, the food would've felt closer to 5 star.  . . For our main course two of us had a rabbit special, which we both thought was overly salty.  Someone else had the livers and onion, which the waiter talked up by saying people go out of their way to go there for them... (We weren't sure if he meant that they were unusually good, or that they do some special preparation of them.  The answer, it seems was neither... They were pretty traditional and ordinary, though decent at the same time.  The side of polenta was downright bland and needed salt.  Another person had veal saltimbocca, which I think thought was good but not stellar.... . Outside of the main course issues, service wasn't really too great.  We got bread and butter but no bread/butter plates.  It just wasn't very upscale feeling service. And I'm not sure if the waiter even came back really after our main courses were delivered...   When he did he seemed kind of short.. . No reservations meant for a good long 50 or 60 minute wait, which was OK because we went to their next door wine bar (though perhaps annoying to the pregnant person in our party who couldn't drink anything, and they didn't have sparkling water by anything but a giant bottle)...
