This review is based on their croissants only.  This past weekend I picked up 1 each of the chocolate, apple and cream cheese.  I was shocked by how delicious the apple was.  Definitely my favorite of the 3. Chocolate was a yummy 2nd and the cream cheese was my least favorite, though I didn't try that one until the next day.  I liked their croissants a little better than those Alon's has to offer and it doesn't hurt that they are $1.25 each.. .   Can't wait to try the Bahn Mi!
