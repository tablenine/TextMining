Restaurant: Fiddlehead Cafe
Category: American (New)
I base my reviews of restaurants on the following components: customer service (includes the time it takes to reach me, attentiveness of server), quality of food, value (is it priced fairly), and ambiance. I'm not impossible to please, but I have standards. Fiddlehead Cafe exceeded all of them!. . My fiance wanted a cheeseburger, and I wanted excellent wine, so as we strolled Lincoln looking for a pre-movie dinner place, we passed our usual favorite Jack Rabbit and checked out the menu of Fiddlehead Cafe. Cheeseburger? Check. Ridiculously awesome wine list? Check. . . The restaurant was not crowded, which was another plus, and we got a cozy table with the friendliest, most knowledgeable server, who was happy to sub an Argentinian Malbec into my Spanish wine flight because I wasn't thrilled about one of the included reds. Our cheeseburgers were amazing, and the french fries were addictive. My fiance enjoyed a Guiness Ice Cream Pudding (very British dessert) and ate every bite. I ended up leaving with a bottle of the Rioja I had best enjoyed in my wine flight... and it was only $16! Yes, they sell most of the wines AND cheeses on the menu, so you can take your faves with you when you leave. We will definitely be back!
