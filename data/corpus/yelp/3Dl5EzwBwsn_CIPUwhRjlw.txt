I was lured in by the bubble tea but fell in love with the food! Ive been to every one of its locations and the food is consistently delicious! There is something for everyone here. You can try something crazy and exotic or something safe and familiar. All the meals are huge and family style so its great for a group. My favorites are the Thai Basil with Baked Rice, the Lychee Mango Freeze with Tapioca, and anything with seafood or eel in it.
