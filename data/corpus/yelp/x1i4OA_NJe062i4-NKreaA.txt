Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
For me personally, Pizzeria Mozza lived up to the hype. The food and service was excellent, and not too overpriced - for the quality. . . Went here for Lunch one afternoon, and sat at the Pizza Counter (where they make all the Pizzas), let me tell you, what a delight to watch (try it out if you can - no ressies required).. . We watched the Chef staff who were so detailed, make sure the dough, crust, sauce, toppings, etc. were meticulously perfect - each a work of art. From Clams, to Prosciutto, Truffle Oil, Figs, to Edible Flowers you can get almost any gourmet combination imaginable at Mozza.. . They also have a great selection of local micro-brews and premium production beers (Yay!) along with a comparable selection of great wines served by the quartina/bottle (Yay x2!).. . I think Pizzeria Mozza is a delightful culinary experience - and if you love gourmet pizzas then, it's a place you cannot miss!
