One of the first places I had eaten at arriving in Atlanta.  It has an amazing outdoor patio to eat on and watch the midtown traffic and rising sky scrapers.  The food is the usual paired with beer fare.  From burgers to salads and some pretty good wings.  What I like to get is something I dont find much on Atlanta menus are the Hot Dogs which are great here.  All in all a fun place to eat with friends or a late night drink after work with a basket of fries.
