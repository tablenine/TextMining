Had an outstanding meal here starting with a cheese course, then making our way through three pasta courses that the server split nicely between the two of us.  Highlights: gnocchi with braised oxtail (perfectly light and fluffy)  and the linguine with clams (mildly spicy and delicious!).  For the main I enjoyed the crispy duck served with a lemon wedge.  Very moist and tasty.  All was enjoyed with a knockout dolcetto for $57.   Great vibe, will try to sit at the mozzarella bar next time to watch Nancy do some plating.
