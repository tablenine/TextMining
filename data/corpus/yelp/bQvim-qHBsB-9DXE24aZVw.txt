Cool atmosphere.  Great wine and beer lists, and the staff are generally very knowledgable from my experience....and so far, the service doesn't feel too over the top.  The staff seem to generally care and show an interest in the items they offer.. . I've tried the frites and a few of the flatbreads....but I'm generally not in there for dinner, more so to have drinks....and maybe snack/share a few items with friends.  If that's what you're going for....you'll be pleased.  If you are looking for a sit-down dinner experience and are judging solely on the food.....maybe you'd see it differently.. . Overall, I'm glad I have this place so close to home....it's relaxing, even when the crowds start coming in as the hours pass on.  Great place to have some drinks....let time slip away, and maybe dig into a few dishes through the nite.
