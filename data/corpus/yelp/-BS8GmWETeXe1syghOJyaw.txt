Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
In my opinion, this place is waay overrated.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but really nothing to rave about.  We ordered a pizza and a pasta with clam sauce.  The pizza was decent, but I thought high rated pizza should have good dough, it was a bit disappointing.  The clam sauce on the pasta was very good.  . . Over all good food, but not worth driving across town for it.  Cash only also made it less favorable.
