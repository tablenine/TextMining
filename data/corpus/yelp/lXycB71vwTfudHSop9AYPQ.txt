Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
ive had better and made better grilled cheese sandwiches, i wouldnt recommended eating if your really hungry, its good as a snack but not as a hardy meal... I ordered a plain melt ($4), the cheesy mac and rib with bbq pork and onions ($7) and a cup of tomato soup ($2) With the overpriceyness of the mediocre grilled cheese sandwiches i shouldve just made it myself. The tomato soup is nothing special, tasted like campbell tomato soup mixed with marinara sauce. I guess this truck is a good idea if you really have no experience with turning on the stove and dont know what a pan is.
