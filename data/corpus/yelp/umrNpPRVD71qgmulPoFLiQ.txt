I ate here in January for a good friend's birthday with a large dinner party.  We had reservations (which I believe you pretty much have to have to be seated) and walked right in, even though I believe we were a little late.  Our seats were awkward as they were next to a narrow walkway where the wait staff walked by. Several times servers had to strategically maneuver large trays to make sure they didn't knock us in the head.  If you're a big eater (like me) this isn't the place where you come looking for something to fill your stomach.  We shared several dishes including, rolls, noodles, edamame and calamari between several of us.  We also ordered a few bottles of sake and some beers.  Total, the bill came out to about 40 dollars each.  The food was pretty good...as they say in spanish: "X".  I was actually expecting the bill to be a lot more.  The place is very trendy.  The DJ plays a variety of music, but mostly house. Everyone is there to see and be seen so have fun with it and you'll have a great time.
