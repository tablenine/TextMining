BRUNCH: I came here on a Saturday afternoon right after the Red Bull Soapbox Races.  The decor is pretty sweet !!  High ceilings, white walls all around.. . Everything in the store / deli section looked great but my fiancee and I did not pick up anything.  . . Brunch however was excellent.  I had the smoke salmon and my fiancee had the house salad.  I would definitely order the smoked salmon for brunch again, it was that good.  As for the salad, it was very refreshing granted the nice portions of shrimp provided.. . DINNER:  I came here for dinner on a Friday night.  We were a party of 10.  We had some appetizers in the bar area and personally, I think we could have waited a lot longer (the hostess said 45 minutes to an hour for our table) if it weren't the help from our bartender.  I think his name was Rob, I'm not sure.  But he checked up with the hostess a few times and was able to get us our table in about 45 minutes.. . As for the food, we shared our plates around.  I can't recall exactly what plates we had but the food I would give... 3/5.  I was not super impressed with the food, but the prices were pretty stellar ($25 a head with tax and tip).. . Two last things: Corkage Fee: free !!  I called in before we went to the restaurant and I asked them what their corkage fee was and they said that they do not have a corkage fee but to please have one bottle per table.  We brang two, and our waitress did not say anything (which was Tonya who was very informative and attentive).. . Second: sound.  The restaurant is extremely loud because the sound bounces off the high ceilings and the marble floors.  Just an FYI. . Still, I find myself definitely coming back soon !!  One of my favorites in downtown.
