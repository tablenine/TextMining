Can someone please tell me where you can find a burger joint that has a bouncer at the door to check IDs? Only in LA.. . Sure, the food has this after taste of pretentiousness.  Take a look at the photos of those burgers.  They even look cocky as fuck! But I gotta give FO credit.  It was holy orgasmic.  Did I mention this 5 star review of the FO burger is coming from someone that hates burgers?  For some reason it never pleased my palate.  Just the smell of them alone triggers nausea in me.   Yet there I was, wanting to make love to it.. . Now to their wide variety of beers. I'm not really a beer drinker.  I don't like beer.  I don't drink it often but when I do I'm burping like crazy.  And they're those burps where you're not so sure whether you're burping or if you're going to throw up in your mouth a bit. Then I tried their Peach Lambic.  Now dubbed the only beer I love!  Why? It's sweet and it kinda tastes like soda!  Trust me, if you hate beer, this will please you and leave you wanting more.. . This place is a must!  Try it out at least once just to see what all the hype is all about..
