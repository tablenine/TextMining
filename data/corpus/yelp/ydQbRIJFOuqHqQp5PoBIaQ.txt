Heard about this place so much over the years, and finally had the chance to drop by here after attending Ray Bradbury's 89th birthday party just down the street at Bookfellows yesterday.  I decided to give the fruit tart a try.  The fruit quality was decent but nothing outstanding.  Pasty cream/custard was decent.  Crust was way too buttery.  Overall score: "A-OK".  I took a peek at the various other items there and had the impression that I probably wouldn't like the food items (too meaty or greasy), but I might possibly consider trying a different dessert sometime, like one of their more unique, specialty items.. . Pay parking available on Brand (max 2 hrs for $2), although there seemed to be some public lots available just off Brand where you could park for free for 90 min.  I didn't get a chance to check them out since I was in a bit of a rush.
