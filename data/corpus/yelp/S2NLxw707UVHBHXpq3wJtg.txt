They have such a HUGE selection of pastries and desserts that it's so hard not to just buy one! I wish I worked here so I can sample all of their desserts! It's going to take several visits to try them all! I can't wait to go back! So far, my favorites is the creme brulee and the tiramisu! The only tiny complaint I have is that they put a lot of sugar on top of the creme brulee making it too sugary. The prices is hard to beat too! Creme brulee was $2.50 and the tiramisu was $3.50. They're all so decadent!. . As for lunch, we tried two of their steak sandwiches. Not bad.... but desserts is what I'll be coming back for! I found that their potato balls were not all that cracked up to be. The potato needed salt and the ham croquette was just ok. The meat pie however is another favorite of mine!. . Even though the line was very long during lunch on a Sunday, service we quick.
