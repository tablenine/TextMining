GIRL'S NIGHT OUT!. . Well I can say that I appreciated all the waiter attention that we got. I think we had THREE different waiters that were waiting on us. . . We grabbed a table near that DJ booth so that a fellow yelper knew we were there  support him. I ordered a Newcastle and some flaming hot nachos were VERY good BUT the beer was warm.  When my friend asked for a frosted glass they said they didn't have any (this IS a bar right?? )   I was just so disappointed about the warm beer. The waiter asked if we wanted some  ICE for our beer...????!!!!. No because the second thing worse than WARM beer is BEER with ice in it.  Needless to say the beers stopped at ONE.  . . But putting the warm BEER aside,  we had such a great time that I will be back!
