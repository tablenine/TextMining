Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I am the first to bitch and moan about LA not being a "breakfast town". But seriously, the abundance of actress/model/dancer/writer/producer-types and a town that is made for such schedules where people are out every night of the week mean that an abundance of breakfast hot spots are just not logical. Who wants to get up that early to eat when you're just going to bed at sunrise on any given day?. . But Griddle Cafe is my favorite bright spot in LA's emerging breakfast landscape. Pancakes bigger than your head, flavors more glutenous than anything Willy Wonka ever pushed, french pressed coffee made to order, and fresh juices make this place my favorite for that very important AM meal. Yes the wait is pretty much always insane, especially on weekends but, as long as you aren't too hungover to hang out and wait in the sun, it's well worth your time.
