Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
This is going to be very simply put.  . . This was hands-down, the best meal I've had...ever.  I'm a carnivore and love meat.  So this place was right up my alley.   You may think $56 per person is a lot.  But in all seriousness, if you go to Morton's or Flemings or another steak house, you'll pay over $60 for a steak.  Here it's $56 and you get an amazing variety of finely cooked meat.  And I mean finely.  . . The waiters (meat-boys) provide great service.  If you prefer your meat cooked a certain way, just let them know, they will be happy to provide you with carnivoric satisfaction to your liking. . . All the staff was quite pleasant.  The manager walked up to every table as they were finishing their meal to make sure everything was up to par.  . . I can't rave enough about this place.  All I can say is that going to Fogo de Chao has ruined my life forever.  No other brazilian steakhouse will ever measure up.  Ever....
