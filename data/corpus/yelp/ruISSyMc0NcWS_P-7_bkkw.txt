Bring out-of-town friends here for an authentic LA experience. Toast is just an all-around fun, happening, and tasty place to spend a warm LA morning. There are some drawbacks, but you can always look at the bright side of them! Parking in this neighborhood is hell, but you get to look at some beautiful scenery as you walk the 2+ blocks from your parking spot. (There's also valet.) You'll have to wait to be seated (especially outside, and ESPECIALLY on the weekend) but you get to see and be seen while doing it (the people-watching here is to die for). The waiters are flighty but they're also REALLY ATTRACTIVE! The menu is perfect assortment of large, eggy breakfast dishes, some traditional, some not. And the iced coffee is PERFECT. If this is your first time in LA or if you're a hardcore regular from up the street, you just gotta sit back, enjoy the food, enjoy the sun, and enjoy the view. . . Everything there is to love (and hate) in an LA brunch staple.
