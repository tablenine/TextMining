This place is pretty good!!  My friend from Pasadena took me here when i first moved to Southern California and it hit the spot.  Their sauces are a great compliment to the meat.  I didn't even care how hot it was in there the food was excellent.  I only took away 1 star because every time i went there, there was at least a 2 hour wait.  Don't go there when you're starving and want to eat right away, trust me.  Best time to go is on a Sunday morning when you have a massive hangover. try to go there around 10am to sign your name on the clipboard on their front door as early as possible so when they open @ 11am you can get seated quicker.  =)
