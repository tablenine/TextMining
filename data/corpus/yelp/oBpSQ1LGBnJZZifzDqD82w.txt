best cheese rolls ever ! just thinking about it makes me drool , the potato balls are a bit overwhelming when you bite into them and they have this funky chili smell but their pretty good. The red velvet cupcake I must admit wasn't as good as I was expecting. It was just like a normal cupcake anyone could've made. I didn't feel the "magic" in my mouth lols. Anyways, love the price and love the taste and I will definitely return when I am back in the area
