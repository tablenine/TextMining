Restaurant: Little Bangkok
Category: Chinese
Little Bangkok grew on me.  It hasn't changed at all since my last review.  I still don't like their Chinese menu and some of the appetizers are still bad.  The delicious Thai dishes are still all simple, low-brow, and street food like...there's no sublime culinary revelation to be had.  The interior is still tacky and old school.  . . I just can't justify giving a place 3 stars when in the end of the day I find myself eating here maybe 20 times in the last 3 years, when 9 times out of 10 I find myself preferring the comfort Thai food here over Tamarind Seed and a multitude of blown-up Thai establishments (so typical of Atlanta) serving more sophisticated (and sure, sometimes tastier) variations.  There are a lot of similar and great comfort Thai food places north OTP, some can give Little Bangkok a run for its money.  But for now it is my favorite comfort Thai food place in town, and it's close to my house.
