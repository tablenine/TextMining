Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
When Jonathan Gold says a restaurant is good, I usually believe him.. . But what was he thinking when he recommended the Apple Pan?. . the burgers were mediocre and far from amazing, or even plain ole' good. I wasn't digging the sauce. My mom's burgers are waaaaaaay better, maybe she should set up shop. Didn't even bother for the desert, which I'm sure we missed out on but I was hungry for a burger, not pie and ice cream. And I don't hit up restaurants specifically for their dessert, so I will probably never get to taste the pie since this was my first and last visit.. . the seating situation is different, and I wouldn't mind it so much if douchey westsiders were a little more, umm, considerate? god forbid. Or maybe I'm way too needy. Anyway, my boyfriend and I sat with 4 people in between us. They didn't even have their food yet and refused to slide over 1 seat so we could sit together.. . The servers, however, were friendly and very quick with bringing out the food. . . It wasn't absolutely terrible, but definitely not worthy of the hype. Personally, I'd rather go to In N Out.
