Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
Service is the big 'ding' for this place, which is always surprising in this part of town given the pile of other great restaurants all around. The tacos are indeed great, and fairly creative with new items popping up on the menu. A good choice for outdoor or open air dining (their front windows/bay doors open so you can sit covered, or simply outside). Only other complaint is the value is a little low for what you get, but not completely out of whack. If you like Mexican, my money goes to Zapatista in the South Loop!
