Restaurant: Grindhouse Killer Burgers
Category: Burgers
Sometime Saturday afternoon, I arrived with Ivan S. and our non-yelping friend, Ian at the Sweet Auburn Market, and we made our way to GKB.  After some confusion, we went to order at the register, and sat down for our respective burgers.  While we waited for our orders, we caught a soundless "Night of the Living Dead" projected on the wall.  . . As this was my first visit to GKB, I ordered the eponymous Grindhouse-Style double burger.  It arrived hot and wrapped, and I made a mess of my hands eating it.  The cheese on the burger was hot and dripping from the bun, and the patties were clearly handmade based on their irregular shape and the penchant for large chunks to break off and fall into the coagulating cheese.  I would grab those same chunks and dip my fingers into the cheese (and fallen onions) to savor the flavors of each bite.. . While sadly missing a go-go-dancer Rose McGowan with a machine-gun/rocket-launcher leg, based solely on my initial impression, Grindhouse serves up an excellent burger, and is definitely worthy of another visit.
