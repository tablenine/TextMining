Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
You'll enter in the dark with you eyes dilated adjusting to the dark,, you leave reborn like a baby that finds out how to turn on the TV. You are changed forever, you become a new person who understands the greatness of food and the role of steak in the diverse culinary world. Appeals to the most experienced foodie and enlightens the person who normally abstains from Maestros's namesake food.  . . It is the cheapest  in town, not the most affordable (affordability having nothing to do with value), but still the cheapest (as far as I'm concerned a ration of price to value). For what you pay you gain in multitudes. An experience no other steak place in the region are able to provide.. . The food is steak. The decor, the appetizers, the side dishes, the wine... even the bread all exists to complement the steak. A system that works flawlessly. It's a freaking heavenly steak and every dish on its menu easily are top notch, made with equal care to that of the main course. The effort is noticeable, making the steak a superior experience. Better than "Cut" and "Wolfgang" the competition in the vicinity, it's unequivocally THE steak place of Los Angeles.. . It's not quite a chain restaurant, but it's certainly not unique to this world, but as for the Los Angeles region, it is unique and in a league of its own.. . Oh yeah, not all their steaks are on the menu. They have some "off menu" dishes.
