Restaurant: La Pasadita
Category: Mexican
La Pasadita surpasses any burrito, taco, or chile relleno I've ever had. . . I usually order a carne asada burrito, and the worst thing that's ever happened was a lil too much cilantro.. . The only way you would get a better experience is if you had one of the Pasadita cooks in your own home! Enjoy!
