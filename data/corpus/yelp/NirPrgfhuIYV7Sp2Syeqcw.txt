You have to order the Hainan Chicken which is what they're known for.  I love the sauce...soo good!  I got the white meat because I was trying to be healthy but the dark meat looks so much better.  The rice is deliscous.. . We had the shrimp egg rolls for appetizers and they were yummy.  I also tried one of their pasta dishes but it wasn't as good as the Hainan chicken.. . Prices are pretty decent.  Parking can be found on the street.  Service is not too bad.
