So, I had the kara kara ramen last night. . . That shiet was spicy as hell. I think I burned my stomach. . . Anyways, its ramen with ground pork and some spicy seasonings. I couldnt finish it all, cuz it was too salty and burning my tongue.. . Usually, I get the house veggie ramen and add tofu and bamboo shoots to it. Should have stuck to that.. . I think they add MSG here, cuz I could not fall asleep last nite. Ugh.. and no, I didnt have any caffeine either! wtf. . . My ramen was about $10. But, $10 is not worth losing sleep over.
