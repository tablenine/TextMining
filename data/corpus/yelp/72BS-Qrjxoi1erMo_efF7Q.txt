Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Let me first start by saying I'm not big on the whole "rate chains low" anti corporate sentiment.  For me good food is good food.  That being said Cheesecake factory has its high and low points.. .         As other reviewers of have stated Cheesecake Factory offers large portions of standard American fare.  Despite the large portions, I'm still not sure I want to shell out $14 to $16 for Fried Fish, Chicken Fingers, and other easy to come by standard dishes (although I have).  The dishes, while not a great bargain, are always pretty decent (albeit nothing to get excited about). However, Cheesecake Factory (at least this location) features one of my pet peeves. I simply can't stand it when restaurants do not put prices next to their beer. It puts you in that awkward situation (if you want beer), do I ask for the price and look like a cheap skate (especially on a date) or do I risk paying $7 for a bud light? . .         As far as the cheesecake goes, it is really good. I've had the Godiva Chocolate &amp; Some type of Cookie Dough Cheesecake both came in generous tasty portions. This is the restaurants strong point (hints the name Cheesecake Factory).. .           The service at this location is excellent. The hostess was very friendly and the server was also friendly and attentive. If you hate tourists (or at least eating with them) don't go here.  Atmosphere is strange in an interesting way (I think it's supposed to be cheesecakes coming out of the walls and ceilings??) . .           Overall, I give it a solid 3 star rating. I'm not sure I would recommend going here for lunch or dinner (although I wouldn't say avoid it either), but definitely a great dessert spot.
