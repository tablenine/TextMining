Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
as i was reading the other reviews...i was cracking up at the remarks on the service...or lack there of at Manna. and i have to say, i don't know how many Korean places you've been to but living in a city filled with Koreans, and growing up with them my whole life, the service they provide here at Manna is pretty much standard at any Korean place. i mean there are a few places where they are nicer than others. but...i mean it is what it is. . . cheap food....lots of meat. loud speakers....an arena like setting, what else can you expect? except an experience. cheap champagne squirting around...weird happy birthday music...lots of smoke, pineapple sake, people yelling and crowded spaces. . . i came here thinking...just a normal Korean BBQ spot....but its definitely ...not that. go w a lot of friends, leave the vegetarian at home...i don't know how they would feel with all the raw meat being pass around on large patters all over the place...
