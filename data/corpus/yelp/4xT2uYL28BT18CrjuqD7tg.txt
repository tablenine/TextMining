Went here 2 years ago but I am catching up on the Yelp.  I had a great time.  The decor, atmosphere, and legs walking around were all exceptional.  . . I remember I loved the presentation and taste of the lobster bisque.  They bring out a shallow dish with lobster piled in the middle and then pour the  bisque over the top at the table.  I always get lobster bisque at restaurants when they have it, this was some of the best in my book.  . . Also ordered surf and turf and remember after two years that it was also very good.  . . Definitely recommend for both atmosphere and food, I do not remember the service very well but I have an impression it was adequate..
