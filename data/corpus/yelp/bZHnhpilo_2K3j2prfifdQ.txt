3.5 +.5 for company :) . . Oh hayyyy Grace L. Hahaha. . . I met up with an old friend to grab brunch at this neighborhood gem. . Grace suggested Over Easy and I agreed as soon as I read "goat cheese" on their menu. Hehe. . . We were greeted by a friendly hostess and also pretty taken by their cutesy setup. Actually, I was super taken by my seat cushion... kinda memory foam pillow-like.. so comfortable 8) . . Grace L. got something sweet(the blueburry crunch pancakes with my favorite detail: the cinnamon butter),  and I got something savory(the nueva mexicana omelet which had corn, tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, GOAT CHEESE, &amp; salsa...but no sour cream). We be balancing each other out. Haha. Also, I agree with Grace, my omelet was SO SHINY ...looool! Didn't realize that till now. Funnay. (look at shiny omelet pic). My only complaint: my omelet was lukewarm. . . Good start to our future foodventures! foodeavors!
