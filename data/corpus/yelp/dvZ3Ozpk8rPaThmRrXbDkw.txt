I went to this place after checking out Yelp reviews for good pancake houses in Hollywood.  All I can say is... WOW!  Those are the biggest freakin' flapjacks I've ever seen in my LIFE!  . . The pancakes are amazing, you can special order them with any of the ingredients they have on the list... we made our own "pancake/cheesecake/blueberry/strawberry" pancakes.  Hmm... now that i wrote that out, it doesn't sound very appealing... but they were awesome!. . One short stack can easily feed 3 people and still have left-overs.  The other breakfast food is good too, and prices aren't bad, but the portion sizes on everything else is normal.. . The other great thing about this restaurant is that there's parking available in the (QFC?) parking lot, right behind the restaurant, which saves the $ and hassle of finding a spot and checking the meter.. . The only thing lacking was the service.  It wasn't too busy when we went, and yet we had to wait forever for our waiter to come by and get our order, check on us, and get out check.  Other than that, I love this place &amp; wish it didn't close at 2 or 4pm!!  :(
