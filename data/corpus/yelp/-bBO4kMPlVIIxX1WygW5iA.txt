An old friend of mine wanted to meet me here for a late meal, so before I headed out I came over to Yelp to check out the reviews.  Holy crap, what a mixed bag.  I was totally going there ready to fight Brad to the death, however he didn't seem to be there tonight so he got off lucky.  Here was my experience for a Sunday night:. . The place is pretty dead.  My friend was waiting for me at the bar and we were immediately sat.  The waitress all throughout was attentive and nice, and offered suggestions when asked, and everything she suggested I liked.  Granted what I ordered was total heart-attack ammunition, but here goes:. 1. Moshe Cristo.  It's a Monte Cristo essentially.  It didn't come with any sauces, and I am used to having some strawberry something or other to dip it in.  The waitress brought out syrup, apple sauce, and some strawberry jam.  My only complaint with the sandwich... too much meat to fit in my mouth.  A real jawbuster.. 2. Fries.  The sandwich didn't come with anything else so I ordered fries. Not horrible, but nothing special whatsoever.. 3. Cherry Pepsi.  Pepsi with cherry syrup.  I had two, they are fantastic and she refilled it for free.. 4.  Plain old cheesecake was awesome.. . All in all, my experience here was good to above average.  I'd be back... however after reading the other reviews it sounds like it's a good place to avoid in the mornings, and if I was ever treated like some of the other people have been there is no way I'd be back.  . . Main complaint: it doesn't seem like it's that expensive, but it is!  Granted I ordered dessert but I spent way more money than I thought I would for a monte cristo. Oh well.
