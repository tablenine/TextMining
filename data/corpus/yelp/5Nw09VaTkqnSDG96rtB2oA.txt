Restaurant: LA Mill Coffee Boutique
Category: Desserts
I went here just about a week ago with one of my friends. We heard about this "Coffee Boutique" that has just opened in Silverlake, so we thought we would go check out what the Hype was.. . I have to say that this place's interior is more that of a "Boushie Cafe" And not what you normally expect when going to a Coffee house.. . oops! I mean "Coffee Boutique" ...well actually I have never been in a Coffee Boutique before, until now. . . Let me cross that off of my list!. . Anyways the food was super expensive and so was the coffee. This LA MILL  coffee can be purchased over at the Magic Cafe &amp; gas station(Echo park)  for HALF of what they charge at this "Coffee Boutique". . . I do have to say that the food I ordered was super delicious ( they have interns from Le Cordon Bleu Culinary school working in the kitchen,SMART!!) But for the price it was for a "Pinkies up" Ham Sandwich , Chips &amp; some olives it was a little more then I would have wanted to pay.. . So after...... . 2 cups of coffee (Their Guatemala blend was super yummy!). Potato &amp; Leek soup. Ham Sandwich &amp; chips. . The bill was $$$ 50.00 $$$. . I was really taken back by it, but then again it is not just another coffee shop   :::Announcer voice:: it's LA MILLS COFFEE BOUTIQUE. . . I will probably only return there after I hit the lotera
