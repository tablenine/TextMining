Restaurant: Daddy D&#39;z BBQ Joynt
Category: Barbeque
I really like this BBQ "Joynt."  It is just as good as Fat Matt's and I left feeling full and satisfied.  Our waitress was awesome and my boyfriend and I walked away with a food coma!  Good stuff for sure.  I tried their pulled chicken with their signature BBQ sauce, steak fries, broccoli casserole and green beans!  I pretty much cleaned up my plate and walked away full and content!  Check this place out if you're in the area. A definite "thumbs up!"
