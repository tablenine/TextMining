Category: Hot Dogs
This place has great dogs but the service is horrible.  I got there at 11:57 am, must before lunch hour, and was about 12th in line.  About 50 minutes later I had a hot dog and some fries.  Very good, but I can't drive to a place to wait this long.  People were at the register for five minutes.  Order a dog and move on.  Finally, it appeared some of the employees behind the desk had a "meeting of the minds" and then some guy comes up and tries to explain the menu to me (I was still in line ofcourse) to make sure I don't take too long.  Too little too late.  I mean the food is good, but people get dogs because they are quick, if I want to wait an hour for a dog I can go to opening day at Dodger stadium.  Plus it is just a respect issue.  They are trying to get peple from downtown who work and can't take forever for lunch -- pretend like you are trying to move it.  They don't even start cooking the dogs until you order.  You must be kidding.  This place could be great --- but right now it is just a place to wait.
