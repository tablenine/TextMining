Restaurant: The Real Chow Baby
Category: Asian Fusion
I've been to stir-fry/Mongolian BBQ joints like this before.  And it's pretty much all the same damn thing.  The quality of the food totally depends on you, which can be good or bad.  The key to a good meal here is to know what goes together and not to over do it with the sauces or spices.  Hint: Even though there's a big spoon in the tubs of various spices, do not add an entire spoonful for one bowl.  . . The Real Chow Baby is also rather sneaky.  All of their ads say the dinners cost $11.99.  But for an extra buck you can get endles stir fry.
