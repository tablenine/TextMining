Phoenix dim sum yay, yay, yay.. . Is it the greatest on the planet? No.. . For me, eating dim sum is sort of like eating fried chicken. You know what you're getting, it's going to be tasty and delicious.. . While waiting for a friend at Phoenix, I sat out near the front room and was not bothered. There were lots of people coming up for lunch (myself included) all in a hurry for dim sum! When my friend finally arrived, we grabbed a table right away and were helped to some tea.. . A picture menu was summoned (I guess they do not have as many carts running around during weekday lunchtime) so we picked and picked and picked as many goodies as we could get our hands on. Fun rolls, shumai, shrimp dumplings, spare ribs, taro balls, turnip cake, and all manner of dim sum classics rained down onto our table.. . We are merrily and were better off for the experience. Like after eating fried chicken, you feel very full and tired after some dim sum. Watch out on Sunday, the waiting line is treacherous!
