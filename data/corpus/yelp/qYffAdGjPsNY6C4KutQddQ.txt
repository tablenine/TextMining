Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
If you are in a hurry DO NOT go to Porto's , because you will be waiting for about 15 minutes for someone to get your order and then another 5-10 minutes to receive your food, BUT on that note the food is yummy the potato balls and the Croquettes are really good too, although you probably gained 5 pounds with each bite.. They have good desserts too, I've had the strawberry short cake and carrot cake and both were delish!. I took a star away because of the crazy wait!. and make sure you get a number ASAP once u enter, since they call you by your number.
