there is some good stuff happening here.  particularly good-their cookies and desserts (except for the "chocolate clouds" one-avoid that one like the plague) and bread.  you really can't get any better than a loaf of their country white or rosemary olive oil.  it makes a pretty bad ass grilled cheese at home.  . . they also have some pretty solid sandwiches and daily specials to mix it up.  i don't have anything great to say about their salads or pizzas, however.  a little sub-par...but not BAD, per se.  do yourself a favor and stick with something fantastic-like the chicken club.  it's fabulous!
