First time I came here there was an outrageous, 2 hour wait or something, so we didn't get to try it. . . I came back for lunch on a weekend and loved it. In the summer, the outdoor area is the place to sit. It's beautiful and fun to do some people watching. The food was better than most Mexican restaurants I've been to and my friend who is Mexican actually agrees with me! (That never happens when we talk about Mexican food.). . The salsa was spicy and the enchiladas I had were huge and delicious. I haven't been back in a while and now I'm wondering why I haven't!
