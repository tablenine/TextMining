Came in here for a pint and a snack with my sis last night and really enjoyed it. It was a Monday and they had $1 Mini buffalo chix sammys and $5 Winter warmers (a choice of about 6 warm yummy drinks from mulled cider to hot toddy).. . I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken sandwich and 2 filled me up. The chicken is so moist and I really like that it's pulled rather than a chunk of chicken. It's one of the best chicken sandwiches I've had.. The hummus plate was very well presented with lightly steamed or blanched broccoli, carrot slices, pita, bagel chips, and cucumbers. The hummus had a little too strong of a flavor to me (tasted like indian curry a little) but it was still very refreshing and I'd eat it again.. . I enjoyed a pint of Rouge Mocha Porter which was delicious and my sister had one of their specialty beer mixtures. I can't remember the name but it was decadent with dark cherry flavors. It was amazing.. . We also shared a Hi-Hat which is a muddled basil, grape, vodka, and Â ginger ale and is so light and delicious, I could probably drink 20 of them.. . The music wasn't too loud and was an ecclectic mix. I didn't hear one song that I knew while I was there, but it wasn't really annoying at all like some places can be.. . The staff was great and the food and drink selection was fantastic. I'll definitely be back :)
