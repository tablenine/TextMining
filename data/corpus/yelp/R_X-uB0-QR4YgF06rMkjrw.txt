Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
One star is for the service and that's about it. I love garlic but somthering garlic on top of grade D food is just a gimmick to mask what the underlying crap they serve. Â  Also what is the theme of the inside anyway? I felt like I walked into the home of someone who decorated their house with collections from years of visiting garage sales. The food tasted like they received leftovers from cheap weddings held at big boy's and just put their signature stamp of garlic slop all over it. I don't even want to start on the drinks from the bar. It amazes me a place like this stays in business but what is more amazing is the droves of people that go here instead of the million other authentic restaurants in la. My stomach and the taste in my mouth is probably as bad if a vampire ate here.
