Annette rocked it our night. Having a party of 30 is hard enough and she got all of us all our drinks and food, check was flawless and drinks tasty for sure. I don't really like chain type places but this place has been good to me the last few times I have been here. Mac n cheese, beer, burgers, yep that is my WHITE comfort food. Even though I love me plenty of Asian comfort food sometimes I just need a little of this stuff. Yes their staff and food can be hit or miss I would imagine but based on my recent few experiences I am still a fan for now. Beside this location has better service than the others I have been to in DTLA and LBC. I will likely be back again from time to time.
