Dear Kogi,. . I finally got to hook up with you. It's taken a while, I apologize, but our schedules never seemed to align, until recently.. You were near my work, so I headed on down and surprisingly there was no line!. . I quickly ordered each one of your tacos, sans the tofu, cause I don't do vegetarian. I have a shark photo in my profile for a reason. The chicken was so-so, but your Bulgogi (Korean short rib) was the winner to me. The 3 tacos didn't fill me up, and it ended up being $6 and some change.. . I can say it was pretty good, maybe I overhyped you mentally in my mind, but it wasn't super good. I will definitely keep coming back when you are in my neck of the woods and try your other items. You're just a concept I can't get over!. . Till next time,. . Ed
