I must say I am very impressed with this place.. . I was first exposed to it at work, where we received free chikin and carne asada burgers... and I was thinking okay... a veggie burger... it should taste alright.... . The taste was awesome!. . I've since gone to the place for a V-Burger which was of course delicious. Nice lunch atmosphere in the place.
