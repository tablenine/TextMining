I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into SPOON to have lunch with my awesome friend.  The decor was super modern for a thai place and I didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised by our entrees.  We got a chance to try the wide noodle pad thai with tofu and green curry.  If you like spicy then definitely as for the "THAI SPICY" and you'll get what you paid for!. . Great food, good service and you walk away stuffed and satisfied.. . Check them out next time you're on Marietta St. and are craving some yummy Thai!
