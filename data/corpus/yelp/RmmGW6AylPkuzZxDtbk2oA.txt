I love love love the MANLY BURGER.  A tender, juicy beef patty, beer-cheddar cheese, smoked salt onion strings and bacon lardons.  But what the heck is a lardon?  And does it matter?  For me it did because you can't spell lardon without lard!  I had to look it up.. . Thanks to Wikipedia, I now know a lardon is a small strip or cube of pork fat used in a wide variety of cuisines to flavor savory foods and salads.  So it's basically a chunk of lard.  Translation?  Like every pork byproduct, it taste absolutely delicious when added to anything!. . Unfortunately, the Manly Burger and it's glorious lardons are all that I love about Umami Burger.  I didn't care for the parking (valet for this place is silly-- find street parking), the wait (always a line for dinner), the prices (a bit overpriced for the size of the burger-- I could probably eat 2 of them), the regular fries (meh), the sweet potato fries (sweet meh) or the onion rings (onion meh).  I also wasn't blown away by the classic Umami Burger when I tried it.  It's just not as good as Father's Office.  Yup, I said it.. . Long review short, even though Umami Burger is a lot of hype, their burgers and pretty good, especially the Manly Burger.  But Father's Office is still better bang for your buck and your taste buds.. . 3.5 stars
