Amazing amazing Salvadorian food. I always loved tamales but Salvadorian ones are quite different. The pork dish was divine--simply melted in my mouth.  And pupusas?!? Wow!  The service is so welcoming that it made me feel like an old friend coming to visit. That is a lost art.. . This place is going on my short list.
