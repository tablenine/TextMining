hard salami sandwich &amp; potato salad. . best combination ever.. this is not a place for a vegetarian. . . the waiters are not super cool, but the service is quick and delicious.. also, the kibitz room is next door if you want to make a classy night of it.. i have only ordered sandwiches from here, never a salad (terrible drunk food) or egg dish, etc. the meat is where its at.
