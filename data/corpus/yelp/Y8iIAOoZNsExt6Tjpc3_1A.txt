Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
The buritos at El Tepeyac are more renowned for their size than their quality but that doesn't mean this place isn't worth a trip. If you were to put together a fun eating tour of LA, El Tepeyac warrants Â consideration.. . You can avoid the line by ordering around the side and eating outside but don't. Sitting inside is an essential part of the experience.
