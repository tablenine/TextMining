Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen

Savoy is the Cafe Deux Magots of Alhambra. East Valley Boulevard substitues for Saint-Germain des Pres. The Hainan Chicken Rice a formidable threat for a roasted chicken. The cafe tables outdoors are always filled, but instead of garlic-drenched Frenchmen sucking Gitanes, we have here an entire generation of first and second generation of Taiwanese and Hong Kong kids. If you have to order three things here, I'd go in this order: Hainan Chicken Rice. Shrimp rolls. Seafood salad. No one orders the pizza and pasta, although I'm sure it must be good. For bevvies, the Chysanthmum Iced Tea is remarkable--chilled, sweet and smokey. The Iced Cappucino is also a must--more along the lines of a Vietnamese Iced Coffee than a Starf*cks disaster on wheels. For those of you not in the know, Hainan Chicken Rice is a room temperature chicken, cut up with lovely steamed rice with soy sauce, hot sauce and a mound of what amounts to ginger pesto. You dip your chicken into the sauces and eat spoon each portion with rice. BTW, HCR is a knife, fork and spoon affair--don't ask for chopsticks.
