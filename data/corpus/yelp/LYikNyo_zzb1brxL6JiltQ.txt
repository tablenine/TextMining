Small and Quaint! ^_^ At first I thought it was going to be a medium to big sized restaurant, but it turns out that I have been passing by this place a million times on my way to Phoenix Inn for lunch.  It's right across the street from it and I have been missing out on the simple yummy goodness of Hainan Chicken.  . . Albeit, I have never had Hainan Chicken and I didn't know what to expect.  At first I was thinking that it would be bland and boring but it was surprisingly tasty with the rice.  I am sure everything is soaked in chicken fat and simple seasonings to make the rice so tasty and complimentary to the chicken.  They basically debone most of the chicken and give 3 simple sauces.  There is ginger, soy sauce, and a spicy sauce.  . . I actually detest ginger but I think it really adds and brings out the flavor of the chicken.  Sure, it is a simple dish but it's simply good! ^_^ I liked it enough to order some for home and thank goodness I did! The portion was actually pretty big and it filled me up before the horrid Christmas dinner! Thank you Savoy Kitchen!. . We got there in the nick of time on X-mas Eve because they closed at 5PM and they were still friendly.  There was a lot of holiday spirit in the air and the servers were sweet.  I tried their Curry Beef Stew and that wasn't anything special.  So my advice is stick with the Hainan Chicken that almost EVERYONE ELSE HAS! Lol . . I will definitely be back for my take out in the future! ^_-
