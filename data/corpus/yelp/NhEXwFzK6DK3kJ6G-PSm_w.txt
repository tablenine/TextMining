If you want to impress that first date this is the place to take her.  Just follow the coys to the bar and order up.  The wines can do damage in more ways then one, so be aware of the prices before going.  The food servings are a bit small, but the sophisticated combinations of spices make the dishes a ringer to the taste buds.  . . Ambiance, opulence, excess and overindulgence is the words that come to mind when thinking about this place.  Personally, I like the fishies.
