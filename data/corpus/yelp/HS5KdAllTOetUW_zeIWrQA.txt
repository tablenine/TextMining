LOVE this place!!! I just moved here from San Francisco and when I visited my boyfriend I always demanded to go to Noche!  I seriously craved this place when I went back to SF and even yelped places there that would fill my void.. The tapas are sooooo good!  Some dishes are not worth the price but you can never go wrong with the following items:. *Fried Chicken and mashed potatoes. * Lobster Tail. *Pulled Pork. *Iceberg wedge. It is usually pretty busy so we try to get there earlier so we can snag a seat on the patio.  The vibe is great, the staff is nice, and I never leave here disappointed!  I still have yet to come on Sunday but I heard it is poppin! lol!. I highly recommend Noche! See you there!!
