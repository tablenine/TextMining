Restaurant: Luckie Food Lounge
Category: Lounges
Go to Luckie for the atmosphere and the drinks...not the food!! Its a nice place to see the "beautiful people" and have great (expensive) drinks but as far as dining, that's a negative. I have the shrimp and grits which were awful. My friend had the fish tacos which were awful. My boyfriend had a streak which was extremely tough. So like I said go for the drinks and the cool hip environment.
