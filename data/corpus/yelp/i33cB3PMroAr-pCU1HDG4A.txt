When you think about taking your girl for a first romantic dinner date in this upper class Vietnamese  restaurant, you couldn't be more wrong, brotha! Well the Beverly Hills part is right, but who will get some romancing after cracking crab leg with bare hands and wolfing down oily garlic noodle? At least after two minty gum or rinsing your mouth with antiseptic mouthwash, you will... . . Crustacean might fool you with high-end decor, Koi aquarium underfoot, and live jazz/classic tune. But when I think about Vietnamese food I prepare to be unglamorous, Phò anyone? Oh well, let's toss all the negativity because nevertheless, I worship their garlic noodles and roasted crab, they're FANTABULOUS!. . To make me look less barbaric while eating them combo, I chow down some garlic noodle first and midway I swift my gear to cracking and licking them crabs. Because holding a crab leg on my left hand and forking some garlic noodles on my right at the same time might be the last thing that my boyfriend would like to see.... . pics- . http://www.yummycrave.....
