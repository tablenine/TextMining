The service is so-so, but the pancakes are amazing--definitely worth a visit. Unless you have a bottomless stomach, don't order a regular stack--you can get a single pancake, or a short stack of two if you're famished, and that is more than enough for most people. If you go during off-peak hours (early on weekends and weekdays) then there should be little to no wait.
