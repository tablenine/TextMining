O.M.G. their cheese roll RULES!!!. . everything is good there. Â i think everyone knows about this place so i am not going to say more.... i am pretty lucky that i haven't really been to the store to experience the long wait (or unlucky cus i need to really go and check out EVERYTHING myself?), there are always friends or customers (favorite!!!! lol) would go and buy bunch.... . . LOVE IT!!! and yes i really do need to go there and check out other stuff someday cus all i've been had are all pastries, not their sandwich! (not that i am complaining.... ). . oh yummy, let me take another bite now...
