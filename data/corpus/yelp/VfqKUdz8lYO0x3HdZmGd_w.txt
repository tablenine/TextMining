Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
I'm sort of a Versailles convert. . . Of the restaurants I frequented while living in the neighborhood, Versailles had plopped itself down near the bottom of my list.  Nothing too special, but nothing terrible either.. . Nonetheless, this past Tuesday I found myself headed here (against my will, of course) with Richard L. and some friends who had never been; it came highly recommended from some (other) friends.  I figured, worst come to worst, I'd just a eat a heap of plantains.  I like those.. . Of course, eater-of-words that I am, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit this time 'round; the inside has gotten a face lift since I'd last come, with nicely painted stucco-colored walls, better lighting, and decent decor.  The service seemed a bit more attentive as well.  And the food, well.  The garlic bread starter was warm and buttery, and the camarones con arroz amarillo were pretty darn good.  The pulled pork looked amazing, though I didn't try it myself.  Oh, and I think I mentioned that I love plantains...  I was not disappointed on that front.  They were delish!  I told Richard L. that maybe we would come back again BEFORE three more years have passed.. . For Cuban, Versailles is THE restaurant everyone points to.  It's worth a visit, or two or three.
