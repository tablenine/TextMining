I've only ever been here for HAPPY HOUR.. . The beer selection is great....and i appreciate how it is categorized into types.  Most other places assume we know all about types of beers and can tell what they are simply from the name.  Yardhouse helps out a bit by putting them in categories such as Lager, Belgians, Porters, etc. . . Most appetizers are half price during happy hour as well...bar type food....but pretty legit....
