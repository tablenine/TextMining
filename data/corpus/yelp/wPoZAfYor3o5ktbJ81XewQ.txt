Don't let the Disneyland type long lines deter you from enjoying one of their famous sandwiches. There is something to be said about an institution that is over 100 years old. You have to see what the "hype" is about. . . Mr. B and I recently went here after a Dodgers game and were not disappointed. We split a single dipped beef sandwich and a single dipped turkey sandwich. If you get double dipped it would probably be too soggy for our taste. The rolls were fresh and soft and probably made that morning. It's a very simple sandwich no fancy ingredients. If you want some added kick enjoy some of their spicy mustard. It's the horseradish that will get you but it doesn't hurt to add a little. We also enjoyed lemonade for 75 cents! You can't even get that at a kids lemonade stand. We also split a beer which was cold and reasonably priced. One of things that impressed me about the beer was that it was very cold something you sometimes cant even get at a bar!. . We will definitely come back to try the sides and a different type of sandwich.
