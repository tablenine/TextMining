I love this place!!! I'm not one to "waste calories" on bar type food unless it's really good and I always pig out at Umami Burger. My favorites are the socal, hatch, and manly burgers. I do think their signature burger is a bit overrated compared to those others. I love the onion rings (great batter) and the fries are good too. I do think it's a little pricey. I do wish the burgers were a little easier to eat (the are kind of messy) and it is a little pricey (but it's LA, so it's not outlandish). I also love how they sell the ice cream sandwiches from milk and they have a great bottled ginger they sell too.
