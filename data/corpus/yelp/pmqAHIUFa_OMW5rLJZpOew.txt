THEY SERIOUSLY NEED TO OPEN A SECOND LOCATION!!!!!!!. THIS PLACE IS WAY TOO CROWDED FOR THEM NOT TO.. __________________________________________________ ___. . The food here is actually good. It is pretty much authentic. The place is always crowded, though. The lines are like those at a stadium's concession stand. They are a big hassle and make you want to avoid going. The service itself is pretty quick. They pull your order as you wait at the counter. Some people obviously go here because they like crowds. I hate crowds!! All the nudging, bumping, breathing in your ear. Does any non-desperate person enjoy that? Move!! . . I think to date I have tried most of their items. I like burritos, but here the meat is not really to my liking. I was expecting it to be ground beef, instead it is stewed beef in a ruddy Â red sauce. They only have two sizes of drinks and no refills. It is good for fast, authentic mexican food, but seriously way too crowded.
