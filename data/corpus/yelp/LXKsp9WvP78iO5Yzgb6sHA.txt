A lapse of judgment lead me to the Kogi truck.  I knew it would not be worth my time once the friends of Kogi started throwing themselves in traffic to save a parking spot for the beast.. . The good news is that it tastes Korean.  I was expecting to be punked with a run of the mill Mexican taco.  The bad news is it's just a mediocre taco from a truck.
