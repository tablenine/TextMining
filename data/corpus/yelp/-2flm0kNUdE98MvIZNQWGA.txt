Wanna part with $20? Head to Alcove!  The food is expensive, can't deny that.  But, get your camera out, 'cause they know how to plate the food!  If Mrs. Butterworth made french toast and wanted it to look good, she'd hire the folks at Alcove.  I can't complain about the price, because you're paying to eat in a great little house and getting VERY good service. I was going to say the huevos rancheros sucked, but I'll modify that to say it was on the healthy side.  (And "healthy" and "huevos rancheros" obviously don't go together.) The other three orders at our table were great.. . They provide valet parking for $3.50 in back (you have to look out for the small driveway) if you don't want to hunt for street parking.  Nice touch for breakfast!  You order at the counter, get a number, and find your seat.  They bring the food to you.  Try it.  It was featured in an article in AAA's Westways Magazine a month or two ago.  Good place.  Tell them to turn the music down if you can't hear your own peeps at the table.
