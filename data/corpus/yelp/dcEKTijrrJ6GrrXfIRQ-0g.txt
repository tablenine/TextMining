Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's Tacos is a good bet decent Mexican food. I would give it a higher review but it always seems to be a chore for me to go. Lines are long during all parts of the day (I live in the neighborhood and see queues constantly) and the service generally takes a while. I'm not a big fan of the place your order and stand around for 6 minutes before paying and picking up.. . Admittedly, the tacos are pretty tasty. I've had the beef burritos a couple of times. They give chips and salsa but the salsa is not very flavorful (think watery tomato stuff). As for the cost-- the tacos are cheap but can add up fast -- keep in mind that they charge extra for cheese.
