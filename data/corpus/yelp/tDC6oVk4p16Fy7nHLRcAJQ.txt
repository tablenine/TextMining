I only ever get coffee here but it is real good. I drink it slowly through out the day - eventually it goes cold but it still tastes good. That is the sign of a good brew.. . Two tips:. . - If you want soy, don't ask at the counter. You can ask the guys making your coffee and save $0.50. - Put some chocolate powder in it instead of sugar. It is good quality and tasty.
