This place has been a favorite to my work and it very good for large parties. The service is great and the waiters are not so bad to look at either. I always get something with Ahi Tuna and I have always enjoyed the food. The chips are pretty good, but sometimes not so great. On the weekends the restaurant is packed, but come Monday night, they have a great deal with 30% off all meals and select drink discounts. It's not so busy then as well. If you have trouble seeing beware! There is major mood lighting and if your eyes can't adjust you'll be unable to read the menu. My favorite part, they're open really late!
