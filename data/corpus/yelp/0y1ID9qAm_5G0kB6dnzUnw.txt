Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
For 55 years there has been once place to go at 2am for good Pastrami. Johnnie's Pastrami is a Culver City landmark. Just around the corner from Titos Tacos you find this 1950's neon clad restaurant. I have lived down the street from it for five years and never seen it empty. It's the hub of the late shift workers, Cops, Teens, Sony employees, and Pastrami aficionados. You can sit inside at the counter and bask in the smells of cooking meat or relax on the patios with their fire pits. Like the menu says "The juke boxes on the counters and the booths are all original. So are some of the waitresses." This place has a very retro feel because it really is old, not some replica idealized version. It features my favorite thing about a late night eatery: Fast fresh food cooked to order.. . The four page menu is always the same, night and day. So are the reasonable prices. Johnnie's is priced right on the mark for quality food. $9.75 gets your choice of Hot Pastrami or Corned Beef on Rye or a French Roll. The Menu runs the typical 50's dinner gambit. Hamburgers, Chili Dogs, Sandwiches, Taco's, Milk shakes, Fries, and Fried Chicken. The big attraction is always the Pastrami.. . Note: This review also appeared on LAist and was written by me.
