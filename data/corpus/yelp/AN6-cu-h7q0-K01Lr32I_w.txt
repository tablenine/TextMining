Restaurant: Craft Atlanta
Category: American (New)
I just ate at Craft Atlanta three weeks ago.  To say I was unimpressed would be a complete understatement.  My dining companion and I shared appetizers and entrees so I had the opportunity to taste five dishes.  Here is the rundown:. . Sweetbreads and kumquat:  The only acceptable dish of the evening.  The citrus wonderfully complemented the perfectly cooked sweetbreads.  I would give this appetizer an "A".. . Pork Belly:  I was so excited to try the pork belly, as it had been recommended.  It was the single most disppointing dish of the evening.  We were served five rectangular strips of "pork belly".  From the outside they looked perfect:  perfectly bronzed and carmelized.  Unfortunately, they were inedible because there was no trace of pork.  We were served five rectangles of nicely browned fat.  There was not a trace of pork.  I understand that pork belly by definition is mostly fat.  It can't be ALL fat.. . Caesar salad:  Not much to say here except that it was totally unremarkable and unseasoned.  I've had better at the past 30 restaurants where I have ordered a caesar salad.. . Diver scallops:  Not bad, but again, what happened to nicely seasoned, Tom?. . Beef short ribs:  OK, so I get the concept that this is sort of comfort food, so I wasn't expecting some glorious piece of beef here.  But it tasted like beef stew you'd get at a covered dish supper.  It wasn't awful, but it was far from extraordinary.. . Our meal was almost $300 for two (granted we had a $130 bottle of wine) but please.  $14 for a Caesar salad with anchovies that tasted so devoid of flavor it was almost as if they had rinsed the anchovies in water just to make sure the salad was ultra bland.  $16 for strips of pure fat with absolutely NO pork?  No way I would return to this restaurant.  I will say that our service was fabulous and we were treated perfectly.
