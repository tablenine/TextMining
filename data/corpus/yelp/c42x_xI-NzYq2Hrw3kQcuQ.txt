Restaurant: The Highlander
Category: Dive Bars
I have been going to the Highlander for over 10 years...yes, I'm getting old. Anyway, this place is very close to my heart. The beer is affordable and the food is freakin fantastic! Yes, the tots rock but I also crave the black forest pasta and this bar knows how to cook a steak...and pork loins! Actually, I don't think I've ever been disappointed in the food no matter what I ordered. Everything is superb!. . Also contributing to my love for this place is the air hockey, pool and pinball. The fact I can bring my dog on the patio and the servers love on her and bring her water. The servers are delightfully smart assy and there is enough ink in this place to publish a newspaper. Inked up boys are kind of a weakness. You can even get take out and bring the food upstairs to the Independent because they support each other like that.. . I love you Highlander! Never change and never go away!. . UPDATE 9/16!! Highlander no longer allows dogs on the porch because some dork compained. They may start allowing it again in the future but for now the doggie door to the Highlander has been closed. I'm not changing my review based on this but it does make me a little sad
