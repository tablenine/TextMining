Restaurant: Agave Restaurant
Category: Tex-Mex
Agave is now my favorite place. The guacamole is a must as an appetizer. Their famous fried chicken is a can't miss if this is your first time going. Add some sides like mac and cheese or collard greens, and you'll be instantly hooked. Â If drinkings your game, take a look at the huge selection of tequila and wine. And the best part is their staff. They are very friendly, helpful with recommeding good choices, and are just as enthusiastic about the food as you will be.
