Category: Sushi Bars
Short Version: Good food and a knock-out view.. . Long Version: This restaurant is known for its view, and with good reason. That alone is a good reason to go. The service is great and it's a classy joint from the first moment to the last. I found the food to be very good and the drink selection to be outstanding. Definitely a romantic spot and if you want to impress, this is a place to go.
