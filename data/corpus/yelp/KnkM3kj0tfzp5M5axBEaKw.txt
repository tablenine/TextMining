Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
wow, i'm very impressed with this little restaurant. i've heard about it from friends, even got invited to a birthday dinner once but never made it for whatever reason. but now that i've finally made it there for lunch, I LOVE IT! the bread was great, the halibut salad was divine... i can't wait to go back to try out their pumpkin soup and perhaps a more solid dish.. . it's so cute inside. it gets really packed during lunch time. i recommend making a reservation before you head out there so you're guaranteed a seat instead of waiting outside in the cold.
