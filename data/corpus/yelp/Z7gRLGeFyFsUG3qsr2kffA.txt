Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Back in college, all my buddies, aka American, raved about this place, and so, a couple years later, I finally checked it out (being dragged there for a birthday).  For the all you can eat meat, it's not too bad, but I'd rather go to Tahoe.  The meat is fresher and the service doesn't make you feel like you're bothering them.  At times I actually felt bad flagging them down to ask for more ban-chan.  All in all, if you know Korean BBQ, it will be costly so unless you're a poor college student, I think the low price, poor quality, and cheap atmosphere is still not worth it.  . . By the way, while walking back to our car, my buddies and I caught one of the employees taking a piss in the corner - where "clean" dishes were stacked.  When he noticed us, he zipped up and then went right back to doing his job. Yeahhhhh....lovely.
