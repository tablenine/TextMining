Restaurant: The Vortex Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Burgers
Great Restaurant.  I have only eaten there once, but have ordered to go three times.  I usually eat the Turkey burgers.  They are very delicious and very juicy.  The atmosphere is a typical sports bar.  Don't go there thinking its going to be fancy or anything.  The food is great and the wait staff seems to do their job well.
