After reading other's reviews I think this place is too fancy for me.  I wasn't thrilled with much on the menu except the prices, which were great!. . It doesn't bill itself as "tapas" but that is what they serve.  I never feel full after eating tapas and generally it's too much of a mixture of flavors and I feel sick to my stomach afterwards.  . . While what I ate wasn't terrible (olives, cheese, various flatbreds, mac &amp; cheese) I wasn't thrilled either.  I could have made these things at home.  None of my 5 friends were that wow'd either.  . . Plus my cocktail (vodka &amp; club soda) was $10!!  And our waiter was pretty snooty and seemed irritated that he had to explain some of the items on the menu.  I had no clue what lomo was and he certainly didn't think it was cute.. . I won't go back unless someone forces me.
