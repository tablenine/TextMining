I Love a place in Los Angeles that is open 24 hours!!!. . .....and to top it off, Fred's has great atmosphere, GREAT people watching, is relax/chill, fun... has a GREAT selection of Yummy things to eat - from eggs to udon (i like the udon!) (oh, and the eggs!). . it gets crowded but sometimes a seat opens up at the counter if all the booths/tables are full.
