I'm 65 and have lived in the local area all my life. I've eaten at Twin Anchors at least five times each year. It just isn't the same. Last night the food was served cold -even the ribs were not hot. Flavor isn't what it used to be. The chili lacked proper seasonings.. . I suggest that the kitchen management is not doing their job. So, while it is fun to eat where history exists, it still is important to get a properly prepared meal.
