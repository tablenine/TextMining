This place is always packed with a decent line waiting outside.  They are famous for their Haianese chicken rice, which I find to be pretty good.  The chicken is soft and juicy and the rice is flavorful.  Most people order this dish here.. . I've also tried their baked halibut with cheese over rice dish and it was delicious.  The fish was tender and the sauce complimented the dish very well. It tasted much better than your regular baked rice dish from a HK-style cafe. They don't have as wide of a selection as many other cafes and restuarants, but seems like the quality of the dishes they do make are pretty high.  . . Oh, and to top it off, this place is relatively inexpensive too.
