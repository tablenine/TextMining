Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Thin crust in LA that is worth the wait (but you don't have to wait...). . Casa Bianca is always busy. From the minute the doors open, 'til the time they kick everyone out, the place is packed. Being a fan of NY thin crust pies, I believe Casa Bianca is one of the great places to enjoy a pizza in LA.. . The family run establishment is a treat. We love several combos. . The sausage, pepperoni and roasted garlic combo is a meat lovers delight.. . For something different, try the cheese, pesto with roasted pine nuts as a change up.. . The eggplant parmigiana pizza is truly unique and worth trying.. . My tips - If you can't bear the wait for a table, order to go. Make a picnic of it and enjoy pizza in your favorite nearby location.. . If you do order in, make sure to let your pie cool or be prepared to lose a layer or two of skin from the roof of your mouth.. . House wines aren't cellar worthy, but not make an excellent compliment to any pie you try.
