This place has been around for over 100 years and it's easy to understand why after you've been there!  We went here for lunch with friends before a Dodgers game (they'd been here before) and we all ordered the beef French Dip (they also have pork, ham, lamb and turkey) which is served with cheese (we chose Swiss).  It was the best French Dip I've ever had -- tender, juicy, flavorful beef and really good bread that doesn't fall apart but has enough "jus" on the bread to moisten the sandwich nicely  -- they do not serve au jus on the side as most places do.  Their potato salad was also excellent.  They had a number of lines for service and they moved quickly.  One of our friends also enjoyed a piece of their banana cream pie.  We'll make it a point to go there again on our next trip to L.A.
