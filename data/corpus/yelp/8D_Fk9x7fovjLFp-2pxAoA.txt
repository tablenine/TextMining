Oh, LaLa's ... how I heart you. . . The bread and olive oil they give you to munch on is addicting, the Milanesa Napolitana is fantabulous and the mashed potatoes are to die for . Damn, so much for my cardio workout earlier that day! Â I've also tried the arroz del campo and the filet plano, both of which are heavenly goodness. . . Parking is a crap shoot on Melrose and a nightmare if you completely suck at parallel. I've never had to wait to be seated and the service is usually on point.. . I'm yanking a star because of the absolutely shitty waiter we had this past Sunday. I normally let things slide if I can tell the guy or girl is having a bad day but this one was just inattentive and bordered on rude. I asked if they could split the bill for our group of 5 and he flatly said NO. I couldn't tell if he was kidding and asked if he was being serious. He said yes and offered no explanation as to why he couldn't split the bill. . . Fast forward to the end of the evening when the busboys had already scooped up our plates. *twiddling thumbs* Where the hell is our waiter?? We flagged down a busboy walking by and asked him to have our waiter bring the check. UGH, so annoying... and it wasn't even that busy! Our waiter came out 5 minutes later, handed us the bill and mumbled "thanks" before promptly turning around to address a nearby table. No "sorry I disappeared for 20 minutes" or "hope you guys have a great night"? What a douchebag. If you're in the service industry, don't have a shitty attitude because it'll reflect on the tip. It takes a lot for me to leave less than 20% and let's just say that guy didn't earn his stripes at all. . . Aside from that one encounter, LaLa's is a go-to for sure.
