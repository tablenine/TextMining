Restaurant: Ruen Pair Restaurant
Category: Thai
Went to Ruen Pair over the weekend and the biggest relief was being able to pull into the plaza and seeing the valet there. I was a bit confused since there was parking available and I wondered if I could park myself, but for a buck, I figured I'll just hand the keys to the guy.. The restaurant was moderately crowded, it seemed to be their delivery day which meant family members had backed up their van to the fron of the restaurant and were unloading produce etc. Its that kind of a homely place, one I would imagine you could just stroll into and they would know what to bring you if you lived in the area. Ambiance is zilch, but thats not why you are here.. We ordered the Papaya Salad (the lady was nice enough to ask about peanut allergies when we asked for no shrimp since my mom is vegetarian), Rad Na (chicken), the coconut curry noodles and the silver stir fired noodles. The papaya salad was first to the table and it was huge. It had a heaping amount of papaya, often I find when you visit non busy thi restaurants, they substitute other things like a whole lot of beans for the lack of fresh papaya. But not so here, the salad had the perfect sweet hot balance. As with any Asian restaurant, the food started arriving as it was being cooked and everything was spectacular. We ordered a fried rice and a pad kee mao to go for my sister who reported that those were awesome and made to order as hot as we liked. Every single person in the restaurant ordered the papaya salad. The rad na had the perfect wok hei. The glass noodles were average and the coconut soup had the perfect hotness balanced by the smooth coconut milk. I wish I lived closer to this great restaurant. Oh BTW, did i mention the tab was under 40 bucks (tips not included) including the take out order and a Thai ice tea as well. Oh I have got to move here!
