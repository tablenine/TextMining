The food was absolutely awsesome.  Prices are a bit expensive but I think that that is normal for sushi anywhere in the city.  The food presentation was very nice but the service was very slow.  I had to ask for low sodium soy sauce twice and I don't think they were that busy.  Also the servers seemed confused and both were serving us.  They tried to take our drink order twice and all we wanted was water.  Its a good BYOB spot and in a great location.  Little small.  Nice and private for couples.  On a busy night expect a wait.  I went there on a Thursday night and had to wait a half hour.  Not bad.  We went to oodles of noodles next door for an appetizer while we waited.
