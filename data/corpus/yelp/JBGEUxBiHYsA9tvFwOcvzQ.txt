Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
Say it once, say it a million times.... . Katsu-Ya has some of best sushi in L.A. The place might look a little underwhelming from the outside, tucked away in the corner of a Studio City strip mall, but the food is without fault. Try the seared tuna salsa "tower" (ask for it if it's not on the menu). . . Take advantage of the valet parking and be prepared to wait for a table if you don't have a reservation.
