Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Came here on a freeezzinnng night and got a mint ice tea while sitting outside. Baaaddd idea. Sooo cold. . . Besides that though Alcove's great! There cakes are unbelievable and their lamb burgers are so juicy and perfectly seasoned. . . There's valet parking there but the guy leaves after 9:30 so you could probably park there for free a little later. . . All in all a pretty cool place to get a quick bite and catch up with friends.
