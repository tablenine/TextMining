I wanna say that I've been here before... maybe 5 years ago. It was kind of a blur I guess thanks to their crazy martinis. But my most recent visit confirmed that this place is a deadly stop for all you martini fans. Order 2 from their House Specialties list and you're guaranteed a helluva good time.. . If anyone asks me why I like this place I'd have to say first and foremost, the HUGE martini list and selection they offer followed by the great beats playing in the background. Third would be the crowd and the fact that they have a pool table in the middle. Last but not least, the multiple rooms you can walk in and out of in case you get bored sitting in the same room looking across at the same people the whole night.. . But the same amount of things turn me off like the fact that they only have 1 stall in the women's restroom which makes our bathroom wait much longer. Then there's the dingy furniture that they still use from centuries ago... they definitely need to update the furniture and decor abit to keep the sexual appeal of the place. And most importantly, the service. It takes so long to get someone's attention before they'd take your order, then another long wait before you actually get your drinks. I know that the wait is worth it but if you're there to drink then YOU'RE THERE TO DRINK. No waiting necessary. Especially after a long day at work.. . I haven't had the chance to try their food yet aside from their egg roll appetizer. Maybe when I come back there I'll give their food a try.
