Classic burgers done well.  The menu is small, but what they do make, they make is very well.  I tried the steak burger and had a side of fries.  It was really good and it soon was devoured.  It's a little on the small side, so I left feeling a little bit hungry.  The pie was a little runny for my liking, but it was alright.
