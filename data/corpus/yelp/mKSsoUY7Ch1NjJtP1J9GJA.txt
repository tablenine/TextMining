Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
So my friend would not shut up about these fish tacos, so after the 3,009th RAVE about it, she finally took me here and uhhh... GOLD MINE!!  3 things: Fresh, Simple, Recession Friendly. . . $1.50 Fish Taco, $2 Shrimp Taco and $1 Drink.... That's the menu.  The fish and shrimp are battered and fried to your order and the salsa bar is pretty dope!!  I like spicy, so I go Mango Less and Pineapple Kiss.  There also have mild versions of those, as well as an interesting beet salsa.  I know why they don't serve tortilla chips there, cuz if they did, they'd be making salsa all day!!. . I woulda gave it 5 stars but they close at 8pm??  Who doesn't like eating tacos AFTER a great night on the town??  Still, a solid 4.5 stars!!
