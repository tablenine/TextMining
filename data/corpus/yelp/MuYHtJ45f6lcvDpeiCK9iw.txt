I have been here a few times. it is close to home and we can walk there which is nice. the food is nothing special and wouldn't expect anything different from a dressed up sports bar. however the service leaves a lot to be desired. i have noticed a decline in service the last two visits. maybe in this recession there is an influx of less than qualified applicants in the food service industry or maybe this place just plain sucks. either way, we wont be back.
