It's not as good as the DTF in Taiwan, but it's better than the frozen varieties.  The 2nd/next door location is huge and the wait is considerably shorter, so I've heard.. . My favorites are the crab and the pork and veggies ones.  Ordered the red bean dumplings, but it's just a lot of red bean paste and the flavor is really 1-dimensional.  It's more for the funky idea than tasting really good.  The noodles were ok.  The soup noodles were a little soggy but it could be that we let it sit for a little.  The dan dan noodles were good, but it's all stuck together and kinda a pain.  The noodles weren't a highlight.  The rice cakes were good though.. . I agree that the portions are small - we ordered 3 noodles, 6 dumplings, 1 dessert dumpling, and veggies, for 6 peeps and ate it all.
