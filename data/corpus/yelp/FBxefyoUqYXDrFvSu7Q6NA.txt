Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I'm not sure what the big deal is about Roscoe's. The chicken is vastly overpriced at $15 for a half chicken. The waffles are okay, but we have tasted better. The place was busy, and apparently has a reputation that this is what great fried chicken should taste like. My friend, who prides himself on being a fried chicken "aficionado" said he wouldn't be back. We've been to many other places that were much better and less expensive in price. If you haven't found any local place better, keep looking. There must be someplace closer rather than driving all the way to Pasadena.
