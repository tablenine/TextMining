Restaurant: The Vortex Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Burgers
The Vortex is hyped up as one of ATL's local establishments.  Some even call it the best burger in the city.  So, I had some hella high standards when I came here last weekend.  I can be an adventurous eater, so I went out on a limb and tried the Elvis burger (with regular toppings, fried bananas, and peanut butter), got it well done, just like how I have all my burgers.  I really wanted to give the Vortex a four and be super satisfied with overall dining experience.  My tater tots were excellent (crunchy throughout the entire meal), and the fried cheese balls with jalapeno sauce - one of the appetizers - were fantastic (not overly greasy and not too rich).  So we were off to a good start!  But the pretzels - another appetizer - were a bit too doughy for me.  I tried my friend's sweet potato fry (one of my favorite things in the entire world) and discovered that it was kind of soggy and mushy.  Most importantly, my burger, not focusing on the eclectic toppings, was waaay too dry.  I know I ordered well done, but I've definitely had well done burgers at mediocre chain restaurants that were so much juicer than my sad Elvis burger last weekend.  I'm hoping the Little Five Points can save what's supposed to be the best burger in town!  . . Other things:. -  Parking's tricky, but that's to be expected anywhere on Peachtree in Midtown.. -  Surroundings are pretty strange with lots of things adorned on the walls.  Kind of reminds me of a biker's Applebee's.. -  Service is...amusingly a struggle?  I don't know quite else how to describe it.  It's almost as if the waitstaff get away with clearly not caring.
