Super friendly service, fantastic music, clean layout, delicious food with a real chill country southern vibe.  The pork belly taco and fish tortas were awesome and the various sauces they have were great compliments to the food.   Also, the best bourbon selection i've seen in Chicago, which counts for a lot.
