Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Mmmmmmm....everytime I drive within 10 miles of this place, my fried taco radar goes crazy and I have to get some of that southern cali goodness.. . TITOS TACOS = GOOD FOOD, GOOD PRICES, GOOD SERVICE!!!. . I have been eating at Titos since the early 80's and its still the same as it ever was.. Thanks to my unlce Sam (RIP) this place will always be a great place to eat.. . Im not going to get into much detail because its unnecessary.... . Simple and straight to the point:. 2 Fried tacos (3 if you got the force with you). Chips and salsa. Med. Coke (Large if you want to get down like that). I can taste the grease as I type.... boys and girls. thats about as good as it gets. . May the funk be with you!
