Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Media Noche-Amazing. Slow roasted prok, ham and nice crispy pickles.. Shanghai chicken salad-delicious. Lots of ginger and mint, a very refreshing dish.. The food at milk is tasty and seems very fresh, but staring into that glass case of deliciousness while you eat may be the best part about this little cafe. i highly recommend the chocolate croissant bread pudding, which they serve to you warm with a scoop of ice cream of your choosing.. For lunch or midday dessert, MILK does not disappoint.. They also supply ice cream to the Coolhaus truck, so get a sammy if you see it rolling around.
