I heard a lot about how good ramen in LA is so this time I got to try it. My boyfriend and I swung by here for lunch on our way back to NorCal.. . It was around 11:30pm and there was a line already. The wait wasn't that bad considering that we only waited for 15 minutes. I got the ramen and he got the cold ramen. They were the same except the cold one ramen wasn't in the soup. . . I like the chewy and crunchy noodle and that the egg was stew. It was well marinated with soysauce and the yolk was moist see through golden yellow. I like the lots of green onion in the soup. But the broth tastes a bit too salty for me. My boyfriend liked his seared fatty pork, tasted kind of like bacon. . . We were so full after the meal that we could barely walked. The portions were huge. I had to pack half of the bowl to go because I could have it for lunch the next day. I don't ever let good food goes to waste. Â The soup got a little more saltier the next day but noodle was still good.
