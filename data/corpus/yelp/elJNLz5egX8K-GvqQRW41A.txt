Even if this place got closed down by health inspectors recently, this place still remains highly popular. . . We went here on 7/2 after dinner and I wouldn't have suspected the closing! There was still a line and a wait. The usual guy who takes our order and sits us down is still busy, taking the orders of the parties who were waiting to speed up the process. It was like nothing happened.. . I still bumped this place up to 5 stars since this place is still one of our favorites. Maybe knowing the fact that they closed down and still giving them 5 stars is a bit weird...but at least I know that they're cleaner than before...enough to reopen. . . Anyway, now that it's been a bit warm outside, we get the shaved ice. Our favorite toppings that we've gotten for our 5-topping shaved ice are condensed milk, flan, mochi, lychee, almond jello, coconut jelly, and red bean. It is topped with a brown sugary syrup and it's bliss on a summer night.. . Of course, I am still a fan of the Taiwanese sausage here. Sausage + raw garlic = my simple thrill in life.
