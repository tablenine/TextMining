Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The wait for this place isn't as long now that they expanded their restaurant.  The dumplings of course are the highlight of this place.  I usually only go for the traditional pork dumplings (the other flavors aren't that great), their pork fried noodles and their shanghai rice cakes.  Delicious!
