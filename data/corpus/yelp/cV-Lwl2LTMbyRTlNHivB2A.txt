Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Vacationing in socal, I asked a lady if she recommended any soup places since it was cold and she recommended this place. And I'm glad she did.. . This place is rather small (mom n pop type of restaurant) but the ramen is tasty. The portion was rather hearty and it took me awhile to finish it. I didn't dare spice it up to any extraordinary levels or anything, so I just added a mild kick to it, which was 2nd to the last level of their spicy list. . . In short, good food. Good ramen.
