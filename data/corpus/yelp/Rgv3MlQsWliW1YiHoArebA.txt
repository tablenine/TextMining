Lucky ole me got to go here twice without having to pay a dime. I used to intern for a doctor's office and man did I grow to love drug reps. They loved taking out the staff and wining and dining us at any place we wanted. Of course if they're willing to take us anywhere, why not be over excessive at Mastro's? . . If you've got some extra money to spare this is the steak place to go to. The portions are ENORMOUS. We're talking like at least two days of food. Leftover food that is. The prime rib here is excellent and is the size of my head. I'm not even kidding. It was cooked perfectly and not swimming in fat and butter like at Ruth's Chris. Oh yeah and since I didn't have to pay I also ordered a crapload of other things. Yeah I basically rolled out of this place like a bowling ball. So full. All the sides are delicious and their martinis are excellent (if you like bleu cheese stuffed olives, try the CEO). The sides are served family style so you can all try a little of everything. And you really should try everything because it is all soo good. If you're an oyster fan, you will love their oysters here. Huge, juicy, succulent oysters mmmmm. . . Loved their private party rooms. I've been in both the upstairs and downstairs one. The downstairs private room can fit 20+ and the upstairs can fit around 15 or so. The staff is so warm and attentive. They even cut up my lobster for me. I'm not a huge dessert person but give their butter cake a try, really light and fluffy. I was a greedy pig and ordered two for myself. Hey, who cares if I'm not paying? :). . The damage for a party of 12? Around five grand.
