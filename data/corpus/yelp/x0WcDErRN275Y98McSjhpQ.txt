Yikes, I don't get why there are so many positive reviews of this dump.  Cold falafels, mediocre kabobs and a giant a-hole of a waiter made this a truly awful experience.  The food next door is far better, and less expensive.  I think this place is skating by on it's popular name and awful commercials.
