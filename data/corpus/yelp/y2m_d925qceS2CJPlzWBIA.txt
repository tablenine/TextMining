did i NOT write a review!?!?  this is my favorite dumpling place in the world, though the taipei location is best.. . yummy yummy. though their "soup dumplings" which oddly don't come with soup but are to be put in the soup, run out easily and early. . we got there at opening and by the time we sat, within 1 hr, they were out!?!?  you'd think they'd know to make enough. . anyway, love it and used to go to LA just for this, but now found a place in cupertino (n. CA) that is just as good, at least I don't have to drive/fly down...
