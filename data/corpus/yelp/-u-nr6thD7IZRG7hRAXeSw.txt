Restaurant: Al Di La Trattoria
Category: Italian
I'm obsessed with food, and the goal in my eating 'adventures' is to seek out food that is at once elegant, comforting, refined but unprententious, and that tastes relatively 'homemade'.  I enjoy 4 star dining, love Jean-Georges, love Daniel, and I make their recipes often - but realistically, that level of food is not the type of food I want to eat every day.. . Instead, what I want and love to eat - is Anna Klinger's food.  Rustic, soulful, elegant (northern) Italian fare which charms, soothes, and that reminds you of maybe (if she was a great cook) the dishes  grandma used to make.. . A simple plate of Bagna Cauda - steamed vegetables, bread, with a walnut anchovy butter, actually made my husband eat his vegetables(and order it again the next time).  Beef Carpaccio, in its most elemental and basic preparation - with a few anchovies, parmesan, and olive oil, shines.  Beet ravioli, with poppy seed butter.  Heaven.  And anything with the best pork ragu I've ever had makes me happy.  . . Al Di La re-creates the impression of being in a small village in Italy, where you would find incredible food, in a rustic setting, with absolutely no pretense - a very 'real', and beautiful experience.. . Also, the wines are great, the service is good, and the place *can* get a little cramped.  But a bill under a $100 for apps, entrees, wine, and dessert - is pretty good in NYC, considering the very impressive QUALITY of this wonderful restaurant.
