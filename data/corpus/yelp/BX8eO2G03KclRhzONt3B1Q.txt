This is one of most overpriced restaurants in Atlanta. What? You think that having a German name makes you special? Guess again buddy. I'm German and I know that I'm special. The food is average at most and the beer selection didn't impress me. I went there for a Christmas party and they were pretty adamant on wanting us out at a specific time. In fact, they were pretty rude about it. Just like in other reviews, it's a glorified Applebees. Save the money, buy some of your own food, and have a great party rather than renting this place out and wasting the money. Being in a clear recession puts things in perspective.
