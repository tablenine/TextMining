i love the HAINAN CHICKEN! its cooked perfectly, the rice is really flavorful, and you really get a meal that seems homemade. if you are looking for a place to try and escape LA for a lunch, savoy is your spot!. highly recommended. . ps. seating is limited, but if you have to wait, theres a discount denim consignment store right next door! call in advance to see if they are open too.
