So THIS is where they all are!!. . Oh how I've missed my cute, skinny, little hipster boys who's entire body is smaller than one of my legs. This is where they are all hiding and noshing on rattlesnake, alligator, ducks and bacon! Yay!. . I had no idea what to expect with this place. In fact I had never even heard about it, but since I was in the hands of my CM Yelpettes and after announcing my need for food, I trusted they would take me somewhere cool. . . When we walked in it was the usual crowd one would expect in downtown. The resident hot guys with shaggy and purposely unkempt appearances and girls with perfectly mismatched fashion sense. Having not been here before, I thought it was just the counter, but no, oh no, there's more.. . In the back is a huge dining area with communal tables and smaller tables to boot. I love communal tables though and dig being able to sit down and immediately strike up a conversation with someone who will then give you a Belgium fry and let you dip it in his sauce, if ya know what I mean.. . Here's what we tried thanks to the recommendation of Travis 2 (apparently there are 2 of them and he specifically asked to be referred to as Travis 2. Hi Travis!):. -Rattlesnake and Rabbit with grilled onions and sweet peppers. -Duck and Bacon with sauerkraut and spicy peppers. -Fries with Curry ketchup and the bacon, blue cheese and walnut dip. . All were super tasty, but I would say that the R&amp;R was my fave. It was juicy and yummy and just deeelish! We washed the madness down with Chimay White and it was a delightful, yet slightly pricey way to end the day. Yum, I will be back!
