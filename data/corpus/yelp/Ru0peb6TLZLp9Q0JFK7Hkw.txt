Category: Sports Bars
This location is more laid back than the one on the promenade, with more of a restaurant feel than a bar feel.  The booths keep people separate.  However, there are two pool tables, and a few other coin-op games, to make for a very low-key evening.  But if that's all you want, stay home and don't pay so much for beer.  They did have the Big Lebowski playing, but that is also something you can do at home.  It may have been an off night, so I will probably come back and see how it goes.
