Category: Steakhouses
Been here a few times....and I've come away happy all the time.. . You go to Lawry's for a few reasons....for me its the meat and the cream corn...it really is amazing....just get the cream corn and you will understand.. . and people really like there dessert too.. . But the service has always been good and i highly recommend reservations, or don't even go...there's a bar in the waiting area also...plus complimentary meatballs in the lobby.
