This place is amazing. I want to say more but it's all been said and said very well.. . The whole experience was incredible. The service was quick and attentive; the wine recommendations were excellent. The food came out super-quick, piping hot, and just plain mouth-meltingly to-die-for.. . Look, it's hard to get a reservation, but plan ahead because it's damn worth it.
