Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The first time I went here their menu was all in Chinese and end up ordering too much.  But now their menu have both English and Chinese, which is good for those who can't read chinese.  . . Likes: clean, friendly service, yummy dumplings, juicy pork dumplings, house noodle soup and their string beans.. . Their parking sucks tho
