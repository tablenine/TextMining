I must admit that I am addicted to their salads. My favorite is the caeser with seared ahi. I am addicted to seared ahi right now. Any way, this location is great since it is by the Staples Center, Nokia Theater, and a movie theater down the street. The only downside is parking. I would only eat here when I'm seeing a concert. Anyway, the food here is big portioned and quite delicious. Dessert wise, I have a weakness for creme brulee and theirs is so delicious with the banana on the side. While it's pretty expensive at I believe $7 for a tiny portion, it wouldn't be a trip to the Yard House without it. If you do come after a concert, ask to sit outside (there are heaters) for a much shorter wait.
