Just tried Takashi for the new Noodles lunch menu on Sunday.    . We had heard this was the first day for this menu,. it was a beautiful day, so we decided go sit on the patio and . give it a try.. . We're so glad we did!. . First of all, the prices are very reasonable - appetizers between $5 and $8, and noodles around $11.. . I started with the Duck Fat Fried Chicken and my boyfriend ordered the Gyoza appetizer.. . These were unbelievable.  Next we tried the Shoyu Ramen. and Chilled Soba.  Both were homemade - I heard this is very. difficult to do.  The noodles tasted so fresh and the flavors and ingredients delicious.. . We've been to Takashi for dinner many times, and love it.  The . lunch atmosphere is more fun and casual- Rolling Stones . was playing in the background.  . . We'll be back next week to try more dishes.
