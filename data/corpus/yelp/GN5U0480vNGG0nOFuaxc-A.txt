i LOVE this place. it's just fun and the food is always tasty. it's not so much the food for me on this one, though. it's just that it's a really fun atmosphere, and i'm almost always celebrating something when i go here...mainly b/c it's byob and something really cheap like $3 for the corkage fee..so it's pretty difficult not to have a good time after eating some great tapas &amp; drinking as much wine as you want. Regardless of what I order, I usually spend about $30-40 (inc tip). Not bad in my mind, for pre-party dinner.
