Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
With over 250 reviews, I highly doubt my review will make much of a dent for Soowon Galbi, but I felt I had to add my 2 cents' worth purely due to the fact that we had such a great meal there.. . Two of my best friends (and longest friends -- both over 25 years and counting) were with me -- they have only met once 20 yrs ago -- for a wonderful weekend in LA and this was where we ended up for dinner one of those nights.. . We had to wait a little while for a table, but it wasn't too long. Once seated, I immediately knew what I wanted to order! We got chadol, jumulluk and their house special galbi. The banchan arrived and we were on them like a hawk on its prey -- we were so incredibly hungry and just pounced. The meat arrived shortly and soon enough, the servers were helping us cook the meat on the grills.. . The only issue we had was the ventilator system not working all that well. At one point, BFF asked the cute server dude if the vent was on. He did a little cute listening motion and then said "yes it's on". So funny.. . All the meats were really good quality hence the wonderful flavors. Banchan was good, but the variety wasn't as fab as some other places I've been to. This isn't AYCE so you won't find some things like the egg stew, but at the end of the meal, I asked for 'noroongji' the burnt rice soup and when they brought it, they also brought a little pot of daengjangjigae for us to eat the noroongji with.. . We were so stuffed at the end and they still brought us a little cup of 'shikhae' as well.. . For $28 each tax and tip included, we had a really fantastic meal and the service wasn't bad either. We were always happy when the cute server dude came around to help us out!!. . 4.5 stars!
