Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
First off, Joseph, the owner, could make me want to return to this place time and time again just on the general principal that he is incredibly kind and warm.. My boyfriend and I frequent this place, occasionally bringing a close friend or visiting relative as we firmly believe that these tacos, and the experience are what make LA so great. . Bring a six pack of beer, forgot limes? Ask, the ladies will be happy to cut some limes up in back for you. Joseph will go out of his way to make you feel welcome, he'll bet you double or nothing on the cost of your tacos, and if the coin doesn't flip in your favor he'll charge you regular price and insist that you tip the women in the kitchen.. I've had horchata bestowed upon me as a gift many times, as well as appetizers that aren't on the menu that he occasionally makes back in the kitchen. I'm in love with this place, every friend I've taken there has returned within the week to get their fix. Personally I like to get the shrimp tacos and drown them in tapatio, cream, and cabbage. SO. GOOD.. . Go here.
