I went to this place for a private party and it was very good.  Classy establishment all around. . . The wine selection was good.  The appetizers did indeed look appetizing,  though my group was in less than an appetizer mood. :(. . The french onion soup was high class, as was the lobster bisque.. . The steaks were cooked to order, nice and big.  The desserts were what you would expect from a place like this EXCEPT for their Pie (or cake I can't remember) It was the size of my head, and our table of 7 was unable to finish it off.. . The one complaint I can have about this place is that the service took my plate without offering a to go bag.  I would have loved to use the steak in the morning with my eggs.  but alas it was not to be.. . I don't know about the service on an average table so I can't comment on that.. . highs:  A good old school high class place.  Somewhere to take the parents/grandparents for their anniversary. . Lows: Not really a low, but you pay for the quality!
