Want some polenta? They got it. Need a few T-bone steaks? You're in luck. Want to order lunch from the same place 5 times a week and not get sick of it? You've found the spot! . . Bari has the best subs in Chicago, awesome italian sausage, and a great selection of Italian foods and staples like dairy, eggs, bread, and produce. Definitely the best bet if you don't feel like battling the crowds at Jewel or Dom's. Plus, you're supporting a local business which means they stay in business and I get to eat more subs. Do it.
