Restaurant: El Cid 2
Category: Mexican
ok. update.. went here with a friend at 11:30 am on a sunday.. therefore, we were the ONLY people on the back patio.. . Not only was the service so slow that we had to wave over the server, but they CHARGED US when we asked for another basket of chips and salsa (I have NEVER had this happen at any other mexican restaurant, INCLUDING THIS ONE when I had asked for more in previous trips, did they change that overnight?) and then when my friend asked why she was DOUBLE CHARGED for the meat on her burrito, they claimed they didn't.. . Sorry El Cid. Â Not even the patio can save you now!
