I have been going to Fred's pretty much since it opened. In fact, it is solely responsible for me even having food in my system from ages 17-19 because well... I lived two blocks away and didn't know where else I could get Mac Daddy Cheeseballs or Calamari or Udon with Beef or a Thai Cobb or a PERFECT Bossa Nova Waffle (the one with the ice cream on top), let alone, at 4 am? . . Some other favorites: . The SWS Salad. the Juicy Lucy. FAIRFAX HIGH (fave brunch ever - i wish it was served all day). The BLTLA. The Patty Melt. The Tower of Power (ask for an extra peice of bread, you'll see why). The LALA Salad (vegetarian friendly). Rice Deli with Beef. And as mentioned earlier:. The Bossa Nova Waffle Sundae (epic!). Mac Daddy Cheeseballs (perfect for munchies!!). Cali Calamari. . And honestly, Duffy D. pretty much got it right. The servers understand that when it's 3 am, you might not be able to properly speak your order, maybe all you can do is point to it on the menu and nod. And that's OK.. . And stop giving the servers such a hard time, they aren't ALL that bad. A majority of them are really cool and laid back. This isn't fine dining, so don't expect that kind of service. Also... the shirts are funny. My personal fave is the "Emotionally Unavailable".... . Yes there can be a wait, especially late at night. And if you're with a party of 8 expecting to get seated right away then there must be something seriously wrong with the way your brain works. That's just not going to happen. ALSO... this really isn't the place for children. Sorry... Maybe you should try House of Pies.. . Fred's is just all around awesome and delicious. It's 24 hours, so you can't go wrong. And it's got a lot of Vegan and Vegetarian dishes. So YAY Fred's!
