My cousin and I met up here for lunch.  Great place in Greektown!  We both had a bowl of tomato basil soup and split an orchard salad. Our soups we full of flavor and perfectly hot to help combat the freezing Chicago day.  OF course we were eyeing the amazing pastries during our whole meal.  My cousin was a big fan of the white chocolate strawberry tart! . . The atmophere was relaxing like a cafe you would find in Europe.  We are going back for dinner!
