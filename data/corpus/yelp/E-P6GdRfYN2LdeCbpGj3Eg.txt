Awesome spot to hang out! I have been going the past few Saturdays with my friends and this place is hopping. Tomas, one of the bartenders is the shit! The other bartender looks like Tiger Woods haha. Awesome drinks and really good sushi. I recommend you to give it a try and sit at the bar! Hopefully you will get to see Tomas and "Tiger Woods" haha.
