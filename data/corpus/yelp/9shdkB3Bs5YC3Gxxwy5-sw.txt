I feel the need to review this place if only for the great sandwich I had there. It is not the place for meaningful human interaction with the staff, nor for ambience or cleanliness (It took me awhile to find a fairly clean table in this self-service joint.) But I love their Chicken Vesuvio sandwich. It is really unique and reminds me of Potbelly's for the size, type bread and good flavor. . . In fact, the place could be easily described as the love child of Potbelly's and Bean's and Bagels (or as my friends describe it "Bongs and Bagels") In a service sense, you feel like you are interrupting some kind of private indie rocker party by asking for a sandwich, especially if you are a geezer like me. The music they play I'm sure has never been played before on any restaurant PA system.  And the room and atmosphere is something like a faded and unkempt Potbelly's.. . I did not try the pizza here, but I would definitely come back and do that. I noticed they have a different pizza special everyday.  And I would come back for the sandwiches again, too. Maybe try a different one. . . It would be nice if they added coffee to their beverage lineup as not everyone is a soda drinker. But if you like a delicious baked and crispy sandwich, filled with tender chicken, peppers and garlic, check it out.
