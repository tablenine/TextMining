Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
This is the most mouth watering dumpling house on this side of Los Angeles, heck.. this side of the west coast.  I think it has something to do with that large window where you can see the cooks meticulous shape the dumplings and the smell of the steamer baskets while you wait for your table.. . All the dumpling favors are delicious so you must try at least a few of them.  Take a soup spoon, dip the dumpling in the vinegar/ginger sauce, and be prepared for the gush of the soup.  . . *******Be careful the dumplings are hot so don't forget to let it cool for a bit.. otherwise you might end up with a burnt tongue like myself... lol.
