I have been a fan of LA Mill for a few years now.  An local friend of mine introduced me to the coffee and I have been having it shipped to me on a regular basis for my morning fix at work.  Unfortunately (or fortunately for LA Mill) all my office friends are now addicted as well.  Best brews are the Parisian, the Black Velvet and the Ethiopian Koratie Dry Process.  The entire selection might not be available at the café, but the online store is great with speedy delivery.. . Late last year, I made the pilgrimage to the LA Mill café and was extremely happy I did.  I had the Panama Esmeralda Geisha prepared in the siphon brew which was the most expensive but absolute best cup of coffee I have ever had.  My partner had the iced espresso, cold brewed with excellent vanilla syrup.  By far the best iced espresso ever!  We took two to go for the drive back to San Diego.. . The food was great.  We split the potato leek soup and the Asian BLT.  The soup was insanely good with tons of clams.  The BLT had pork belly, preserved black bean spread, tomato and arugula prepared as a panini.  Yum.... . Service was great.  Grace (I believe) was a big help.  She made great food and drink suggestions.  Prices were definitely on the higher side, but hey - you get what you pay for.  I have no problems paying for this quality!. . Next time we're in LA, we'll be back.  Glad I can get it delivered to my office in the meantime!
