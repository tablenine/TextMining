Very good food and service.  Our waiter was wonderful (not sure of his name, but it was the guy wearing the black hat).  The other staff was great and very friendly.  A wonderful evening eating on the patio.  Parking across the street in the vacant lot is nice, as you don't have to walk far.  Just a tip, you can talk the guy down who is taking the money for parking to get a better deal.
