Kobe beef sashimi is my new lover.  And Tempranillo Sierra Cantabria wine is my new bff.. . My petite filet was delicious, the bf's new york sirloin was a little peppery.  I love it when my order choice is better than his.  :)  He still like's Carlsbad Caverns better: . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... , weird.. . The tempura green beans were unnecessary, but the lobster lemon ravioli was tasty, and I don't even like lobster.. . Loved the special touches like the Himalayan salt and the wine carafes.. . The peanut Benton bacon brittle was the gravy on top.. . I'm drooling like Homer Simpson and trying to find out how I can get my hands on more of that sashimi.  Seriously, it's like meat candy. . . David Burke, we need to make out more often.
