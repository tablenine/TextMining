Ah cue the French music to play in the background as 2 crepe loving pretty ladies walk into this joint. We are on the hunt for some brunchy goodness in the form of the ever versatile crepe. Ah, the memories of a long ago Paris trip coming flooding back. . . Ah okay, so there was no French music playing the background as my friend &amp; I entered La Creperie, but we were greeted by a friendly host &amp; seated right away. Unfortunately it was a chilly summer day &amp; we could not sit outside (Le BOO!!). They have a nice outdoor patio that I will enjoy on a future visit. As we got there pretty much right when they opened, there was ample seating--mind you it was also a week day. I would imagine the weekends get a little crazy in the LP location. . . This place makes no qualms about what they do, they are a crepe place &amp; if you are looking for something else, you should probably go somewhere else. If however, you want some crepes, GO HERE!! They have a very good selection of sweet &amp; savory thin pancake goodness. . . I had a breakfasty crepe as I was craving more of morning time delights and it was delicious. The crepe had a hint of sweetness, that was not overpowering. The eggs were made just right (I loathe running eggs) and the potatoes were a-okay. I really enjoyed the food &amp; look forward to another go so I can try the sweet selection. My friend had more a lunch crepe of chicken &amp; mushroom--I tried it &amp; it was also yummy. Another plus, the coffee here is pretty good. I look forward to another visit here in the near future. . . The decor of the place is a bit on the dark side, but not seedy looking or anything. It is simply furnished with dark tones which could be romantic in the evening. The service was prompt even when it got a little crowded &amp; they kept my coffee cup full, so kudos for that!
