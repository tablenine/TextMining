I think the laydoo is quickly retiring from the happenin list of places to go.. perhaps because of that janky little fountain in the courtyard, the ONE bathroom with 3 stalls for about 86.5 girls, or the little dark room in the back with music playing (or was that the dance floor?). Oh and apparently Saturday night is Giantess night because I'm pretty sure there was a 6 ft. and over height requirement for girls. But despite the small venue and Hollywood-y crowd, the laydoo can be fun if you're with the right people.
