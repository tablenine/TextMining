Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Completely satisfied and happy is how I felt after both of my trips to Joy's. A great selection of noodles, curry's, and stir-fried dishes presented in a very unique way.. . I would say go for the curry, especially the coconut one they serve. It gives you a taste of all the aspects of Joy's kitchen that people like. Try a spring roll here too, don't be afraid it is not what you are used. Very soft, and fresh. . . A great wait-staff and decor, I would recommended going during warmer weather.
