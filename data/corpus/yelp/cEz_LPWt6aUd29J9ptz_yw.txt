I did not eat at TAP and was only there for a pre-dinner drink.  I was very disappointed with the beer selection.  Sure, they have a better selection than your average neighborhood bar, but really in Atlanta these days any decent bar offers a few Belgians and other high gravity beers.  I guess I listened too much to the local foodie press trying to prop this place up as a beer drinker's destination, and so I was expecting a lot more from their selection.  Reading the rest of these reviews I'm happy I didn't bother with the menu.
