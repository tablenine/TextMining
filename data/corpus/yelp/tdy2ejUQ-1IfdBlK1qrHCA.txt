Anytime I can go to a place and have my choice of ANYTHING on the menu, I'm a happy girl.  When I became a vegetarian 14 years ago, I really missed my chinese food (I mean, you can only eat stir fried vegetables and rice but so many times).  So needless to say I was SUPER excited when I stumbled on this place.  I abso-freakin-lutely LOVE it here.  There's not much in the way of ambience, but that's fine with me since I only order to-go.  . . I just wish they had a location closer to my house... eh, it's worth the drive!
