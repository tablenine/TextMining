Ever since my friend took me here my perspective on ramen has changed. I've been to a couple of ramen houses before and I've always thought "why pay upwards towards $10 when I can make ramen at home".. . The ramen here is DELICIOUS and the prices are very fair. I've read some of the other reviews saying that it's not the best in the LA area. I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area so I guess I wouldn't know for sure, but I can tell you that in the SF area none of the ramen places can touch Daikokuya. For me though, it is the best ramen I have had to this date.. . If anything, this place sets a standard for ramen for me now. I will now judge ramen based on how good it is compared to Daikokuya. I now make it a point to eat here at least once whenever I am in SoCal.. . I can't thank my friend enough for introducing this place to me. . . Other reviewers are right though, when you come in, sign your name with the number of people in your party on the list, and then expect a 30-45 min wait. I've always brought larger parties (6 people+ ) and we always end up splitting into two tables, the restaurant is small and isn't designed for huge parties.. . And if you're not a complete health fanatic, you MUST add the ketorri (spelling may be wrong but it's written in the menu) flavoring to your ramen. It's a flavoring made of pork fat from my understanding, but it makes the ramen THAT much better.
