Was visiting Atlanta from out of town.  Interesting and tasty small plates, fantastic environment; service was thoughtfully helpfull and suggestive. I'm usually a beer or wine drinker, the latter being what drew me to Top Flr, but ended up drinking innovative mixed drinks suggested by the bartender.  Overall a memorable and interesting (in a good way) experience.
