Ok, how have I not reviewed Joy's yet?!? Such a mystery... anywho, if you're looking for good, consistent and budget friendly Thai... look no further.. . I believe a list is in order:. . 1. BYO (most important part since I love me some wine). 2. Good food, consistent quality. 2. Fast Service - you barely place your order and it's already on the table. 3. Great for groups. 4. Usually very little wait since there is so much seating. 5. Fast delivery service. 6. Very friendly staff. . Stop reading, go to Joy's!
