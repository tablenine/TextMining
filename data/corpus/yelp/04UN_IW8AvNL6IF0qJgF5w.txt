Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
6/19/10 - Saturday evening and we were .2 miles from Orochan so we finally decided to check it out! We walked over there and were seated immediately! It was pretty crowded and we looked forward to their spicy ramen! Being our first time we decided to order a few levels lower than what we wanted to try! I'm still really iffy about wanting to try the actual challenge...I mean why do I wanna torture myself when I'm gonna spend money to eat it? . . I LOVE ALL THINGS SPICY...but for some reason it didn't really entice me enough to try the challenge...Overall it was a pretty good level of spicyness that we ordered...I tried the EXTREME Orochon 1 and the BF had the HYPER Orochon 2. The levels right below the special 1 and 2...and they were pretty good...Hey we're Korean what can I say? I don't think I would have enjoyed it if it were any spicier...but next time I might go up 1 notch just to see how much I like it.... . And NO we didn't feel any BDS the night after...Definitely a must try...
