Enjoyed this low key casual spot on a warm summer evening. We were quickly seated on the front patio with a view of a flat screen in the restaurant's store front window allowing us to catch a few minutes of the Sox game. We had the smoked brisket and BBQ pulled pork sandwiches. Both were mouth watering with plenty of spicey/smokey sauce. We had plastic bottles on the table containing more. Good stuff! Â Meat was tender and plentiful. The side of baked beans was a great accompaniment. The mac/cheese side was a bit heavy. Service was good and we were in and out in an hour avoiding a heavy parking toll.
