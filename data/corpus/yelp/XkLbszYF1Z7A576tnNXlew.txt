I feel like I just washed my mouth with MSG after eating a plate of MSG and snorting lines of  it up my nose.  . . I have no idea why I gave this place 4 stars when there are so many better options in the neighborhood.  . . It's pretty quick and a pretty cheap place to go if you have a big party.  In fact, I'm not sure where else in the area you can fit a gigantor party of people.  The curries are decent, the pad thais/see ew/kee mao are decent.  The duck soup is a little sweet for my tastes. The fish ball noodles are decent if you like msg.  The spicy noodle soup makes you feel like you've dunked your self in a bowl of spices and MSG.. . Just make sure you have a pitcher of water close by during lunch, because I'll be damned if you ever get your water refilled.  This place deserves my McDonalds stamp: fastfood Thai at its MSGest.
