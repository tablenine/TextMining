Restaurant: El Myr
Category: Mexican
This is undoubtedly one of the friendliest bars in Little Five, and the food isn't bad, either! Everything is reasonably priced, and if you're getting a soda or something, they give you a *big* cup so you don't have to keep walking up to the bar to get more Diet Coke. The jukebox is great, the DJs are fantastic (I seriously never expected to hear someone spin "Beans and Cornbread"), and there's R. Land art throughout. As to drawbacks, the main barroom is exceedingly small, the place is usually packed, and it's difficult to get to the ladies' room.. . I have been here about five thousand million times, but one of my fondest memories of El Myr is Christmas Eve 2009. I had made a bunch of doughnuts and was looking to share my surplus with the neighborhood homeless. Most of them had found somewhere else to go that particular evening, so I kept trekking down Euclid until, to my great delight, I found El Myr open. Once inside, I had a wonderful evening of conversation, doodling, and doughnut-sharing. At one point, I looked above the bar and saw a number of 3-D sculpted doughnuts. Awesome.
