Restaurant: Fellini&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
I've never had a bad experience at Fellini's. Â The food is great, cheap and it's always a cool environment. They did get onto me one time taking pictures in the restaurant (I was taking pictures of the architecture) but other than that, I've always had a great experience!
