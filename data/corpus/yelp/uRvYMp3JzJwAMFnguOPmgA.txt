Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
This place is non-stop meat. I've been to Agora where I actually like the salad bar better. But the waiters there are slow compared to Fogo where they just keep bringing out the meaty glory.... . Cooked exactly as you would find in Brazil, don't bring your steakhouse expectations here. It's just different. Steakhouses people use terms like butter to describe how tender a steak is. This is not how the Brazilians do it. Food to me often needs to find texture and butter is not a quality I find favorable for a steak. With Brazilian preparation, I enjoy the char on the meat, simple seasoning (I hate sweet meat), and the variety. I don't do many regular steakhouses these days. You just get one big slab of meat with little variety and you might order one or two sides. Places like this you get to try everything and that makes you feel like you're not missing out on anything.. . The thing that doesn't make this a 5 star restaurant experience for me is the price and salad bar. But I would come back here with friends for sure...
