Four of us had a great time on Saturday night here. . . Drinks: Top shelf margaritas were had and were LOVED. Even the Sangria was top-notch. I don't usually like it, but the mix of red wine and juices was great.. . Food: This is where they really excel! As soon as you order expect a whirlwind of tasty treats to arrive at your table post haste. Standouts were the Colombian Shrimp, Grouper Tacos, and Chicken Tacos. . . The service was pretty good for a busy friday night. We sat outside and it wasn't too loud as others have indicated. Great music and a fun scene.. . Plan on spending your evening with lots of bachelorette parties and large groups. If you want a quite evening go somewhere else.. . If you're a single dude hang out at the bar and then dance with some of the cougariffic chicks hanging around. The girl:guy ratio is similar to what you'd find in a pilates class.
