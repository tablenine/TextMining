OK let me preface this review by saying that the one time I actually went inside Delicatessen, I felt like it was too cool for me. Really I just went in because my friend and I'd been wandering around Soho all day and he had to use the restroom (shhhhh!) Although I suppose the act of us ducking into this swanky looking place just so he could use the restroom pretty much cements the fact that I am, in fact, not good enough for Delicatessen.. . Fast forward to last week. I'd been at work for 15 hours, couldn't see straight, and was starving. I needed a place that delivered late (because my lazy ass wasn't movin' nowhere for nobody) and there was Delicatessen! I decided on the scallops with the parsnip puree, brussels sprouts, bacon, and quail egg.. . OH. MY. GOD. . Party in my mouth!!!!! I've never had anything so delicious. Well, that might be an overstatement, but it was definitely one of the top 10 things I've eaten in my life. Seriously. There are no words. MMMMM scallops! MMMMMM sauce! MMMMMM perfectly runny quail eggs! MMMMM and those BRUSSELS SPROUTS! They come as a side by themselves at dinner - get them!. . My poor boyfriend was forced to first watch me dive face-first into the take-out box while devouring the dish (which maybe took 2 minutes?), then had to spend the next 45 minutes listening to me tell him how amazing it was. I'm surprised he didn't leave me. Ah, true love :)
