I eat here pretty regularly. Sometimes there is a tiny wait but the tables turn around quite fast because they make the food really fast. I usually get the same thing...the vegetarian noodles. I can't remember what number it is. The hot vegetarian noodles are good too but I don't like eating that much soup. Not anything against the restaurant, it is a personal preference. Soup is just the same thing every bite. While the other noodles are a lot of different things, only in the same bowl. It is not a place to go if you want to be inconspicuous but there are lots of interesting people to look at. Cheap. Really good lemonade. The service is basic but that is fine with me. It's good to take away. I feel like an idiot with those noodles sometimes. And last time I almost choked on whatever plant is in the noodles. I'm not sure what it is, but I bit it and the stem got caught in my throat. Embarrassing.. - Sometimes the food doesn't sit well. I don't know...maybe I have an allergy that I am unaware of.. -Parking sucks.
