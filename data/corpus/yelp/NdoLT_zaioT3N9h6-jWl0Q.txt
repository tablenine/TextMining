Stopped here for some tea. The tea was really good, and a good selection. I also had a bagel and some fruit. The fruit was really fresh and the whip was nice and sweet. The bagel was just o.k. Service was a bit odd. I asked the guy for apricot tea and he was like "uhhh I don't know if we have that" I told him I saw it on the shelf and he was like, "go grab it"...found that strange. Anyways, the tea tasted good and the atmosphere was very interesting in a good way!
