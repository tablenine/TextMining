Worst service we've ever seen.  Waiters kept bringing wrong dishes to our table and forgot to bring our orders.  After our dishes finally arrived, we found sand in two dishes.   I almost lost half of my tooth.   We order the crab, but it tastes just okay with too much MSG.  This restaurant is way over-rated.  If you don't mind to eat dirty &amp; over-priced food, you should try this place out.
