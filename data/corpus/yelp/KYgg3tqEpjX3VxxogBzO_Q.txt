Hmmm...I thought I reviewed this place already...guess not. . . This place is worth visiting just for the view from the garden. The food is decent and so are the drinks but service is just okay. . . Good place for a romantic date but just for drinks...have dinner somewhere else.. . Edit 02/22/08 - The yelp elite party here was awesome. I still think the food is just okay but free drinks are always good. :) Sake to me foo~!!
