I've been coming here ever since I was a kid.  Nothing has changed over the years.  As others have indicated, they are known for their Hainan chicken and rice.  The best thing on their menu.  Moist and tender, even the white meat comes out moist.  Rice is cooked in the chicken fat but boy does it add some mean flavor.  Mix the ginger and hot sauce together and dip a piece of chicken into it and prepare to taste a little bit of heaven.  . . I am even willing to say that it tastes better than the famous Tian Tian in Singapore.  . . Lots of my friends/family do like the curry here but I prefer Japanese curry over the one they have here.  Haven't tried much of anything else on the menu. . . Brought a coworker here once and now he typically goes atleast 2-3 times a week.
