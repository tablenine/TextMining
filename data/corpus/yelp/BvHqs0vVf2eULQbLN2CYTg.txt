Like some people have been saying:  DO NOT believe the hype.  To those who enjoyed it, you are lucky.  . I waited 2 hours in line (luckily I was with some friends) and paid $11 for two pretty small burritos.. . When I got my order, I was pretty excited, and all of that excitement was gone when I took the first bite.  Both the spicy pork and the beef burritos tasted the same.  Also, the saltiness was extreme.  It was like they put some meat paste, and some kimchi paste in the burrito, and that was it.  A kind of sad excuse for food.. . Well, If you are to go with some friends, it is an experience,  but other than that, it is a complete waste of time and money.. . For $11, go to a sit down restaurant and get some good food.
