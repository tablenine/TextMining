Note. Did not eat IN, did not get their food. . Just tried their macarons.... . I have definitely had better.. It was pretty sad because they looked gorgeous.. bought a full box (little less than 30$ for the smallest box) 1.75 dalla per macaron..hm.. I believe they gave me one that had been sitting out for at least two days.. honestly, tastes were good, but the texture was too hard, almost stale.. . i will review once more once my experience improves.
