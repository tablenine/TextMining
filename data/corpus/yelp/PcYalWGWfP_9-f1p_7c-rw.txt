The view alone is worth the trip, the food is good, but in talking to the waiter they are trying to move away from being a "sushi-bar" and are focusing more on Asian-Fusion cuisine (yes this means the sushi menu is limited).. . BTW- if you are visiting and your iphone says .3 miles away- DO NOT WALK it is straight up hill.
