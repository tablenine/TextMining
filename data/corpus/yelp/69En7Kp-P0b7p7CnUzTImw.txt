Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
I've never eaten at Reza's so I can't comment on their service or atmosphere, but my parents usually pick up an order of the chicken and steak combo on their way home. It comes with one chicken kabob, one steak kabob, dill rice, pita bread, and some veggies. I'm not a big fan of the combo because I find the meat and rice quite dry. I like their hummus though, so if my parents give me a heads up that they're picking up Reza's then I order a side of hummus. $15 feeds two people, not a bad deal. . . It's in Andersonville, so good luck with parking.
