Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Every now and then I'd drive by here and the place always caught my eye.  I went to check it out even before I heard all the hype about it from friends and TV.  The food is crazy-generous and pretty good.  I've been looking for a mexican restaurant that makes refried beans like my girlfriend's mom makes, and I found it!  I looove the refried beans, I could eat it forever.  My husband gets the Manny special and it lasts him for 3 days.  The burrito is as heavy as my new born!  So whenever I go and visit my parents out in east LA and I'm craving for Mexican food, guess we're headed out to...
