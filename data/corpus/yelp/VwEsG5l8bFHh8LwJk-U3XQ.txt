This place is REALLY good. So far I've been twice and I have yet to be disappointed. Their queso dip and guacamole are the best place to start. Â I wish I could tell you that the entire menu is on point, but I've only eaten the carne a la parilla with the jalepeno mac-n-cheese. And of course it is very reasonably priced and service has yet to be horrible.
