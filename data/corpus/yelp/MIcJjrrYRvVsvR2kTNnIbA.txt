OK... gotta admit this place is unique for LA. Many guys bring their women to impress them here on a romantic unforgettable date. Hormone is floating in the air. Tough to make reservation, parking is only valet- and if you have a nice car, they will for sure be speeding with it, after they turn around the corner where you can't see them.. . In spite of a truly "amazing" view- that is, unless you get seated without a view, which happens most of the time- overall it's too expensive for the measley size and unimpressive appearance of their sushi. Well at least the fish was fresh every time - I visited 3-4 times &amp; never had a rotten morsel.. . I'd say: visit once, for the location, the view &amp; the unique "authentic" building (hehe) &amp; it will be quite enough... Prepare yourself to spend some money, cus you'll definitely be paying for them visuals.
