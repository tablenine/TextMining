Restaurant: The Mermaid Inn
Category: Seafood
I went to the Mermaid Inn on a recommendation from a friend of mine. Since moving back to NYC, I haven't had seafood, and the reviews on Yelp made it sound like the perfect place to go to for seafood, so why not.. . Anyhoo, I went here on a date. The atmosphere was perfect, the wait staff were extremely friendly, and (most importantly) the food was fantastic. Best salmon I've had in forever; even when I lived in Florida for a while, I didn't get salmon prepared as well as it was here. The beer selection was interesting, as well, and the two of us had a great time. Would recommend it to anyone.. . (Sorry for the lack of cohesion/coherence, but I had to write this twice since my browser crashed)
