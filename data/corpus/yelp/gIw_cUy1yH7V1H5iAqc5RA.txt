Great place to kick it with the homies/homegirls! The beer choice is overwhelming and the appetizers are great (especially when it's happy hour!)! And not in the mood to club? This is the spot on a Friday or Saturday! You have the great music, great crowd, and lotta eye candy to check out! And if you're in the mood to club after...the clubs/bars are just down the street!
