ok i've been converted. i actually love bottega louie now. the sterile white walls have grown on me. it's actually become quite soothing at the end of a long week or day, to just rest my eyes on nothingness. the din [it is quite noisy up in that place] actually serves as a drowning out instrument. all the indistinguishable hubub of the place lets me zone out too. and all while eating near-perfect white pizzas and shrimp pasta. we always seem to get the same server, CARL. and carl is a sweetheart.
