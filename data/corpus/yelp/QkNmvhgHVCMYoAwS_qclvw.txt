Kogi gets 7 stars for the concept....a Korean taco truck?  Are you kidding me?  Brilliant!. . I already love Korean BBQ, and I love taco trucks, so the combination is too good to be true.. . I give the tacos 3.5 stars.  Good, but after all the hype, was a bit disappointed.  The short rib taco is lightly marinated.  The spicy pork is more flavored as has some more kimchi on top, and is greasier.  Both good so order some of both.  They have burritos too but didn't try them.. . They have a twitter so that's the best way to ensure the truck is where you want it before you show up.
