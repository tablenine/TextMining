Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
This place rocks!  You will leave with a happy and full stomach.  Great dumplings, (shaolong bao), soups, etc.   It often gets busy, but worth the wait.  Service is quick and like most good Chinese restaurants, service is about efficiency not pampering.. .  I've recently been to the original restaurant in Taipei and to the one in Arcadia 3 or 4 other times.  I would love for the owners to open one in San Francisco Bay Area.  Cupertino or Milpitas would be a great location!
