David Burke's.....everyone raves it.  Finally went.  The service?  Excellent.  Our server was on top of everything.  The bus boys, awesome.  The food?  I love my steak..been eating it since I was 10...I know what a good steak is.  I was told to order the bone in.  It wasn't as tender as I had expected, the taste..?   Not so much.  I even threw on foie gras.  It was just a lot of meat.  We had oysters for appetizers..and I didn't get food poisoning, so it was good.  I guess, it's just like any other steakhouse.  I think it would've been a better experience if people didn't hype it up as much.  I don't think I'll be going back there again.
