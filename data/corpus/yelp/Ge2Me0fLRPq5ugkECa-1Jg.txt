Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's can be just "whatever" to local folks, but this is special to me. Great place for people watching- after all, there's always a wait. Awesome menu. I'll take a Millenium Dog (look it up) with bacon and some Chili Fries. Don't forget a side of Tums in your pocket.
