This place definitely lived up to its hype! We tried 3 different types of dumplings to start with and that was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. The bacon and squash were light and sweet and the lamb and the duck were robust with flavor and left me wanting more. But I still had my main dish coming, and I had no idea the flavor that was in store for me. I ordered the signature ramen noodles with pork belly and I had never had ramen like this before! With each delectable bite came one new flavor after another. The pork belly was succulent and I had to restrain myself from eating it all right away. I was nice enough to share with my husband and friend and although their dishes were also quite tasty, my taste buds were hooked on my ramen. I will definitely be coming back for more soon!. . You should note that there is no easy way to get to this place without driving but it is worth the trip!
