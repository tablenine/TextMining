Really great place if you're looking for a nice meal after a long day at work, but don't feel like paying the LA restaurant price.. . Casual place, where you order at the counter then bring the food to your table on a tray, but without the cafeteria-like atmosphere. They have a nice outdoor area with candles on the tables so it makes it feel like a more expensive dining experience than it really is. I had the steak with mashed potatoes and side salad and it was really really good---all for like ten bucks. Plus we had some nice wine which pulled everything together. . . Definitely want to go back to try other menu items.
