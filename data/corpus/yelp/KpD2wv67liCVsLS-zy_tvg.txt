dear urban belly. i think i'm in love with you. everything was so perfectly seasoned and balanced. your specials of the watermelon with the pork belly and shrimp were amazing. i got the special young coconut broth with rice noodles and scallops. the most tender scallops i have ever eaten. i'm usually skeptical of coconut broths being overpowering but this was sooo light and with a hint of heat to it. sooo delicious, i licked it clean. Â the kimchi was delightful. different veggies.. not the usual plain cabbage kimchi... cucumbers, radishes, the works. yum. . . my boyfriend got the udon... delicious and chewy and soft. the broth was delicious. his brother got the ramen... now i'm not usually a ramen person but the broth was so delicious.. the pork belly tender.. and the thin ramen was amazing.. . dumpling wise we tried the duck... fried perfectly and when you had a touch of the sauce it came with. simply mindblowing. i also ordered the asian squash with bacon dumplings. boiled ravioli like.. the squash tasted so unique with a tiny hint of the sprinkling of bacon bits on top. the touch of citrus from the sauce and the orange slice on top was a perfect compliment :] YAY. now to go back on a wednesday for foiegras dumplings. i must try them all :] i loved how it was next to a laundromat... a hidden gem in the middle of nowhere. LOVES IT.. . Read my blog about it here: . http://misstiffie.word....
