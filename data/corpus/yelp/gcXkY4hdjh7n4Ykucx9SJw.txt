Apparently, there is always a long wait to get into this joint.  It was no different the day I decided to eat at Daikokuya. The lunch hour crowd packed the place up. But let me just say, it was well worth the wait. The ramen was excellent!  The broth, noodles, the veggies, and egg that accompany the ramen is outstanding. The service was quick and efficient and our food came out nice and hot.  A great lunch place for sure and honestly, probably the best ramen I have ever had.
