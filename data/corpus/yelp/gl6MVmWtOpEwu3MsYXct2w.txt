Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
This place is tiny!  You seat yourself and wait to find space at the counter to order.. . We ordered the steak burger and ordered an apple pie to go.  Service was pretty prompt and quick.  Food arrived quickly, too, from what I can remember.  The burger was good.. . Apple pie was taken to go for a potluck.  I have to say the pie was unique since they gave us a type of sweet apple sauce to go with the pie.  A little bit unexpected but good.
