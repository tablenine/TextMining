Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
Uncle Julio's Hacienda is exactly the crap-ass chain style restaurant which gives Mexican food a bad reputation. The Wifey grew up in Northwest Indiana where they pretty much only have chain style Mexican restaurants and she has always disliked Mexican food. I LOVE Mexican food and can eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. After years of eating with me at quality Mexican restaurants the Wifey has come around and enjoys the taste of guacamole and cilantro. . . I had the tacos for lunch and the awful taste is still with me at 8:30 p.m. I have been to the hacienda before and every time I vow not to go back. This time I mean it! . . I gave the hacienda an extra star because I do enjoy their chips. If you go, my recommendation is have drinks, chips &amp; salsa, and go elsewhere for your entr√©e.
