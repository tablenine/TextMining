I think this place does almost everything right.  The only thing i don't love about it is the hipster attitude i get sometimes.  Occasionally when i come in, the people behind the counter just act like they couldn't give a shit.  They don't smile at you and seem annoyed to be taking your order or answering your questions.  I have no idea what the deal is.  I have noticed that the place seems to be entirely staffed by women.  Maybe that has something to do with it.  I have heard that women that are in close proximity tend to get on the same menstrual cycles.  Perhaps i am just coming in at the wrong time off month.  I'm not trying to be a misogynist, i'm just searching for a reasonable answer. . . Back to the biddness.... . They have an excellent selection of sweets (cookies, cupcakes, etc), food (breakfast and lunch) and drinks.  Their cup cakes go well with the fresh Intelligentsia coffee they carry.  Have a mini cupcake if you feel guilty.  Its small enough that the calories can't really put a dent in your diet.  . . If you are there for breakfast, go with the breakfast sandwich or breakfast burrito.  You won't go wrong in either case.  The lunch menu has about a dozen or so sandwiches and a few salads.  I like the crab cake sandwich and the pastrami sandwich.  Yesterday they had a tomato soup with kale and sausage that was outstanding also.  . . Seating is first come first serve.  Walk up to the counter, place your order, get a number, and then find a table.  I like their system.  You have to have your full party their though.  You can't hold seats for multiple extra people.  Again, i think thats OK.  Keeps the line moving and the tables open.  And on a nice day they have a sweet outdoor seating area on division.. . Pick up some of their home made granola also.  Goes great with yogurt in the morning for breakfast.
