Restaurant: La Crêperie
Category: French
Had such a great dinner here the other night!  The dinner crepes were really good, but maybe a bit rich as most of them had some sort of cream sauce in them.  I would definitely recommend the nutella and banana dessert crepe.  It was outstanding!  The prices are totally reasonable, and the crepes are big, so you can definitely split.  The restaurant can get a bit nosiy as it's kind of small, but it's a very cute date place if you're in the mood for something different!  If nothing else, go try the dessert crepes, they are definitely worth it!
