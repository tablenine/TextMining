Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
This was my second time coming to Pinks. I decided to come again with my friend who insisted on visiting Pinks because of the history involved and must see place if you come to California. I ended up waiting in line for 1 hour again and tried the following:. . 1) The Planet Hollywood Dog - Pretty good if you enjoy eating bacon and Mushrooms. 2) The Ozzy SPicy Dog - It was ok. 3) The Lord of the Rings Dog - Simple, reminded me of the western bacon cheeseburger from Carls.. 4) Nacho Fries - Super Yummy!. . The hot dogs were extremely big and you could get full off of just eating one. At the end you feel like you need to hit the gym because of all the fat that you just swallowed lol. The place is extremely hyped up but for any vistor to Hollywood its a must.
