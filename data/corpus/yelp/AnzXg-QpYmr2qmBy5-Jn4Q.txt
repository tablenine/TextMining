I can't believe I've been coming here for so long and never reviewed it.  . . Anyways, there is a great variety to the menu for really affordable prices and the portions are HUGE.  You can just split this with a friend and be full.  Their bubble teas are AMAZING and the best things here...huge, made with fresh fruit for the most part.  This is the best location too, I don't know if they have a better chef or what.  My favorite dishes here are the chicken teriyaki w/eggs over rice and their spicy thai shrimp with white rice that comes in a cute little wood container.  . . The reason I took off one star is because parking is tough to find, unless you're willing to fork over some cash for the public lot nearby.  I also take off one star because the staff is not the friendliest, but perhaps this is a cultural/language barrier thing.
