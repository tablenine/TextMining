i made an absolute pig of myself here last night. (as did my entire party!!) every christmas season, my boyfriend's family has a tradition - they see "a christmas carol", then head out to dinner. this year, dinner was at gioco. and oh man was it good!!. . they seated our party of eight right in the window. it was so intimate, and not at all cold. i was really surprised.. . i wish italian restaurants would stop bringing you your own bottle of decadent olive oil and bottomless bread baskets. i just can't turn it down!! and of course, we ordered three appetizers to share - the eggplant, calamari and meatballs. i tried everything but the meatballs. yum.. . at this point, i'm full. but there's more! i had wanted to try the paparadelle with wild boar and pine nuts - no wild boar :( so i went for my next choice - the rigatoni with pork cheeks and jowl, etc. amazingly rich and delicious!. . and then for dessert i tried the pumpkin cake with butter pecan gelato and cranberries. i'm a sucker for pumpkin everything. it delighted as well.. . we weren't rushed at all, and the wine was refilled generously throughout dinner. i would love to come back again...on an empty stomach, mind you, as i definitely overindulged this time!
