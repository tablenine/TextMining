Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Whenever there's a line, there's good food ahead.  Think about your favorite toppings, and they will put it on a hot dog for you.  This 5 stars I am giving it is not based upon the best service, but a great time and awesome food.  The prices are very reasonable and it is fun to people watch and notice all the celebrity pictures on the wall.  . Don't go here if you don't appreciate little holes in the wall, they are going for fast service and good food, and that is exactly what you will get, not perfect lighting or a romantic ambiance.  If you are having trouble deciding what you want to eat, get to the back of the line.  You don't want to piss off a bunch of hungry people ready to order.
