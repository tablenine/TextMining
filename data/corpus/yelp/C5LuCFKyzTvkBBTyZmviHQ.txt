You know how food snobs come out with The Best This and The Best That and hold a caucus to make some inane claim like the Best Pizza is made by some American dude in AZ? Well, I tell you what. This here snob, caucus of 1, will tell you the best chai tea is made by some white guy in Silver Lake at LAMILL.. . $6 for a 16oz chai masala tea, light on sugar please = the best damn chai tea I have ever had in my life. And i just got back from India so try to compute that shit in your brain.
