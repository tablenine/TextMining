I'm not a big meat eater, so I was happy to see a bunch of veggie friendly options.  When I asked the waitress what she thought was a better option between two that I was trying to pick between she told me and I went with her pick.  It was a salad and she said many people order it and it was one of her favorites.  But, when I got the salad it wasn't anything special.  I wish I hadn't listened to her.  I didn't ask my friend how her food was, I should've but it totally skipped my mind to do so, but she only ate half her sandwich, so I don't know if that says anything.  . . However, some good points were that it's a dog friendly place.  I was able to bring my dog and sit outside on a sunny day and they even brought out a bowl of water for him.  So, that was thoughtful.  Also, even though I didn't like the waitresses pick she was VERY knowledgeable about the full menu.  Always a good thing.
