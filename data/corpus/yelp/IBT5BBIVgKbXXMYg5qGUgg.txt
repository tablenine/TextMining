Hands down the BEST Pastrami on Rye I've ever had. Better than Jerry's, Canters, Factors, Juniors, Johnnies, and The Hat! Thick, tender slices of warm pastrami, stacked high (but not too high) on rye bread that was ohhh soo soft in the middle and amazingly crunchy on the outside. At first I thought I could only eat  of the sandwich, then as I bit into the second half I was thinking how am I going to finish this? Bite by bite I managed to devour every tender morsel of meat until it was all gone! The chicken soup on the other hand gets a thumb down. How can you make chicken soup with and put no chicken inside? It should be called chicken flavored noodle soup. Shame on you Langers for taking $2.75 from me and in return giving me a cup of chicken flavored water with noodles floating inside. The only other downside is that if you go solo the tables for one are right up next to tables for two or more. So you are practically sitting with the people next to you hearing every word of their conversation. I asked if I could sit in a booth near the window but even though it was after the lunch rush I was told that is for parties of 2 or more.  They also close too early at 4pm and are not open sundays which is also a downside! I could eat one of these babys at all hours of the night!
