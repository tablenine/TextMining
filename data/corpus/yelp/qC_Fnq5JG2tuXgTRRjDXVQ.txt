Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Joy's is a wonderful Thai restaurant that is BYOB, takes reservations, and has plenty of seating space inside.  You can have dinner for two with appetizers for around $20 total, with plenty of leftovers for later.  You just can't beat that.  The online ordering/delivery service is amazing as well.  If you go here once, there is a good chance you will come back time and time again.
