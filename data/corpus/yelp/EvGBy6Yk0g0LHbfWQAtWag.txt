Gourmet burgers, belgian fries and BBQ - uber-yum!!  Wellll.... that's what I was hoping for.. . I had a cheeseburger special which came with the belgian fries and a fountain drink, for 8 bucks not too hard on the wallet. After waiting in the bright and comfy dining room, my burger was brought to me perfectly dressed, and medium rare as i had ordered it.  A side of flavored mayo came for the fries.... I was starving.  i was drooling.  It looked so, so goooooood.... and then.  . . Meh.. . Ummmm.... do I need to map out the obvious metaphor here?  Let's just say there was no applause in the final act.  No cherrry on the sundae.  No olive in the martini.  I didn't "finish" in the way that a girl should after making a commitment to blow a day's worth of calories on a single meal.. . The fries were pretty bland and a litle too chewy.  That flavored mayo was the best thing going, and frankly when I find myself using a fried potato as a conduit for mayonnaise, I know something's gone awry.  Their "homemade"ketchup was thin which would have been fine if it had had more flavor than your average ketchup.  Sadly, it did not.     . . The meat on the burger, while clearly fresh and cooked properly also lacked a certain "something"...oh what do we call it?  Flavor?  That's it.  The tomatoes were mealy and soggy.. . I ate the whole fucking thing waiting to enjoy it.  Then I felt like one unsatisfied Oinkster.  Would I go back?  Perhaps... I didn't try the BBQ and they have an interesting, simple menu of salads that I would try.. . My daughter loved the PB &amp;J cupcake, and it's in beautiful Eagle Rock, so two shiny stars for Oinkster!
