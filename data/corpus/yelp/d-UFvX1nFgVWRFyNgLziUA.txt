A beautiful location and restaurant, but sooooo overrated and overpriced. It's cool to know you're in a place where movies have been filmed, but that doesn't make up for the crappy food and small portions. I ordered one roll, the Darth Vadar, and it sucked!! They covered, and i mean saturated, my roll with black roe. I couldn't even taste my roll because the saltiness of the fish eggs was overwhelming. I was VERY disappointed. My friend ordered another roll and got like 6 pieces. The only good thing I got there was this lychee martini. I think next time, if there ever is a next time, I'll stick with the cocktails and forget the sushi!
