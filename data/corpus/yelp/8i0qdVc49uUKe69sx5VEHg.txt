Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
The Stinker~affordable decent Italian food. Would I bring my date here? Depends if I'll being giving kisses that night. They use a lot of garlic so for some of you out there trying to avoid smacking lips, come here for dinner. . . Don't be lame and say "ewww....so much garlic...blah blah whine whine" The restaurants name says it all. Friendly staff. Oh... and those of you who turns bright red whenever you drink, come drink at this place. The red lighting helps..so you can't really tell.
