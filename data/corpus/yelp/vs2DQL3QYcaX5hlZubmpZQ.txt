The pizza here is fantastic! I, especially, love the deep dish pizza. It's so goowy and the cheese stretches for miles and miles...mmmm. the side orders are great too. i like the zuchinni and mushrooms. the drinks are okay although, they have only what? coke and orange? but, the restaurant itself has a really family feel to it and is the perfect place for a family gathering or a place just to chill with friends.
