Sushi-Gasm found here. Everything, i mean everything we ordered was just so yummy. The tuna with that mustard sauce made my pants moist. That's because I dropped a piece, i can't use chopsticks. I ate it though, it was that good. Salmon on crunchy rice is something that could start wars. And i tried sea urchin for the first time here and i gotta say, i didn't hate it. It was like peanut butter, but ocean flavour.
