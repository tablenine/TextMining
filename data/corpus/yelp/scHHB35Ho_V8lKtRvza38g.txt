I'm fighting a cold right now! So it's unfair for me to be critical of the food in this review! So I'll reserve my opinion for another visit!. . Place was packed as expected! Service was very slow and unorganized, It looked as if the server was new and still getting to know the menu. She was very nice and polite.. . The food took a long time to come out. We arrived at 7:00 and left at 9:30 pm. No big deal we weren't in a hurry and had plenty to catch up on.. . Everyone else seemed to love the food and the presentation style was good!. . Looking forward to my next visit! I hope it's as good as NYC or Chicago, I've found it very difficult to get great Sushi in Atlanta, What's the deal with that?
