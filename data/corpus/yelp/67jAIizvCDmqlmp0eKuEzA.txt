Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
At Little Tokyo's Orochon Ramen, choose your own ramentastic adventure in three easy steps:. . 1. Choose a soup: I picked the soy sauce-flavored broth ($6.75).. 2. Choose a spice level: Orochon uses a 7-point scale, where 7 is weakest, and 1 has a "EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!" call-out. I chose their "EXTREME OROCHON" flavor. (To be specific, I got their hottest flavor, the strangely-named "SPECIAL 2".). 3. Add toppings: a cha-shu pork slice ($1.25) and an egg (99 cents) found their way into my bowl. (If you think have room, get their flavorful bambooshoot appetizer, too.). . At Orochon, if you can finish a serving of their spicy noodles in 30 minutes, you can get your mug added to their "Wall of Bravery". (You need to opt-in to the Challenge, and of course, I did.) We sat outside in the warm sun, which didn't help matters, but our server (Aiko) armed me with two glasses of water (FYI, I only drank one). Besides a few racking coughs when I took my first sip, I finished my ramen - and most of the jalapenos - with little difficulty: that's some good stuff!. . Unfortunately, to win the Challenge, you need to finish everything - even the broth. Staring at a half-bowl of salty soup, with four minutes to go, I threw in the towel, even though it wouldn't be entirely unreasonable for me force it all down. (C'mon, I'm famous already, why do I need my photo elsewhere?) One day, I'll return and beat their Challenge, now that I've cut my teeth.. . Orochon Ramen does noodles right.
