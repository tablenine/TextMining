Yeah so all it takes for me to be a fan is free beer. I actually had a great time here. Went in for some Monday night football and a few beers. Well threw back a few and then a few more and the game was almost over and thought, yeah I'm done, but then another beer appeared. Yeah the bartender hooked me up with a free beer. Yeah that's great service. I will be back, and luckily I live close enough to stumble home afterwards.
