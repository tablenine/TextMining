Love this place!  Great atmosphere, simple design &amp; a fantastic concept! Where else can you go in LA for a great gourmet sausage and beer?  I read about this place in the Downtown News and was picturing it to be like The Red Lion, but it's totally different.  It has a beer hall setting and they serve sausages (the Austin Blues is my fav), awesome fries with dipping sauces &amp; a great selection of beers.  The place has been packed since day one!  Happy it is downtown!
