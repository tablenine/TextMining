Review # 478 for Sushi Gen...After a 3 day debacle of jury service that book-ended my 4th of July weekend, i was finally free (excused) and decided to celebrate by trying Sushi Gen for the first time.  It was noon, a Monday, and the place was jammed.  As a first timer, the host explained that the lunch menu could not be accessed at the sushi bar (which was relatively empty), and that explained the long wait for a table.  Not having 30 extra minutes to kill, we opted for the sushi bar and stuffed our faces with lots of fresh, delicious sushi.  However, having deviated from the lunch menu, we racked up $102 in charges(no, i don't weigh 200 pounds and yes, for those of us not producing $100MM films or making any substantial income, that's really expensive--i felt the bite).  The sushi is great, the service is automatic and chilly but effective, and the interior is quite comfortable.  I think the place is great, but it's pricey, and frankly the sushi is just as good at Komasa and much, much cheaper.   Plus, the service at Komasa is friendlier.  Unfortunately, Komasa is not open for lunch, so if you have a hankering for raw fish, and you're downtown, you won't be disappointed by Sushi Gen, but if you are there for lunch and don't have money busting out of your pockets, you might want to wait for table.
