Best pizza I have had in US of A. highlights - Crust, creative topping combination, creative appetizers and side item.. . No mixing/customization of toppings allowed which is fine, because chef is brilliant and I will gladly eat whatever he creates.. . zucchini flower fritters, roaster pumpkin crostini, wild-mushroom pizza and italian sausage+green scallion pizza were all excellent.. . wine was not cheap or expensive - I had a carafe.. . Damn LA!, totally smoking the SF out of the pizza scene.
