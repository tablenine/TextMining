I want to write and sing songs about Stanley's. But I suck at songwriting and I could make a deaf person cry with my singing so I'll yelp it instead. . . So there's two parts to Stanley's. Front room is the bar, strewn with peanut shells and beers clinking everywhere. The back room is the dining room and this where I put my hat down and thank God silently for the grub I'm about to partake in. . . Get the fried chicken-it takes 30 minutes because they really put it in a pressure cooker which is totally old school. Get some mac n cheese with it and veggies to balance out the mac n cheese. I always get the crabcake appetizers and a hefty load of Dr. Peppers to help me pass the time. I also write all over their paper table covers with crayons-it's allowed. The wait for the fried chicken is totally worth every pound I gain from it with the mounds of mashed potatoes and vegetables they serve with it also. SOOOOO GOOD.. . Did I mention they also do Sunday brunch? I could do another review on that alone. Go for dinner or lunch-both are fantastic but you HAVE to try their brunch once. Beer, Bloody Mary Bar and the game on a Sunday morning? What's not to love?
