I finally made it to Canters after two years in L.A.  I went with the corned beef reuben as I feel that is the best way to judge a deli.  The sandwich was very good.  Not the greatest reuben I've ever had but definitely in the top 90th percentile.  They serve the russian dressing on the side which I thought was weird since I didn't request it that way but whatever.  The half sour pickles were good.  The cole slaw on the other hand was very generic.  The food is not quite in the class of Langers in my opinion but still good.   Of course I've only had the pastrami at Langers so I'm comparing apples to oranges or pastrami to corned beef in this case.. . The atmosphere is really nice.  It's not classy by any stretch but it has that very comfortable NY deli feel and it's much bigger then I imagined inside.  They also have a good amount of GNR memorabilia in the bar.  GNR did their first publicity photo shoot right in one of the booths there and I guess the owner's son is good friends with the band or something.
