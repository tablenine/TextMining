I had an attempt to try this place during a lunch rush but did not have the patience to put my name down on the waiting list. It was packed!. So, I just checked out their deli and bakery section. Very european...everything looks delectable.. Finally, with my recommendation to my son's random dinner treat tonight, we did a bit of food tasting on Louie.. Waitstaff: deserves a 5 star for a superb customer service, very .                    attentive, has a very pleasing personality. Food: Louie Salad, Portobello fries, Pan Seared Halibut, Lasagna,.              Clam and Mussel Pizza are absolutely divine. All are prepared.              and cooked into perfection. It's a 5 star.. Beverages: Complimentary sparkling water, Pinot Grizio, Arnold.                       Palmer tea, Mojito are good.. Dessert: Chocolate Souffle with Creme Anglaise is one of the best.                  I've tasted.. . The only thing that did not get my 5 star on this place is the loud noises that echoed from the high towered ceiling to the whole dining area. It seems like you're in a club with outrageously loud buzzing and chatting sound not from the music but from the diners. Absolutely not recommended for dating or a business lunch. Too noisy to talk about. some important or intimate matters. It's such a fine restaurant with a noisy environment. It reminds me of some chinese restos in Hongkong and China.
