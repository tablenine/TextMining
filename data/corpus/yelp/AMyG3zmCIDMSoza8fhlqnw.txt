Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
It was hard for me at first, several years ago, to accept this place, seeing as how I used to frequent this same place when it was called the Boulevard Cafe. I had way too many good times at the Blvd. to count. However, now that I live within walking distance of Dunlay's, I have to say my feelings have changed. I have gone in the summertime for burgers and beer and brought my dog to sit outside with us (Dunlay's provides the water :) I have also gone on Thursday nights for $5 martini night with friends, and most recently have been going for brunch. I must say, the fresh fruit pancakes are one of the best things this place has to offer-one of the best brunches in the city too, especially with those crazy cheesy rosemary potatoes they offer. I mean, most places just give you fried potatoes or hash browns, but Dunlays really steps to the plate with their offerings. Love love love it.
