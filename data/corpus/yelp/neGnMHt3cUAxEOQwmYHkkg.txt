This may be my favorite sushi bar out of the handful I've tried in the A.  It looks trendy inside but the menu is simple - no noodles, no katsu, no teppan, just sushi.  They have all the basic rolls and some specialty ones but nothing crazy like cranberries or chicken.  The candybox roll and the seaweed salad were the highlights of my meal.. . Fresh fish, great service, low-key, and fun but pricey drinks make this sushi place one of my faves in the A, ITP anyway.
