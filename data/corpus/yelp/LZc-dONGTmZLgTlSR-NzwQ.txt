Rodan is my Cheers.  I am there a lot and I like it.  I love their empenadas  and their fries and their staff.  And on Mondays I get drunk off of Champagne and Tuesday is a rough day at work.  The music is almost always good or at least tolerable and there are a lot of pretty people there.  The weekends are a different crowd and I tend to not go then.
