I found the pho broth to be very flat.  It lacked that depth of flavor that all good pho broths have.. . If you've ever had "real" pho, you'd feel the same way.  Actually surprised at how many people think the pho tastes good. I found it very weak and not flavorful at all, and I hardly tasted any star anise or complex flavors.  . . I snicker every time I see a hipster eating the banh xeo with rice paper because that is sooo NOT how you eat banh xeo!  Surprised that the owners would even offer that as a way to eat it.
