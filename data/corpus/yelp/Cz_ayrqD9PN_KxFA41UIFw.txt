dude this place is $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. 2 sandwhiches. 1 large fries . 1 coffee . 1 heinie. $45 . PLUS Â tip ( &amp; a big one at that cuz i sat at the counter waiting for my bf &amp; betty white waitress kept chirping "is he coming soon??" so i felt like i needed to compensate for holding the booth..). LONG line out the door around 130ish. like 30 ppl dude.. i saw jerry o'connell &amp; he looked like a regular old pico union tweaker.... nevertheless, langers' food is on my top 5
