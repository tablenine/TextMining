I went here only twice for brunch, because Flying biscuit was too crowded and I was too hungry. It is all you can eat (not buffet style, but from a menu they have with pre-selected choices). I won't bother telling you what I had, because my table of 5 had just about everything the menu had to offer. I wouldn't recommend this place for brunch, if you're a real breakfast/brunch fanatic, like I am. . But, I will say that they had a good drink menu and the drinks were like $4, the drinks looked so good, I actually took the menu (I'm so a thief, I feel so embarrassed... so scratch that, I really didn't take it). I also read about belly dancing nights. That should be fun.
