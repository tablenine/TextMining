I love that this place is 24 hours because i always manage to end up here faded! Their onion rings are the best ever!! Â The sandwiches and some of the burgers tend to be on the dry side, spread on some more ketchup and you'll be alright. I also love their strawberry waffles.. they are good. overall a great place to eat.
