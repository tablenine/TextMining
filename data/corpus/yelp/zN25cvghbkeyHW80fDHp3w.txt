i think yelp has this place underrated.. i remembered it from daniel boulud, but forgot the harrison ford connection.. came for dinela lunch, and it was quite excellent.. on that menu, i think there's only 1 choice really. clam chowder, roasted chicken leg, and dessert sundae. also had the hash. everything was delish.. the clam chowder was light (instead of cream heavy), with clams in the shell, bacon, and crostini...portion is small. the roasted chicken with large flat egg noodle, perfect meat texture and amazing broth, hearty, abounding with flavor. the ice cream and banana had an expert complex tasting glaze that was perfect (glad they didn't use too much bacon). culver city still looks very up and coming.
