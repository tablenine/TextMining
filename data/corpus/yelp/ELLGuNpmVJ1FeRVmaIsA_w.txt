The food was very good and had a great price.  The only thing I didn't like was the refried beans, but the tacos and enchiladas are great.  I would suggest going for lunch and not dinner as it will be more expensive to fill yourself up at the end of the day.  They charge per item, it's not a preset amount of food on a plate.
