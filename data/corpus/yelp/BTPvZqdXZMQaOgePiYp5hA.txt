My roommate and I went here late Wed night, so we missed the long lines.  She got this rich chocolate cake and a hazelnut cookie.  I got a chocolate cupcake and the panna cotta.  One bite of the hazelnut cookie and it was very dry, but had an interesting taste.  The chocolate cupcake was good, except for the frosting -- way too sugary.  But the panna cotta... it was absolutely wonderful.  Those four stars are explicitly for the panna cotta.
