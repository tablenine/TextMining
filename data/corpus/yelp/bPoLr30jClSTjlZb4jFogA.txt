I went to JCT for the first time last week on a Saturday night. We decided to eat there last minute and I was so pleasantly surprised with this place. The room is beautiful, the servers are very nice, and the menu is just great. After dinner we went upstairs for a drink and had dessert at the bar. Â Great experience! Will be going there for lunch today! :)
