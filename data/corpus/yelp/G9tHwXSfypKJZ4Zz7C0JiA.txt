Well, I finally made my way to Humboldt Park after having lived in Chicago for nearly nine years (sad I know).  I had the express purpose of eating at Bite, because I've heard great things about it.  It WAS excellent food at a great price, with good service.  I had the green curry with tofu, and enjoyed some BYOB wine.  The atmosphere is casual, and they basically let us sit there and chat for as long as we wanted.  I'll definitely be back to try their Bite Salad.  For those of you in Wicker Park, venture out of the hood to this place. It's not far off the corner of Western/Division, and is an easy hop on the #70.  Have fun, eat well, and save some cash, gentle readers!
