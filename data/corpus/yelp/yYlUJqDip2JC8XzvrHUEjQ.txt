Probably the best or darn close to the best Chinese food in town! Imagine a PF Changs, but about half the size, better food, not nearly as loud, and you can eat a full meal under $10, vs. $15 alone for the Mongolian beef elsewhere. Combo meals are around $9-11 and give you the full compliment of soup, side, and meal in just the right portions to make you happy, or you can order the full size entree for $1-2 more and it skips the extras but you get a good sized plate.. . This establishment rates up there because the quality of the meats and almost every dish I've had, has never been a let down. You can customize it too, requesting certain vegetables to be on or off and the waiter will not fight with you one bit, and happily oblige. . . The vegetarian menu is also interesting, while I'll still eat things that had a face, I've given that menu a try and I'll say this, the "chicken" and "beef" that they use, is stellar for not being the real thing. Plus it helps to offer this as some of my friends can't/won't eat meat so the Buddha is the solution for dinner night outs.. . Crowds of 4-6 will be fine, any more and it is hit or miss with seating. You have booths and tables of course, layed out on the single level and the kitchen is off to your right as you walk in. The red tinted glass window lets you watch the cooks at work, and the service is all around friendly and on top of things to keep your drinks full and the table clean.. . Oh did I mention they are open from 11 AM to 6 AM? 3 AM craving for Hunan beef and some crab ran goon? No problem, they got you covered. :love:
