I died and came to pastry heaven!!  My eyes got glassy when I walked the full length of the glass display counter - YUM!!. The place was packed, but they were for fast and efficient there that it did not matter.  Tons of seating, inside and out.. I had a feta sandwhich that was on a really fresh baguette with tomatoes, basil and olive oil. It's also served with plantain chips.  And for desert I had a chocolate cupcake.. Can't wait to make eat my way thru the pastry selection :)
