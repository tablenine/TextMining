Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So with all what I've heard about Pink's, I had to give this place a try.  In the end, I left disappointed, and it was really just....Hype.. . So after a trip to the Getty Center and a light lunch at Hide Sushi in West LA, my friends and I decided to venture to Hollywood for some hot dogs, since we've heard so much about it.  At about 3pm on a Saturday, I figured it was probably an offpeak time for this place.  Boy, was I wrong about that one!  The wait was about 45mins, which probably was not bad since I've read a lot longer wait times here.. . Once the wait was over, I got myself a Mullholland Drive Dog.  Who wouldn't want a heart attack on a hot dog bun (aka 10'' dog with nacho cheese sauce, bacon, grilled onions and mushrooms).  Plus a soda, the $7 I paid for was OK, but honestly, the hot dog was really just decent.  For the wait, and the hype I've heard about this place, I'd much rather get a dog and drink at Costco for $1.50.  I don't know how this place could be the "best hot dog in LA," but since I'm not a big fan of hot dogs anyways, maybe I don't know any better.  Overall, it wasn't worth the effort to get there, plus the time waited in line for this grub.  I can definitely say I've tried Pink's since it's such a landmark, but I know I wouldn't be going back.
