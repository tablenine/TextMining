Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Okay, I'm an original New Yorker and to stand in line for a damn hot dog is ridiculous. Â The onions are out of a can or jar..sabrett's onions found in most grocery stores..don't be fooled..the chili is also out of a can too...This is a novelty..go once for the experience of Pink's but you can buy the stuff and the grocery store to make your hot dogs just the same..Angeleno's don't know any better, but New Yorkers do!
