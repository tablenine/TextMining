Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Situated on trendy 3rd street, amidst other breakfast nooks and boutiques, Joan's is the perfect place to grab a coffee and a snack.  However, if you're looking for a hearty meal, attentive wait staff and for more than one or two choices, you'd be better off going to Toast (down the street).. . I love the location, and the market itself.  However, like most cafes, the menu is limited, and the choices for vegans are even more sparse.  For breakfast, I sampled the rolled oats and substituted soy milk.  It was tasty but overpriced.  The iced tea was $2.00 and the waiter never refilled it.  Also, due to a mess-up in the kitchen, one of the people in my party received their food late.. . If you're looking for atmosphere, location and the trendy factor, Joan's is for you.  Be prepared to pay a little extra, and don't complain about the dearth of menu options.
