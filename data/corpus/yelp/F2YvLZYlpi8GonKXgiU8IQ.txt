i CRAVE their white sangria. i try to get people to come with me for a glass or a pitcher whenever i can. i tried to order white sangria at another place in old town and it just wasn't the same. the atmosphere at night is pretty cool too. they've got two bars open one room always has music playing and a small dance floor and theres a slightly quieter area on the opposite side... the area i prefer. the staff is cool, drinks are good. what else do you need?
