It's more hype than anything. Â Everything was above average. The food was definitely better than mediocre. But I don't think it was outstanding. Perhaps it was what we ordered, but I didn't think anything was special about the menu. I didn't even particularly like the portabello mushrooms. The staff was great. The interior is eye catching. But the noise level is OFF THE HOOK. And not in a good way... . . Food = C-. Staff/Service = B. Environment = C. Overall = C. . A good place to take your friends if you want to try something new and that's being touted as good.
