Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Roscoe puts the "pleasure" in guilty.  You wouldn't be living if you hadn't at least checked this place out.  . . This is my favorite of their locations.  The servers will engage in banter, make you feel at home and then bring you high cholesterol, high flavor nuggets of heaven.  And, enough gravy and syrup to bathe in. They offer all the accoutrement.  Fried chicken, waffles, grits, black-eyed peas, corn bread, sweet potato pie, corn on the cob, greens and wet naps. Thank heaven for the wet naps.
