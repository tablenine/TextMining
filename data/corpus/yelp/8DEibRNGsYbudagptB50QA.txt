this might seem like another boujie west la restuarant but fear not my people this place actually makes you full and worth your money. i try to beat the lunch crowd it usually ceases around 2. i highly recommend the mash taters. so yummy. i usually get the hot place. you get meat, good portion of salad and mash potaoes. its best deal. last time i got big salad and swear it was only 2 slices of meat and the rest was lettuce i am not a bunny.
