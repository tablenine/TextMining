As you can see, this is my first review on here. I usually don't waste my time writing reviews for restaurants whether good or bad, because I truly believe the food and service will speak for themselves over time. HOWEVER, I am so disgusted by what I have witnessed at Fraiche in Culver City that I feel I MUST warn others of what I experienced.. I have to say (even though I really do love the food here and the service always seems to decent) is the chef really surprised me.  It is obviously customary for the chef to grab a drink after his shift and go to the bar here. Me and my guests have witnessed a few times before when the chef has taken his hair down, gotten a drink (or three) and talked very loudly (even in the middle of a rush it seems at times), but last night the chef literally UNZIPPED his pants in the lounge area.  Now i know what you're thinking, in his defense he was doing so to tuck in his shirt, that part does not bother me (a lot). But in front of PAYING customers? After you have been claiming you are the chef all night? My guest was shocked....Unzipping your pants so that guests are able to see your undergarments is truly unexceptable, ESPECIALLY in a restaurant.. . All i could think about was how THOSE hands were all over the food I ate that night. Enough said.
