Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
My recommendation is to begin with the dinner salad which is served with the most delicious house dressing and also the mediterranean bread. If you still have room for the main coarse, a Pizza Pot Pie, a creative and delicious alternative to Pizza.  They also have a tasty rum gelato for desert.  The wait staff is excellent every time I go as well.  The only downer is that the place is always very crowded...and there is usually a long wait.  Suprisingly, the same adorable old man is always seating guests and memorizes every party in order which is quite amusing.
