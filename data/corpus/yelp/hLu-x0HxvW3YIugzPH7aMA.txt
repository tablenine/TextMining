This place serves their full menu until close! 2am on the Weekends!. . The PERFECT place to go get GOOD pizza or dessert after seeing Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind. We always hit this place afterwards.. . Late nights offer cheesy lounge singers and middle age and older people drinking and dancing, but the service was always good and the food/drinks far better than anything else open at that time of night.
