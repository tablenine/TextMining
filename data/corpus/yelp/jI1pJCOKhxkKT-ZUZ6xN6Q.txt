Like bees waiting to mate or make honey or whatever it is they do when researchers aren't injecting them with cocaine, the Wafels and Dinges truck and I have been engaged in a delicate dance of courtship and seduction for several months now. Usually when I happen upon it, I'm on my way home from consuming 400% of my daily recommended caloric intake in popcorn (when it's parked at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas) or mojitos (when it's by Union Square).. . Tonight, the mood was finally right.. . And it was as gentle, sweet, and perfect as it could possibly be.. . I don't know what the below reviews are talking about -- this tasted exactly like the Liege waffles did in Brussels, maybe because I got mine at Christopher Street and ate it in the subway, just like I did in Brussels. It's all about context. The guys sitting next to me on the train were jealous!. . Also, the wafelman was super-nice and gave me a lot of free toppings (dinges?). Definitely a value at $4!
