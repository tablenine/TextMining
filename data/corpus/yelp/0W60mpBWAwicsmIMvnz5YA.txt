Trendy and well decorated restaurant, but not overbearing/over the top. . . Generally has very fresh/good sushi, though it doesnt come cheap -. . For dinner I tried out the salmon ceviche, cold cha soba noodles, spicy tuna and lobster tempura roll - all of which I would recommend.  And for dessert?  Lychee panna cotta ... which was great, especially because panna cotta is my fav.
