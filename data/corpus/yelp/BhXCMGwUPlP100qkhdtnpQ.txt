Restaurant: Sun In My Belly
Category: Caterers
There are definitely a couple of servers who could stand to read How to Make Friends and Influence People, but not even the meanest mug could make that bacon or french toast taste bad. Generally I hate eating bacon by itself, but Sun in my Belly has engineered some kind of super bacon that I could eat every day of my life if it wouldn't lead to sudden heart disease. I definitely recommend the Kirkwood to first time eaters. You get the bacon, scrambled eggs, and a buttermilk biscuit that almost gives the Flying Biscuit a run for its money. I'm not a hug egg fan so I usually substitute them for fresh fruit which is just that, fresh. An instant breakfast killer can be getting fruit that's been frozen or sitting out and lacking in juicy flavor.. . If you want the full effect of those gigantic blackberries and strawberrries, the french toast is a great starting point. I had average expectations when I ordered it and was floored when it came out. This is like food porn that you see on cooking competitions. Crispy (nothing worse than soggy french toast ughhh) toast, enormous berries, and a light whip cream. Divine and really, really filling.. . I've never had the baked goods behind the counter but have heard rave lemon bar and muffin reviews from friends. So yeah, you might get some haughty servers but, and maybe I'm just jaded, that's almost expected at Atlanta hot spots. So I'd rather roll my eyes and suffer through it over some bomb ass brunch.
