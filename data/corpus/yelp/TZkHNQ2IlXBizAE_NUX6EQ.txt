Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
It is all you can eat korean bbq for $16.99/person. It comes with 5 different kinds of meats to choose from and several side dishes. I always ask for two order of the boiled scramble egg! As for meat, I never go wrong with the short rib and brisket.. MMMmmmmm. . . I would have given them a better rating but sometimes there service sucks. The servers are very rude and don't really give a shit about you but I just try and be nice to them so they don't think about/ about spitting in my food! So just bite your tongue and brush 'em off!
