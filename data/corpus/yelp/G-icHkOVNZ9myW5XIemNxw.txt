This place's reputation has spoken for itself. It's gone from a little known place that's supposed to have killer guacamole to a premier authentic Mexican place in Chicago, with a booth at the Taste. The guacamole is the best in Chicago, and prepared tableside. The entrees are great, from carne asada to the pechuga. Highly recommended on all accounts. Grab an Adobo Margarita, or add another $1 for premium tequila - of which there are tons there.
