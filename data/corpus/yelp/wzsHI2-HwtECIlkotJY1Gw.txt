I'm deducting a star because I'm a creature of habit and change scares me. . . Here are a few things that annoy me in general:. . 1. Having to eat while standing.. 2. Eating with strangers.. 3. Having to eat while standing with strangers.. . Thank you, Chego, for getting rid of your individual dining tables and replacing them with a giant planks of wood. I would take my grandma there, but unfortunately, there's no way she could manuever her body into the picnic bench, and I don't want her to eat standing up. All around, it's an incredibly bad idea. But I'm guessing you can squeeze more people into the space with this set up. . . On the plus side, congrats on getting real silverware.
