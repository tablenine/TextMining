I'm happy to spend any lunch hour in the warm  LA sun with a glass of wine and a plate of steamed shrimp.  So was my lunch last week at Hungry Cat.  It's definitely a little pricey for lunch, but a girl can't complain when her co-worker picks up the tab. Now can she?. . AFter said shrimp and wine, I moved on to the fish tacos.  They brought me extra avocado at no charge.  Yay!  There wasn't much choice for my non-fish eating friend but I really didn't care because the wine was going to my head by that point.. . Do you know how hard it is to concentrate at work after 3 glasses?. . Do you?. . HARD.
