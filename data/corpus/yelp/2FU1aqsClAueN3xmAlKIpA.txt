So fun!  Something very different to do on a Friday night.  Sunday late mornings they have magic for kids too!. . Didn't have dinner here and I've heard mixed reviews about the quality of the food.  Have to try it out for myself eventually.. . Good for a small group (we were 5) because anything larger might have trouble staying together for the close-up show.  . . There is a dress code- women need to wear a skirt, dress or pantsuit.  Men need to wear a jacket (not sure about the tie).  If you aren't wearing one, they have spares.  And no jeans for anyone.  As far as I know parking is valet only.. . Alcohol+Magic=AWESOME!
