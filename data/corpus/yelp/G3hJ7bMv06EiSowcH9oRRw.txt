Alright, so this is the new locale. Driving up last night, it's nice and new and glossy on the outside. Apparently since it's Friday the valets charge $5 to park, which I found really annoying and just found a spot on the street.. . I walk back the nice, new and glossy Fado and walk in to what feels pretty similar to the old location, just....cleaner. I take a few more steps in and I realize this place is expansive. It's massive and the seating, odd as it is, is plentiful. . . My friend and I find a booth, that I would have otherwise missed, and we're camped out there chatting it up. Of course, I'm there for the beer, food and people watching. By the way, they have these items called Boxty's (hope I'm remembering that spelling) which are essentially Irish burritos. I had the chicken and shrimp, pretty darn tasty, I might add.. . So we're done with dinner and we've had a few pints, so now it's time to take a tour of the upstairs. The second level is small, seems like more of a place to catch your breath, I guess. Now the third level is where it's at. It's completely open and you get a great view....of the the construction happening across the street. If you've ever been to the Warren in the Highlands, it feels like that. Oh yeah, Fado is smoke free. YAY!. . Our server was pretty good with a Friday night crowd, have to give her some props. Hey, it's Fado, you pretty much know what to expect with this place.
