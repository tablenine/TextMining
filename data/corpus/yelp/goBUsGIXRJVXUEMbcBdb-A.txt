I look forward to visiting the G-dale/Burbank area so that I can insist on having breakfast at Portos.  You can't miss with their assortment of delicious and creative pastries.  The lines are long, but they move.  I recommend the potato balls and meat pastries.  They serve good coffee as well.  This is a strong candidate for a five star upgrade.  I'll visit again and order more items.
