Mastro's is AMAZING-- Â I was taken here for my birthday last week and it was TO DIE FOR! . . First we had an amazing snow crab claw appetizer-- already shucked sticking out of a bed of ice, with dry ice beneath keeping it cool. These were sooooo good! Their cocktail sauce had just enough horseradish to give it a nice tang and they also provided a Dijon-- when mixed with the cocktail sauce with just a bit on the crab it's like fireworks in your mouth! . . The steaks... we both had the bone-in filet's (I had the petit, and my bf had the larger portion... he's a water-buffalo). Perfectly cooked-- melted right in your mouth! Best Bearnaise in the world-- very light, but very rich and flavorful at the same time (You have to specifically order a side... this is a MUST). . . The lobster mashed potatoes is nothing to snuff about either... real lobster CHUNKS... when I say chunks, I mean large chunks-- larger than a half-dollar-- no fake lobster shreddings, or tiny flakings. This was Amazing too! . . The Asparagus was great too-- had a lot of garlic (my breath was kickin after these guys). Dip them in the Bearnaise and it's pure heaven. . . So the only thing left are the cocktails, these are about $16-18 each, BUT the giant martini shaker seems to be bottomless because that $16 drink refilled my glass at least 2 and a half times! . . Great place for a birthday-- no cheesy waiters singing to you, just a nice intimate dinner with an amazing free dessert! . . AMAZING!!!!! You have to try this place!
