I came here for a quick dinner before a show and ordered from their DineLA menu.  Food was pretty good all around.  The drinks were a little overpriced.  My mojito was tiny and mostly consisted of ice and not enough rum.  Definitely wouldn't order that again. . . For dinner, I had:.  - Peruvian Ceviche: Nice and tangy with lots of different kinds of seafood..  - Chile Rubbed Mahi Mahi: The mahi mahi was cooked perfectly.  Flakey, buttery, and delicious.  It was placed on top of amazing saffron mashed potatoes..  - Barcelona Chocolate Cake: It was basically a brownie with some sauce.  Definitely my least favorite of the three dishes.. . Random fact: Did you know Ciudad has a shuttle service too?!  If you're planning on grabbing dinner here before a show, they offer a complimentary shuttle service to the nearby theaters.  We ended up taking it to the Orpheum, which isn't part of their normal route, but they were nice to accommodate us.  We walked out expecting a van and found a limo instead!  We apparently lucked out that night and the driver decided to bring his limo instead of a van!  It was so awesome arriving at the show in style!
