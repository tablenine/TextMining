Restaurant: Silver Cloud Bar &amp; Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
I've passed Silver Cloud a hundred times on my way to Northside, only acknowledging it because it's on the block where I can always find parking in Wicker Park (don't take my spot). I ventured in for the first time with a couple friends while looking for a late bite to eat.. . The menu had a bunch of comfort food -- pot pies, mac and cheese, spinach dip, etc. My vegetarian friend was happy that there were plenty of options noted for him. I had a hard time deciding between three salads that all sounded great, but went with the Cobb. . . Everyone really enjoyed their food --a veggie burger, a spicy chicken sandwich, and a Cobb salad. They have a bunch of eclectic beers on tap stuff you wouldn't find at other bars in the area, and two pages of specialty drinks. My (male) dining companions were less than impressed with their $9 frou-frou drinks, even though they were served in pint glasses. Me? I had a Rogue Dead Guy.. . I'm glad we tried this place out. I'm adding it to my list of possible restaurants to go to while in Wicker Park. I wouldn't sit here and drink, but I would definitely come back and try more food.
