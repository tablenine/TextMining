Good maki at very good prices on weekends before 6pm, as many have noted. Monday nights are martini special nights, and the samurai are my faves -- it's amazing how much one swills when a glass is only $5. I think all sushi is ridiculously expensive for the most part--yes, it takes great skill, I recognize this, but paying $18 for a single roll is just a bit obscene--but if you're ok with shelling out the money, this is a good neighborhood joint that will probably get the craving out of your system. If you're a sushi cheapie, then the weekend deals might make this your fave place. Try the sake flight -- I still sigh whenever I think of the poochi poochi. Or the Japanese vodka, which is excellent and ridiculously strong. The salt and pepper calamrai appetizer is very tasty, and the miso soup is also good. The servers have always been great and we've never had a problem getting seated (I've never made reservations for Tank).
