The experience on a weekend is similar to what other's have said - drive by, stomach initial shock at how long line is, park, get in line, look suspiciously around to make sure no one is "cutting you", final get a table, oh, it's at the bar.  Crane neck to see football game score.  Service tends to be slow but just because they're so busy - everyone there was super nice and rather apologetic considering it's that way every weekend.. . I had some sort of super chocolate pancakes - they were rather absurd.  No doubt they were good.   My only beef is the lack of variety - I want pancakes, I want eggs, I want bacon, I want jam, I don't want 3 absolutely gargantuan chocolate pancakes with no variety on my plate.  But for those that love their pancakes, in all varieties, you can't beat the experience here, they were pretty fantastic.  I personally will be in search of the shorter-wait-more-plate-variety breakfast spots.
