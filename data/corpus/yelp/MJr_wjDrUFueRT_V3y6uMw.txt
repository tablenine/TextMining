Restaurant: Comme Ca

First thing's first.  Sean, the bartender on Mondays and Wednesdays, is the greatest thing ever.  Were the experience only about him, the plae would easily have 5 stars.  He makes good drinks, takes pride in making sure they're well-made, and is sweet as hell to boot.. . That said, I don't know what all the hype is about.  Truly.  Their super high end restaurant, Sona, is very good, but not foodie good.  Not Patina good.  Or Cyrus good.  Or even AOC good.  But Comme Ca masquerades as a brasserie, with roast chicken for two specials, coq au vin, steak frites.  The roasted beef marrow and oxtail jam leaves much more to be desired, though the bread and butter that it comes with are fantastic.  The wine list is pretty good, albeit wildly overpriced.  In the marrow bones, the fat wasn't rendered enough, nor were the bones seasoned, so there wasn't really any flavor (a travesty when it comes to beef fat).  The oxtail "jam" was good in that it wasn't gelatinous, and I've known some oxtail to be before, but it also tasted something very close to Mexican birria, which I could've bought at half the price and gotten 6 times more food.. . Over all, I kind of got the vibe that people were there because it was supposed to be good, or because famous people went there.  It seemed a little bit like a star fucker scene.  The places was packed to the gills, when they could've gone across the street to Luques for some seriously good eats.  Comme Ca was disappointing in that it was overpriced (as a brasserie, it shouldn't be), and just kinda...meh.  Bummer.
