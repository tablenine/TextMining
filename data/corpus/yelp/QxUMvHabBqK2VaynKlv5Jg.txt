Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Terrible service - terrific pizza!. . We had a long layover in Chicago and had enough time to hop on a train, grab some deep dish pizza in downtown Chicago, and get back to the airport. We got to Lou Malnati's around 2:00 p.m. and the restaurant had only 3 other tables with customers. We were seated immediately because it was so empty.. . Our waiter took over 10 minutes to bring our menus and then another 10 minutes just to take our drink orders. After waiting over 5 minutes for him to bring me a drink, I began to look around for him. I found him in the kitchen talking to another waiter - all the while carelessly holding our drinks in his hands. . . We knew that deep dish pizza takes approximately 30 - 35 minutes to prepare so we counted on a long wait - but his inefficiency made our wait even longer. At one point while I was looking around for him -yes I had to get up to go look for him- he was standing in the kitchen eating cheese! Â We thought about leaving but then we knew we'd not get any pizza anywhere - we didn't have another 30 - 35 minutes to wait at another restaurant. We could either stay and get bad service or leave and get no pizza at all.. . We decided to stay and I must say that the pizza is fabulous! Gooey, hot, flavorful and very filling. Their deep dish pizza truly is the best and it's very affordable. It came to about ten dollars a person. . . My advice is to place an order for pick up or take a Malnati's frozen pie home and cook it there if you can. Don't eat there if you like nice service.
