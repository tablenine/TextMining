Wow, harsh reviews.. . I actually really like Bar Celona.  I used to hit this place up last spring/summer while working on the left coast.  . . They introduced me to the watermelon/feta cheese/honey combo.  People, have you tried it??  Amazing.  Life-altering.  So freaking good.  . . Not a bad atmosphere, either.. . Definitely a solid 4 stars.
