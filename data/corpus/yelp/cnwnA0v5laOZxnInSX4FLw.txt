Pretty amazing once you walk in. Almost as much staff here as diners/patrons/bar sippers. The patisserie is delightful, very good macarons. The mojito is probably the best I've had, although it is $10. Have not yet sat down for dinner, but did try the grilled artichoke and was a little disappointed with it. Will update once I have dinner though.
