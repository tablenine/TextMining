This place was okay, but I wasn't that impressed.  The sushi was no more inventive than a bunch of other places I have been to in the city.  The fish was really fresh and high quality.  I just wish they had put it together in a little more interesting way.  . . I am willing to accept that my lower opinion may also be a result of a poor first impression: we had a reservation and still had to wait over 30 minutes to be seated.
