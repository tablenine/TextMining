Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
After getting the Cemitas Milanesa for pretty much every visit in the past year, I decided to mix it up and opt for the Chicken (shredded).  Good, but not nearly as good as the breaded butterfly pork chop (Milanesa).  The rest of the Cemita's ingredients are exactly the same, which is to say, incredible.  . . Also chose the Tacos Arabes which is a spit roasted pork and onion  wrapped taco served with a  chipotle salsa...good, not great.  The Cemitas and simple Chalupas are where this place just completely dominates and therefore i'm sticking to my 5-star rating.. . Get. In.
