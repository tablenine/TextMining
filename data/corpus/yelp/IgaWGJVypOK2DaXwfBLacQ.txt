Like most other people, I'd heard a lot about this place before coming here. I was excited because of all the hype, so I went on the website and was even more excited when I saw the menu and all the "themed" rooms they had.. . My friend &amp; I made reservations for a weekend, and when we went we still got pretty crappy seats. The tables were so close together where we were sitting that I had to adjust myself so I wasn't overly close to my table.. . The food was mediocre. It was kind of an up then down for me. We started off with a medium order of their "sizzling iron skillet roasted" mussels, and it was soooo good I wished we had ordered a large instead. Then the entrees came, and that's when things went downhill. I had a half rack of baby back ribs, and my friend ordered a Silence of the Lamb Shank. The ribs were way too dry, and that specific garlic taste didn't go with them very well. My friend, who's usually a fan of lamb, barely finished 1/3 of his dish. Needless to say we brought the leftovers home, but never actually touched it once it got there. It ended up in the trash sometime that week.. . It's a cute restaurant with a good decor, but I didn't think the food was worth all the hype.. Some places you go and pay a high price for the view or the place itself, some you go and pay a high price for amazing food. I wish I could say this had both, but to me, the crowd and uncomfortable seating arrangements definitely took away from the otherwise interesting decorations, and the food didn't live up to my expectations at all.
