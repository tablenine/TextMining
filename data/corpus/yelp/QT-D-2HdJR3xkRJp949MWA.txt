Seems like every review of Daikokuya starts off warning about the wait...and this is no different. There were two of us, so the wait was ONLY 30 minutes. Outside. In the rain. And the cold. . . They seated us at the end of the bar. This might've been the highlight of the meal, since we got to watch the two chefs work their butts off deep frying, grilling, noodling, and the rest. We both got the ramen; I got the kotteri though, because when have I ever passed up an opportunity at back fat (answer: never). Also split an order of the tsukemono (assorted pickles).. . The pickles were great to look at, but not really that interesting. There were purple and green ones, made from unidentifiable vegetables, that were sweet and sour, but nothing stellar. There were also bright yellow pickled radish, that had a bit of an off flavor, and we couldn't finish them.. . The ramen came in big steamy bowls, which was great for the cold day. Maybe they didn't hear my order the kotteri (or my gringo tastebuds aren't refined), but we couldn't taste the difference between the two broths. The bowl comes filled with noodles, bean sprouts, a huge pile of green onions, some sliced pork, and an egg. The egg was easily the highlight--sitting in the broth it soaks up a lot of the flavor, plus an opaque, just-barely-solid yolk. . . In the end, this wasn't really anything to write home about. If this soup had knocked me off my feet, maybe I'd feel differently about the 30 minute wait, but as it now, just a big steaming bowl of whatever.
