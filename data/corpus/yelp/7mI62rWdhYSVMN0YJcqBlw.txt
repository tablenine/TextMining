Damn, I love this place.  Despite the long wait, the overall experience is enjoyable.  I'm not sure if this is "authentic" Thai food, but it is quite good.  Start your meal off with some spicy shrimp soup (they give you options as to how spicy you want it; spicy = flaming hot it hurts and drinking water won't help spicy) and get any of your favorite curry dishes while listening to Thai Elvis.  It's a great place to bring your folks or friends to if you're in the Hollywood area.  And, your wallet won't be hurting - it's something like 7 bucks a plate.
