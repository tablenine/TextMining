Restaurant: Heaven On Seven
Category: Southern
I've eaten here many times.  I prefer to go to AMC 21 on Illinois St because comfortable seating but occasionally I do come here depends on what movies are playing.  This place advertises as Cajun Style restaurant but after having to visit many similar Cajun places.. Heaven on Seven is mediocre compare to other places. I usually order cup of jambalaya, comes with small portion of rice, and corn bread. It's all right, somewhat spicy.   Don't get me wrong, I mean I had some spicy jambalaya and gumbo that makes your eyes water up, running nose, drinking milk to cool down.  I don't know I would eat here regularly. Just see it as convenient location to eat before going to the movies and kind of touristy restaurant.   They have escalators that keeps going up and up, makes me feel like I'm going to heaven. I guess that's how this place got the name?
