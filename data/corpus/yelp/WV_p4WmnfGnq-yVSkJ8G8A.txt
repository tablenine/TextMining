I already can't wait to go back to try some other things! What a fun lunch this was with my good friend who was also super excited to try this place. We are both fans of Urban Belly so were anxious to give the Shack a shot as well. Â Saturday afternoon, 1:30pm- no lines, no waiting. We both ordered the Korean BBq Gogi. It came with small pita pockets to make little sandwiches and stuff it with the kimchi and beef. Great flavors. The "ssam paste" is a delicious combo of soybean paste with hot pepper paste. YUM. We split an order of tostones- fried plantains, ok, twist my arm. I think she had one and I had the other ten. I loved the sweet salty combo. It went perfectly with the chilled Verdicchio we were drinking (BYOB). We are also both fans of day drinking. (Don't judge!) The other side we split was an order of brussel sprouts with chorizo. What an interesting combo! I like both sprouts and chorizo, so why not?! It was just a tad bit greasy, but delicious nonetheless. And of course I also had to try their hot and sour soup. I would come back just for this on a cold winter day. Heavenly. I believe I was licking my bowl at the end. I would have done that with or without the vino- it was just that good!. Lastly, we decided to try a dessert. They are all toppings for soft serve ice cream, FYI. The Vietnamese Cinnamon Caramel rocked my world. It was warm but then got hard on top of the ice cream so it was like big spoonfuls of ooey gooey caramel. . So many other things I need to try. I will totally be revisiting Belly Shack again sooner rather than later!
