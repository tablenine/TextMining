l went to this place for my friends birthday and the view was amazing, a little hard to find, but loved the view! as for the restaurant itself...not so good. I think their was probably a nicer section where you sit in the middle of the restaurant that overlooks a garden, but we sat in the crappy section by the kitchen doorway haha. Ive heard it's good to go here on dates and I can see why. The food wasn't that great and was wayy overpriced. Also my friend was charged incorrectly called later to figure out what happen and she said it happens all the time and the banks end up changing it to the right amount after it clears. I find that very strange. Anyway I would love to just drive up there again, but just to walk around the hill and that's it.
