Stumbled upon this place when the sizzle crew made a 24 hour stop in LA.  Decent prices, decent food but the service was a bit slow.. . Sitting outside is great during the day, but don't expect the heaters to keep you warm.  . . A great location for lunch when shopping on Melrose.. . 3.5 stars overall.
