Category: Mexican
I love mexican food. But this was awful. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce and it was just horrible. The chips and salsa were okay, not very flavorful. In addition to yucky food, our waitress took ages to get to us, kept forgetting to refill water glasses, and dragged with the bill. It was not even remotely busy either.. . I won't be going back when there are so many other better mexican restaurants.
