I absolutely love this place! You need to get yourself there right away! I didn't have anything with fancy aging, just a regular filet but it was so delish! I started with the baby arugula salad and they also brought us this delcious mini calamari creation and an asiago cheese popover which was quite tasty. Our sides, chorizo whipped, garlic spinach, and tempura green beans, were also fantastic. They have an excellent wine selection as well, the lady who brought our wine claimed it is the best wine from napa valley, period. And it should be it was $325. Obviously I had no part in picking out or paying for this wine. I did however have several glasses. :). . Service was great, atmosphere good, overall definitely felt it was a 5 star experience. Now that I am all out of positive adjectives to describe this place...Can't wait to go for lunch and cash in on the 50% off special!
