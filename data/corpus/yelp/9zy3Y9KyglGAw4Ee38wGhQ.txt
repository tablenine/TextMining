Completely decadent! This is a great special occasion type restaurant. The food is inventive and fun. I couldn't get enough to the caviar staircase. Aside from being a great presentation, the caviar was just darn good. We had the Chef Tramonto's Market Collection which was amazing. I especially loved the soup served in the Limoge teacups. The dessert is obviously amazing since Gale Gand is a pastry genius. If money is no object, pair chilled vodka with the caviar and change up your wine with each course. There is a dessert tasting whoch I would love to try!
