Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
they say its all about the toppings.  well, let me tell you.  i waited in line for over an hour and its not all about the toppings.  you must be a good old fashioned beef hot dog lover to achieve the full pink's experience.. . but still.... you can eat like a king off pocket change. . the fries are divine.. and once you're in la, waiting in line for an hour on foot is no different than sitting in traffic in your ride.
