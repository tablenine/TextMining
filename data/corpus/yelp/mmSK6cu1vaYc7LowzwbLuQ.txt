its pretty good- the burger meat is juicy and fresh and pretty tasty but the prices are ridiculous for what you get (in my mind). there are plenty of other good 'higher end' burger places to check out. however, the cucumber margaritas are DELISH and perfect for that lunch break away from the office when youre having one of those days that call for a day time cocktail.
