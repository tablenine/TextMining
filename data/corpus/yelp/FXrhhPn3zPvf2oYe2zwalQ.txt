Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
ATMOSPHERE.... . ...I loved the atmosphere of Bottega Louie with it's wide open space and high ceilings has a very pseudo French opulence that is somewhat cheesy but definitely fun.  It's kinda like an open cafe in an upscale train station is how I would describe it.  . . We went for breakfast and ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, the French Toast and their Breakfast Flatbread (which was like a breakfast pizza with mozzarella, prosciutto and a broken egg on top).  . . Everything was delicious and reasonably priced.  We were in a bit of a hurry so we ordered at the counter and sat in the bar area, rather than opting for a table in the dining room.  The service was still very quick.. . We also left with a variety of breakfast pastries which we devoured later.  We will definitely be back to try lunch.
