Always great simple comfort food, good service, and I'm always surprised that I get a seat within five minutes of showing up. Never too noisy, even with the TV and bar. Great place for a date or small group. I'm not an onion ring eater, but I cannot deny the onion ring tower here. The sauces are great, the salads are simple and great. They don't do anything too complex here, but what they do- they do well.
