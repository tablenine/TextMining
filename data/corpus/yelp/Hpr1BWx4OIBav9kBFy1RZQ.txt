I came to dance to some much-missed salsa &amp; meregue &amp; I got it :) Moving from Miami to the mid-west can affect a Cuban girl! I can't say I would order the signature Corazon cocktail however; too many flavors going on in one glass to handle. The salt &amp; PEPPER rimmed glass caught me off guard! . Overall a nice place to go dance w.o a hassle at the door. Hope to return for some of that menu!
