Oh man.....I'm trying really hard not to be that mean....but you know what? F it...... . This place should be ashamed of themselves for ripping people off by serving their crappy sushi and crappy everything else. The place is nice but the food is horrendous. I'm not being a hater but you know this place gotta stop serving sushi when I have to spit out my toro for being so chewy. And their yakitori is so dry, I thought i was eating beef jerky. I can go on and on but I got other things to do. This place sucks. Â For everyone else who likes this place, go try other places, you deserve better.
