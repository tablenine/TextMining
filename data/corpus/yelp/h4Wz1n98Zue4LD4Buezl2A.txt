Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
In honor of sandwich week '09, a Cuban sandwich is a MUST and outside of Ybor city and Miami, it doesn't get much better for me than Papi's Cuban sandwich. The roasted pork is tender, the ham is tantalizing, and the bread is soft but supportive of it's hard working inner flavors. I felt a slight sting of guilt after I finished the entire sandwich but quickly chased it away with a helping of sweet plantains, which are always perfectly prepared, warm, and just the right texture. . . It gets a little loud when they're busy and you have to yell at the wait staff or your fellow lunch mates but if this bothers you, then you should eat alone and just point at things you want on the menu. . . Price is right, portions are plentiful, Papi's is pleasing.
