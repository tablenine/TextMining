Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
A very historic place that is a vestige of a bygone era.  The burgers are all the rage, and they are good.  They put on a kinda sweet hickory sauce.  Sitting at the counter is fun, with the service being a kind of hyper active dance where they pour your ketchup for your fries before you even know you need it.  But be prepared to wait for a seat unless you get there right when it opens.  You can order to go but make sure to call first so it's waiting when you arrive.  Parking can be a problem...don't forget to feed the meter.. . The hidden culinary delight of this decades old burger joint that refused to sell to developers is the tuna salad.  I think it's the best in the City.  It's  a very wet concoction with inches of fresh lettuce on rye bread.  Damn, damn good.. . Lastly, this place is also obviously known for its pie.  Hence it's name.  For Thanksgiving people order in advance for their pumpkin.  It's all good.  . . In short, you cannot call yourself a true Angeleno  unless you've been to the Apple Pan.  When I lived on the Westside some of my favorite afternoons involved golf at Rancho Park (another historic landmark) and then a feast at the Pan.  Enjoy!
