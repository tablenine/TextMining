Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
I wonder if putting up 2 stars might be too generous.  Maybe it's 2 stars for Penny's effort of trying to pass their food off as Asian... Or is it a 3 star penalty?. . I really tried to like the food here, but the noodles are pretty much blah and seems much closer to packaged ramen than stuff served up at typical noodle shops.  That's not the only thing though; there's the overpriced items on the menu such as a few strands of boiled watercress served with a dash of soy (where's the creativity?).  The nail in the coffin would be their "Asian raviolis."  I was actually stupid enough to let my curiosity get the better of me and ordered it.  Turned out to be boiled pot stickers - the EXACT same frozen stuff you get from places like CostCo.. . You can fool them Penny, but you can't fool me.  There's absolutely nothing Asian about you.
