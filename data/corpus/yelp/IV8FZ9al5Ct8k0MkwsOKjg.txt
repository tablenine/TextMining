I've dined here twice - once in the main dining room, once in the bar room. Both times a great experience. Main dining room is a more expensive and more artistic dishes that really pack a wallop of flavor. Bar room also offers exceptional flavors, everything is served in a large-appetizer/small-entre size that is intended for sharing. The basil gnocchi is quite possibly the best thing I've ever eaten - truly outstanding. The service in the bar room was also superb - the waiter always could sense when we needed something and was right there to help. Service in the dining room is overdone is my opinion. Too many people, too much of a production.
