The "New,HIP" spot H&amp;F def has buckhead buzzzzzzzzing! Some friends and I went to H&amp;F on a Friday night and the wait was two hours, so we walked over the Restaurant Eugene's for a cocktail (please see review for my ranting on the MOST amazing White Chocolate Martini I have ever had). Now back to H&amp;F, the food was really good, we ordered almost everything off of the menu. The pimento cheese dip was REALLY good. The roasted garlic dip was fantastic (just don't eat it on a first date). I wasn't too impressed with the Southern Cola, so I opted out for a glass of Merlot. The wait staff was so nice, our waiter accommodated our every need. This restaurant will be buzzzzzzing for a long time to come!
