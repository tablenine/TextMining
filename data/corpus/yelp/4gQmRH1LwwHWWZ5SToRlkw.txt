I'm ashamed to say that I have lived in LA for most of my life and have never been to Philippes until I saw it here on YELP. Went there with my hubby and he ordered the Beef with Blue Cheese (LOVED IT) and I had the Lamb double dipped....yummm! Well, it was sooo good that we brought the kids back the very next day. We ordered the same thing and our kids shared a Beef Sandwich and each had a bowl of soup. My teenage daughter swears it to be one of the best clam chowder she has ever tried! Need to make sure we go there on a Friday so I can try the clam chowder for myself :-)
