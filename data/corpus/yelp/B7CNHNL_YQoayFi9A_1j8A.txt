I originally wanted to come here based on Tom and the hype of the show...and then I tasted the food, enjoyed the service, and all-around fell in love. I can't remember the last time I had such a fantastic time at dinner...probably because I adore the folks I went with and the staff got a kick out of us. . . I asked our server (darny, I forget her name, but she was a gem) to make up a flight of wine, which wasn't on the wine by the glass menu and she hooked me up exactly to my taste, though she wasn't the sommelier. The amose was at our table within seconds, the carpaccio melted in your mouth, the cross between the striper fish was killer good, and get the soufle for dessert. Overall the most culinary fun I've had in a long while.
