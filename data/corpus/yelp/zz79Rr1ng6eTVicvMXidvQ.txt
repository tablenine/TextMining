Hit or Miss, but they have good beer. I have been here a million times and everytime I leave wondering why I go. The food is average and sometimes it sucks, the service is good and sometimes it's slow and annoying. What kills me is $5 burger night.. really? $5?? That's a lot! I mean, if you're going to have a special make it a real special.. how does $1 burger night sound?. . The two things that drag this place from two stars to three stars is the brunch till 3pm, its really good.. I can't even name one thing cause they are all good, and the beer. They always have a good selection of beers.. . Too bad the rest of the place is bush league.
