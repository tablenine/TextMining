Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
The scene: noon at Stella's. On a holiday Monday with every reason to be waitlisted, we were seated immediately at a table with a view of bustling Broadway. Before our server greeted us, the busser/server assistant came over, dropped off waters and asked if we wanted coffee. Yes and yes, thanks!. . Our server was on it. My cousin ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer which consists of two small sliced, crusty loaves literally drenched in garlic oil, herbs, AND butter. Fragrant and just plain good. Next I had a wrap starring chicken, pepper jack, and avocado... quite simple, really, but probably the best wrap I've ever had. And from a diner, no less! Large enough to take half home for dinner. I also inherited an untouched quarter of my cousin's colossal turkey club for dinner. What, we're family, right? And for you non-morning Yelpers, Stella's serves breakfast all day as any authentic diner should.. . No wait, on-the-ball service, clean and shiny, and with enough on the menu to make even prissy Patty a happy camper... Stella's a girl you could introduce to your mom.
