Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
there's three things i'd like to do at the cheesecake factory. . the first is mild hallucinogens to enjoy the cheesecake frosting/mushroom decor. . the second is absinthe to create some excitement from the masses of bridge and tunnel traffic in a city with few of either. . the third is eat. they do a good job of compensating with quantity
