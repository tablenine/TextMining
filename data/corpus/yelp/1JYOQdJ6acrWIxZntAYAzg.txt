I give this place 4 stars overall for it's plentiful, tasty food and great atmosphere.  I had a lot of fun dinning there.  Admittedly, I had a few in me when we arrived, and that might have influenced my opinion of the food.  I thought the salmon and shrimp were great--juicy, buttery, and mixed well with the mini-garden of veggies served on the side.  Probably not the best Mex. seafood in town, but tasty enough--and if you're with a fun crowd, you'll have a ball.
