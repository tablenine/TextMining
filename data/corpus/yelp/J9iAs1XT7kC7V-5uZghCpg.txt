Restaurant: Toast Bakery Cafe

I always see such long lines outside this place when I pass by on weekends for brunch. I've also heard that a couple of movies/tv shows were filmed here before. So giving in to hollywood's social conformism, I decided to give the place a try. And with a restaurant named toast, I decided it would be best to have their brunch. Now I was prepared for a little wait, but 30 minutes to wait in line for brunch? And the server was kinda pushy. Wasn't sure if it was the fact that we didn't order too much or that she'd rather get through with us and get another table in. Whatever it was, I really hate being rushed through my meal. I'm here to enjoy lunch, not to make sure she earns enough tips for the day. The food was ok, I guess. My salad was pretty good but my bf's sandwich was a bit dry. . . And there it is, another overly hyped restaurant.
