I HEART this place... but I HATE the wait. I have tried going everyday of the week to see if it made a difference in the wait, average wait time is about an hour and on sat or sun try an hour and 45 mins. Pretty ridiculous right? The place is kind of small, but the atmosphere is fun and the food is delicious! There are tv's with the major games on. Also, I like how when you pay, they ask for your identification as well. The servers are nice. The food comes out fast. The shrimp is the best! Just be prepared to smell like garlic for a day. (the whole shabang is the business!) Also, try bringing the bag of sauce home and pour it over some salmon and bake it, with a side of rice...OooOHhweeee... YUMMY! . . *The only reason I gave it 4 stars was b/c of the wait time.
