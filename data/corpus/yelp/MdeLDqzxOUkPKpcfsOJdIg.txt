Category: Steakhouses
I remember the first time I came here...It was back in 2006..My oh my. Simply delicious. Simply orgasmic. Simply...quite possibly the best prime rib I've had ever. I just got out of prison 4/29/09..I'll be done with my halfway house 10/23/09..I already got my reservations at 7:15pm that day..CANT WAIT!!! =)
