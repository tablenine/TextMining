Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Phillippe's has been around for 100 years, so you know they're doing something right.  It's the classic definition of an LA institution and famous for its French dipped sandwiches.. . The restaurant has a lunch counter atmosphere with sawdust on the floors and long plank tables to eat at.  It attracts everyone around LA from blue collar workers to lawyers to cops.  There's always a line around lunch time but it moves pretty quickly.  It's right across from Union Station, so if you work downtown, it's only 1 or 2 short metro stops away.. . They have beef, pork, lamb, turkey, or ham sandwiches, and a variety of sides and deserts.  The beef stew is great, and so is the potato salad.  They have fantastic slices of pie for desert, I always get the blueberry pie.  A notable item on the menu is their cup of coffee because it's the original 1908 price of only 9 cents.  (How do you beat that?)  They have a pretty spicy horseradish sauce on all the plank tables for the French dipped sandwiches, it's great but be careful not to overdo it!. . Phillipe's is a one of the greatest lunch establishments in LA.  I once visited three days in a row.  It's filling food at a good price with a vintage atmosphere.
