In rating their soon du bu on it's own, this place would probably get 2.5 stars.  Just not that great-- a bit too watery, and just lacking in flavor overall. . . However, it's kalbi is pretty good, so that definitely brings this place up... and the panchan is solid.  They bring out a variety of "appetizers" including kimchi, chap chae, fish, and some potato salad.  Not too shabby.. . I don't see myself coming back here cause I'll try other places first, but its not bad, but not great either.
