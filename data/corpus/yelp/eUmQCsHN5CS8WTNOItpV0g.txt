Restaurant: Rock Bottom Restaurant &amp; Brewery
Category: Restaurants
Rock Bottom...more like Rock Top! Alright...bad pun, but seriously, when you walk in to Rock Bottom Restaurant &amp; Brewery, walk straight to the top floor. It is on this floor where you will find a beer garden in the middle of River North.  Obviously, it is in River North and surrounded by other buildings, but nonetheless...still cool.. . Friendly rooftop advice #1: wander into Rock Bottom when it's warm or dress appropriately (may not be open in bad/cold weather anyways). Advice #2: get there early or prepare to wait (think 1 in, 1 out). Advice #3: Even though it is a rooftop, they still abide by Chicago laws and close the beer garden rooftop down at midnight on weekends (11 PM on weekdays - Boo!).  Everybody downstairs!!!. . Other than a rooftop beer garden, the other qualities of Rock Bottom would be comparable to a classier TGI Friday's as Rock Bottom is actually also a national chain.  The biggest difference would be Rock Bottom brews its own beer. These home brews are a definite recommend for beer lovers...and for the people who just like beer, but do not have that passion. Also, pool sharks should take note of the billiard tables in the back room of the first floor. Rock Bottom (Top) Restaurant &amp; Brewery - even if you do not like heights, you should still give it a shot!
