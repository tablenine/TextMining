i was a little worried reading some of the negative reviews here, but i loved it here. it didn't smell at all. i went on thanksgiving night, and they have a turkey dinner for $29 which my mom had. everyone's dishes were good except mine, the babyback ribs.. not bad, but nothing special. the staff were excellent and attentive. maybe it was quiet and that's why service was good that day. mash potatoes were delicious. i love garlic so all the better for me. i had the bagna calda which we shared and ate with the bread which was also good. but after about 10 of the garlics it got spicy and my tongue was burning.. got sick of garlic halfway into my meal.
