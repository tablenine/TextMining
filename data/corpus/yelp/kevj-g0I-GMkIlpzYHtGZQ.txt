I really, really hate to do this, but it must be said. The food at Bocado is quite good, but the service was deplorable to the point of making me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. . . Yes, I was a party of one, but that doesn't make me a leper. I entered through one door, made my way to the host stand, got the shaft for a few minutes until a guy came and asked if I needed help. I was ushered over to a crappy table along the wall with the fire alarm right in my face. Charming. They don't have wifi, which was a bummer, but no matter. The waiter arrived, took my order without offering recommendations or assistance, and then brought out my sandwich about 10 minutes later. The whole exchange was painfully cut and dry.. . My sandwich (chicken with fennel and other goodies) was quite lovely with fresh crunchy bread and flavorful toppings. I hate sandwich spots like this that make you order sides a la carte, as the servings are typically much too large for one person. The same is true here, so if I ever come back solo I'll just go with a sandwich without anything in addition, which is kind of a bummer. . . I paid my check and left without so much of a thank you from any of the staff and made my way across the street to Octane where I was greeted with open arms and friendly smiles.
