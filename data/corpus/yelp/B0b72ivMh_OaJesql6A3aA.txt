Category: Sandwiches
I pain's me to update a place that has let me down so severely in the past but after it was suggested by a specific friend I though i'll give it a go. What do you know they receive an extra star. (and a half if Yelp would allow it). . Dined In (as you may note all of my bad experiences were with take out) and was mildly surprised. Not going to get all mushy and gushy like some fans are but the overall experience was better than I have had in the past. Sandwich, delicious... sides... eh Cold Mac and Cheese and Fries. Really... Only the Kitchen to the table how can that be hard? For the cost per Sandwich I would expect warm side warm. . . Side Note - My companion enjoyed a delicious looking Vegetarian Sandwich and some cold sides, she seemed quite pleased with the experience. . . Just don't understand how I always seem to come out short on one of the most favourably reviewed places on Yelp.
