Small, low-key restaurant serves up a focused menu of tofu bowls, barbecued short ribs, and a few noodle specialties.  Banchan usually includes a lettuce salad, japchae, and a small fried whole fish which I don't see much around here, along with other items that change more often.  Simple but very good banchan, better than most other establishments.  . . Tofu bowls are very flavorful but contains not much meat/seafood.  Not too spicy, which I like.  Dumplings are delicious though you cannot order it as a standalone dish.  Combo is a great way to try both the barbecue and the tofu bowl together.  The short ribs come in smaller quantity than I like but are tender, slightly charred, and savory.  Over the winter a pollack roe tofu bowl was offered, but this turns out to be a bit bland.  . . The noodles are decent, but not exceptional.  I did not see any bibimbop on the menu.  . . Really good prices for a satisfying meal of varied flavors.  Great for a casual solo dinner.  This is a good example of a restaurant focusing on a few items and making them really well.
