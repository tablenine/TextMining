Restaurant: Ben Pao
Category: Chinese
I admit it--we were charmed, nearly to the point of blushing.  Allison B. and I had both had kind of rough days but I also had reason to celebrate.  So we headed up State Street from the loop and eventually came upon Ben Pao. . . We had originally wanted to eat outside on the patio, but upon entering the restaurant, we both knew we would enjoy the detailed ambiance indoors more.  The lightening, especially, was per-fect.  . . After walking over the (almost cheesy) little bridge, we were seated at a lovely bench table for two.  Our waiter recommended drinks from the creative menu--I enjoyed the Sake Sangria.. . All was delicious, including the free mini egg rolls served to us by a manager in honor of our first-time visit.. . It's not too often that a guy and a gal living on teacher's salaries can expect such classy treatment.  I would stick this on my list of places to take out-of-towners when "near downtown" is a requirement.
