Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
This place is always so crowded!. . They have cheap ($3) ramens, but of course the portion is really small. Once I saw the size of the actual bowl, I felt like I've been ripped off. They have so many limitations though. There weren't that many choices in general either.. . The taste wasn't bad but I felt like it was not worth the time waiting/the price I paid for.
