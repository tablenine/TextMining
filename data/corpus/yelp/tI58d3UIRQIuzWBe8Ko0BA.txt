Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I think this place is a bit dated.  The prime rib is great if that's what you're looking for, but I'm not that impressed.  Seemed a bit expensive for what it was.  The best part about this restaurant though is Mrs. Fethersten, our Scottish waitress.  She's worked there since 1966 and I want her to be my grandmother.
