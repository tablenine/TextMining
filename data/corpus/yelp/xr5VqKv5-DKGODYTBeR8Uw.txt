Lovely little restaurant in the same space where (the now defunct) Scylla once resided. Valet parking, very friendly hostess, knowledgeable waitstaff, and very good food.. . We sat upstairs, where it was a bit chilly, but there was quite a nice vibe.. . Started out w/ kampachi sashimi...very good and flavorful. Don't be freaked out my the notion that there are small slices of monkfish liver. It's really a delicious dish...complex...fresh. . . Also enjoyed the peeky toe crab and trio of tofu with a variety of interesting toppings: seaweed, marinated mushrooms, eggplant and okra. Yum.. . For main courses we had the duck fat fried chicken--totally addictive--and the NY strip steak w/wasabi, miso-glazzed fingerling potatoes and salsify. Very satisfying meal.. . We had a nice bottle of wine...but I had no room for dessert here so I cannot speak to that. Word...if you are dining with another and you want dessert, get two small plates and not three. I found it weird that our waitress told us they recommend three small plates &amp; two entrees when the waiter next to us said two small plates &amp; two entrees. This inconsistency and the fact that it was somewhat cold upstairs were the reasons I gave it 4 and not 5 stars.. . With three small plates, two entrees and one bottle of $50 wine, our tab came out to over $200 for two people (including tip). Definitely worth the spend for a lovely evening. I'm sure as they move forward this will be a solid 5 star experience.
