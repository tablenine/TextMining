Not to keep ripping on this place, but too bad.  Whenever I write a bad review (seldom), I like to be sure of my facts, and make sure I say reasonable and smart things.  I read a lot of reviews of this place that say "New York Style".... which is ridiculous.  Anyone who thinks this is "New York Style" has never been to New York.  New York has some of the best restaurants in the world and while my experience has been better with smaller boutique places, I'm sure there are NY places similar in decour to BL, but even those places would hire a sommelier to taste and pick the wine.  BL clearly does not employ a sommelier, and even worse has an uneducated, arrogant staff that thinks dressing like a waiter, actually gives you the right to comment on wine.  If there is a sommelier at BL, we should find out who he is and start gunning for his job, because  he's an idiot.. . If there are a few places similar to BL in NY I guess it would be in SOHO, but again, SOHO prides itself on great food, service, wine, etc.  BL is very loud, way larger than most places in NY and would not last 2 weeks in SOHO.  Professional reviewers would have a field day with this place.  SOHO knows good restaurants and bad ones like BL wouldn;t be able to compete.
