What?!?  Peanut butter wings?!  What?!?!?  Shots that I can pay for with the change in my ass pocket?!?  When we went in the middle of December it was too crowded to fit inside.  We bore the cold for about an hour in the back patio area, but we wimped out and came back inside.  The only reason we left early is because of the ridiculous crowd that obviously had more ass pocket change than we did.  Will definitely be back this summer armed with my piggy bank!
