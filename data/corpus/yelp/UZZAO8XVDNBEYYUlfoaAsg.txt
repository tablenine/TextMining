Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
My mouth is watering as I think about Papi's. In that last year, I've become a regular. Once or twice a week. I've never had a bad meal there. I have had some fantastic meals there. You will too. So, get off your rear and make a visit.. . Every day they have a different special. Now, if you're like me, when you read the menu, you will think, "What can be special about beef and beans?" Hold your judgment until your plate arrives. After your first bite, you will be hooked.. . Of course, you will now have to go back each day of the week to try all of their specials. You will enjoy them all, but you will have favorites. Tuesday's beef special is my favorite.. . Another favorite is the jerk chicken special on Saturday.. . Theyve got garlic and are not afraid to use it. So, this may not be a good choice for a date.. . You won't leave hungry. Their portions are plentiful.. . What are you waiting for?
