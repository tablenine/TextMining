I've been going to the spoke for many years... way before the remodeling and improvements. The food is good. I like their tuna sandwich. Sitting upstairs on a sunny day is the best. Great bloody mary's and Stella on tap make me happy. The waitstaff is okay... the bartender's rule. I have spent many hung over Sunday's ponied up to the bar. By the time I leave... my hang over is gone... replaced by a nice buzz and a smile.
