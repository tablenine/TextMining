Eh, I'd rather stick to the Cheesecake Factory. The Grand Lux has a crazy multiple personality disorder... they serve sushi and pasta and burgers. I'm almost too scared to try their version of sashimi. . . I ordered the pasta with chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and mushrooms. The first two bites were tasty but after a few more bites I quickly got bored of it. Nothing special. The boyfriend ordered some kind of burger and the meat was dry and overdone. The dishes will definitely fill you up assuming you have the motivation to finish your food. . . They serve Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes but the selection is much smaller. They also make a conscious effort to emphasize the difference between Grand Lux and the Cheesecake Factory. I suppose it looks upscale but the food doesn't cut it. The chairs are awesome though! I have to give them that. My chair was spacious, nicely cushioned and coated with a red velvety texture.. I felt like a queen. But I still think this place sucks.
