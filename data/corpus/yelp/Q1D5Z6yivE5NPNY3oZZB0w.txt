Good Seafood...in fact, best seafood around the area.  Place is always busy and there's always new fish on the chalkboard.  I enjoy coming during the week, which allows me to relax and enjoy the food with my wife.  Food is fantastic and the presentation is always top notch.. . My only complaint is that it gets so busy sometimes, you have to scramble to find food at a nearby restaurant.  . . It's BYOB, but they do carry alcohol now.
