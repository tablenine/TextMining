Restaurant: A Taste of Heaven
Category: Bakeries
Taste of Heaven came recommended by friends who live in the area of Andersonville, Uptown/Edgewater.  We all stopped in for a lunch on a weekend.  The prices were a little higher than I imagined for such a small luncheon looking place.  I tried the tomato soup.  It was on the cold side and an average portion for the large price tag it came with.  The chef was either getting creative or spilled the whole bottle of dill because my soup tasted like pickles it had such a strong dill flavor.  Spices are accents not the entree itself.  YUCK.  I won't be back even if they were giving the food away.
