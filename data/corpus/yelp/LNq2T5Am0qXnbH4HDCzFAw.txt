When I arrived at Porto's, I flashed back to simpler times.  Instantaneously, I was seven again.  It was like I was at Toys R Us for my birthday and my dad was telling me to "pick any game you want."  . . I went to the counter and I'd focus on one item.  Cakes.  My eyes, like a moth, would focus and refocus on other colors in my peripheral vision.  CREME BRULEE! Sandwiches.  Tarts.  Croissants.  Cupcakes.  Creme brulee.  Lattes. Chocolate Mousse.  Potato Balls.   Creme brulee.  I took a second to recollect myself and I finally went into line to figure out what I wanted to order.  Here's what I decided on:. . 1.  Potato Balls.  5 stars.  So simple, but so flavorful!  It's a fried ball of mashed potatoes filled with seasoned ground beef and green peppers.  The beef was seasoned similarly to what you'd find in a really good taco filling. The dish looks and sounds odd, but it was very tasty....definitely eat it while its still hot!      . . 2.  Meat Pie.  4 stars.  For this item, they take their seasoned ground beef and they put it in a flaky crust.  I liked it.  . . 3.  Ham and Cheese Croissant.   5 stars.  Ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo in a freshly baked croissant.  Served with a side of plaintain chips.  I really believe that you have to have great bread to have a great sandwich.  The croissant was flaky and all the ingredients were fresh.  I definitely recommend this..   . 4.  Triple Chocolate Mousse.  3.5 stars.  Top layer was a thick dark chocolate fondant.  Below were layers of other milk and white chocolate mousse.  On the bottom was a cookie crust.  It's a solid dessert.  Just a tad too rich for me.. . 5.  Creme Brulee.  4 stars.  Creme brulee is my favorite dessert.  They do it well. Creamy custard with visible vanilla bean specks. Sugar was well-caramelized, which gave the brulee its nice crunch.  Good vanilla flavor.  I'd get it again.. . 6.  Materva Soda.  3 stars.  This was recommended by the guy at Porto's.  It's a Cuban soda and it has a unique flavor.  I'd compare the taste to Red Bull, but with a much smoother and a more appealing and sweet aftertaste.  It was definitely interesting.   Portos has a few international sodas that you can try here.. . I really enjoyed everything at Portos.  I'd definitely go back again.  Now...time to burn off some of those calories.
