my FAVORITE breakfast place ever. . . although the wait can be a bit long some days, it's to be expected. and the guy who does the seating is so friendly, efficient and will always remember your name/face that you can't get upset at the wait. . . order the chocolate chip french toast and ask for strawberries on top. heaven. sheer heaven. if you like saltier breakfast items, try the tequila sunrise. it's nowhere as good as the french toast, but it'll do. poached y papas benedict is also tasty. what i dont like are the kickin' and screamin' breakfast tacos -- theyre a little bland for me. . . portions are massive, be hungry. and ask if you can sit in the back booths if you have a group of 4 or more.
