Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
Grey Dog is a great place to go for coffee, sandwiches, salads, etc. The ambiance is interesting -- there's always quirky artwork on the walls and everytime I've been in there, there's been a different genre of music playing (I've heard Nirvana, The Beatles, and Sigur Ros on separate occasions). I've tried a few of the cookies and pastries and they're also very good. On the weekdays, it can be a nice place to sit down with a cup of coffee, a book, or get some work done. Their brunch on the weekends is good, but it can get extremely crowded. 9 out of 10 times, you'll be waiting in line to be seated and the staff will turn your table over extremely quickly. You'll be wedged in to your seating space, so don't plan on coming in with a large group -- it won't be comfortable. The good food (I enjoy the turkey brie sandwich, the Irish oatmeal) and coffee (hazelnut iced coffee is always so refreshing) keep me coming back though. The staff (usually hipsters) can seem ambivalent at times, but they're not rude. The owners are very nice though, I had met them at a community service event in Greenwich Village a few years ago, and are definitely interested in hearing what their patrons have to say.
