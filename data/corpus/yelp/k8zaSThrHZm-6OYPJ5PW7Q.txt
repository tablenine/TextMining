We went for a fixed price, three course brunch at Easter. First, I was disappointed the elevator was darkened because of the windows being out. The ride to the top is the best part! (Tornado's will do that I guess! That's no ones fault) . . The scenery is great if you're not the one sitting backwards. We had a fried chicken plate with scalloped potato's and collard's and the beef tips with mashed potato's and a corn casserole . . . The food was toooooooo heavy. I think they used a pint of heavy cream and a stick of butter in each serving. The servers were understaffed for such a busy day. We sat about 10 minutes before someone came with water. I think we got lost in some of the very large parties... . . So after sitting backwards, eating heavy food and not getting water or anything to drink and swallow my food, I did not have a good time. . . I may go when visitors are in town and we'll all sit on the same side of the table, but I don't think I'll ever say, "Hey, let's go to the Sun Dial". . . The views are magnificent! The food is less than edible unless you eat a lot of heavy cream.
