prob worth 3.5 stars.. kogi is one of those things u gotta try at least once.. i don't know if it is worth 1.5hrs of wait, tho.. it wasn't like there were alot of ppl in line, the service was just SLOW.. . short rib taco:  ok. tofu taco: tofu was so bland.. spicy pork:  where is the meat?  (it was mostly all fat!). kim-chee quesadilla:  YUM!!!!  so good, u just inhale it.. . maybe i will go back for the burrito.  . or for the shaved ice that another truck was selling...it looked pretty good.. . overall, m glad i tried it.
