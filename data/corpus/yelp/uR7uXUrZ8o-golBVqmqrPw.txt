Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Now generally i am apposed to places like cheesecake and CPK and such. . . However.... . Going to the original cheesecake in Chicago was an amazing experience. I would definitely recommend it for an out-of-towner or a hungry NorthWestern student needing a large/tasty meal for incredibly reasonable prices.
