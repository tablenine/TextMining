I've never been to Japan but this is the best Shabu Shabu I've eatten so far.  This place is packed every day so if you want a seat, you've either got to be patient or come 30 min before they open and put your name on the sign in sheet.  The meals comes w/either a large/med portion of raw sliced beef and a plate of veggies along w/ a couple of pieces of tofu and udon.  The old man is the owner, don't piss him off otherwise you maybe 86'd from the joint.  Tender meat, perfect sourness w/the Ponzu sauce, grated radish, and perfectly sliced green onions make this meal.  Also try the ice coffee it's pretty good too.
