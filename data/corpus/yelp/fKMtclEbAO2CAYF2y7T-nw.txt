Post meal, we wanted to go enjoy some fine desserts on the town!  After deciding we were too full to indulge on the Peninsula Chocolate buffet and finding that Hot Chocolate was a 40 minute plus wait for a table, we wandered over to Feast to find ourselves fairly pleased.  The 5 of us left happy.. . Apple Blueberry Crumble - Slight notes of sourness, crumble was good, fairly unsweet dessert for those who aren't looking for sweetness.  This ranked third in our group.  -$6. . Chocolate Decandent - Pure unadulterated chocolate, soft, moist, delish.  Share this dish, as the chocolate was nearly overpowering.  Comes with a raspberry sauce (excellent, brings out the chocolate flavors well).  This ranked second for my fiancee and I.  -$6. . Banana Creme Brulee - Perhaps I've never had banana creme brulee before, but this dish was the clear winner for my fiancee and I.  The creme brulee could've used a bit more of a "crack" to the sugar top, but the creme underneath with thin slices of banana mixed in was creamy, smooth, and delicious.  It was a welcome surprise!. . Verdict:  The dessert is worth going back for.  Not sure about meals yet, but if we're in the neighborhood, may stop back again to check it out.  My only issue (resulting in 3 stars instead of 4) was that the service was fairly lacking... for a group of 5 people to sit down with dessert menus, we really don't need 20 minutes of time before someone appears to take our order.
