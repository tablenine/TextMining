Restaurant: Cleos Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Bars
Cleo's makes it into my Top 5 list of best bloody marys in Chicago Whether the really nice blonde waitress w/ the glasses (Gretchen?) makes it, or you make it at the bloody mary bar, you can't seem to go wrong. . . Yeah, it's little divey here--the stale cigarette stench kinda slaps you in the face when you enter, but it wears off and overall it's a good atmosphere. You're guaranteed to be in the presence of a colorful Cleo's regular, and they'll likely strike up a conversation if you've got a friendly face. Cleo's is also one of the most entertaining places to watch a good game on the TV's... Always good stuff playing on the stereo, and the servers &amp; bus boys are extremely friendly. Service can get a tad slow when they're busy. They have great comfort food, and their brunch menu is pretty terrific for a bar. Can't go wrong w/ any of the wraps. And they're HUGE. I always leave w/ half leftover for the next day.
