Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
So after partying up in WeHo for Halloween, I knew I would be up for some good breakfast grub. Square One seemed like a good choice since it's loved by Yelpers and Chowhounders alike. . . Parking is limited and after passing the Church of Scientology garage, I was hoping to get a glimpse of TomKat.. Arrived Saturday morning just shy of noon, 20 minute wait for 2 people.  Luckily there's a few news machines, so grabbed a paper to read.  Food roundup:. . Skirt steak w/eggs: I got the cheese bacon grits as a side. The grits were pretty good, the meal is stone-ground, so it has a great texture and hearty mouth feel, big chunks of bacon too. I was surprised that the skirt steak was not one hunk of meat, but a pile of thinly sliced meat cut on the bias. It was cooked to a perfect medium. The five grain toast that came along was awesome, too bad it was two halves and kinda dinky. I would have loved one more piece.. . Friend got an egg sandwich w/sausage: Only took a bite, but was tasty. Good garlic aoli and the sausage was not uber-processed or overly salty. Came with some greens in a light balsamic vinaigrette.. . To go: Orange blueberry scone and carrot raisin muffin. Both ok, nothing to write home about.. . The lowdown: I love the ambiance here, fresh food made pretty simply in a relaxed, non cookie-cutter chain atmosphere.  Unfortunately places like this are hard to find in OC. Sit in the patio (I didn't experience any flies),  read a paper, relax , and take in a leisurely brunch..my ideal Sat/Sun morning. Next time I'll come conquer the fabulous looking french toast!
