I'm gonna have to try this place for the 4th (?) time b/c I'm not sure what is so fantastic about sticky rice other than its wide array of dishes. I remember getting the . Yum banana blossom- Given the reviews, I was expecting fresh, not canned, banana blossom, which has a very different taste. Wasn't a fan. . Green and red curries- ok. . Khao tom mud- same as the kind you buy in the grocer freezer. khao lam- grocer freezer
