Category: Pizza
This past Saturday morning, we were part of the L.A. Loft Tour, and for some reason, Louie's was our first stop. Really? At a restaurant? This is supposed to be a Loft tour, not restaurant tour. . . Anyways. When we walked in, I felt out of place right from the get go. I made a comment to my GF that I should be in the back washing dishes or busing tables. It's a pretty intimidating place. It reminds me of Mi Piace, without the historical aspect to it. . . And now for my one star. When the tour was over, my GF's mother came back to have some lunch. The good news is that her name was taken for a table. The bad news is that she was never actually seated. See, the patronage consists of uber yuppies, and douchebags. Oh yeah, I was looking. My GF's mother is neither, but she was by herself. I guess if you're not "people" or with people, you ain't gonna eat. . . After nearly 30 minutes of waiting she left. Something is seriously wrong when you cannot serve a single patron. I think she was pegged as soon as she walked in. You've got to be a real shitty establishment when you're going to let the rival IHOP take your business. . . Louie, more like Fouie.
