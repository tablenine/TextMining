Restaurant: Barney&#39;s Beanery
Category: Bars
Everytime ive come here, its been solid, a good "go-to" kind of spot. six dollar draft beers, bunch of tv's and above average atmosphere, Â seem to get parking right in front of the place everytime i go, bunch of pool tables and bar upstairs (good date idea).. . Also, its a good spot to go to salvage a night that went wrong, have a drink and possibly meet somebody new.. . Overall, pasadena barneys beanery, you get four stars from me and ill be seeing you sometime in the near future.
