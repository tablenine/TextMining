I was visiting Los Angeles for one day.  What a treat it is to visit an establishment with tasty sweets and a beverage for a midday pick-me-up.  This enterprise is a Cuban bakery. I had ordered a whipped, ice chai latte and desserts to share.  . .  Mango Mousse - Smooth mango mousse on top of a crisp flaky cracker.  The BEST!!!. .  Pina Colada - Topped with shreds of coconut and real orchid - beautiful presentation and tasty. .  Tiramisu - Creamy with a hint of rum.  Yummy!. .  Cappuccino Mousse - multiple layers of smooth mousse and full of flavor.. .  Fruit Tart - Crisp, flaky tart with light creamy filling and fresh toppings of fruits.  Scrump-delickious!. . Here is Type II Diabetes going through the roof.. . Looking around at the bakery counter, I saw cakes galore.  I was impressed with the huge sheet cake on the counter with fruit toppings as high as Carmen Miranda's headgear.  This bakery could use some improvement with their service line.  The wait to order  was way too long.  They could improve the wait by tagging each item with the name and price and allow their customers to order by form and submit to the staff for ordering.  They certainly have enough staff behind the counter.. . 5***** for the desserts and minus 1 for the long wait.
