I am an instant fan even with the fact that BL does not take reservations and we waited about 45 minutes for our table on a Saturday night!!!! The buzzing of gave this restaurant the energy that downtown LA has been lacking and needs! Â I love the simplicity and the sheer size of the place -- though I would have love for just a dimmer lighting... but enough about that and lets get to the food!! . . Portabella fries -- nough said!!!! I wanted to keep on ordering these little goodness but decided to try some other items. . I went with the mussels and clams and fries as my main dish! I must admit that although the broth was tasty and the mussels and clams perfectly cooked, it was a bit on the salty side. . My friends ordered the Margherita pizza, which was inhaled within minutes after arriving on our table. The thin crust was perfectly cooked..The penne gamber was also very tasy..very fresh and light with just a hint of garlic!! . . I'm already dreaming about the fries..and next time, I'm going to make room for the chocolate souffle!!!
