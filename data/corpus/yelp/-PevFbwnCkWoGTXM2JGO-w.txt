Wurstkuche is a work in progress, and they are working hard at finishing it off... that did not detract from good food, including a great variety of sausages from the traditional to the exotic amazing fries with a really good variety of dipping sauces, great draught beer selection and a really cool fun vibe.  Going with the expectation that we would check out something new and not much more we accomplished the main goal and realized that we would surely be coming back for more.. . They were working on the tables and lighting while we were there and as soon as they had more space for people to sit, the space filled up.  We had a great afternoon and stayed way longer than we imagined we would!  I say this is one to support in order to make sure they are successful!
