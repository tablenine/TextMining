Continue my recent post on my LA trip.... . . After finished 5 lbs of lobster at Newport Seafood, I needed my dessert, so I suggested brown shaved ice to my bf... he thought I was insane haha... when the shaved ice came, I think he actually ate more than me....ummmm.. who is the pig? j/k =). . The Combo 8 shaved ice comes with red beans, green beans, condensed milk, pudding, boba balls, taro balls, rice cakes, grass jellies, ai-yu jellies... and the very tasty brown sugar syrup... I think this shaved ice is the best that I have ever had in the US and it's almost comparable to the best ones in Taiwan!  Truly amazing!   Check out my shaved ice picture!
