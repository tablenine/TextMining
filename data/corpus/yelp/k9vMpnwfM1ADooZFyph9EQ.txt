I highly recommend stopping by on a Thursday night for the vibrant, soulful blues band that plays then. All the band members have personality, but the spunkiest is the ~ 70-some year old guy on keyboards; he has classically scratchy vocals (and barely intelligible, but in a good way!). Can't get enough of those guys.
