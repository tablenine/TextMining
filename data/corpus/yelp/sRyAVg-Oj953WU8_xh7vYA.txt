Now that the hype has died down and I don't have to wait an hour for a table, I will definitely be going more often. I've been twice and had the bacon/spinach/feta omelette and it's really yummy. Next time I'll have the chicken and waffles. My friend highly recommends it.. . The ambiance is cool. It's setup like a small, quaint house with a come as you are type of vibe. Some people are all decked out, while others are rocking sweats from all different types of backgrounds. . . The service was good. Our waiter was very sweet and attentive, but not in annoying way.. . The only thing I would change is that they need to consider using the A/C. My God it was so hot in there. The thermometer said 89, and when I got up to leave I was pretty soaked :( That's the only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 4.. . O and I wish the served liquor...if not a full bar, at least mimosas.
