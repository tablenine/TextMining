I was in Atlanta for a trade show and was looking for a good place for a steak dinner lucky me Teds was across the street from my hotel. I walked over sat down to my table for one, one thing I noticed Its a real steakhouse, they offer all kinds of exotic meat from the grill this time I ordered the Bison steak, it was out of this world! It was juicy, tender and reminded me of what real good beef should taste like. The service was above par, the people in George are real genuine folks the decor was American steakhouse all the way, I would go back when I am back in Atlanta. I say check them out!
