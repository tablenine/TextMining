I *heart* sausage.. I *heart* sausage.. I *heart* sausage..Hey Hey Hey Hey!! . . Mmm.. Gimme some Taiwanese sausage from Sinbala over hot dogs at Pinks any day... Okay fine, maybe my opinion is slightly biased since I don't even like hot dogs.. hehe... . They have a whole array of sausage from savory to sweet toppings.. I have yet tried any of the sweet toppings.. Maybe I don't *heart* sausage as much as I thought.. eh...but u can't go wrong ordering the sausage w/ garlic (ground and sliced) is good.. To me ground garlic seems to pack more heat... If u get the sausage rice plate it dont come with garlic, so if ur like me and *heart* ur garlic as much as u do sausage make sure u have them add garlic.. . . Their cold chicken noodle is good too. And when I feel like abandoning my nonexistent diet I get the fried chicken leg rice (boneless, saves me the trouble) or the fried pork chop rice. To make myself feel better for eating these yummy fatty dishes I order some sweet/sour cabbage. Extra veggies in my meal should compensate for the extra 2000+ calorie I just consumed right? . . Drinks are good here, but I have yet to try their shaved ice. Always too full after my meal to get any shaved ice, and doubt it would taste great if I were ever to get it to go. Â One of these days..... . The staff is nice friendly people. Very efficient and prompt services. One time they were even more nicer and speedier when I order to-go and let them keep the change from my $20 for a $16 something tab. LoL... the cashier lady actually kept asking them when my order was gonna be ready.. I think I waited a total of 2 mins.. Wow... Dunno how my food was prepped and cooked that quickly but it felt nice to be cared for.. Kudos to them for making me feel special...In my book that's always a plus.
