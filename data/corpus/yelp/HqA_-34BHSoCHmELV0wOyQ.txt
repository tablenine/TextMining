Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I think it's a conspiracy. This place was made as a diversion to keep all the Gringos away from the good Mexican restaurants. That way people who know where to get good Mexican food won't have to wait in line outside like the lost souls who inhabit this place. . . Maybe 30 years ago when there weren't a lot of Mexican restaurants around this was probably the place to go. But with so many other Â Mexican restaurants around that have much better food to offer I just can't in my right mind understand how this place is so popular.
