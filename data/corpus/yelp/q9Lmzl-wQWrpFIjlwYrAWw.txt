Canter's is a rather recent discovery of mine. I know what you're all saying right now, "recent discovery?! does she live under a rock?" Yeah, well, I guess I must, because when I went to Canter's, I immediately regretted that it wasn't the FIRST THING I discovered when I first entered Los Angeles.. . I love Delis. I don't care how they look inside, or if the same waitresses are celebrating their 50th anniversary of working there, I still love them. I love sandwiches, and I especially love knowing that my meat will be freshly sliced off that big hunk of meat behind the counter specially for my sandwich. It makes me feel a little bit important.. . Another thing- Canter's has bagels and cream cheese. Bagels and cream cheese are also up there on the list of my top ten most favorite things in the world. I like to get lots of them to bring home. I kid myself by saying that my dozen bagels will last me a week. I'm lucky if it lasts the evening.. . Finally, Canter's biggest selling point: they have a ::drumroll:: PARKING LOT! Wow! What a treat! Being able to park RIGHT NEXT TO the building, go inside, buy my stuff, and NOT HAVE TO PAY TO LEAVE! What a novel idea! It's like an oasis in the middle of a parking-lot-less city.... It's like... well... Heaven.
