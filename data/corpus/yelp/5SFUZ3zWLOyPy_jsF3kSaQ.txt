Wow, looking back over my reviews, I was shocked to find I had only given Gilbert's 4 stars... Since writing my first review, which was based only on the brunch experience, I have been back to Gilbert's several times, mostly for lunch and dinner.  I must say, though the brunch is great, I'm actually more impressed with the lunch and dinner.  .      The dinner menu ranges from sandwiches to Mediterranean favorites like spanikopita and baba ganoush to more high end entrees like lamb tenderloin.  By the way, these are the entrees that are half price on Mondays, meaning you can get lamb tenderloin for 10 bucks.  Hard to beat that!.      Being the fan of variety that I am, I *love* the way the lunch menu is laid out.  They have an impressive list of the aforementioned Mediterranean favorites of which you can choose 2 or 3 for a combo.  Of course, you can get one of the delicious gyros too if you're so inclined.  .       Seems like everyone's already touched on this, but the atmosphere and service are amazing.  The servers are super friendly; I think one of them even brought us shots on the house one night!  Speaking of the drinks, the tiramisu martini is TO DIE FOR!!  It's made with marscapone cheese blended in.  I think that says it all.  I also really love the atmosphere of Gilbert's as a bar too..      There are not very many places that I would honestly frequent for brunch/lunch, dinner, and drinks, but Gilbert's definitely has it all and is quickly becoming one of my favorite places in Atlanta!
