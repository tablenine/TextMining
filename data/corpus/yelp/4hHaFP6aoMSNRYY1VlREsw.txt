Normally coming to a Yard House just makes me cranky, but this time was surprisingly enjoyable. The crowd is usually what kills me, and there where no drunk yuppies at the bar making it almost eerily quiet.. . We came to watch the Oscars and they had it on every TV around us! They also had CC so we could read the thing and know wth was going on. I don't really understand wth is with espn and not having CC. How am I suposto know whats going on?! What are they saying?!. . The service was fantastic because of how slow the bar was. We had a new server and he did great.. . The appetizers where FANTASTIC as always. We had the spicy tuna roll...my favorite spicy tuna roll anywhere...and the nachos. The tuna roll is a crazy blob thing that's just avocado, spicy tuna, and edamame.. . The beer selection compare to other Yard Houses I have been to was a bit lacking but compare to most bars its a treat. I've had nearly everything on the menu so this time I tried Green Flash West Coast IPA, which I enjoyed. It has pretty yummy hopps.. . I'd totally considering coming back to this location on another night and see how the crowd gets here...and to have their mojitos!
