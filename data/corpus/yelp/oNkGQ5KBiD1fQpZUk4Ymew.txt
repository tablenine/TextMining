This pizza place is great!  It's byob, cozy and small, and wow do they make a great pie!  If you're sick of overstuffed Chicago-style pizza (which does have its purpose on occasion) head to this little place for some authenticity.  The menu is small, with a few salads and about 10 thin Italian-style pies.  All the pizzas are the same size even, (8 slices) so there's no bones about what size you need to get.  It's actually perfect for two ppl.  Anyway, we got the classic margherita, which was sooo tasty.  The crust was light and airy, yet crisp and perfectly charred on the outside.  A true delight.  And, what was refreshing was that the pizza didn't make me sickeningly full.  I felt great!  This place was reviewed by several places as the best pizzza in town, and I definitely agree with that title!
