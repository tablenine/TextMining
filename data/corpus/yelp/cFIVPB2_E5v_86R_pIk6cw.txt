Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I'm usually no burger fan, but a co worker of mines told me about this place and that I MUST try because it's just so gOod. Ok, so one Friday night that I didn't have any plans or wanted to go out. My lovely bf and I went all the way to LA to get some burgers.. just to see what this place is all about. We went about 9pm, it was busy but wasn't crazy packed because the place was about to close within an hr or so. We sat and I ordered the Manly Burger (well done because I wasn't feeling the bloody burger) Oh man the burger was DELiSsSsHh! My bf got the signature burger...It was 6x Umami or something like that. He said it was bomb diggity! We also shared sweet potato fries and beer battered onion rings. Geez, the onion rings had more oil than all of our food put together! . It's been about a month since I've had Umami and I am craving to return! I say it's a must try and of course skip out on the onion rings! And yes it's about $10 bucks a burger and the prices has gone up about a buck since my co worker last went.
