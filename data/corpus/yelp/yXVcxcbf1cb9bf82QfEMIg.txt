Great place to drink and snack on. I've been coming here for two years and good service has dwindled. There food distributors tend to shut down so one month you get delicious edamame's and another you get nachos with some sort of white dip thingy. The drink specials still keeps me coming back for more and the calamari with the sweet and sour sauce. Definitely a staple to a Friday or Saturday night before hitting the clubs.. Don't drink the mojito's unless you're prepared to suck on peppermint leaves, since they serve them with huge bubble tea straws. The lycheetini is to die for, sweet but heady and strong. . . The pre-fix dinner is a great deal: four courses for $16 plus glass of wine. You can always change your wine to there house cocktail and your desert too.
