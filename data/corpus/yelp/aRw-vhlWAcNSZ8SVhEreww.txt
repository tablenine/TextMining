I love this place.. . It reminds me of what I love about Hollywood. The Hills, the history, the charm of old Hollywood. It transports me back to a golden age when Hollywood made movies, not tent pole events or franchise opportunities.. . And standing in front of Yamashiro looking out over LA, you can for a moment forget the grime and the dirt of the streets, the hustle, the struggle, the desperation to make it before your bank balance hits zero and you return to Bumfuck, Idaho, tail between your legs, to work the registers at Walmart.. . From high on this hill, all you can see are the lights of Los Angeles stretching out before you. Hundreds of thousands of lights, all glowing and sparkling like the dreams in our hearts and the hopes in our eyes.. . This is the Hollywood dream.
