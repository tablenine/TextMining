Category: Vietnamese
Solid Asian food at good prices! I was stuck outside of Chicago for work and got sick of the hotel food so my co-workers and I decided to come here to satisfy our Asian food cravings. . . They have an extensive menu with a variety of asian dishes. They don't just serve Chinese food. They also have Thai, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese dishes. Something for everyone. I love how they present their food and the portions are large! The rice in bamboo pots remind me of places in Asia that serve rice in the same way. My korean tofu soup came in a cast iron bowl with an old-school wooden ladel. How cute! Their fruit drinks and teas are HUGE and good! The place can be pretty cramped, but that's okay, I'lll endure it for some good ol' Asian food. . . It's definitely a fun place to eat at with friends. Before I left Chicago after my work was done, I had to go dine at Joy Yee's one last time because I liked it so much. Oh Joy Yee's, I miss you so.
