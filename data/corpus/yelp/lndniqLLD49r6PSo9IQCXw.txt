Category: Vietnamese
I haven't been to this place for a while....Food is incredibly delicious especially for noodle lovers.  It comes in BIG bowl that sometimes you can share with your friends. . . I give this place only four stars because last time I went there with my friends.  We ordered seafood fried rice which is really good.  Unfortunately, this time it was so salty.  In addition, one of my friend, she ordered vegan dish.  When the order came it turned out to have ground pork in her noodle soup.  (it was even worse that  she already had some before she found out.)  Finally, they replaced it....but in somehow my friend felt bad for their mistake.....anyway, just wanna let you guys know so this won't happen to you all :-)  . . For me, I am omnivore and I can take almost anything that human being can eat and enjoy so I have no problem at all.. . PS: Try avocado smoothy (even though it sounds weird, it is one of my favorite cups)
