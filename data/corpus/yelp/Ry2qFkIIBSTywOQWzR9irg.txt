yay!  frasca is one of my favorite restaurants in chicago!!  i love it.  . . the farmers platter where you get to pick different bruscettas, cheese, meats, etc is fab.  the waitstaff are all really friendly.  the pizza reminded me of the pizza in roma. . . ooo  and the bottomless mimosa brunch is great.. . once i had a date here and even when we got really drunk and had a gay makeout sesh in the booth the servers were still all super nice.  : )
