Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
What happened to this place?. . I have been a fan of Buckhead Diner for 15 years and had really enjoyed this place in the past. Unfortunately my most recent visit fell short of my expectations. This diner is located in the heart of Buckhead off of Piedmont and you can't the unique silver diner building. There is both valet and self parking. Once inside you are greeted by a hostess to take your seating arrangements and many photos of celebrities plastered on the walls.. . On my last visit I ordered the grilled grouper sandwich at the bar. I didn't get quite the warm reception from the bartenders. They seemed aloof and indifferent to me. When the food arrived, the piece of grouper was smaller than what I had experienced at other joints, plus the bun was a bit overbearing on the sandwich. It was a major letdown and wondered if it was worth the price.. . On a another visit I had the veal-mushroom meatloaf. The vegetables were cooked freshly as was he mashed potatoes. The meatloaf on the other hand was a little on the dryer side and lacked any distinct flavor. I was unimpressed with this dish and wondered why the quality has been on a downhill spiral. I want to like this place but it is becoming rather difficult to do so.. . Expect to pay a moderate price as you will with Buckhead Life restaurants.. There are better places to get a grouper sandwich, like Florida :-)
