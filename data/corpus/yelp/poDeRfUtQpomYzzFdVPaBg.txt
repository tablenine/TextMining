the best caesar anywhere!!  hands down!  and the free bread is awesome - so fresh and fluffy!  the meat is pretty good too, but i would say that the chop house does it better.  but to be fair, after consuming the bread, the huge caesar salad, two dozen oysters, and three rounds of drinks, we were probably too stuffed to fully appreciate the meat when it came.. . the atmosphere is not what i typically look for in a restaurant, but i go back for the caesar.
