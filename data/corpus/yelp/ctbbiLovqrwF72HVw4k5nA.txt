i LOVE the ropa vieja. it's sooo good there and damn, the portions are huge. it's well worth the price. i save the fried plantains for the end of my meal. they're always perfect. i opt for all rice, no beans. the rice is really tasty there, too, not plain tasting at all. the location on venice is much better than any of the other locations. if the other locations are too busy, i'll go to the one in venice and i rarely have to wait.
