Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
Mmmm Mmmm! That is all that needs to be said but since they're paying me by the word I'll throw in a few more.. . Nowhere in my search for good barbecue in Chicago have I found one more worthy. Yes, there are a few close contenders and it took me a while to consider this but I have to say; Smoke Daddy's is the stuff.. . Juicy, sweet ribs that drip from the bone, sweet potato fries, thick pulled pork, treat yourself and go to Smoke Daddy, it's some good eatin'. They offer three different kinds of sauce right there are your table too.. . The service is excellent and friendly and a great atmosphere with good music (always related to 'cue. CCR was playing last time). If you haven't been, GO!
