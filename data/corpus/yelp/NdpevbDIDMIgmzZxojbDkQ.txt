Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I was visiting my bro in Hollywood, and he brought me to Roscoe's (now immortalized by the film Jackie Brown). Came with an appetite, did not leave unsatisfied. Had always wondered how fried chicken and waffles worked together in an unholy union, but while these bits of pure unadulterated greasy goodness may bring about apocalyptic changes to your waistline, you will gladly sell your metabolism to the devil for how these taste. . . Sweet tea, mac n' cheese, and the Carol C. special==perfect after a day of avoiding 4-dollar popcorn at Disneyland.
