Came here for dinner with a group at a business meeting. Good, attentive service. Great French food. I had waygu flank steak which was prepared nicely. If I were paying I would have gone elsewhere but on someone else's dime it was just fine.. UPDATE: Return visit: Friday night and the place was nearly empty. Lat visit January 2010 this visit April 2010. We were surprised. I had the ribeye with truffle butter whic hwas wonderful. A special appetizer was crawfish and okra soup which one person had and enjoyed. Pasta du jour was Fregola (sardinian couscous) with escargot, grilled corn and tomatoes, which got rave reviews. Thumbs up for fregola which is wonderful - I passed because of the escargot.
