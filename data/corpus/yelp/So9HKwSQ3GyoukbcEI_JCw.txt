I think I have a new favorite sushi spot in chicago!!!  This place is hands down one of the best i've been too.  We ordered the tuna tuna salmon maki (poached salmon topped w/ tuna and wasabe mayo), medium fatty tuna nigiri sushi, yellow tail hamachi, and the aka anago eel.  The fish was RIDICULOUSLY fresh, and virtually melted in my mouth, particularly the tuna.  . . They made a mistake and brought us someone elses maki roll, yet they were nice enough to comp it to us since we were like 3/4 finished!!  Lucky this happened since the mistake ended up being the spicy mono (octopus topped w/ tuna) and it was probably the best thing we ate all night.  . . Service was fantastic, extremely quick and attentive.  We washed it all down w/ some cloudy cold sake which was great.   While this place is certainly not cheap, it's easily one of the best places in chicago!!
