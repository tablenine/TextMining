All yum and no 'tude for us. Our waitress was super-sweet as a matter of fact, giving us recommendations and being perfectly accommodating. It was interesting that the wait staff was wearing aprons. Semi-casual, approachable feeling.. . Anyway, the delectables we had:. Wild mushrooms salad (delicious). Ravioli (with fresh English peas + ricotta inside - fresh). Passatelli in brodo (aka chicken noodle soup - good broth). Blood orange martini (high octane). Dessert with fruit + tropical cream atop chocolate meringue (get this if you want a light dessert with taste explosion). . The one thing was, I had a gift certificate for $200 and was thinking we could split it between two nights of dinners. Unfortunately, they don't give 'credit' so it was either blowing it all on an $80 dinner (incl. tip) or saving it for next time where we'll really go to town on cocktails and dessert. We'll be back.
