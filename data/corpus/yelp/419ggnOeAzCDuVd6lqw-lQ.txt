Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
mmmm I love tender greens. I get in these weird moods sometimes where I am craving a yummy salad. this place hits the spot for sure. I love their nicoise salad. I just can't seem to get enough of it. Their chicken soup is very hearty and perfect for rainy and gloomy weather.. . stay away from their tomato soup - very greasy!
