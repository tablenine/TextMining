Restaurant: Mana Food Bar
Category: Vegetarian
i'm a vegetarian who leans toward the vegan side. i had high hopes for this restaurants and high expectations simply by the great reviews given here.. i will first say i applaud any bar or restaurant that is completely vegetarian or vegan. and i will go at least once to help support it. but unfortunately i won't be going back to mana food bar.. . perhaps it's because they are still catching their bearings (they only opened this summer) or it was a busy saturday night, but our food was really unimpressive. as was the service.. . we were a larger group (7) which this place is not really good for. we expected to wait a while, and we did. but for 30 minutes of that wait, the tables that we were to later occupy sat empty and unused. so we politely asked if we could sit and got snapped at by a stressed out server.. . the food sounds exciting, but it's really not. perhaps it is for people who aren't used to eating vegetables in any other state except steamed out of a bag. thai watermelon salad was obviously sitting around a while. baja corn? mushy. mana 'slider'? could have been a falafel instead of the fancy mushroom/rice base they claimed. it didn't taste bad, but pretty boring. my boyfriend order an argula salad which was bagged lettuce barely topped with a generic type of dressing. i tasted the buckwheat soba noodles with peanut sauce: mushy, overcooked and very little taste. that's all i tasted, but the rest of my group didn't have many good things to say either. oh, the 'spring salad' was supposed to be good.. . to the restaurant's credit, it was pretty on the inside and had good patio seating. but the lack of actual vegan options (butter/cheese/mayo/creamy stuff is in lots of things) and the quality of food to price ratio does not encourage a second visit.
