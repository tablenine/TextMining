I've been back a couple of times since my original review and I still love this place just as much as the first time.. . I celebrated my birthday here with a large group, which involved lots of good drinks and lots of good food (I had the chicken tacos).  We were all very happy with the food and the service.  This is a great place for big groups of people.  . . This past Saturday I was here for brunch.  Gotta love a place that serves brunch on Saturday AND takes reservations -- no waiting around for hours here!  . . The River North Mimosa (Champagne + Homemade Hub Punch) was sooooooooo good.  I had the Blackberry French Toast (brioche french toast with fresh blackberrys and blackberry syrup) -- not too sweet, just perfect.  My friend had the (vegetarian) breakfast tacos and raved about them.  . . I didn't do it, but I hear that you get 10% off your bill if you wear your pajamas to brunch.  :)
