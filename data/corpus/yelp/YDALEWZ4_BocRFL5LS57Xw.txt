I have great things to say about this place, but there are a few downfalls.  I'll start with those.. . When I asked for reservations at 7:15, I was told that I could either come at 6:45 or 7:45 so I chose 6:45 so we could make our show afterward.  So, when we arrived at 6:50, I was shocked to see that only two other tables were in use.  They knew ahead of time that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and they put us in the middle room which initially seemed perfect and romantic except they decided to put us in the corner two-top table on the edge of the room where you hear all of the bustle and conversations at the busser's station and the kitchen.  I found that bizarre, since there were plenty of quieter open tables that weren't in use until other patrons started arriving around 7:45.  Our waiter was a bit of a Hollywood chump, condescending and sarcastic.  He didn't honor the beauty of the restaurant or the caliber of the excellent food.  Start to finish the food was incredible-- the baguettes were perfect, the cheese plate was great (not the best I've ever had, but good).  We both ordered fish dishes and the flavors and freshness were amazing.  The St. Germain dessert was basically heaven in my mouth.  And of course, Lavazza coffee to finish!. . This is probably the most beautiful restaurant I've seen in a long time. You really feel like you're not in L.A, but in some romantic Parisian hideaway.  I spotted a few celebs and the crowd included a lot of people posing, begging to be looked at. But if your company is good enough, those things shouldn't matter.. . If I could afford it, I'd go here much more often.  But alas, dropping $200 for two people is a bit steep for me these days.
