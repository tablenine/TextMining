I start by saying that I went for the Wall of Bravery (Special #2) and I failed. So take that how you will. If I go back for reasons other than to rid myself of the stench of failure I will repost. . . The writing was on the wall as soon as they put the bowl in front of me and didn't even bother to start a timer. "This kid has no chance" I'm sure they were thinking, and having all eyes on me was a bit nerve wracking as well. Honestly it's not even the spicyness that'll get you. It's the temperature the soup is served pretty scalding that by the time it simmers enough to eat quickly you've taken up a bunch of your time already. Then there's the broth. After the noodles are done you have some sort of pepper slurry to lap up at the end. . . Good luck to anyone who tries.
