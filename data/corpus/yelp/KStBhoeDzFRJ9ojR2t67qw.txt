Restaurant: Canton House Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
We accidently found this place while looking for another dim sum restaurant.  The first comment my husband made was how clean it was for a Chinese restaurant.  And I have to agree that it was (including the restrooms).  . . I have to admit that I have high standards when it comes to dim sum.  I can't help it! When I use to live in NYC, I use to go out to Flushing to have dim sum with my parents every weekend! And this place was fairly good.  The food had a lot of flavor and it wasn't too oily. My favorites were the preserved egg/pork congee and crystal shrimp dumplings.  . . However, I think we went a bit late, so the selection was a bit lacking. And the girls were pushing the carts around like snails.  We'll have to go back again at an earlier hour.
