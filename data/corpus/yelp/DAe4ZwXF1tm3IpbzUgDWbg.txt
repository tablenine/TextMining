I came here with a group of friends for my 22nd birthday dinner last year.  I don't know what the hype is all about.  It looks cooler in pictures than it actually is in real life.  It's actually kind of run down and needs to be remodeled.. . I was excited and I had a great time, but I was also surrounded by fantastic company.  They squished the 8 of us on a small round table that probably could only fit six comfortably.  It was a Saturday night so it was pretty crowded, the server wasn't very friendly or attentive at all.  . . I don't even remember what we ordered but it was a lot of food.  I guess there everything just comes out when it's ready so some people ended up with food while others had nothing, but we all shared.. . My friend was nice enough to bring two bottles of wine, but the girl that was pouring it was an idiot and he ended up barely getting any of the wine that he paid $80 for so they gave him a free glass of wine, but it wasn't nearly comparable to what he should have gotten.. . They had a live dj that night which made it a little more of a party atmosphere, but another complaint is that there restrooms are downstairs with like 2 stalls.  Do you know how hard it is to walk down and up stairs in heels?  Especially when you're drunk?. . I am glad we came here, but I probably wouldn't come back.  There are way better restaurants in the area, and I don't care if it's trendy and a place to be seen, it's not worth it.
