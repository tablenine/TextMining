Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
This is, hands down, my most favorite ramen place ever.  Prior to Daikokuya, I refused order ramen in a restaurant, something I felt I could easily make at home.  I only wish I could come close to creating something as delicious as Dikokuya's, which I actually find myself craving at times.  I always get the combo, Ramen + Oyako Don, and it's more than enough food to fill me up.  The only negative I have is that they don't take reservations, so I've had to wait over an hour on several occasions during dinner hours on a weekday.  Move to a bigger location already!
