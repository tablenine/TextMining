I had no idea there was a place like this downtown.  Before the Dwell Show at the Convention Center my friends took me to Bottega Louie's for brunch.  We walked in to this impressive space, so chic.  It's done up a little like a Dean and Deluca, (I assume they plan to expand the retail side if that takes off) with pastries and pre-made goodies under glass and a limited gourmet grocery area.  The dining area feels massive.  It is crisp and white with gilded embellishments.  No patina on this brass.  . The service was great.  We ordered two pizzas, which seem to be the specialty of the house.  One white pizza and one pepperoni ,so pedestrian but really great.  The white pizza came with fresh arugula covering the top and I was particularly impressed with the red sauce on the pep pizza.  It was so fresh and tomato-y.  We also had a frittata with roasted veggies and goat cheese.  As we were leaving we grabbed a couple of tiny cupcakes from behind the pastry counter.  So yummy.  I think one was chocolate and marshmallow and the other italian cream.. My only criticism is aesthetic.  I like the look of the place very much, but it seems like maybe they ran out of money or time in the completion of the decor.  Perhaps it will be an evolving interior space but it seems to be lacking some pieces.  If it were up to me, I would add an impressive rococo chandelier in the center space and some super modern 3-D steel and neon sculptures to the back walls.  But who cares, the food was excellent and a welcome addition to this part of town.
