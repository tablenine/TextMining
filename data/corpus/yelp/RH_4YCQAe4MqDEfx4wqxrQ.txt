Come here quite often with coworkers. Menu is pretty limited, but everything is good. Ramen is good - I like the Kara Kara (spicy pork). A bit on the pricey side because most of the condiments are ala carte (egg, bean sprouts, etc.) In the summer, I like to get the "summer noodle" - a cold ramen dish with some sort of miso (?) dressing. I've heard coworkers rave about the mini pork sandwiches - I personally haven't tried them. There is a (small) parking lot in the back, a definite plus for West LA.
