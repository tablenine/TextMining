Ive tried the Reuben multiple times after a long night of deep Fried Poetry at the Poets slam. Nothing says yumm other than sourkraut.....! . . Their open face Philly cheese steak sandwhich with potato pancakes and a pickle isnt half bad after a long nights drink fest less the sidewalk yackathon. Its a good refill i guess. . . i love this place, i mean come on, its Jewish deliciousness....!!!!!!
