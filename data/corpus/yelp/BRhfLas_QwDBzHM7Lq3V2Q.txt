Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Tourist trap, soggy buns. . I HATE soggy buns. No seriously, I HATE it. I don't like food that is moist, especially when it shouldn't be. Pinks has Soggy buns. . . My little sister loves this place, but I hate to say I don't. I had high hopes for this place. There's always a long line because of all the tourist hype. I came here one time when it wasn't long, that was one time. . . I got the ozzy dog and some other hot dog I can't remember. Both had guacamole, don't get anything with guacamole. It taste bad. I also HATE thin hot dogs. Hot dogs should be thick and big. THICK and BIG DAMMIT. . . Next time, I'm just going to order a polish hot dog with chili and cheese with french fries. I think that will taste good. The fries are not bad. I'm also going to ask them to toast the bun so it won't get super soggy and gross. . . It's a good place to go, just so you can say you went. I'm still trying to find a good hot dog and burger place.
