OMG. Where am I? There should be more locations of this place, especially since they've disguised themselves as an airy and bright California chain restaurant already, with an interior set up as a McDonald's inside a SFV mall. I feel they've perhaps overdone themselves with the fake meat selection (perhaps to lure in the recent veggers) but their veggies are done just right and please, PLEASE GO AND HAVE SOME OF THEIR SWEET POTATO FRIES!!! They are the best sweet potato fries in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD. Who knew? EL SEGUNDO?! NO! EL PRIMERO!
