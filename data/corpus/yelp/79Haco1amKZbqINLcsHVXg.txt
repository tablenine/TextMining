great food and love the simple neighborhood atmosphere. Pizza is my new favorite. I had it two nights ago and i cant stop thinking about it. But was disappointed by the wine and the wine selection. The wine my boyfriend i was served had turned and it was over priced....12$ for pinot noir from OREGON..come on guys..... . lucky the pizza amazing and the service was fast!!!!
