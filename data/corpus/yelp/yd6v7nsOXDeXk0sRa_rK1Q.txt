Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I've been here twice and never again. i don't get it, it's cheap ok, but Del Taco is cheap and has something Tito's lacks, flavor. I've now tried all of the menu and all of it made me sad. i mean, i love food so much and rarely is food so bad for me that i get sad after eating it. but Tito's is that place, i felt like a piece of me died with each bite. all of it each time was bland and offered nothing. . . I'm not Mexican but i know food should have taste. i wish i could give zero stars.
