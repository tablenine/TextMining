I've been coming to Ann Sather for years, but to be honest, the only reason I ever come here is for their cinnamon rolls. Whenever I walk by here, and it happens to be opened, I always walk in to buy them. They are just so gooey and delicious and well-priced. Just around three bucks to go.. . Whenever I am hungover or I just really want good breakfast food, I usually come around twoish, when it's not too busy. I've had their omelets and egg's benedict with hashbrowns, and it's always been really good. Another reason why i go so late is because of the copious about amount of food they serve you leaving you full all day. . . I love it here and they will continue to have me as a loyal customer as long as they keep baking those delicious cinnamon rolls.
