Category: Diners
I always take my friends here after showing them around Hollywood. It makes me seem extremely cultured because I know of this small, cozy diner that's open 24 hours. . . You MUST try the thai cobb salad. When I first read that this salad had bacon bits and egg, I was close to vomiting because I had never conceived eating such a concoction. But my brother highly recommended it so I gave it a try, and it was fantastic. The sauce they use was especially tasty.. . As for dessert, they make a mean capuccino and peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream on top. . . They're burgers and sandwiches tend to be a bit dry though.. . Fred 62 is a great place. The atmosphere is amazing, and I think this homey diner is a testament of what Hollywood is really about.
