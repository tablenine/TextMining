Lured in by the hallucinogenic, Hello-Kittyish on LSD, asymmetric, plastic decor and loud techno pumping from this shiny confection at 1130 pm, one of the few places still open on the Bway strip.  Food was decent: got the Udon soup, very salty which is what I was craving.  I thought the style of just throwing in a couple pieces of fried shrimp was interesting, soggy breading anyone?  Interesting drink menu with sake mixes, tried out the green tea one which was more powerful than it tasted.  I thought the service was fine compared to others on here, although I couldn't really understand a word they said it all worked out and was pretty quick; then again it was late and uncrowded.
