Simple, delicious, and reasonably healthy without being unreasonably expensive.  I had the Chicken hot plate with some absolutely incredible mashed potatoes and a fantastic spinach, toasted hazelnuts, and goat cheese salad, topped off with the biggest two-cup french press I've ever had.  . . Everything was five star except the chicken, which wasn't bad, just not as incredible as everything else, and the counter people who didn't have much patience for somebody who was taking way too long (me) thanks to having never been there before, having not eaten in a while, and being semi-hungover due to a cold.. . Either way, I'll be back, and took a few menus back to the office to distribute to everybody else...
