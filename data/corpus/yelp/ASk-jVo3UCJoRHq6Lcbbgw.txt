Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Ok first off I must confess that so far this is the only ramen shop that I have been to. . . I love the miso base at Orochon when ever I go it is always very creamy and delicious. So far I can handle up to a number 2 (not the special 2. I can't handle that yet!) I love the dumplings when I have had them. Since I am a hungry boy I usually order extra noodles and I always get extra bean sprouts because I love them. . . I have also had the spicy fried rice and teriyaki chicken. In my opinion they were both very tasty. The spicy fried rice is truly spicy and the teriyaki chicken is also quite good (it is served with white rice and a nice salad.). . Now I must warn that the food can be hit or miss depending on when you go. I do not suggest going right at lunch because it is incredibly packed and it can take a long time to get your food.
