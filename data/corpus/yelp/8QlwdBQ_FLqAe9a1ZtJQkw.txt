This is the toughest rating I've ever given. Everything about the place is over-hyped, but I loved the pizza I ordered: Egg, guanciale, radicchio, escarole &amp; bagna cauda. . I'll bullet point the experience because I would like to share:. * The only reason we got a 4-top at 12:30PM was because there was a canceled reservation. The next available table was 2:45PM.. * Decor was awesome and simple. . * Service was very slow.. * We were on an office hour lunch break on a Thursday. The whole time we had to eat was the time it took to make our four pizzas. We had to box them to go and eat back at the office. . * My pizza was amazing, but the lunch was not worth $25 for pizza and water. . . Overall, I will probably not go back. I am happy that I have discovered Mario Batali's pizza style. One time is all I need in this case. I'm kind of disappointed.. . : (
