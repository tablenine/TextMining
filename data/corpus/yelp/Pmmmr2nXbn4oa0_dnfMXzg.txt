Sorry, but no. And I didn't even have expectations for the place! How sad.... . My appetizer was a pumpkin soup with a fruit compote and creme fraiche. The soup itself was ok, but I didn't really like it with the fruit compote. Too sweet. Ever had that butternut squash soup in a box from TJ's? Add some apples and raisins to that bitch and there you go.. . Since there were no vegetarian main courses, the chef prepared a special vegetable dish for me. It was essentially a plate of four vegetable side dishes: Chinese green beans, stir-fried Asian vegetables, cauliflower in cauliflower puree, and lentils in eggplant puree. Boringgggg! While none of them were particularly offensive, it's rather unfortunate that the green beans at a C-rated Chinese restaurant taste better than the ones here.. . The dessert also failed me--a caramelized apple pastry with apple sorbet. Again, very boring. The sorbet was good, but I didn't even finish the rest of the dessert.. . I'm glad I tried Spago for DineLA because I wouldn't have wanted to pay full price for that meal. Then again, I didn't even think that meal was worth the DineLA price. Not even the service could save this review since our waitress was kind of cunty.. . And finally, the decor inside is hideous. HIDEOUS. And dated. I mean, what the fuck is with the trout paintings on the wall? And the glass panels with swirly sperm-looking things on the ceiling... my god. So wrong.
