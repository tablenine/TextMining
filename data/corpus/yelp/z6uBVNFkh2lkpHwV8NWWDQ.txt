Mmmm sushi buffet + crepes? Haaail yeah. I love coming here and stuffing my face. Esp with the crepes. I'm obsessed with them. I hate how it's so cold here though! I guess it's to keep the fish fresh? Anywho, I come here on a 3-week interval basis and lubbb it. Sometimes the sushi isn't as fresh as it COULD be but no worries, I'll gobble it up anyway.
