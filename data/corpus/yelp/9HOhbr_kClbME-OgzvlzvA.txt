Restaurant: Sushi Go 55
Category: Sushi Bars
I tried Sushi Go 55 just out of convenience for the first time and loved it!  I wanted to get sushi in J-town, but didn't want to hassle with trying to find parking.  So I remember there was this place in the deader than dead Little Tokyo Mall (I call it Mitsuwa Plaza).  But to my surprise, the sushi here is excellent!   The fish is fresh, and the price is right.. . I'd much rather eat here than Sushi-Gen which is just a zoo during lunch.  I thought this was my little secret gem of Little Tokyo, but based on the number of reviews here, It's not a secret at all.
