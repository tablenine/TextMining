How did I live a mere 12 minutes from Porto's most of my life and never go there until I moved across the country? I even worked nearby it for months! *cries* What is wrong with me? How could I have considered myself a true piggy before my taste buds discovered Porto's? . .                                   OINK!.              .-^------^-.     / .            /                  \      .                  o.  .o       9    .            \      (@)      /             .              ' _ '----' _ '               . . Luckily, this faux pas has been rectified. And I've finally tried Porto's.. . I can easily see myself screaming for Porto's papas rellenas, but in English. Who wouldn't love to just hear me belt out "POTATO BALLLLLLLLZ!!!!" randomly? I would do it too if it got me one on demand. Mashed potatoes with seasoned ground beef in the center, breaded, and fried for only 90 cents? Oh how I heart you, potato balls! This just goes to show that you don't need a lot to make yourself happy, because if these balls don't make you happy, I don't know what will.. .      POTATO BALLS + CUBAN TAMALE*.               /    ____   .    O O         ____ . . I also sampled a relatively new addition to their menu - the Cuban tamale ($2.05). The masa that they use comes out smoother and moister than most tamales that I've had. You don't even need any sauce. Yep - that's how amazing it is. It was a very happy last minute choice on my part. Get it!. . I split the pan con lechon sandwich with my lunch date (my mommy!). It consists of slow roasted pork, mojo garlic sauce, and grilled onions on grilled Cuban bread. The pork is super tender and not at all dried out while being flavorful and still allowing you to taste the garlic sauce. Honestly, it's probably one of the best sandwiches I've had - ever.. . There are so many more things I need to get the next time I'm in LA - the cheese rolls being one of them. I had planned to go to the bakery side, but by the time I was done with lunch, my happy tummy barely allowed me to waddle myself to the car, let alone think about getting more food.. . ----------. * Next time, I should forgo taking photos with my iPhone and just make little ASCII pictures of my food. Think it does it justice?
