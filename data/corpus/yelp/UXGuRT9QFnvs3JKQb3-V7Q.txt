good beer, good food, good atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, whats not to like?. . well... maybe~ the steep prices... but for awesome get-you-drunk-with-only-3 beers, $8/beer isnt too shabby.. . and, because of my partial pescatarian ways (doesnt it totally sound like i made that term up? haha, maybe), i opted NOT to get the burger *GASP* i know. shame on me. ill be back to try it one day.. . i did indulge in some fine beers, sweet potato fries (AWESOME when hot), and a special of the day - oysters. . . it ALMOST reminds me of wurstkuche, but a bit more chill and not as crazy loud. id definitely go again, but probably not on the weekend. im sure it gets crazy crowded.
