Arrived early evening Sunday, just before the rush. We were seated immediately, a nice surprise. The looks of the place are pleasing even in the bright daylight, but it was designed for the night. I loved the hood ornament lamps. My biggest quibble - it was very warm, despite being in the middle of the restaurant. Our server tried to explain it was just summer in Atlanta, but , c'mon, fix the AC! Lost a star for it! Service was crisp, the potato chips and bleu cheese are great. They had a special 30th anniversary 3-course prix-fixe menu available, so I ordered that, and my wife ordered the fried chicken. My salad had Green Goddess dressing which I havent seen since childhood, but was excellent. The crab cake was superb. The main dish was a pan-fried chicken breast with marsala &amp; mushroom sauce and accompanied by the most delicious side I can remember having- mushroom and leek bread pudding. This was spectacularly good all by itself and paired with the chicken was a true food "moment." My wife's fried chicken was similarly tasty with competent sides of collards and mac &amp; cheese. She kept trying to steal the bread pudding but Â I was able to defend with my steak knife. We finished with the white chocolate banana cream pie. It was very good, but didn't knock my socks off. The coffee was great. Our server, Georgia, was excellent. I have to disagree with the lukewarm reviews. This place gave us a memorable evening with a reasonable bill. Just cool it down a bit.
