Loved it.  Not necessarily the most aesthetic pleasing building on the exterior, the inside was cool, spacious and fun.  Lots of areas to park it or mingle before you commit to a location.  The drinks were plentiful and not the usual thimble of liquor.  The food was excellent, tapas-style dinning.  The food is served hot and quick.  The portions were mostly adequate as tapas go, but the quality was excellent.
