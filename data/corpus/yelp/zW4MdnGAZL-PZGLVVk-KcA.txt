Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Near the 134 fwy, on Colorado Blvd. situated next to one of the coolest bar in town, The Chalet...this pizza joint rocks!  I went here with 2 other friends and we shared a thin crispy crust medium pepperoni pizza and each had a Moretti beer the bill came out to $18, just $6 and change per person including tip!  What cheap eats!  The atmosphere was very friendly and I got the vibe of many loyal patrons. This place seemed to fill up quickly so I suggest making reservations if you're with a big party.  . . Reservations are taken for parties of 6 -16 persons max.  They are closed Sun &amp; Mon.  Tues - Thurs 4PM-12AM, Fri &amp; Sat 4PM-1AM
