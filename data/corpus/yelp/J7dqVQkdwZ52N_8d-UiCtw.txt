Restaurant: Doughboys Cafe
Category: Bakeries
New location, same food. Stopped by here while I was on 3rd and had a late night dinner.. . New location is better than old doughboys, looks more cafe like and legit. Plenty of outdoor seating, indoors is fairly small but cozy. Ordered my favorite "the monster," noticed they took out the gruyere cheese and replaced it with swiss but nothing else has really changed much.. . Recommended if you're trolling on 3rd and can't find anyplace open late night. Prices are fair, portions are freaking huge, can't go wrong.
