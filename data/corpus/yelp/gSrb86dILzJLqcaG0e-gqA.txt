Five Stars in the summer with the rooftop patio.   It is like a beer garden with great views!  There is no food on the rooftop patio, though downstairs they have fresh brewed beer, great food, and appetizers.  JUMBO PRETZELS ARE AWESOME HERE!  . . This is probably my favorite Rock Bottom location in America.
