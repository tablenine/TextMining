this is the place to get the best 'pan de reyes'!!!! If you know what it is then read on if not... then read on! Anywhos, if you grew up Catholic and Hispanic then you know the greatness that is 'pan de reyes' - its sweet, soft, and has a lil baby jesus somewhere in it. Well Portos has the best pan de reyes in terms of size (it comes in small and large-i suggest getting the large one for a family of 7 or more), the price (very inexpensive compared to other bakeries like Adelita which totally take advantage of being one of the only bakeries that sell it) and most importantly...the taste is just unbeatable!!! On the day of 'dia de los reyes' I was waiting in line to buy this awesome bread only to find out that the lady in front of me had just purchased the last two. But the girl told me that if I could just wait 30 min or so they would let me know when the fresh batch was done cooking. I'm so glad I waited! The bread was still very hot when they gave it to me and I didn't have to wait in line! The large size fed not only my parents, myself and the boyfriend but my uncle and cousins and there was still some left! :)
