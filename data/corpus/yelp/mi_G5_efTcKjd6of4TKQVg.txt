Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
There are lots of hot dog combinations to try but neither the dogs nor the chili were that great. The line was about an hour the day we went and really was not worth it. However, the staff was friendly and I guess it was one of the LA must-dos. I think it's more about the scene and location than the actual food.
