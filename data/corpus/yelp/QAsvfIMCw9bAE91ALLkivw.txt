Restaurant: AMC Fork &amp; Screen
Category: American (Traditional)
the former AMC Backlot just got a big renovation and now its called AMC Fork and Screen. . . first of all, and i do have a better way to say this... i really hate the chairs... they had replaced the chairs with leather office chairs... yes you read it right... those are office chairs! and i can tell you this chairs are not comfortable... i guess it makes some sense when these chairs are good for you to have your food on the table... but i feel like i am sitting in my office and my laptop is replaced with a big silver screen... :S and in no time i am adjusting myself every five mins, turning the chair from side to side while distracting people at the back the whole time. . now the food... there were some changes but most of the food are quite similar.. they used very very good description on the menu, but dont expect your food to match the description... . . here is my example: . Margarita Flatbread . Hand pulled flatbread "piled high" with Mozzarella and Provolone cheeses, fresh Roma tomato slices and fresh basil. Served with a Balsamic vinaigrette. $9.29 . . and what i got:. An oval shaped chewy Margherita pizza with not enough cheese, and not enough tomato. It didn't come with vinaigrette and i dont even know you are suppose to put yeast in the dough for flatbread!!! and on top of that, even i can make a better pizza than this!. . i am normally an easy-going person, and for the price that i pay, i expected better... i'll stay with my good 'o popcorn n soda next time.. if i could stay in the chair through the whole movie!
