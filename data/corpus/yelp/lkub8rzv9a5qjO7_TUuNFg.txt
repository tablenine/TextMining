Wisteria is so tasty!  It's a gorgeous little restaurant, and the food is impeccably cooked.  Our server was so helpful, too.. . The entrees we chose included the skatefish, ahi tuna, and three meat ragout.  The skatefish was cooked perfectly and tasted buttery over grits and asparagus.  The ahi was seared just right and served with broccollini and wasabi dumplings.  The ragout was suprising - a combination of beef, pork and veal in a rich stew of pasta, tomatoes, and vegetables. I could eat this over and over again!
