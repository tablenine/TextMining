I used to really love this place as it was my go-to place after a long night of drinking too much. They have great cheese burgers and I love the onion rings, I'd like to review the other food but honestly I've never had anything else (and I've been here a lot). The beer garden is great, it's pretty large for the city and you wouldn't know you were right on Broadway. A word of warning, the squirrels are vicious Rogers Parks squirrels and are not afraid of anyone or anything, I actually saw one run down someones arm and steal food off their plate. . . One thing I am slightly disappointed about is the lighting. As anyone who has been going there for a while knows Moody's is DARK and I mean really dark. As I said before a great place to go when you are hungover. Sadly, the last few times we have been there it was almost well lit. We sat where we normally sit (in the back by the fireplace) and for the first time my wife could actually read the signs on the restroom doors, way too bright. . . The service is always good and the beer is drinkable. All in all I really like this place. . . BTW they only take cash.
