pretty pretty pretty good.  This is more of a place for true foodies (it's a little lost on me because I'm not all-in for the flavored foam and all that crap that's a requirement for the trendy spots) BUT the environment is really cool-- beautifully designed, and open view of the kitchen (and it's not a divey spot so it's not one of those situations where you're better off not knowing what's up in the kitchen)  . . This is also one of the few places (in the US) that serves Jidori chicken--and if you tend to get a little skeezed out about meat, as I do--it's really the safest, cleanest way to go.  cool article in the NYTimes about it pretty recently . . . http://www.nytimes.com.... . . with a hilarious picture of these chickens looking all happy and snuggly with the guy who owns the farm (ignorance is bliss, i guess). . they buttermilk steam it here and it's delish. . great cocktail menu and beignets for dessert-ch-ch-ch-check it out!
