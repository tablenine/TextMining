So on occasion, my office has ordered from Gingergrass for our "free lunch days". I've never really had any complaints about the food I've tried from here. Actually, this is one of the few places where everyone in the office agrees on. So therefore, I decided that this place would be a good dinner spot to celebrate my husbands 30th with Dinner and then drinks across the street at Cha Cha's.. .  The wait staff was VERY friendly. They accommodated our semi large group rather quickly. Everyone in our group managed to find something that sounded appetizing to them, being that some peeps are scared to venture outside of the normal realms of Mexican, Italian and American fare. . . So then the food...it was delicious. Not one of us disliked anything that we got that night. I had the cold tofu noodle bowl. I'm not usually a huge cold noodle fan, but it was perfect. My hubby got the shrimp dish and LOVED it. I heard good stuff about the pork chops and the shaking beef. Overall everyone gave this place a thumbs up. I will definitely be coming back here again.
