Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I've been here a handful of times, and as ridiculous it first seemed to eat a HUGE plate of TWO classic heart-stoppers combined and still walk out alive, I was sold.. . I think what really got me was the golden-cinnamony perfection of the waffles.  Waffles are a scary thing to order in restaurants, for they are oftentimes hard and crispy.  So yes, I'm a waffle fan.  Maybe with a little bit of chicken.
