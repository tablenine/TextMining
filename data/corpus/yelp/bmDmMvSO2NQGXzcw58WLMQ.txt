Restaurant: The Old Oak Tap
Category: Bars
Shoutout to Kristina B. and Olia H. for suggesting this place for dinner!  . . Life changing items on the menu:. 1. Fish tacos . 2. Sriracha wings and the wasabi-esque dipping sauce.  . . I have yet to come across good fish tacos in Chicago.  I've only had luck out on either of the coasts.  But Old Oak Tap impressed me and I would probably get them again!  It was the right combo of cabbage, sauce, and fish.  So effin' good! The portion size is just right, too (3 for $9).  . . Now these wings - whoever thought of these was a pure genius.   Sweet and spicy in the same bite! Oh so delicious!  The wasabi-ginger aioli was like heaven.  I wanted to take a container of it home with me.  Ask my dining companions; I'm pretty sure I was raving about that sauce for 10 minutes.. . We also thought the beer flights ($8) were cool.  I don't really like beer, but I was intrigued by these flighs for some reason.  . . Our server was fun and friendly(she was all about making suggestions for beers), but busy!   It looked like she had to take care of half the tables!  It was waaay packed on a Friday night, so I'm glad we came early enough to snag a table.. . The space is nicely decorated and trendy, but you still get a cozy vibe from the place.  It does get pretty loud, so I felt like I was shouting across the table at some points.  All-in-all, I really enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the service!  Can't wait for the warmer months so I can try out their outdoor seating....
