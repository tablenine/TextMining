My husband and I went to Mastro's for this first time this past weekend to celebrate his birthday and I was very impressed! The service is top notch and the food is INCREDIBLE. As many many others have mentioned in previous reviews, the lobster mashed potatoes and the warm butter cake are absolutley AMAZING. The lobster mashed are pretty pricey ($33!) but they are definitely worth it. We can't wait to go back and try more!
