I don't remember exactly what I ordered but it was some type of sushi and soup (miso?) that was filling. I also had a cold green colored drink that I assume was green tea or some type of imitation. The place was packed when we went so its popularity is immediately obvious. The food that I ordered was okay but I'm sure there are much better items on the menu.
