Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
"Operating under the unique service concept of espeto corrido, which translates from Portuguese as "continuous service," Fogo de Cho satisfies palates and the desire for something original. Instead of ordering from a traditional menu, Fogo de Cho offers a prix-fixe system where guests can sample the entire menu, or just focus on their favorite items.. . The lunch and dinner menu features unlimited servings of 15 different delectable cuts of fire-roasted meats, a sumptuous buffet of gourmet salads and fresh-cut vegetables, and a variety of Brazilian side dishes.". . This is what the legendary restaurant Fogo de Chao in Beverly Hills promised us. And baby, did it ever deliver. 5/5 stars without a doubt. Too bad I can't give it 6/5 stars (but Jack Bauer can). It's all-you-can-eat of some of the most delicious cuts of meat this side of the Atlantic. The service is top-notch - all the waiters were knowledgeable and any one of them was willing to help you out. The green/red card system is unique and, though basic in technological standards, works extremely well. And a college student like myself definitely did not belong there. But dammit, we went and we ate that shit and we loved it. I won't be eating any meat for the next week or so.
