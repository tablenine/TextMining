Mmm, delicious! Even the fries were good, and I'm kinda picky when it comes to a good fry. But their fries + their chipotle aioli sauce = yum! . . As for the sausages, we tried about 6 kinds. I knew going in that the alligator would probably be tough, having spoken to people who had eaten alligator before, and, yep, it was by far the toughest of them all. I would skip it, unless you're purely curious. Still good, though; it was kind of like eating an overcooked sausage or something. Personally, the ones with rabbit were my favorite. Though to be honest, while all the different kinds were good, they didn't really particularly taste like any specific kind of animal. . . I'm not sure that really matters though. It's just like eating a physical manifestation of yummy.  And now that I think about it, I'm not even sure normal sausages taste like any particular animal either. I suspect it's only through trial-and-error association that the brain develops the ability to distinguish a beef hot dog from a pork one more accurately beyond, "Hey, this is different!". . Anyway. One downside. If you're hungry, one dog probably won't do it. And two for yourself will definitely push you to around $13+, before sides and drinks. Also, the ice cream sandwich is surprisingly small for $5, but it is good. But the beer selection seems nice, hailing from Belgium, Germany, and domestic. . . Seating can be pretty limited when busy, but you won't know that until after you order your food (so, here's a tip, send someone into the dining area first. It's past the long hallway), and they like to keep the dining area "hipster dark" to the point that I saw people whip out their mobiles to use as flashlights to see what they were eating, prompting employees to offer to raise the lights, circumventing the whole original point.
