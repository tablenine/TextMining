There is usually a wait, and a substantial one at that. It's good for you though, since it will give you more room in your tummy for ramen and pork.. . Get the gyoza. Get the Daikoku ramen. If you're feeling really REALLY hungry, the combos are a great deal (Eel? Tuna? Katsudon? Check!). Get the iced green tea.. . The first time we ventured to Daikokuya, we were in the process of unpacking all of our worldly possessions at our new home when hunger struck. Time had flown by while unpacking and it was already 9pm. Where the heck are we going to eat now? A little (and I mean very little) research later and we were on our way to Daikokuya. That was the best uninformed decision we'd ever made... We just happened to eat one of the most comforting, delicious, cheap foods ever.. . Daikoku ramen is my go-to feel better food.
