Come here EARLY or else there will be a long line. We got here right after it opened for lunch and was lucky cuz the place was happening when we left. We decided to try a bit of everything: . . Salad: Although the greens weren't much to write home about (just shredded iceberg lettuce and some stalks of julienned carrots I believe ) but their dressing is soooo savory! I love the salad dressing from most Japanese restaurants but this one had that extra kick to it...big onion flavor! Unlike anything I've ever had before. Apparently they don't sell it in individual bottles anymore so if you want some, you'll have to have it in store. . . Small chicken egg bowl: Typical donburi with egg and chicken and on the sweet side, how I like it. . . Gyoza: Was pretty typical. Nothing extraordinary but still good. . . Daikoku Ramen: Great soup base. The noodles could've been thicker and chewier but I still slurped up my bowl like no other. I did feel like they were a bit skimpy on the ingredients and my bf noted that the pork slices were on the thin side (they have nothing on Santa!). . . I'd come here again but my ramen favorites still reside in NorCal.
