Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I always enjoy this place.  The service is very good and dinner is always an experience.  The prime rib carts are unique and the food is delicious.  I love the people watching here as you see A-listers and a few B-listers here.  I'm a Lawry's VIP Rewards member and membership does have its rewards.  If you've never been, go.  You won't regret it.
