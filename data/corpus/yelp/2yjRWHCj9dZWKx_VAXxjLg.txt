Restaurant: Uncle Bill&#39;s Pancake House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
An absolute institution!! . . What's great: the pancakes, the people, the green chile and jack cheese omlette, Mitch's Scramble.... . It's not fancy and it's difficult on the weekends with more than two people to get a table quickly if you arrive after 9am...but for those willing to come early (easy with young kids), it's a great time. Service can be hit or miss but if you are local and regular, it's always fine.
