Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Boo ya! I like this place, mainly because Mama likes meat.  This place is seriously so freaking inexpensive for all of the food you get.  I have not been to many Korean BBQ places so I don't have much to compare it to, but I think it's pretty fun eating a motherload of meat.. . I prefer the beef items to other meats, but that is just me. The BBQ beef is delicious, it's like it is marinated in something sweet.  The kimchi is decent, although I don't really go for that stuff. I like the potato cake thing they give you right away.. . The reason I rate this 4 not 5 stars is because you totally stink like meat when you leave, and the dining area is very basic, if not kind of low budget.
