Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
This gets one extra star for being in my neighborhood. It's perhaps the finest restaurant in perhaps the finest city in America. I've tried a few things and  they are all good. The best is the fish and chips. It's so good and it's healthy for you because it is fish, right? and potatoes. . . The best onion rings I've ever tasted come from here. And the best trout I've ever had in an L.A. restaurant also.. . This place is always busy with hip people but it's not a nauseating crowd in any way because it's Culver City, where normal people work and  live. . . It's in the beautiful downtown area and it's great to sit in the patio, eat and drink and look how pretty our downtown is. It's one of the only places open late here.. . It is owned by Ben Ford, son of beloved actor Harrison Ford. He works his ass off in this restaurant in one of those chef outfits. You have to give him credit for that. If I was Harrison Ford's son, I wouldn't cook food for anybody. This place is not cheap though. It's just good.
