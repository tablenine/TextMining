If I ever move too far away to consider this my neighborhood bar, it will be a sad day. . . The food is reasonably priced, and the week night specials are really good deals. I tend to stick to a few things that are my favorites, but I've been coming here long enough to have tried 90% of the menu, and have never had a bad meal. I've had a few average meals, but even those were cases of getting exactly what you would expect when you order a (fill in the blank). The steak sandwich is particularly good, the wings are good (order them crispy), as is the barbecue chicken quesadilla. The salads are huge, and I favor the chicken Caesar... I could go on. Like I said - I've eaten everything here at one point or another.. . The drinks are decent prices, and they've got a good selection of beer, though it's not the Map Room or anything. I love the staff, and sometimes they love you back if you're nice. Drink specials nightly - which includes weekends - are worth remembering. And the patio is a reason in itself to come here in the summer.. . Seriously - one of the best patios in the city. Large and accommodating, this is where you want to be on a Sunday afternoon with a beer. See you there.
