How about a sign before I try to rip open the wrong door!. . This is what one patron told the spandex clad hostess upon entering.  I suffered the same fate,  as did most people entering this establishment.  There is a big wide side walk that leads right to a door you can not enter,  yes it states this,  but when you are freezing your ass off you tend to get tunnel vision.. . I twisted my self into a chair at the bar,  addly positioned at the corner making it quite awkward for the servers to pass.  Had a nice Fat tire 60 minute,  before meeting my friend for dinner.. . We ordered a burger,  and the andoui,  bacon, avocado sandwich.  One with salad and one with fries,  all the food was quite good,  although quite daunting to finish after a couple of pints.  The wings smelled quite good although they were a bit pricey.  When I ordered my burger I thought that the price was a little high,  but its not,  good quality ingredients,  nicely presented.. . The room,  how do I say this?  A mish mosh,  looks as if they took over a space and decorated on the cheep,  which would be fine if there wasn't dry wall compound and paint splashed all over the exposed ductwork,  or the gouges in the wall that need to be touched up.  The very high ceilings with hanging light fixtures look out of place,  the faux shades on the faux windows don't work with anything but the out of place lights.  Normally I don't take note of a space like this,  but I found it quite odd and distracting.. . Very good eats,  very good beer selection,  decent service,  but the room is awkward.
