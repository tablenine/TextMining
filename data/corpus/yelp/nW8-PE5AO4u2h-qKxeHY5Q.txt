Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
i really am not a fan of mexican food - too heavy for my stomach and too many combos i don't enjoy, well and the fact that it is in NO way healthy! but i do enjoy de cero...and here's why:. . - the drinks: the margs are great (passion fruit &amp; pineapple are my favs). - the chips: greasy as hell and salted. - the salsa verde: not so hot, lots of flavor. - the mini tacos: like mexican tapas, you can try a few without getting bored of your entree. - the corn tamale: tastes like cornbread and the crema that it comes with, is lactose intolerance's enemy...love it!. . it's great for a group, and it's usually pretty reasonable, except of course - if you keep ordering pitcher after pitcher, it will add up! seating is a little tight, but it's a busy restaurant and i'd rather it be busy than not, since that's a good indicator of the food and service.. . one con: i did have a weird encounter with a host one time. we got there for our early reservation (hardly anyone was seated in the main room, there were plenty of tables open) and since we were waiting on 2 people to come, they wouldn't seat us without our full party. which is a drag since there were lonely tables waiting for our butts to grace them. he also asked if we were going to the bulls game and i said that 2 people were, but they didn't need to get to the game on time. he said "so you'll be out of here by 7 then, you'll have to be for the bulls game." and i repeated myself again, "they are not trying to get to the game on time." and then he asked again "are you going to be done by 7?" i answered,"i'm not sure?" then i walked away because he was annoying me and i felt like he was trying to get us in and out of the restaurant. hello, we made a reservation, we're not trying to be "fit in" so lay off, buddy!
