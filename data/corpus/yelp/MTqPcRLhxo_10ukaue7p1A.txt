I can't understand the popularity of Baoguette's sandwiches.  I've eaten from their first location, and walked into their St. Mark's location last night.  Their pate sandwich is fine, but I've had better in Chinatown.   The chicken in my BBQ chicken sandwich was tender but bland, and the sprigs of cilantro didn't add much flavor.   The popular catfish sandwich is the tastiest item on the menu, but I also found it lacking in flavor.  To its credit, the bread is always fresh, but I find it too chewy.  That and the excessive amount of filling make for a dense sandwich with little flavor, not what I expect from a Vietnamese sandwich.   I'm all for modern Vietnamese food, but where's the taste? I'd rather head to Paris Sandwich in Chinatown, where they serve both traditional and updated versions of the Vietnamese sandwich.
