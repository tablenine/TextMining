I didnt like their fries and our waitress hhad more nvested in her conversation than serving us. plus the burger was just ok and the drinks were too small (at least the one i had, then again i have big hands). but considering this was the first time id actually een there to actually eat food its still a great place. love the outpoor patio and the candle effect,
