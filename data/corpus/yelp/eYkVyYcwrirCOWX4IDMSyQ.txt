As a vegetarian, I love coming here for lunch because it's one of the few places I can go with my coworkers and not feel like a retarded stepchild with "special" eating habits.. . The raw salad and vegan salad are excellent. They have a nice selection of naturalish beverages and also have beer and wine.. . The atmosphere is light and airy, although I'd advise against sitting at the big table in front because you'll end up with tree leaves in your food. . . My only big gripe and what keeps me from giving it 5 stars is their overly agressive bus staff. The minute you sit down they want to take your tray out from under you food, even before you have a chance to set it down. They do the same with your plates, as soon as they resemble being empty. Even if you ask them to wait and not take your tray, they'll stand there and grab it anyway. This happens EVERY time.. . It's smallish, so having a group of more than 4 or 5 gets hectic. Better for parties of 4 or less.. . Luckily their food is good, so I keep going back even though I don't like obtrusive people harshing my lunch.
