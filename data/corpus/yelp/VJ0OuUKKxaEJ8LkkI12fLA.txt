BEST PLACE EVER!! Their enchiladas are slap-yo-mama fantastic! I seriously cant eat any other enchilada because they dont compare to R.F.D's. Their tempe and tofu filling is amazing. Along side with their spanish rice....i can eat all day. Their spinach fettuccine and "meatballs" are really good too. I dont do cakes and pastries, but i can eat and love their cakes. Vegan organic strawberry chocolate cake....OOOOOH MAN! You get super full AND not feel guilty about it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
