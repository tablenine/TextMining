I'd give it 3.5 stars, but you get the idear.. . For me, I could eat mexican food daily.  No shit?  No shit.  I love the stuff.  Specifically, the chips and salsa.  If you've got a good salsa, I'm hooked.  As others have said, the decor is amazing/out of this world/cool atmosphere etc.  But that does not a good restaurant make.  Or something like that.. . The salsa was pretty damn good compared to most other mexican eateries.  Smoky, roasted, chipotle, goodness.  However, it needed some salt!  Which is really odd for me, as I don't use extra salt on ANYTHING.  So salt the salsa I did, and it was great.. . As for my meal, I've never had fried chicken tacos before, and it was pretty good!  The chipotle cream was a nice touch, and 3 tacos for $9 was way too much food, ugh!  After 2, I was stuffed...the beans had a great flavor as well.  My man got the mixed fajitas, and while his portions were kinda lacking in a typical fajita, the flavor was on point.  $14 for them was a little steep.. . Overall, it wasn't amazing, but one of the better mexican places in ATL. I know one thing for sure:  If I go back, I'm ABSOLUTELY ordering a pitcher of margaritas; the pitcher they're served in is a BATSHIT CRAZY glass sculpture.  Looks like good times.
