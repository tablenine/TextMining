Came back for a friends birthday party and Belly Shack couldn't have been more accomodating. There were 10 of us, about 5 bottles of wine, a big cake, and 3 hours of us taking up the middle table.  They were really great. Chef Kim was there, bringing food out to the table, hustling around.  Really a great experience and we didn't feel rushed or bothered.  As we were leaving, the kitchen guys and servers were eating a shift meal together, so we gave them the rest of our cupcakes as a thank you for being so great. . . Really, I left very pleased.
