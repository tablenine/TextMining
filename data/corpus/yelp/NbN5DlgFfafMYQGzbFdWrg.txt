Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
pros: hainanese chicken rice is superb and addicting(photo above). $6.50 take-out price, $6.25 dine-in price. portions for entrees are very generous. ginger sauce will tickle your palate, in a good way.. . cons: restaurant is literally a sardine can, take-out is highly recommended. parking can be time consuming. if you are a trooper and decided to dine-in, expect a line.
