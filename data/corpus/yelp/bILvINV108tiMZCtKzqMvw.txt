Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
I hail from Kansas City, and every time I come to Chitown I make sure to hit up some Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Co.  God, this place is GOOD.. . My favorite meal here is the Mediterranean flat-bread and a salad, plus wine of course.  The flat-bread is easily one of the best breads I've eaten in my entire life.  No exaggeration.. . I'm actually not a fan of their pot pie pizzas.  So shoot me.  . . You'll have to wait here, and my suggestion is to get there as close to open as possible, cuz it fills up friggin fast.  Also come starving, cuz your tummy will fill up quick, too!. . So.  Damn.  Good.
