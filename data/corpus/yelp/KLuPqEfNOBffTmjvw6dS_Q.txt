I love this place, I have be grateful that every time I gone. There has been no line. At first I was a little spectacle about only one type of ramen noodles. But after having it, I could tell why. The pork was succulent; the broth went down like water. I've tried different ramen before and this tops them all. Don't take my word or any of the 514 reviews, try it your self.
