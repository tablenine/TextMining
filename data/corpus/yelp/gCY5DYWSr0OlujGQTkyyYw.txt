I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT! It is so authentic and the owner, Al, is super nice and loyal to his customers. I remember the very first time I went to Al's and thinking that it looked a little sketchy...this was pre-yelp days and when Al's had just opened up. It did not have a bar or barely a table but I remember the wonderful service and the AMAZING food!. . I was able to relive that moment when I brought my boyfriend and friend for their first experience. I really enjoyed seeing their expressions and enjoying the atmosphere that Al had created since my first time.. . The food is so authentic and you can see it with the preparation and presentation. Huge portions and very fresh. It is also very reasonably priced! I gave it 4 stars because of he parking...there is none. Other than that, you must stop in and say hi to Al. Become one of his loyal customers...he treats you well! . . Thank you Al for always making my experience like the first one.
