My friend and I happened upon this places (yes, I went there *by accident*) when we were scared away from the crowds oozing out of Sea (friend: "a rat couldn't get in there"... not quite classy, but descriptive enough). . . So we walked down the street and came upon a strange door in the wall My friend let me know that he heard this was a decent restaurant and we decided to dine here instead.. . The most impressive part about this restaurant was the ambiance... it was just rather amazing. The individual rooms that we sat in were perfect for two and were separated by straw screens. You "sort of" see who's next to you but there's still enough privacy for you to chat freely. The pebbled path to the bathroom was a nice touch and the service was wonderful. The waiters were so nice and were there just the right amount to be helpful but not disruptive.. . We got the seasonal omakase two person tasting menu and the food was quite nice. I wouldn't say it's stellar. I have to say it's rather bland compared to Sugiyama, but they are aesthetically pleasing and generally satisfying. We didn't have anything to drink, which would had been extra. Portions were small but enough to fill. I'd say if you are dying for your first omakase experience but don't want to break your wallet and Williamsburg is convenient, this place is a good start. Like I said, the ambiance is absolutely wonderful. I probably won't be coming back though, since I'm rather picky with my omakase....
