Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I've never been to the restaurant, but I was at a party where Jerry's catered, and it was fantastic. I tried two sandwiches - the Baba R (peanut butter, apples, basil, and chipotle chutney) which was awesome and had a bit of a thai kick, and one of the blackened chicken sandwiches (not sure which one it was after looking at the menu, but it was awesome and they all sound good, so I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong). . . They also had the hummus and pita bread (I'm not sure if it was deep fried pita or what, but it was amazing - it tasted like the shell part of a crab rangoon at a Chinese restaurant, just without the filling inside), so I highly recommend that. . . I had never had Jerry's prior to this party, but now that I've had it, I can't wait to go in and get some more - my only problem will be deciding whether to go with something I know is good and I've had before, or trying something else (which I'm sure will be great). It'll probably take me an hour to decide from their huge list of choices, but if that's the only drawback that's fine by me!
