Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
The fried chicken tacos and fish tacos are soooooooooo good. That's all I get when I come here. i can always find a parking space easily when I come here, which is great considering the location. Only thing I don't like is that it's always crowded, and I have to wait awhile to get seated. Â I like the spin the wheel game they play at the top of every hour. If the wheel stops at your number you get something free off the menu. I haven't won yet.
