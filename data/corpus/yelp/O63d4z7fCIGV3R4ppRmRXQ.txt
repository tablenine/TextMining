Restaurant: Front Page News
Category: Cajun/Creole
I've been to the Front Page News in Little Five Points before going to Variety Playhouse, but the one in Midtown is by far my favorite.  The location is perfect for a night out on the town or just a cool lunch spot with some good people watching.  You honestly cannot beat the patio...very large, garden like feel with fountain in the middle. Sounds fancy, but it's really laid back.  The restaurant is right in the mix of bars, clubs and restaurants in the heart of midtown.. The food is always great and I just love their wraps. They have a pretty extensive drink menu so you've got lots to choose from! . Supposedly they have some pretty good bands that play on the weekends, but I haven't heard them yet.  Need to fit that in my schedule sometime soon :). Fun, cool atmosphere with great food!
