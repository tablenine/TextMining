This is one of the best restaurants I have ever visited. The food is amazing and the views are spectacular. I have been to restaurants with views this good, but the food was not that great. This place has great food! After reading other reviews, I saw that a lot of people complained about the prices, but what do you expect when you go to a fancy place in Hollywood Heights? The prices are pretty comparable to Roy's or Houstons, but those places in Los Angeles don't come with a view like here. We started off with the rice cracker coated chicken with crispy potato ribbons and apple slaw. That was amazing! For dinner, I got the braised short ribs with white truffle polenta and roasted root vegetables. My fiance got the Asian BBQ babyback ribs. We both did not need knives because the meat was so tender. The polenta was well seasoned and the vegetables were perfectly cooked. My fiance's ribs came with sweet mashed potatoes and 5 spice corn bread. We both loved our food. The portions were big and I couldn't finish, so I brought home my leftovers. I will definitely come back in the future!!
