Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
I am absolutely disgusted by this establishment. Not with the drinks, but with the questionable practices towards African-Americans of the doorman. I have visited Lola's on two separate occasions and both times I have experienced what appears to be racism. The first time, a male friend and I were told it was guest list only and we could not come in. However, no list was seen. The second time was last night. . It was 9pm and my co worker decided to meet our 3 male friends for drinks. The two of us walked in (there was no doorman), grabbed a table and ordered drinks. Ten minutes later, our friends arrived but were stopped at the door. The man at the door told them they could not get in because it was a private party inside. Having been inside, I knew he was lying. He then proceeded to tell our friends multiple stories ranging from "your not on the guest list," "Its a private party," I cant let guys in after 9," to "We are at capacity." Lola's had about 50 people inside, no where near capacity, he did not have a list in his hand, and there was no X Mas party going on. . My friend and I decided to go outside and find out what the real reason was. The doorman told us they have a guest list only policy after 9pm. I told him he was lying because he doesn't even have a list in his hand and I said that because he keeps changing up his story, it looks suspect. . My girlfriend came right out and accused him of being racist. He just shrugged his shoulders and said OK, call it what you want!!! I could not believe he was admitting to being racist. I told him that he should be ashamed of himself because we are producers, publicist, and real estate investors and have just as much money and class as anyone else. I fully plan on going to the media with this. In this day and age, racism should not and will not be tolerated!
