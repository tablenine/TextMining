Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
The good: the starters, mozarella bar stuff and the desserts.  . . The bad: the pastas, the noise level, valet parking. . The standouts at this place has to be the starters - almost eveyrthing form the mozarella bar is fantastic and definitely get the grilled octopus.  The desserts are tasty as well.  . . This is an italian restaurant but the pastas are way too salty the 3 times i've been here.  off the top of my head i remembered the orichette and amatricana as being salty. . . try finding street parking if not pay up the $8 for valet.  call me cheap but $8 can get me another glass of wine or a dessert so i'd rather use it on that than having some guy park my car god knows where.  . . This place is deafening.  definitely not a place to take a date unless you guys don't want to talk to each other.  reservations are highly recommended unless you want to try getting a seat at the bar.
