LA is full of great breakfast places, but this is my favorite.  Everything I've had there is good, but I'll focus on the lox plate.  It's the best I've ever had.  They get their salmon smoked by an artisan who's only client is a high end casino in vegas (belagio? can't remember).  Also, the chef/owner is a super sweet guy and takes care of his customers like a beloved uncle.  You have to root for a place with dedicated regulars like this.  I hope their liquor license comes through and they can turn into a 3 meal force to be reckoned with.  They have a real dedication to interesting, well made food.
