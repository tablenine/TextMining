A friend introduced me to this place and I loved it so much I had to come here immediately and bookmark it for future reference. . . First and foremost, let me start off with the fried plantains. They're delicious! I ordered the Marsala marinated chicken that was ever-so-tender with yummy seasoned white rice, black beans, and yucca powder (The powder was a bit foreign to me).. . Overall, bravo! I'm coming back here again!
