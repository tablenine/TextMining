This place gets 3 stars from me purely from their Wonton Napoleon.  It's layers upon layers of all my favorite things!!!  Hmm, how to describe?  Each layer of crispy wonton has a new flavor mixed in.  I couldn't decide which layer I liked best?  The tuna, salmon and avocados, and japanese pickled ginger - OH BOY!. . I also ordered the waiter's recommended salmon - well, it was decent, but not something I would expect at Feast.  It was a real disappointment.  The salmon was beautiful but it was slathered in bbq sauce and just ruined it completely.  This is something I might expect at Chili's or TGI Friday's.. . I'd come back to chill with friends in the summer on their patio and for their wonton napoleon.
