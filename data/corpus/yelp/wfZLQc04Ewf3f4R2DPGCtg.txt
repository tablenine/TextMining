fried chicken with waffles?!?  ah...are you sure?  seems like a weird combination...almost as weird as pickles and ice cream.  but hey, roscoe's is a roscoe's for a reason.  . . and come on, if you throw in some collard greens (my fav!), i'm all over it.  so had my serving of fried chicken, waffles, collard greens, with rice and gravy and a biscuit.  i sound like a pig but i come to roscoe's like twice a year...so i need to get my year's worth in during these visits.  . . all i can say is that roscoe's has one of the best (if not the BEST!)  fried chicken...nothing like what the greaseballs they serve up at the colonel's.  and pair this with crispy waffles with maple syrup...hmm...it's heaven!  whoever thought of combining these two was ingenious - love you, love you, love you!
