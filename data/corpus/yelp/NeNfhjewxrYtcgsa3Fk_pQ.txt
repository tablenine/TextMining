I go to Ru Sans once every few months, last weekend I went with a friend bc I had been craving sushi for the whole week before and it hit the spot! Love the sushi at RuSans!!!! Cheap and tastes great! Tampura is usually tastier but the regular sushi is good too! The service is a bit slow but on a busy Saturday night it was better then expected! . . The $1 3 piece maki's are great way to sample a variety of sushi! Japanese bagel sushi is my fav!!. . Combine Ru Sans with a movie next door at the forkscreen AMC, (ave room for dessert and coffee at the movies) and its a great date night out!!!
