Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
The ONLY reason I am giving this restaurant two stars is that I have had some pleasant experiences here in the past. However, my most recent dining experience does NOT fit into that category!. . My friend and I went for dinner on a Friday night and were sat at a table on the covered patio. Great, right? It would have been, except for the roaches everywhere! We were talking when we noticed the couple next to us making weird faces and pointing at the ground. They then pointed out two roaches scampering around the area. We were really grossed out, but decided to make the best of it. When we mentioned something to the waiter, he said, "Well, we're on Sunset Boulevard and there's nothing we can do about it, they come in from the sidewalk." We were a bit surprised at how blase he was, but we figured we'd try to forget about it.. . So we continued to eat--a bit skittishly--and spotted several more roaches throughout the dinner. At one point the guy next to us stood up and squashed one of them on the ground. Yet the WORST part was when we were waiting for our dessert, and one of the roaches picked that moment to die at our feet. He was just lying there and we had to stare at him. My friend was so grossed out that she went to go request our check, and while she was gone, the waiter came back to our table. He asked, "Can I get you anything?" and I simply pointed at the ground.. . He took a napkin off our table and picked up the dead roach with it, then proceeded to clean the dishes from our table--napkin still in hand. He then went to ANOTHER table and took their order---with the dead roach still in hand!!! We were completely disgusted. This place does have good food and is affordable, but they need to refrain from patio seating until this problem is taken care of -- and they get employees who know how to deal with it!
