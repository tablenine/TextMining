This place is good!  I came here with a big group and enjoyed a massive amount of food.  We ordered an enormous ceviche platter that was pretty amazing, plus guac and a combination platter of various appetizers to start.  After all that, I could barely handle the entrees!  . . We then had the tasting menu which include a hearts of palm salad (LOVE hearts of palm, so couldn't go wrong with this) and variety of meat and fish entrees.  I remember it all being very tasty.  The drink menu is extensive as well, and I tried several different specialty mojitos which were amazing.  . . The whole experience was one of excess: too many drinks, too much food, but a lot of fun.  They were just starting to clear out the center of the restaurant for dancing when we left... we were certainly done for the night at that point, but looked like it was just getting started at Nac 27!  A fun spot that I'd definitely go to again.
