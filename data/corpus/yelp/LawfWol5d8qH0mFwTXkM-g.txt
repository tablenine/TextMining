Category: Thai
Okay, I'll be the devil here... . . I don't dig this place anymore.  Much like the neighborhood, Palms Thai is becoming gentrified and predictable.   . . Yes...yes... we know people are waiting, but don't friggin' rush me to finish my food,  I want to enjoy it - or what has become of it - damn it! . . Dinner and a Show? Please...does anyone really watch and listen to Thai Elvis belting out a tune one can hardly understand? Yeah, he can sing (NOT!), now, can comeone take the mic from him?   It's already hard enough to talk to your friends because of the blaring sound system, but do we have to be deaf when we leave?
