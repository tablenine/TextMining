Category: Bakeries
This wonderfully owned and family operated bakery has been my go-to party appetizers and cakes for years!!!! People never tire of them at each party and it always bring a smile to their face.. . 50 cheese rolls -$23. 50 meat pies -$23. 50 potato balls -$23 (be warned though...they are half the size than at the counter). . Cakes are always a hit: Cappuccino Mousse, Mango Mousse, Tres Leches &amp; Opera - 8-10" rounds are always ready to go. If you need 'em bigger, just place an order. I always get them for company b-day parties. Trust me...no leftovers - ever!. . Scones are my favorite any time of day and the sandwiches are all good, fresh and great to take on a picnic, beach day, concert under the stars, or to eat in your car!
