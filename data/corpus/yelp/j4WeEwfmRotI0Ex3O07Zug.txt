Went here for DineLa and I was once again scammed!!!  Ended up ordering whole lot more than just the dinela menu.  But every single one of them was worth it!  Their foie is prolly one of the best seared foie I've had.  My preference is for the terrine.  I love their family style way of bringing out the food, straight from the kitchen in the pots and pans (dunno if those pots and pans were actually involved in the cooking of the dish).  . . When we went, it was the first rainy day of the season and you know what happens in LA when it rains - parking lots on the freeway.  So we were late, when I called to inform that we'll be running late, they made accommodations for us.  That was very nice.. . Anyways the food - omg, they were all so good!!!
