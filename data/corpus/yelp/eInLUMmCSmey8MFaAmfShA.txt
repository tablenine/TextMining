My sister and I had breakfast here the other day and absolutely loved it. There was about a 15 minute wait for a table, so we chose to sit at the counter. The waiter was nice enough and uber efficient. I was actually surprised at how on top of everything he was because they were really packed. I got the Sow Your Oats pancakes and my sister got the Noisella french toast. Lets just say that we were raving about the food for the next two days. I had the orange juice which was good as well.. . The portions here are huge. Giant. Enormous. Can I say more? I ate like a quarter of the serving and was stuffed. A couple across from us split a stack of pancakes, and I think they had the right idea. It had a great, relaxed vibe. Quick note that the music was a little loud. With all the people talking as well, my sister and I had to use our outside voices to hear one another. But how much talking are you going to do with all that food in front of you anyway, right?
