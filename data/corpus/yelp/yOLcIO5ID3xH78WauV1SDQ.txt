I've been to JCT 5-6 times to eat, and probably the same amount of times just to head to the upstairs bar, and I am definitely a fan. . . There have been some inconsistencies in the quality of service, but I love the style, the concept, and usually the food. . . When we went the other night we were finally seated at 9:30, one hour past our reservation time. We were annoyed at this, but without us having to gripe to much, they immediately brought out a complimentary bottle of prosecco, two orders of parm fries, and one order of deviled eggs. What a classy way to handle this! It really changed our mood and made dinner very enjoyable. . . It can be very jammed in there, especially on a Friday/Sat night, but the setting is fun and welcome with the down home kitchen feel with white tables and tea towels as napkins. . . The parmesan french fries are the bomb. The angry mussels is also a very good appetizer, as is the fried okra. . . I've never had the fried chicken - I always show up too late and they run out. The chicken and dumplings (chicken confiit + gnocchi) is great, I've had short ribs once and it was awesome, and the goat cheese/sweet corn ravioli (agnolotti) is consistently great and is a perfect vegetarian option. The hanger steak is also a solid option. . . I had a halibut special the other night and it was good but a little overseasoned. . . The wine list is small but there are many interesting options at affordable prices, and most are available by the glass. I often order a Dale's Pale Ale beer though. . . Check out the bar upstairs. During the summer, when it's not too hot, it's almost as nice as the upstairs bar at the Westside 6 Ft Under. Thursday night they have drink specials and often live music.
