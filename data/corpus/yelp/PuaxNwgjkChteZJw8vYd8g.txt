Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
This place has been around for a few decades now and has acquired a large following, locals mostly.  . They are usually very busy thus the wait for a table is long.  . . The food is nothing spectacular. Same old pasta avec tomato sauce, etc. The pizza is OK. The restaurant itself is cozy. It has a warm homely feel to it.. . What the hype is all about? (shrugs shoulders)
