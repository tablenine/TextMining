Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I am not a fan of fried chicken, but I am one of waffles. So Roscoe's fulfills my waffle cravings quite nicely. . . But if it's too crowded, you should definitely check out their place on Pico! . . Once, we bet our friend to down two shots of syrup and a pat of butter. You guys can do that, too.
