i'm happy to report that portobello fries are back!  (from how they were suppose to be when i first tasted)  i think a lot of folks complaint how they tasted stale and cold -- but i'm happy to write that when we got them over the weekend, they were freshly made, hot, and the aioli sauce had a hint to fresh herb.   . . of course, the service is always friendly and attentive, and also doesn't hurt that male servers are pretty cute (even the gay ones).. . however their pizzas?  well, they are still work in progress...
