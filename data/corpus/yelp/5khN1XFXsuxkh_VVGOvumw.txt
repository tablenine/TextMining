Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Prior to coming here I had never eaten ramen!!! I was coerced into going by Ryan G lol and I have to admit i was pleasantly surprised that I would liked it so much. The Ramen is made to order and great PLUS they have coke in a can which i'm a huge fan of. Â This place is starting to turning into a hangover cure because i feel like we keep going the morning after partying.
