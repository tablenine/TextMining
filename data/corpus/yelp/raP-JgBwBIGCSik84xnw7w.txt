Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
One thing you'll learn about my reviews, they're honest, open and probably offends people.  But, it's my opinion on something, regardless if it goes along with popular opinion or not.. . Now that my legal disclaimer is out of the way, I love Roscoe's!  I went here about a year or 4 ago with my old roommate, mostly because of the novelty of eating fried chicken and waffles.  The concept sounds basic enough, but would it be worth $11 or whatever it was?. . Yes.. . That is some good eats.  . . Don't go if you:. . 1. are not hungry. 2. are afraid of being the racial minority. 3. have health issues. 4. don't like bad parking. 5. don't like waiting for a while. . This isn't the kind of place you go every week.  It is still a bit of a novelty, but the food and experience is worth it.  . . Get the sweet tea.  I've traveled a lot lately, and especailly in the south (Tennessee and down) they love their sweet tea.  Just do it.. . If I had my own angioplasty business, I'd be handing out cards just outside the exit here.
