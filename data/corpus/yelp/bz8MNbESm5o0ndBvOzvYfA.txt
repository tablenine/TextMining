I'm bumping my previous rating from 2 to 4.  I dined here last weekend, and it was a much more pleasant experience.. . Service - the waitress was VERY good and polite.  She knew exactly when we were done with plates, and never overburdened us by coming by too often.. . Food - The non-alcoholic drinks are probably my favorite thing here, definitely boosts the place.  As for the food, I tried some of the more Indian contemporary foods, and they were much better than the traditional.  The naan burger, and chicken flatbread were a pleasant surprise.  The chicken lollipops were surprisingly tender and well fried (but lacked some seasoning).  The scallops were very good.. . Price - Still not sure if I'd drop all the cash to come here, but it did exceed my expectations on my 2nd trip.
