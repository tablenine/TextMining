Restaurant: Bacchanalia
Category: American (New)
After eating here a few times I can honestly say this is one of my favorite spots in Atlanta. Service is fantastic, menu is great, their accommodations for vegetarians are fantastic. I can honestly say I've never had a dish I didn't enjoy here. And, of course, the gulf crab fitter and the chocolate cake are not to be missed. One of the Atlanta greats, things very rarely get as perfect as Bacchanalia in Atlanta.
