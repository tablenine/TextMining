based on delivery/take-out, this place doesn't stand out to be as being anything super special. it's not bad, just not "WOAH" good.  great coupons on the back of the menu (also available on their website).  friendly, on-time delivery (to bucktown). . . what i did really like were the "little touches"... the fork/chopstick/napkin roll-up, and the red pepper hotsauce in the little plastic packets (i had never seen those before!).
