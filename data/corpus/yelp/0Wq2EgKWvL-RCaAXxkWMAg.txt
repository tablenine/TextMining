This place serves exciting Japanese tapas in a modest, intimate setting and stands out as an alternative from the rest in the Sawtelle area. Their food is light, tasty, and never overwhelming. Presentations go well with the overall ambiance, fitting for a date or a simple down to earth get together. . . The integration of a modest and yet sophisticated approach is palatable through their diverse range of tapas dishes. I really enjoy their chicken salad, duck breast, beef sashimi and beef tataki. Their agedashi tofu is one of the best I've tasted, and the fried rice can be seen at almost every table. I thought their grilled salmon was too bland for the price and the chicken wings are over-hyped, but the grilled octopus makes up the difference with its authenticity. Until you develop your list of stables, you will go through some hits and misses with this place.. . The potion size is small, so there's always the trade off between going all out versus watching your budget. With the food this good, it's difficult to hold back from ordering as many dishes as possible.. . Major weaknesses: 1.) Lackluster beverage options. 2.) Slow service. 3.) Not a suitable place for a table for one. . . I highly recommend this place for a light dinner and take advantage of the many dessert places on Sawtelle after.
