Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
Lala's, major props on the $3.25 Sangria and $4 Mimosas any freakin time of day. Finally, a steak restaurant in Hollywood that doesn't break the bank with overpriced cocktails. Your steak is reasonably priced too. I got the sampler meats platter and my favorite was actually the SKIRT STEAK. Perfect fix for my random meat cravings. FILET MIGNON was a bit too fatty. I love the side of GARLIC MASHED POTATOES. Loud music in the main seating area makes it a bit hard to have a conversation. The covered outdoor patio is a major hit with Hollywood's Russian community. Thanks for the space heaters; people from Russia get cold too. For dessert I love the TRES LECHES. Three layers of dulce de leche and other soft fluffy goodness. Light and fluffy, just the right texture to accompany a heavy steak dinner.
