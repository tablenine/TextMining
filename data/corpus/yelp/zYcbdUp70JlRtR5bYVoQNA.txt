My boyfriend had been raving about this place since his mom took him to dinner there when she visited, and we finally went about a year later. YUM. As many other reviewers have mentioned, they don't take reservations, so you'll have a 30-60 minute wait. It's worth it, though. The food is incredible, the service is good, and the atmosphere is lovely.. . I can't wait to go back.
