this was a cool place with really high ceilings (something i'm not used to seeing in restaurants in LA).. . the menu prices were decent.. . the Portobello Fries were pretty darn awesome.  calamari was pretty good.  i don't remember the names of the other things we got, but my chicken entree was good enough.  i don't remember anything being outstanding or spectacular or any other hyperbolic adjective, but the ingredients were fresh, and the tastes of the entrees were accordingly good.. . for next time, i think i'll need a more specific suggestion on what is really good at this place.. . i totally agree that LA needs more restaurants like this, in terms of ambience, design, and pricing.
