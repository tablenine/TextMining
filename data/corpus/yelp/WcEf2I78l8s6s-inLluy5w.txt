Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I love their tacos!. . I and I'm sure most of the people that live near this place have been coming here for years and if you haven't come you, you should.. . My favorite is their tacos and bean/ cheese burrito that comes with a yummy salsa/ chips and you can add a guacamole (I always do) or another hot green salsa they have.. . They have indoor outdoor seating, you'll be lucky if you find a parking spot in their lot right away and to the left/ front of them their is street parking. Also just f.y.i. its cash only.. . They have a small menu with all basic good things... come and Enjoy!
