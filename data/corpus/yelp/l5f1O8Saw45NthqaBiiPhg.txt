Everyone loves a good heart attack.. . I had some Oinkster a couple months back and I truly don't understand how people can eat this kind of stuff on a daily basis.  I'm an athletic and fit dude, but even my heart definitely screamed, 'what the f*ck are you doing to me?!'  . . Excellent grub but pretty far from my current place, thank goodness.  Although I crave it's artery filling deliciousness, Oinkster is definitely a place to take the kids once a year.
