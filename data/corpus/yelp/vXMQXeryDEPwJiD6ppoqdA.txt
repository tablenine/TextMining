Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Best burger I think I've ever had. I wished I could gave eaten another one the moment I was finished and too stuffed to actually accomplish that feat. The mere thoughts of which one to try next time around even though I was currently stuffed are a testament to the yummy nature of the Umami. . . The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because after all is said and done, $20 per person for lunch at a burger joint, even such a happening one, is a little ridic. So how come I'm going again next week and breaking my once monthly red meat limit? Simply put, the buttery, succulent, Rib-eye burger. Just try the so cal burger. The mix of melt in your mouth cheese and slight sweetness of the roasted tomato will have you staring into the center of your new best friend, thinking dreamily "hello lover"...
