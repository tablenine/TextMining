Mi Barrio's location simply can't be beaten, being just a ten minute drive from our downtown building. The dig has pure Buford highway charm even after the recent bright red paint job. Every meal starts with a dish of pickled cactus, a bowl of chips, and two kinds of salsa. Everyone loved the spicy salsa, but didn't quite take to the cactus, which was somewhat slimy in the way of okra.. . I got myself two tacos, one of tongue and another of pork (photos of the food may be found at . http://livetonibble.bl.... ). The tongue didn't come the first time my plate got to the table. Perhaps they were wary that I may not have really wanted it. On the second try, I got the tongue! It took a little while but at least the tongue was succulent and deeply flavored. And the corn tortilla's coarser mouth feel added a nice textural dimension superior to that of the flour variety. The other one, unfortunately was dry, but I had no need for it anyhow having also gotten a gordita to keep the tummy content.. . For it's very in town location, Mi Barrio has charms unmatched by any other in its genre.
