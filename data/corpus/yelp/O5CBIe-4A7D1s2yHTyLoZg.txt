Restaurant: Crustacean
Category: Vietnamese
The true star (and the only reason for the high rating) are the amazing garlic noodles.  They are probably 1000 calories, but worth every bite.  The warm, buttery, garlicky, nutty flavors are one of a kind.  If I had a vat of them in front of me, I'd put on a muumuu and eat the whole darn thing.  I typically get them with the crab (very good, but messy), tiger shrimp (not always consistent, however) and their lobster special.  For appetizers, rely on the seafood salad - everything else I've tried has been good, but not particularly special.  (A few years back they had a great scallop and mushroom appetizer special, but they haven't brought it back - I inquired once and was told it was a waiter's recipe, and he left the restaurant.  Why they couldn't continue making it is a mystery...).  . . Decor:  Crustacean is a beautiful space transporting you to a french colonial setting.  Much is made of the koi aquarium built into the floor but usually the glass is too murky for you to really enjoy it, but the concept is pretty cool.  If you have a choice, sit in the first floor main dining area - you feel much more a part of the scene, versus feeling banished upstairs.. . Random notes:  The best dishes are all from their "secret kitchen" - apparently these recipes can only be passed to family members.  Sort of cool, except I start imagining some poor women trapped in a kitchen within a kitchen ... Oh, the original restaurant in San Francisco is good but much less fancy than the BH location; the vegas location doesn't have its own secret kitchen so they actually transport the garlic noodles to vegas from BH everyday - still pretty good, but you can tell that they aren't freshly made.
