So I'm deliberating between 3 and 4 stars here... the food quality is pretty good, particularly their specialties - corned beef sandwiches, matzo ball soup, mish-mosh. Service is generally good, they serve cocktails, and they're open 24 hours. All of this puts it in the 4-star range.. . But for Pete's (my) sake, why is it so goddamn expensive?!! I know this place is famous, but let's not forget what it actually is: an old, rundown diner that serves standard Jewish-diner fare. In an old rundown diner, how can a reuben sandwich with potato chips (not even fries!) cost $14? Or a grilled cheese for $8.75?. . Now, I love sandwiches more than I love some people, and I'm willing to spend a little extra for a great one. But in 28 years of life, I have yet to come across any sandwich that's worth $14. Come on guys, that's ridiculous.. . Price gouging pisses me off. 3 stars.
