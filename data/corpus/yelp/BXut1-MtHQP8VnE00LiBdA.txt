I have to say that this place was a little overhyped. I came here after viewing an episode on the Travel Channel and it looked really delicious. However, I found the lines to be unorganized and most of the tables were not cleaned at all (sorry but it's hard to enjoy food on a dirty table). The sandwich itself was good, but nothing memorable. Worth visiting if you're in the area and have time to wait in line.
