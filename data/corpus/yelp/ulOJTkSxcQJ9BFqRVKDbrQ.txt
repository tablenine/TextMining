I'm sure this review won't be popular, but it was my first, and now last experience. This is excerpted from my blog from July 2007. The B word has been removed here and replaced with "Lady". . . Cake ...Lady.. . Yesterday I went to Porto's in Burbank on a referral to see wedding cakes. They gave me a card for the Glendale branch, with whom I promtly made an appointment. I asked for an 11am meeting. It was taken so they gave me 10am instead. Cool.. I show up this morning, 3 ring binder in hand, and am directed to the party planning room.. "Are you placing an order?" Cake Lady barks at me while giving me the stink eye.. "I have an appointment to see wedding cakes at 10.". Not actually checking to make sure, Cake Lady throws up her hands at my stupidity. "We don't have any ten o clock appointments. Only 11!". "But I have an appointment. They told me to ask for Lulu or Karen.". She looks down at her much more important balloon ribbons, brushing me aside. "Lulu comes in at 11. Karen didn't come in today.........she called in...sick." Cake Lady said dubiousy.. "But I made my appointment yesterday, is there anybody who can help me?" My wedding planning frustration welled up in my eyes as another customer stopped to watch the exchange.. "No." Cake Lady grunts, walking away.. . What I should have said, "THIS IS NOT MY PROBLEM, LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER, CAKE LADY.". . I instead left. And never returned to spend my money on an expensive cake for the atrocious customer service.
