1 star despite all the reviews from fellow yelpers I guess it is something you got to try when in LA sad to say all you are rite this place sucks.. . no real taste the only thing that makes this place is the toppings on top of toppings on top of toppings... really chilli, with cheese, with bacon, with avacado, with soucream, with saurcraut, with jalapenos, with hash browns, in a burrito wrap or buns wut da!!!!!. . me and the wife had the today show dog, both had sad faces booo dont know why this place is so popular it is not that great.... . service - negative stars always be prepared to wait 30 min. food - negative stars your paying for toppings . price $ for a hot dog with everything ur paying betwen 4-9 bucks depends what you get. ambiance **** it got pictures all over the wall with signatures, nice patio area, parking is difficult there is a lot but never really empty street parking sucks...
