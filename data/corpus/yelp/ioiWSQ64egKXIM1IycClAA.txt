I went here for the Sunday brunch a few times which includes all the items on their menu.  A bit expensive but you get to try everything, have as much as you want, and it is hot and fresh.  The few times I just went for dinner the service was very good but I sometimes don't order the greatest dish (usually a special not on their menu).  The delivery is good - hot and fast.
