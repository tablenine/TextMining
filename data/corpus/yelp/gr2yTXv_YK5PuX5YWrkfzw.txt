This is for the bar atmosphere only. Decent collegy type bar for the area. It's like being in 2 different places with the first floor (sports bar like with tv screen at each table) and bottom floor (like a college frat house basement). Kinda reminds me of a modern day "Cheer's" bar. Food looked yummy and greasy.
