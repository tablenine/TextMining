Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
First time I came here I was with out-of-towners and they were like wth?  But the food was great and the portions were enormous.  The best part though was waiting for our food and seeing this family eating... they looked like tourists... then their son (like 4 years old) straight got up and yacked all over the floor.  it was awesome.  the dad starts yelling at the restaurant for giving them "bad" food and the kid (love honest kids) was like "NO DAD NO IM SICK!" then the dad turns to his son and half yells "WHY DIDNT YOU SAY ANYTHING IN THE CAR??"  good times.
