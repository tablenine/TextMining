4.5 stars...I'll make it quick.. . I highly dislike pastrami sandwiches- this one was amazing...just try it.. . Well priced.- I'm usually a big eater and the half sandwich/half soup combo filled me up pretty well (with a side of shared fries).. . The matzo ball soup was great.. . The french fries were krinkle cut, tasted pretty good, but only a little better than ones you'd buy and bake in the oven.. . The rugula was more like mini coffee cake with barely any fruit filling - sort of disappointing.. . Overall seems to be far better than canter's except for the bakery and the business hours.
