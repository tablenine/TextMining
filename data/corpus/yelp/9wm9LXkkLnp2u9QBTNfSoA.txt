Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
Another great Thai place in the city.  Cheap, plentiful, and delicious.  Dare I say it, this place gives my beloved Cozy Noodle a run for the money.  It's got all the great things: BYOB with no corkage fee, cheap prices, 2-for-1 coupons, good sized portions, friendly service, and really delicious food.  It's these type of hole-in-the-wall restaurants that will keep me from moving to the burbs.
