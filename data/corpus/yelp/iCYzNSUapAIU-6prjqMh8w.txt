Is the ramen better than Orochon?  Yes it's marginally better.  The ramen noodles are on par with Orochon and the chashu pork is actually better at Orochon.  So what's the rub? The essence of a good bowl of ramen whether you focus on it or not is the broth and Daikokuya makes their broth that much better. This rich and flavorful base has been simmering hours in pork bones and is seasoned just right so you don't get tired of it.  The flavor is savory and infused with a buttery finish that must be the marrow.  Would I wait in line for this? - 30 minutes max.  Would I eat it again tomorrow because it's that good?  No, after all it's just soup and noodles and this place makes it the best it can be.  If you want a very good bowl of ramen then put this on your white list.
