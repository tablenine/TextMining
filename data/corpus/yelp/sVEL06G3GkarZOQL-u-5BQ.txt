Restaurant: Caf√© Santorini
Category: Greek
We went there for Valentines Day dinner. My boyfriend surprised me. I loved the lamb chops . We had a great time. . . Pros: Unique Greek dishes and fresh salads. Patio Balcony upstairs. Great Service. Cons: Tight tables in Balcony but Food erases that weakness.. . Definitely would go back.
