Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I was feeling hungry and passing Pink's while on errands and it had no line! So I said "F.. it I've lived in Southern California my whole life and never tried this place." Ordered two dogs, I can't recall which, but two that sounded good. Â And you know what they tasted like?... Hot dogs. . . Anyone who waits in lines like the lines that are usually in front of Pink's, is an idiot. Bacon wrapped street dogs are 10 times better anyway.
