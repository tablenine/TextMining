Yum yum yum.  I love places like this... a small yet eclectic menu of specialty meats and plenty of seafood choices.  The ambience is great, and best of all, it is byob!  The owners are so nice, and even the chef came out to mingle among the patrons.. . For appetizers, we ordered truffle fries with garlic aioli sauce.  Delicious and you get tons of it with the order.  We also ordered the artichoke and edam fritters, which were seriously delicious.  . . My dish was the baked grouper with clams, chickpeas, in a great moroccan flavored sauce.  The flavors are really great.  This is a place that uses fresh ingredients and lots of spices and herbs to flavor their food.  Most of the main dishes are twenty dollars, and this is actually a great deal for fresh seafood, great portions, and meats like lamb, duck, quail, etc.  It's really a great deal for the type of specialty dishes you get here.. . My fiance had the deep fried haddock, and although I'm not a fan of deep frying fish, this was delicious. It was not too greasy, and the breading was awesome.  Also, unlike many places that uses sub par fish when deep frying it, the haddock was quite delicious and of great quailty.  The haddock came in a little pool of split pea sauce. The combination of the flavors were quite genius.. . I didn't try the pork chops that my friend got, but it looked quite delicious.  We were all incredibly satisfied with our meals, and the experience was truly awesome.  It's been a long time since I have been to a restaurant that I found innovative, delicious, and a good deal all at once.  I'm so glad to have tried HB!
