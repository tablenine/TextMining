Look for the Blue awning in the Honda Plaza, parking 3hrs is $2.50 w/ validation, but street parking is possible. 2 people will generally seat quickly, but partys may have to wait.. . Food Quality is excellent, prices are harsh but sustainable. Great taste and texture. If something tastes bland, it's meant to be dipped in something. The dinner combos are suggested since they come with Miso soup, Rice and the side of Tempura or Sushi. ~$20-$26 for most dishes. . Also FYI, the sushi paper menu prices go $13, $10, $8, $7, $6, $5, $4 from top to bottom seperated by the bold boxes since those prices aren't listed. . . The menu is for people "in the know" so don't expect a description of anything like the sushi deluxe (equivalent to around 15 pieces/piles of fish). Or that the dinner combos come with 5 peices of Tempura or ~7 pieces of sashimi. Or you can order the Sole dinner and request that they use red snapper Fillet so that there are no bones to pick out. Some of the food can seem bland, but they flavor the sauces so that everything is delicious. The spicy tuna was pretty spicy though.. . Might be 5 star worthy, but it's my first review..., gotta save 'em up.
