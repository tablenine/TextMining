As a New Yorker, I'm going to be rough on this "Italian" restaurant. I went in knowing it will not compare with my paisanos in Brooklyn. With that being said- I enjoyed my chicken parm, it wasnt as good as I can get in Brooklyn or Manhattan, but let's face it LA is not NYC so I dont need to explain any further. I liked the minimalistic decor, it reminded me of Dean and Deluca. Our waiter was nice even though he had a really creepy mustache but he did recommend the best peanut butter chocolate cake dessert I have ever had in my life. Bottega is average, I'm not dying to go back nor would I refuse to go back either. It's decent fake italian food.
