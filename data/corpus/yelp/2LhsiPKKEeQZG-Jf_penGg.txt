Solid place for happy hour. They have like 1000 beers on tap.  During Happy hour pints are $3.50 and the appetizers are half priced. Which is great because the appetizers are damn good.  Especially the seared tuna sashimi, and my favorite: chicken Nachos.  The entrees are pretty good too, and its a great place for dinner.   Wouldnt really go here for a romantic date or a night on the town. its pretty much a trendier, rock and roll version of Cheesecake factory minus the cheesecake.
