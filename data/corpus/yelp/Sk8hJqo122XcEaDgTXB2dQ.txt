Mmmmm it's such a treat to get some Porto's. We stopped on the way back from Santa Barbara and had to come in to load up on some freshly baked pastries.. . When you walk in there are lines every which way and that way. It's pretty confusing at first but I'm sure if you asked around you'll find your way to the right line. Lines are long but they move fairly quickly. Probably allot 45 mins in your schedule to be in and out.. . The prices are reasonable. I don't think they have the prices posted anywhere but who cares? It's Porto's. Thumbs up for their guava and cheese rolls, regular cheese rolls, potato balls, meat pies, and their fruit tarts. Always yummy and prepared fresh daily. . . Only complaint I have is that the servers strive to memorize your orders. It's hard to keep track of what you want and in what box you want it in. My recommendation is to come prepared with your order written down so when the server repeats the order back to you, you'll know if there's an item missing or not.
