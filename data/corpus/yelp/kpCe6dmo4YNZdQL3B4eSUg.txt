Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
I've had enough disappointing meals in LA that I've become a bit of a naysayer and enjoy smashing the inflated Yelp reviews of the new, hot places in town.  . . Given the hype machine that is Mozza, I had similar expectations going into my meal.  But, in the end I was dead wrong...Mozza is the real thing.. . It's not the most innovative menu ever, the pasta tasting menu has many of the traditional Italian dishes you'd have at your neighborhood spot....Bucatini all'Amatriciana, Gnocchi, etc. as well a Tuscan game-focused secondi menu.. . What Mozza does so well is perfectly capture Batali's Tuscan -influenced formula....simple, superb ingredients and superior preparation.  I had the Crispy Duck, which rivaled any duck confit I've had at the best French bistros, and about twice the size.  My friend had the grilled octopus to start.  I'm never been a fan, but it looked mouthwatering, fresh, perfectly cooked, and not chewy at all...I almost converted.  Also had the sea bass, which also looked great with a good balance of sauce.  I was impressed with the number of fish preparations on the menu.. . The atmosphere has a casual yet experienced bistro feel.  Didn't experience any pretense at all, although it was a Monday night.  Great meal, great wine, great company....overall highly recommend Osteria Mozza.  While the menu may appear pricey &amp; simple, and the hype unwarranted...Mozza is all about the execution so definitely give it a try.
