I read the negative reviews here and keep noticing keyword phrases like, "over seasoned", "communal tables", "vegetarian".  ---Over-seasoned!? What the f&amp;*k is on your mind!? I do apologize for the aggression here but seriously? So, you heard Martha Stewart say that, and you just can't stop yourself. If you don't like food with flavor why are you eating in a Pan-Asian restaurant? I mean, there's gotta be a Jimmy Johns closer to you. That must be it, I . mean for me these recipes are spot on, consistent EVERY TIME. .      Communal Tables, if you don't want to eat next to other people then do me a favor and . stay home so I can get a seat. I know this type . of dining might be new and weird 'cause in Iowa.  ya' ain't got no large tables n'such, unless you're at uncle bubbas picnic. Sheeesh, (wait I go on!) It's such a tragedy that anyone would have to actually communicate with a stranger in this city, I mean god forbid we humans actually interact with each other on a non-virtual socializing web site. Next time I'm there, I'll send you a friend request before I sit down next to you...k? . Vegetarians? Why are you even writing about food?
