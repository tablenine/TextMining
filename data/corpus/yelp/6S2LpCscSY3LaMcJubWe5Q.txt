The restaurant is really pretty inside and everyone who works there looks like they like it. The food is really great. I would recommend any of their seafood dishes. Come during happy hour for some great deals. The reason they aren't getting five stars is because of their parking situation. They technically don't "make" you use the valet but there's only a half dozen spots available to the immediate left.
