One of my fave sushi places in LA....for the quality/price ratio.  Good, decent size pieces of fresh fish at a great price!  My fave is the hamachi+green onion roll.  Beware that it is CASH ONLY though.  They have an ATM inside the restaurant, in case you need it.  Only downside is that there is always a long line/long wait.  Come early on a weekday to try it.  I would avoid coming on the weekends, unless you live on Sawtelle.
