Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
We were all dressed up and ready to go to....Hide?! . . Not really. We were dressed up because we were going to head over to Wicked after dinner. You'd think we would've went to a fancy schmancy expensive restaurant before the play. But no. I wanted sushi, dammit, and none of that creative fusion roll business. And I didn't care if it was from a hole-in-a-wall called Hide either.. . We came here on a Tuesday night around 5:30 pm and we found parking at the meter across the street. We quickly found a place to sit so no waiting in long lines for us. Loved the fish, especially the toro and the albacore, and it was pretty good for the price we paid. We had good service that day since the waitresses were very attentive. I definitely can't wait to go back. 4.5 stars for this one.
