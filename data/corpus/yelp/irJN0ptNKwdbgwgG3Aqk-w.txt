Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant

I've been visiting Versailles for years, first when I was still living in Chicago and coming to LA a couple times each year to visit friends, and now more frequently as I live in the SF Bay Area. . . I had ALWAYS ordered the garlic chicken (mimicking my friends), but when I visited over this past Memorial Day weekend, I tried the roast pork for the first time.  I have "seen the light" and am now completely addicted, and am already looking at cheap airfare so I can (1) eat at Versailles ASAP and (2) visit my friends in LA (in that order). . . I should mention that the service here (Venice Blvd. location) is always fantastic.  Drink refills and baskets of garlic bread keep coming, and the plates of food show up on the table much faster than you'd expect (and sadly the experience ends all too quickly!).
