Restaurant: West Egg Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
A very trendy yet laid back and casual kinda place, this cafe is located near 14th St. where it dead ends into Howell Mill.  There's breakfast all the time or a variety of really unique sandwiches, soups, and salads.  It's not your ordinary food, but it definitely very good and worth a return trip.
