If I could give 3 1/2 stars, I would.  It's hip, it's happenin', we've waited and it finally came.  Most of the food is delicious.  And for a real treat, try the brunch.  Service is spectacular, and the dishes are beyond well done, they are flair and very, very special.  Down to the honey yogurt.  I mean, how do you make yogurt and fruit special?. . What peeves me are the little plates of tapas.  I mean, at those prices they are too hit or miss.  That's a little disappointing, but fixable.  I hope they figure out which ones work and which ones don't.  Or which chef does them right, and which one doesn't.  But all in all, this is a unique experience in Los Angeles dining.  I'd go here again and again.. . One more tip: acoustics.  I'm all for loud and proud, but I'm not old and this is ear-piercing noise level.  Perhaps someone should check it with a DB meter, cause the cops might shut it down! LOL.  Seriously, just some art/canvas, tapestries on the wall would warm it up a bit.  Love the old Brooks Brothers store and the clean, white thing and all, but a little cloth never hurt anyone.
