Restaurant: Belly Shack

This place is a stone's throw from my residence, and even though I've lived here for a year and a half I just now tried Belly Shack. Â I wish I didn't wait so long.. . I visited this unique eatery with a friend on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy, and the staff on hand were friendly and very attentive. I ordered the Asian Meatball sammich (gotta love the use of the word "sammich" on the menu) and my friend kept it light with the Hot &amp; Sour Soup.. . My sammy was tasty, but a little awkward to eat due to the odd shape of the bread used. The meatballs were tender and uniquely flavored, especially with the mint, sriracha and ramen noodles mixed in. I tried my friend's soup, which was decent as well, although I have to agree with her... too much egg floating on the surface.. . And the reason I wanted to come here... Bacon Chocolate Chip Ice Cream. I'M IN LOVE! It's not what you think at first, it's vanilla soft serve topped with a crumbled chocolate chip cookie and bits of bacon. The combination of sweet and salty was amazing and I can't recommend it enough.. . Next time... Vietnamese Cinnamon Caramel Ice Cream!
