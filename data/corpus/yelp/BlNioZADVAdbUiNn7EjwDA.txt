I am a Ramen fascist.. . I know this to be true because I have tasted weak inferior ramen before. I know this to be true because Daikokuya is by far the superior ramen in LA.. . What makes them the superior ramen? As always I judge ramen by it's broth. And at Daikokuya, they cook their broth in pork bones for a full day before serving. A full day! Â Their broth is so creamy and rich that I always plan ahead not to do anything active after wards because I know it's going to be nap time. . . At Daikokuya you have the option of ordering your ramen with extra flavor. Do not ever order extra flavor. I found that I could not handle the extra goodness, and you can't add anything to perfection.
