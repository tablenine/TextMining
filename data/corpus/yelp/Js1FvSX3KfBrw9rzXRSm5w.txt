Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
This is a once a year kind of place. I don't really like hotdogs anyways, but I suppose they made it somewhat of an art. Sometimes it just doesn't make sense waiting in a 2+ hour long line in the middle of the night to grab a hotdog named after someone you may just say, "oh, that guy, I get it". But I guess it's a flavor of l.a. Recommended for out-of-towners. It's a flavor of l.a., I'll give it that much. To me, it's like Hollywood blvd. Millions flock to Hollywood Blvd because it's world famous, and a tourist attraction and blah blah blah, to me, it's just another street I have to drive through to get to work.
