Restaurant: LA Mill Coffee Boutique
Category: Desserts
I go back and forth on my star rating of LA Mill. On one hand, I am a huge fan of design and restaurant establishments that are well thought out in terms of their layout, cutlery, tabletop accessories, furniture and overall design. But that doesn't make up for the fact that a coffee house is charging upwards of $15 for breakfast and lunch entrees. I have a hard time justifying that no matter how great their interior design is. . . This business is extremely controversial in Silverlake, to be sure. The residents were upset that LAM essentially kicked out a ma-n-pop biz to set up shop for themselves. The reality is that hipsters love designer anything, even coffee. And a large hipster population reside in Silverlake, so therefore it makes sense that a designer coffeehouse would open in Silverlake right? Exactly. . . LA Mill has its niche market, and that niche is the type that charges close to $100 for a stinkin' cup-o-joe. I have a hard time justifying that but on the other hand I love over-the-top, decadence that is borderline obnoxious at times. I might pay that much for a cup of coffee just to say I had it. Overall the place is gorgeous, it speaks to the people in the community and the food is, well, the food is outstanding. But I would expect nothing less from Michael Cimarusti (of Providence Restaurant). You can refer to my Providence review if you need any further explanation.
