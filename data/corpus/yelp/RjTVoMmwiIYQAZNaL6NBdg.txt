Bar Celona is the type of place that you absolutely want to avoid.. . 1. Dirty and Dingy bathroom and kitchen... check. . 2. Neon signs outside advertising drink specials...check. . 3. Sushi and Spanish food?..... now thats just weird. . People are probably wondering why I even walked in. Well, I came with a group this past Saturday night, a sort of housewarming and reunion Â we sat down at a table that conveniently located next to the kitchen. I could tell right away that this place was not for me, but being polite we ordered a pitcher of Sangria and I proceeded to down a few glasses anxiously awaiting our "Catalan" experience. . . For starters, there wasn't one thing we ordered that was even remotely authentic or even tasty. We started with the Tortilla Espanol, it was flavorless and burnt. I tried the cheese dip, which wasn't bad but wasn't great and the Aoili Shrimp (oily and tasteless). . . We thought for fun we would try a few of the soups, as opposed to entrees. We had the gazpacho which was basically cheap tomato sauce with chunks of zucchini and the mushroom and lentil soups.. . Overall a good time though minus the crappy restaurant.
