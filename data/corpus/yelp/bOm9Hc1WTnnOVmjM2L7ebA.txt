Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
We received a coupon in the mail so we decided to try Sapori.  We were seated right away which is good.  I just wanted water to drink and the waitress offered me lemon, loved that touch as I always ask for lemon.  We ordered soup, an appetizer and our meals.  Soup was very good and bread was good and warm, so far so good.  But then the appetizer didnt come until our meal and the appet wasnt that tasty.  However, the waitress comped the appetizer and our meals were good.  I had the Linguini with clams, wasnt the best Ive had, but it was above average.  And the boyfriend had the lasagna, this is worth coming back for!!!
