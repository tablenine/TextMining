Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
This is a place of legend, a place where royalty dines with commoners, a place fabled to be the mecca of all things hot dog...  And this is a place where reality fails to live up to the legendary status.  I conviced a coworker that we had to fit this into the itinerary.  "Everybody goes here" I said.  We get there and... meh.  I was full when I was done but didn't feel like I had participated in anything special by eating here.  I've had a better dog and have a hard time telling anyone "You have to go to Pink's, it's legendary".  Maybe I got the wrong dogs, and if I'm ever in LA with more time and someone wants to try it, I'll give it another shot.  I'm definitely not going out of my way to go back.
