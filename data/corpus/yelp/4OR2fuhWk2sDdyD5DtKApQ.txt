Before my first taco, I thought--what's with the commotion?. Well color me wrong &amp; now enlightened, kogi tacos are darn good!! Not sure if I would follow it like a stalker though, my friend &amp; I happen to get lucky and be nearby when the truck appeared out of nowhere.. They're quite tiny but a mouthful nonetheless.
