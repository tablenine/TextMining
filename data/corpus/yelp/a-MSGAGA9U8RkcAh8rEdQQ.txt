I saw the corned beef sandwich and almost gave up vegetarianism on the spot. Dear god, that thing looked good. . . I fought off the blood thirsty urge and ordered a veggie sandwich (mozzarella cheese, roasted red pepper and tomato on dense bread). The counter guys looked at me a little crooked when I ordered it, but when I got a potato pancake on the side everything was cool. . . Food was good. Atmosphere was better. What a fun, old school place.
