The burger isn't anything to write home about, but it is quite tasty.   Just tried the marrow on the menu, and for $11, it was not a good value.  It was good, but for two small portions of marrow, I'll pass next time.  . . This location is lot better as far as size versus the Montana, and the wait is just as heinous.  Although you don't lose the charm of elbowing people for tables and swooping in like vultures when patrons are only half-way finished with their meals.
