Restaurant: Wakamono
Category: Sushi Bars
Me and my girlfriend always liked Wakamono but this time we were disappointed.. The service was ok and when we paid we left like a 13% (because that's what we decided the service deserved) tip and the waitress didn't like that at all. She came with the bill and asked if we didn't like the service because we didn't leave like a 10% tip. Yes we did we left a 13% tip!. We got upset after we thought about it because her attitude was not ok. We will only go to Toro from now on. The quality and prices are great.
