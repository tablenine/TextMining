Restaurant: Maggiano&#39;s Little Italy
Category: Italian
Being a New York born and raised Italian I am always hesitant when someone suggests "Italian Food" for dinner. Not that I'm an Italian food snob, it's just that there is definitely a difference in the way east coast New Yorkers do food, and Italian food especially. I expected not to like this place. What I found was that I actually didn't dislike it. The calamari was pretty good, in fact the best I had in a long time. What I could have missed was the lasagna, it didn't have the real lasagna taste, texture or feel that I love. While it wasn't bad, there are no Encores here.
