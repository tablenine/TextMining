Start off with drinks in the hotel lounge upstairs.  Service is a little slow and aloof, but just write it off as the typical boutique hotel experience and head down to the beautiful restaurant below.  The food was inventive and delicious, and our server was anything but aloof: she was informed, warm, friendly, and efficient.  Her wine suggestion was great, and my dinner -- the skate -- was one of the best I've had.  Definitely worth a trip downtown!
