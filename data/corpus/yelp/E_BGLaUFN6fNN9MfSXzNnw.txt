I like Cafeteria better than its sister Delicatessan. Food is good, prices are rather high for what it is (however the location warrants it). MacBar next door is good as well.. . The truffle dip was overcooked; however the cheeseburger spring rolls were great.. For main course I had Grilled Mahi Mahi which was good, not great.. . The scene here is cool however, and it isnt a bad spot to stop in if your around the SoHo area.
