I certainly have heard of Chinese buffets, although not a Japanese buffet.  So when a few of us got together last month to check out Nori Nori, I was thoroughly intrigued. Went again yesterday to get a second look and I'm still reasonably impressed.. . Nori Nori is HUGE, it really is a lot space and the seating is plentiful. Have a group of 20+?  They can accommodate.. . The mix of food is impressive. Want bbq pork and bbq beef? Check. Want some ebi (shrimp) with that? Check. How about a calamari salad? Check.. . Normally I go for 2 rounds of full plates. Then food coma soon afterwards. The pricing is a little high, but the quality of food is there.
