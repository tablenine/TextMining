Obsessed with Sunday Wine Bingo - the announcer is the faster number-reader-offer with hilarious sexual connotations to which column it is in that its nearly impossible to actually concentrate on your card.  But when you do, you wine a bottle of wine, a coupon for $12 off wine, wine openers, wine games, a dinner at Bin 36 downtown, etc.  The fact that hes so fast allows tons of people to win, and its a great way to get customers to come back.  I am notorious for being too social to do anything but talk durining the game, but after 2 times there even I won!. . Recommendation:  Eat before you go.  The food I have had has been marginal at best.  Their garlic white pizza you can only have if you are going to be making out with your dinner date for the next 48 hours becuase that is how long the smell will last.  If you dont mind consuming about 1500 calories as an appetizer, the fried green beans with the mayo tastes decent... you just know youre going to have to kill yourself in the gym for days... probably not worth the 11 friend green beans.  . . All in all, perfect place for a girls night  AFTER you've had dinner to meet up.  The wine flights are a good deal and a fun way to try different wines.
