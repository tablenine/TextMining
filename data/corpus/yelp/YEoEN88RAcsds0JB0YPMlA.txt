Quick review.  Versailles is a very good little Cuban restaurant.  I got the house garlic chicken which was extremely tasty.  Service is pretty slow there so plan accordingly and order quick if time is an issue.  Portions are huge and the meals come with fried plantains, rice and beans.  Definitely worth checking out.
