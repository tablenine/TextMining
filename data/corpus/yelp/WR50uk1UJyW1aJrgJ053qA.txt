Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
So i heard about this place from my cousin who said she saw it on tv or something and wanted to go to see if we could eat the Manuel Special because its some crazy 5lb burrito...it was freaking monstrous...kinda in a gross disgusting kind of way...lol...all the portions are huge...but the only problem i had is that its not that great...they are made and stuffed with all this stuff in it and its not that great...sure its huge in size...if youre all about quantity and not quality then for sure this is your joint...but my burrito was huge yes...funny yes...entertainingly huge and fun to laugh and take pictures with my cousin yes...haha but eating it was not as great as i envisioned...thoroughly disappointed...her bf ate the whole thing...he hurt so bad afterwards...lol.... again quality not so good...my meat was kinda stringy and dry...my sister got some huge burrito in a wierd sauce that smelled like old lady vadge...if you accidentally order it you''ll know what i'm talking about...lol...haha . have a good time stuffing your face if you end up going to this place...beware of the old lady tasting burrito...it is on the last page with the burritos...it has a wierd dark red sauce on it...that is gross...
