used to be one of my favorite happy hour haunts but service is going down hill with the quickness. unless you get the 1 cute waitress who looks like she should be a suicide girl. you're the best. . . never, i repeat never order from the bald headed momo working the bar. why would you check my ID at the door then when i order 2 beers, make me show you 2 id's. get off your high horse and just give me a beer dude. . . the beer selection here is really awesome though and can't beat the 3.50 happy hour specials. the irish nachos and chicken tenders are really good too and at half price during happy hour, score!
