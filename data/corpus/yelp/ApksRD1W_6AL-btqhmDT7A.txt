Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Gluttons' paradise! . . It is never my idea to eat here, but I never veto the choice either. It's "eh" for me. I always make sure to eat half of my entree and take the other half home for leftovers. I've found a few items that I stand by. I like Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, which features pasta tossed in an olive oil sauce with vegetables and pine nuts. The soup/sandwich/salad specials are usually pretty satisfying, but hard to box home. I also enjoy the Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon, which comes with asparagus and a very generous helping of mashed potatoes. . . I've been here for brunch once, and would not suggest ordering their omelettes. I had the Asparagus, Portabella, and Artichoke omelette, which was pretty disappointing. Mine came without much flavor.. . It wouldn't be a trip to the Cheesecake Factory without a slice of (duh) cheesecake, and I prefer the lighter textures, such as the chocolate mousse. But I always end up splitting a slice with someone else. After a huge dinner entree, there's no way I could fit a slice of cheesecake in my belly too. On one occasion, I decided to stray and try the warm apple crisp. Well, it was warm, and the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream was good, but the apple crisp itself was just ok. There was lots of cinnamon and walnuts, which I liked, but the crumb top wasn't very good, and that is what makes or breaks an apple crisp. Lesson learned: just stick with the namesake dessert!
