Restaurant: Ecco
Category: Modern European
I dined at Ecco last week for the first time. What a beautiful interior, the bar is comfortable with several small areas to have a quiet conversation in. I found a good selection of wines and liquors if you chose. The staff is friendly and dressed casually hip. Andy, the GM appeared to visit with several tables which I see as a great touch. . . The food was outstanding and I enjoy the style of serving family style. The meat and cheese platter coupled with smaller plates is plenty. We enjoyed the wine and loved the choice of carafe sizes. . . If you are looking for an upscale casual dining experience you can not go wrong at Ecco. I will certainly be back.
