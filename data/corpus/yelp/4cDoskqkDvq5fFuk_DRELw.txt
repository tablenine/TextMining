I live in the neighborhood and this is my go-to sports bar.  Yes, it is small.  But it is a nice contrast to the newer and imho more corporate locations in Decatur and Midtown.  Feels like a regular neighborhood joint.  Just remember, the small size means you can almost forget about getting a seat during a major sports event or on a Saturday during college football season when GA or some other big game is on.  . . The food is typical bar food - wings are decent.  If you like hot, go for the habanero bbq.  Chicken nachos are enough for two people as a meal.  Burgers are good.  Ironically, the tacos are not.  And they don't have mac (n-cheese).  Weird.  Service can be slow at times (odd since they only have to go about 20 feet to get to the kitchen).  But the servers are generally upbeat and attentive.  . . The best part for me is the brewniversity card.  Its like a frequent flier program for beer drinkers.  Except instead of getting free trips to Europe, you get your name on a plaque and a bigger mug.  Which is kinda better since the Louvre is overrated and beer isn't.
