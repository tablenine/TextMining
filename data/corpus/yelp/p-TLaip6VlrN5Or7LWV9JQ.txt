To celebrate winning some awards, we were treated to lunch at Spago on the company's dime! . . We had a set menu, which was fine by me since our options were all very tasty!  For appetizer, we got the Endive and Spring Vegetable Salad.  It was light and tasty.  I did notice my plate didnt get the final wipe down so there was a stray cheese on the side, but it's ok, I won't hold it against them.  I couldn't figure out what the dressing was, but it was just the right balance of citrus and oil.. . For our entrees, we had 3 choices, Mushroom ravioli, Salmon or Filet Mignon.  I opted for the filet mignon and when it arrived, my mouth began to water.  Lying on a bed of horseradish potato potato were slices of perfectly cooked filet mignon. It was divine!  Now I am not a big fan of WP, I really don't know why, but I never found his cooking to be well.. anything to write about, but this dish made me a fan.. . For dessert, it was a trio.  Peach tart, 50 Bean Vanilla Ice cream &amp; Molten Chocolate Souffle.  I only ate the tart and vanilla ice cream, both were tasty, but nothing really spectacular about it.  As for the chocolate souffle, judging the reaction of the other diners, I can only imagine it was the star of the trio.  I took mine home for the bf, since I am allergic to chocolate.  He seemed to enjoy it, even after it's been sitting around for 4 hours.. . Overall, definitely a place worth it's reputation.  Of course, I am sure my extra star is also because everything we ate and drank was paid for ...  and our service was beyond attentive.
