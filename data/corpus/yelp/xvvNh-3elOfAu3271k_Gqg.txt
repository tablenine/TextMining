Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
this place gets 1 star for having a very small menu and another star for serving two pieces of white bread with the ribs!  those are two signs that you are in a legit barbq place.  the ribs were good and the pulled pork was awesome.  i loved fatt matts!
