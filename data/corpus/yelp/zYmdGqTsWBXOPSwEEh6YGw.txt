Chef Roy will be the next Wolfgang Puck of Los Angeles. He hit one home run with the Kogi trucks but how would he do in a new restaurant with as different menu. . He has hit another home run.. They wern't suppose to open till next week but decided to open early. . We had meat ball, pickles and charred asparagus as appetizers. . There are four rice bowls to choose from, we had prime rib and pork belly both served with egg ,vegetables and great seasoning. . The meat was very tender but hard to cut with the plastic knife, it would be easier for the kitchen to cut smaller pieces.. They defiantly have a different taste then Kogi, but have wonderful flavor. . The food was wonderful, very different, very orginal,very Chef Roy.. There is only one item for desert it's called Rock Yer Road it defiantly rocked my world. It has smoked almonds, brownies, Carmel and melted marshmallow fluff. It was AMAZING. . It a small restaurant. . Chef Roy and the entire Kogi team great job, you have another hit on your hands. . . I
