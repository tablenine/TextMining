Oh, I love this place!  If you are looking for Asian-style seafood in the SGValley, especially crab or lobster, you can't do much better. When we have large clients from overseas visit us in our office in Arcadia, we will give them a choice between Maison Akira in Pasadena or this place, and invariably they pick Newport.. . We've had both the Spider Crab and the Lobster, and both are excellent.  Like most Chinese-seafood places the shelfish is cut apart and coated with sauce when it arrives, so eating is convenient (no crackers necessary).  The clams are also quite good.  Even their non-seafood dishes are excellent, as we usually order Kung-Pao chicken and it's quite good as well.. . If the restaurant has a down-side it's the crowds and parking.  The place fills up fast so going earlier is better.  Also, the parking lot is not very large, and we end up parking on the street in front.  Apart from that inconvenience Newport is an excellent choice, especially compared to Sam Woo seafood.
