I really like this place...it's really big and crowded which we chinese people all like (we always seem to flock to the 1 place that has a huge line...even when there's like 5 places right next to each other that serve the same things) you know what im talking about.  Anyways, the food here was really good, be advised that Mild actually equals Spicy...and Medium equals REALLY Spicy...I can only imagine that Spicy = Death.  But that's usually how it is...props to Thai people who can eat super spicy!  Portions are really large, there's live 'entertainers'...quote around entertainers because i thought the first lady who was up on stage was doing karaoke...only to find out that she's actually PAID to do that...oops.  Thai Elvis was funny...and he actually sang happy birthday to my friend who i was there for, so that was really cool, especially since i read below that they usually dont do that!  As my friend says...just lower our expectations and that's the way you do business...and it's so true...i mean i gave an extra star just cuz the SINGER sang happy birthday to my friend!
