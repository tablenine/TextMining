Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
i,ve been going to this place since i was a kid- so it's like a second home to me. the spicy chicago polish dog  or a "rosie" with cheese.. when  anyone askes me where to get a good burger i often say"try pinks" and if your not in a mood for either...a tamale with chili and onions is a good alternative. yeah, maybe there is better somewhere down the road but there is no equal to pinks. on a negative side i will say at pinks there's a whole lot of action behind the counter and yet things seem to move slower than dirt. how can so much movement be going on back there and  they can't seem to put a hot dog together quickly. one reason is to much bullshit talking among workers.  "less talk more work-chop chop! a former co-worker used to say to me"  AND  one time i arrived early to beat the crowd   about 9:20 a.m.! i guess they open at 9:30 cuz i was COMPLETELY ignored by the people behind the counter- i might as well have been a piece of dog poop on the sidewalk. 9:30 hit- "can i help you"
