Maybe the best ramen in L.A.! The wait is ridiculous though... come medium hungry so by the time you get in, you don't have any headache while you enjoy some amazing soup! ;). . Try the gyoza and the sausage too... really good! Just don't come there and don't order their prize dish... that would be stupid!
