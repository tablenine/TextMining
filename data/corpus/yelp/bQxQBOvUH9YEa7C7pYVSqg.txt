Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I don't think I can claim any Culver City cred until I write up Tito's Tacos.  I just moved to the area, only to discover that Tito's is right around the corner from my new pad.  This was quite the discovery, as many people have been raving about Tito's to me for some time.  I have seen peoples eyes get very wide when I tell them that Tito's is a quick sprint from my new apartment.  Apparently this carries a lot of weight in some circles. . .  I like the tacos - they are cheap, tasty and filling.  They definitely do the trick.  What really gets me about Tito's is how f'ing good the salsa is!!  Seriously, I can't figure out what they make it out of.  It doesn't really matter, as I just can't get enough of it.  It is by far the best salsa I have found at a cheap-ass taco stand.  . . So there you have it: Tito's - Come for the Tacos, Stay for the Salsa.
