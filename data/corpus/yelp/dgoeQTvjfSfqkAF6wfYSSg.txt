This place is great just cause it's so old and they still have coffee for like, 45 cents. The menu is packed, and although hard to read, it has a wide variety of stuff.. . I'm not a big fan of soggy bread, so the first time I came here I didn't really enjoy the sandwich. The second time I came back and got the sandwich without the dip and it was really good. . . Beer prices were awesome too!
