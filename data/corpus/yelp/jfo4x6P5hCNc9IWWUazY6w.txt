Well.. if I didn't live so close it would get 4. However I do and I was inspired to make my own chocolate chip banana pancakes. . . I probably wouldn't try to emulate anything else because they make breakfast yummies so well. . . My review is for brunch.. . Added: thanks to Flo, I now make my own banana chocolate chip pancakes... almost on a daily basis.
