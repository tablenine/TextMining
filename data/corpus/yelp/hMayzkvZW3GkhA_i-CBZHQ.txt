I came back for dinner recently and it reinforced my love for this place. I guess Tuesday evenings are a good time to go, because it wasn't too crowded. And the sausage, frites and beer were just fantastic. . This time I ordered the smoked turkey, jack cheese and jalapeno with carmelized onions and spicy peppers. It's a great flavor combo, and I'm still a big fan of the rolls they're served in. My friend kept it simple and ordered a classic brat with sauerkraut and sweet peppers.  I tried a bite or two of hers and I really dug it!  Now I'm normally not a huge fan of brat, but this was probably the best one I've had in recent memory. The frites still rock, and its just fun to try the different dipping sauces. I highly recommend the chipotle aioli. Its smokey and spicy, but not at all overwhelming. The blue cheese and bacon was also yummy, but its not so much of a sauce as it is a topping that sorts out the weaker fries from the stronger ones.. . Quick note about service: it is actually really good. The staff is very attentive. Maybe even too attentive, as my companion suggested at one point. I'm not sure if it was the manager/owner, but he was super-friendly and kept coming to our table asking us if we needed anything - another drink, some more food, etc. Maybe he was a little too eager, but I really can't complain about that. He clearly wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and wanted to do what he could to make our dinner experience more pleasant. If only all my dining experiences had that level of customer service!. . Another bonus: the parking meters stop counting after 4pm, so there's ample street parking nearby. Huzzah for free parking in LA!
