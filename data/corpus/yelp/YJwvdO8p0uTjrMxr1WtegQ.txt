nothing better than a friendly game of dodgeball than some roscoe's. good call greg on picking this spot. you were kidding? come on we burned around 8000 calories today. who knew dodgeball was so intense? people taking winning too serious if you ask me.. . we had a large group but the wait wasn't bad. the food was good. i think our server was new, but she was nice so its was all good as they kids say.. . it's pretty medium sized. bigger than hollywood, a bit smaller than the one on pico.. . nothing says good job like gravy and grits!
