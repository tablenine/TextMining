With a name like Oinkster and me living by the pig this joint has been a longed bookmarked place. . . So when Isabel F. decided to Booze and Brow it up, Hugo C. and I were not about to let a night of eats go to waste. We decided to add another place to our Pastrami lists and off to Oinkster we were..... . First of all, there was NO line when we arrived which i guess is a god send per other reviews. We ordered and took a seat at the bar counter area and in a short 10 minutes our Oinkster feast was in front of our eyes. . . We each had the Oinkster Pastrami (gruyere cheese, caramelized onions and red cabbage slaw), we shared an order of Chili Cheese Fries and I had a Horchata Milkshake. . . The Oinkster Pastrami was really good but was to fatty for my liking. I loved the smokiness but I hated how with every bite the meat pulled out bc I could not easily bite through the thick cut fatty pieces. I did love the cabbage slaw as it added a crisp freshness to the sammie and the gruyere and the caramelized onions were a great interesting addition to add to a pastrami. . . The Chili Cheese Fries were great and I loved how they were topped with green onions. The Horchata Milkshake was INCREDIBLE and probably one of the best milkshakes I have ever had.. . I will totally return to Oinkster again for their eats but would probably try something other than their pastrami next time. But the Chili Cheese Fries and that Horchata Milkshake are enough on their own to get me back.. . PS....Cashier service was top notch!
