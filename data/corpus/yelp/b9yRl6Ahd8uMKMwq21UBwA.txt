This place never ceases to amaze us. We first ventured over here a few months ago at the suggestion of a friend and got 4 or 5 small plates. Everything from the paella to the goat cheese/almond pesto/cherry dish to the sweet fries blew us away.. . My wife returned from her month long stint @ Stanford last week and we hit up C&amp;M to celebrate. The menu looked strangely different..the waitress informed us they had a new chef. As our jaws gravitated towards the floor in shock, she defaulted to damage control mode and assured us this new chef was quite up to par.. . Boy was she right.. . Everything from the shrimp &amp; goat cheese risotto, to the eggplant crustini, to the skirt steak..PHENOMENAL! They even gave us free dessert for asking us to switch tables, which we didn't mind doing at all. The churros &amp; chocolate sauce blew us away.. . Still the best tapa's on the westside. . AOC who?
