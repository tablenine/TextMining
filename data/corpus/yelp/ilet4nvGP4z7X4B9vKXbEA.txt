I only tried the ribs, so I'm certainly no expert, but they were really good.  They were really tender and they gave you 3 choices for BBQ sauce.  The mustard one rocked, and the original was excellent.  I'm not a fan of mesquite flavor, so I didn't love that one, but that comes with the disclaimer that I don't like mesquite!!  I did the rib sampler and the baked beans (wow, by the way) but next time I'm trying the bulled pork because I'm a big fan of those and it looked to die for!!
