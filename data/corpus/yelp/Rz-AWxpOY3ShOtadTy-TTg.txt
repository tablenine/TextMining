I have a love hate relationship with this place.. . I love the deserts they serve and I hate the fact I can't resist eating something sweet when I go here. The prices are reasonable. Ten bucks usually for a cappuccino and slice of cake.. . The crowd is mixed and the outdoor seating is divine. The pictures in the men's bathroom freak me out and remind of the scene from "the shinning". . . Great place to go to after a nice dinner.
