I didn't like anything associated with wine until I had their sangria.  Gosh!  It's been a month or so and I'm still thinking about it.  Too bad parking is such a ...nut... otherwise I'd go there after work all the time ... haha.. . Their food was okay, I ordered the wrong thing.  I got the rice dish, it was much too liquidy for my tastes.  My coworker's half chicken looked good and so did the grilled fish dishes.  I must remember that the side that they offer can be split into 2.  There's just too much if you stick with just one, not that that's a bad thing =d. . We also got the appetizer platter and I really liked the cheese and onion empanadas =d  The service was pretty good for a big table so...kudos to our server =)
