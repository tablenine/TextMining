Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Great brunch spot and really nice dinners. I've only tried the Melrose location, though the Palisades location must be 5 minutes from Santa Monica. . . This place has a relaxing ambiance and is an enjoyable spot to dine al fresco. The variety isn't over-whelming, but everything on the menu is something you may want to order. For me, that's odd. How can they only give me about 15 choices of entrees and make me hungry with their description of each. . . I love their ahi tuna and really love brunch. . . One day, I'll try the Palisades location, but love the WeHo location so much that it'll be a challenge.
