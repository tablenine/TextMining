I enjoy the ramen noodles here but do not find it to knock my socks off.  One of the perks of this place is you get to choose a level of spiciness from 7 the most mild to 1 the hottest which makes it interesting.. . If you're really hungry I recommend adding the extra noodles.  I always like to have the extra pork thrown in.  If you go alone, they have a nice bar to eat at that affords you the opportunity to look out the window while you eat - always a plus for me.  They also have outside seating available.  I should also add that they purify the water which is always a major plus in my book.  I would give Orochon Ramen 3.5 stars and have liked it enough to go more than once.
