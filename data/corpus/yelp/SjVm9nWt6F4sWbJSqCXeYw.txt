Restaurant: Cooper 35 Asian Pub
Category: Bars
Sigh... Asian Pub, you were a cornerstone. The place that we could always end up if there wasn't anything better, if plans had failed, if we were stood up. We could always depend on your outdoor table.... . You were a fantastic last resort (first on nights when we were too lazy to walk further). . . With $4 dollar drinks (mmm...lycheetini) and free edamame (plus refllls), I could be sated for under $10. And thats pretty damn good for New York. . . But then, well, you stood us up. You got incredibly loud, crowded--word must have reached new jersey and long island, and I had to leave twice without paying because the waiter just never came back!. . And even though that means that those drinks were free...it just wasn't quite worth the ordeal, and the pain of seeing our cherished spot go to the dogs (ahem new jersey-long island people under 21).
