I used to live in the San Gabriel Valley all my life before moving to NYC and we would make the drive all the way down here just for the french dip, and the chili. God how I miss the juices of the sliced pork, the soggy yet delicious bread. Aaauugg mouth watering. I Love this place for so many reasons. Nostalgia, great food, original everything, and it just has a life of it's own. Trust me try and avoid the week lunch rush. Crowded! But it's an institution for a reason and derservingly so! Hope everyone that gets a chance makes it down to Philippe's!!!!
