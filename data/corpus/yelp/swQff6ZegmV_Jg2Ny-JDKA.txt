Hit or Miss.  . I went here one night and everything was delicious!. Went again and the food was just not great.  Boo hoo!. . The man is a vegetarian and we don't preach the vegetarian life style, but it is nice to take nervous people (like your parents) to restaurants where they are assured that eating vegetarian can be delicious and exciting and that their son did not lose his tastebuds and will not die from lack of nutrition.  We were embarassed that everything we ordered was pretty bland and not interesting.  Clearly, we just didnt order the correct things.  But still, at $20 for a meat-less entree, everything on your menu should be amazing. Its not.
