New owner, new chef, new decor.. . Something has definitely changed about this place, and we don't really like it.  They still have pretty decent food, but it's just not the same.  Not too sure if it's our favorite anymore.  They got rid of the Shrimp with garlic on toast, and our favorite desert, this french toast with creme fresh and their special syrup.  Now it's just a french toast with blueberry syrup... gross! I can get that at Denny's.
