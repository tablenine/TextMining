Restaurant: Caf√© Santorini
Category: Greek
Cafe Santorini is a cute Italian restaurant located in Old Town Pasadena.. . My friend had highly recommended this place so I came here for lunch with a friend one day. I tried the Santorini Lamb Souvlaki and the Risotto Con Porcini. The Lamb Souvlaki was absoluetely delicious and totally worth the money. The lamb pieces were grilled and marinated to perfection and the best part of it was that it didn't even taste like lamb. It was served with roasted vegetables, hummus, tzatziki, pita and my favorite- rice pilaf. Together, it made a perfect entree.. . I also tried the Risotto Con Porcini, which was just "ok." This risotto consisted of Porcini mushrooms, onions and tomatoes, topped with huge slices of grilled Tuscan chicken sausage. The seasoning and flavors of the dish were exceptional, but the texture of the rice was hard and difficult to digest. I don't think that they had cooked the rice properly which is a shame.. because if they had, this risotto would have been a great dish as well.. . My friend says that the Chicken Kabob is very juicy and delicious as well. I will definitely check this place out again and try the Chicken Kabob for myself.. . The ambiance of Cafe Santorini is very cute and romantic-casual. Service was wonderful and the place is relatively cheap for the high quality of food you get. I definitely recommend this place to others.
