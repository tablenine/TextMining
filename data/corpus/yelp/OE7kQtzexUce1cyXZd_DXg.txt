Yum. Delivery bitches -  delivery. It is all about the lazy evenings when a warm meal is in order. I am not one to say no the plantains, ever.  Even though it wasn't here for an hour our food was still warm. . This establishment can provide a cheap meal or a moderately priced meal, but either way it is a delicious meal. I don't eat read meat but my friend said his steak was great. . Next time I am ordering the carmalized banana dessert.
