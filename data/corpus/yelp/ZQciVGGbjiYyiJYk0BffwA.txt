Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
The Apple Pan is somewhere to go just to say, "I've eaten here!" . Walk inside and you'll see a u-shaped counter staffed by old men and behind them a square grill with a hood that really doesn't do anything.. . The food is fast. The boy and I got our order w/in 5 minutes of ordering. The burgers are tasty. We shared a steak burger and a hickory burger. Both were nice and Â juicy. The pickle relish was super sweet. The burger was stuffed with lettuce; say 50-50 to the patty. Our fries were kind of soggy and undercooked, but that's how I liked them. Downsides? We were completely confused about how to order as the geriatric staff manning the antique registers kept wandering around/taking random orders from people at the counter. It's really unclear as to how to order. Do you have to sit down? No. Do you get in line at the register? No. Do you wave $$ around? No. etc. etc. The ventilation doesn't really work so while the aroma of burgers and fries is nice, you'll probably walk out smelling like that too. And finally the prices are a bit exorbitant. We paid $17.40 for two burgers and an order of fries. While I think the Apple Pan is charming and all that, for these prices I expect a little more out of my food and the restaurant (working ventilation hood?). This is old school fast food, but it's not any tastier than in n' out.
