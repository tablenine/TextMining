Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
Yummy, but a bit overpriced. Went there on a Saturday morning, before the crowd and had the Lover's French Toast w/ Cinnamon-Raisin Apple Compote, Chicken Sausage, and Coffee. . . Everything was tasty, and I know you pay for convenience when you eat out but $9.17 for basically one slice of bread topped with apple sauce makes me hesitant for seconds at Fred 62. However, the waitstaff was friendly, in the laid-back way I prefer and not overly pushy. The coffee was sub par, but bottomless for under two bucks-- the waiter also got me more coffee without asking, which is good. Â . . Fred 62 is a dressed up diner, catered toward the funky, hipster crowd that can't --I assume-- cook, making it easier to overspend on simple dishes. I'd say it's good for a small group of friends since it's hip and cute with basic diner dishes done well with that dash of flavor to make the outing more fruitful.
