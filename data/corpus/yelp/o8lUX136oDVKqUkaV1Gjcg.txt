My friend and I refer to amazing food experiences as "foodsex" - because everything is SO GOOD that your eyeballs roll back in your head and you need to take a breather to calm down afterwards.. . Going to Tru is like, "foodlovemaking against a wall and then you black out and your knees give out and you need to be revived". Because it is THAT good.. . The service is impeccable - it's like a ballet of silverware and plates. Things are set down and taken away simultaneously, and every single person who works there knows more about food than I could ever DREAM to know about food.. . I literally cannot say enough good things about this place. It was my first five-star experience and it absolutely blew me away.. . So uh...here's a SAMPLING of what I ate:. . -- knob onion poached halibut, hearts of palm, pickled carrots, english pea nage. . -- duet of lamb, daikon, watermelon radish, olive, star anis lamb jus. . -- house-made porcini tagliatelle, condensed tomato, asparagus cream, parmesian. . -- frog leg, roasted garlic, carrot, watercress. . -- pan-seared foie gras, lemon confit, green vegetables. . Kids, I died and went to heaven at Tru. Most amazing dining experience of my LIFE.
