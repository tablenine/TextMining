Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
What a great experience today. Got a chance to visit the legendary location that I've heard about forever. Went as part of a group. Was greeted in the parking lot by the man himself, Manuel. He treated us as if we were long lost family members. This man is quite a character! Happy, upbeat and funny as hell! . . Ordered the famous Hollenbeck. Holy smokes! Although it's not as big as a Manuel's Special that was two seats down it's still quite a challenge to power down. Asked for extra Jalapenos in and on the side. Like my food a bit on the spicy side. Gotta say..... this was a pretty good burrito! The pork was tender and flavorful, the green sauce was tasty and the jalapenos gave it a little kick. Tried but couldn't put it away. Chased down every piece of pork though.... couldn't leave that behind.. . What really made this experience one to remember is the stories that Manuel told us during our meal. What a great person. It's like talking to your uncle at a family gathering. Made us all feel right at home. You can go to restaurants and get great food but it's not too often that you get a great meal and feel like you're really appreciated as a customer. Â Manuel made me a fan for life!. . I'll be coming back to try his taquitos. Man did they look good!. . Get by El Tepeyac, say "Hey" to Manuel and ask him about his little twinkie and ding dongs.
