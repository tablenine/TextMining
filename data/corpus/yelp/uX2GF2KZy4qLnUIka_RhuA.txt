Eh, I don't see what the big thrill factor is here.... . Food is "okay" at best, prices reflect that. Not allowed to park in the parking lot unless you use valet, so you're forced to drive around looking for places on busy Ventura otherwise. Don't get me wrong, it was decent, there are just many better places in the area.
