My fiancee and I met up a few old friends of mine here for brunch a few weeks ago and we all loved it!. . Drinks ordered:. - Morning mojito with kilo kai, coffee, and mint Â (think of a coffee mojito). - St. Germain and OJ (elderflower liquer and OJ is a winning combo!. . Food ordered:. - Lemon skinny pancakes with lemon butter and fresh berries (oh so sinful and delicious). - Grilled vegetarian burger (this house-made patty may have won the title of best veggie burger in the U.S. in my book). - A custom ordered omelet stuffed with hash browns (my friend was so happy that they would do that!). - A very large and fresh salad by my very health-conscious friend. . Outcome:. Several very happy campers!. . Next time I go I must try their scrambled egg, truffle butter, and brie sandwich!
