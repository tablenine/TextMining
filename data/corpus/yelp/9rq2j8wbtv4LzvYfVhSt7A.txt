i bought a groupon for coobah MONTHS ago and of course, i waited until 3 days before it expired to use it.  . . we'd been here before, but the food was better than i remembered it to be.  for starters, we ordered the pork skewers (tricky to eat but delicious and full of flavor) and the jibarito...except the jibarito never came out because the waitress had forgotten to take down the order.  the side of chilaquiles held us over until our entrees arrived.. . i ordered the beef short ribs over crunchy coconut risotto.  SO delicious.  and they were very generous with the beef short rib...i could hardly finish everything on my plate.  my friend ordered the zarzuela.  ok, i loved my beef short ribs, but i LOVED the zarzuela.  the broth was perfect, so was the seafood, and the crunchy baguettes were addictive.  i know what i'm ordering next time.. . we got the chocolate cake with bacon ice cream as dessert.  i love bacon, but the ice cream was kind of weird.  the cake was great though.. . overall, we had a good experience...and thank you groupon for turning a $90 meal into $40.  LOVE.
