Restaurant: Twist A Tapas Cafe
Category: Tapas Bars
My good friend Camille took me here last night. Â She lives at Armitage and Sheffield and this great Tapas restaurant is right down the street.. It was marvelous and my favorite was the Tuna Cannelloni, "Canelon Relleno"--stuffed with tuna, asparagus and basil in a creamy white wine vinaigrette and tomato-basil--Yummy!
