My brother took my family and I to Frasca on a recent visit to Chicago for brunch. I really love brunch, and this was an excellent brunch experience. With the bottomless mimosa I had 5 mimosas for $13! I'm not much of a Bloody Mary drinker, but my brother and his friends said they have the best Bloody Mary's in town. I had a taste of one of them, and I agree, they were pretty good (I could definitely drink it). I ordered the breakfast pizza for something different (and because I really love pizza.) Even though it was much larger than a typical "personal pizza" I had no problem finishing it off. The rosemary in the crust was very good. My dad had an omelette (I forget which one) and claimed it was the best omelette he ever had. . . If I lived in Chicago I am sure I would visit here regularly.
