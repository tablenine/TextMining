Tends to get filled with yuppies and hipsters, the staff are generally distant or inattentive. They serve bourbon, which is good... but the prices are too steep of a mountain to climb for such a mediocre view. I'll never go out of my way to go here... but will gladly meet a friend there if they suggest it, because my friends are more important than my passive dislike of this place.
