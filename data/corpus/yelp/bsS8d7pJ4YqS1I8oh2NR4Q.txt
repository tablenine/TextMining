Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
Dolce has an air of douche-ness about it, you know it's like that guy you dated who was handsome and successful but always seemed a little lame and slightly annoying, but I enjoyed myself all the same.  The staff is too beautiful to be really helpful, but Monday nights everything on the menu is half price, the alcoholic beverages are the exception.  I went with some of my sorors and we really had an excellent time.  The food was just okay, I had a seafood pasta dish and salad and both were fairly bland.  I mean it wasn't bad but it wasn't great; however for half price it was worth it.  The place is really very beautiful though so I'm thinking Dolce might be my new Monday night spot.
