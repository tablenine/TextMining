hm I don't know what the hype is all about! maybe it's just because this place looks nice. The atmosphere and the decor definitely made me feel like an elitist. . . The food was okay for me. I had eggs benedict and I really can't see what was so great about it. First off, the dish came out cold. Secondly, the muffins were just meh. The dish would've been better if the muffins were a little crispy on the outside. But, the whole dish was just soggy and mushy and all you could really taste was the yolk. gross! My friends seemed to have better luck with the pancakes, but honestly, you can get pancakes anywhere! They'll probably taste the same, if not better. . . All in all, this place serves a wide variety of food that tastes mediocre, but nothing spectacular.
