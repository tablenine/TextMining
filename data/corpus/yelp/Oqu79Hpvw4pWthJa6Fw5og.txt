Restaurant: Ciudad
Category: Latin American
Over the holidays, a friend and I decided to have dinner at Pete's Cafe, only to find that it was closed for a private holiday party. We opted to try Ciudad instead since both of us had it on our "to try" list. Since we were walk ins, the hostess told us that there wasn't any availability and that we had to sit at the bar. Fine. Good food and drinks. The worst service I have ever had in my life. . . I asked for the bill 3 times and waited 45 minutes. The manager even had to get involved and personally asked our server to get us our bill two times in a 20 minute span of time. I didn't understand what the problem was, and neither did the manager because he wound up comp-ing us. I felt sorry for the other people at the bar too because one party was there before us and still hadn't gotten their bill, and two people sitting next to us didn't get their food for 30 minutes. This experience may have been extreme, but it was a Sunday evening during the holidays (not exactly a busy period!). Either way, I will never go here again.
