Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Great food, pizza is awesome (though don't get it delivered/take home, needs to be eaten ASAP). Cappuccino's awesome. . . I stopped buying wine, from the restaurant part, and went to wine bar at side. Was disappointed more than once, but wine bar has great House Wine! Owner Ugo blew it by getting rid of original wine bar staff. All in all, great place, they are very good to the local Police too!
