Valet parking and hen into the lobby.  You are surrounded by pictures of movie stars and hot sauce where you check in and await your server to take you to your table.. . We started of with the rolls and "bagna calda", I think it was called, which was a good beginning.  This would come in handy later with whatever you order, this is the garlic, this is the taste you add to everything you order.. . We ordered the clams next which were the highlight of the meal.  We got the small which was enough for the both of us and more than we thought we would get.  There is nothing special about them, but it is a good start.. . I had the short rib net which was very tender and tasted something like brisket.  This was great dipped in the bagna calda which I spoke of earlier.  The spinach was wonderful as well as the mashed potatoes. . . My girlfriend had the rabbit which came out dry and with little taste.  Do not order the rabbit.. . Nothing was very garlicky except for the first appetizer I spoke of which put the taste in almost everything you order. . . Service sucked on the waiters part, but the bus boy busted his ass to help us out and keep our table happy.. . It is nice to say I tied it and the meal was good.  Not great, not bad, it was good.  Try it out and see what you think.  For me, once is enough.
