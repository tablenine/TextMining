Ropa vieja nachos. Need I say more? Well, yeah.... . Yesterday evening, I enjoyed a dual app spread at Cafe di Sol, enjoying the weather on the front patio. Shredded beef sat on each red tortilla chip, topped with cilantro sour cream and seeded jalape√±o slices. While the dish seemed small for $9, it was sufficiently filling. I also requested a side of broccoli in an effort to eat my veggies. It's hard to make a splash with steamed vegetables, I know, so the broccoli was tasty but like any other cafeteria accompaniment.. . My friend's zucchini quesadilla appetizer looked inviting, too, allowing us to enjoy a meal at non-entree prices.
