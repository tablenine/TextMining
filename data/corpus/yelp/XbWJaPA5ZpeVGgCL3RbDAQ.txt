great food, great service, great ambiance.  . the scallops were some of the best i've ever had and all of the food is well executed. it's impressive and strange how closely the flavors match home cooked asian cuisine.  i'm definitely not used to tasting mama's cooking in fine dining form, but it's nice to see that chefs did their homework.  . if you are in to seafood with a bit of an asian twist, spring is definitely for you.
