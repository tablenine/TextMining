Restaurant: Holy Taco
Category: Mexican
Holy Taco's Chorizo Quesadillas rock! Check out what's in 'em: Spanish sausage, yellow corn, fingerling potatoes, caper berries and mascarpone cheese. Service is consistantly on target. Dining crowd is animated, youthful, festive. Fun, tasty option for a brunch, lunch or dinner out.
