Restaurant: Francesca&#39;s Forno
Category: Italian
We had a girls' night here a few months ago, and none of us can stop talking about it! With a bottle of wine for three of us and a martini for the 4th, four entrees, one side, one appetizer, and two desserts, the bill (WITH tip) was only $30 a person. I had a pasta dish with fresh ricotta and asparagus that was to die for. and our side of cheesy potatoes was fantastic. . . The most confusing thing about the restaurant is which door to go into for the front! The "front entrance" is on Milwaukee, with the Damen entrance leading to the bar. It was loud, but homey and comfortable, and I can't wait to go back. Definitely more low-key than the other Francesca's.
