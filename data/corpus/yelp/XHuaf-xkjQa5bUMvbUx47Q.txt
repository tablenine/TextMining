so here's my story. i went to china buffet to eat. came out with a really REALLY full stomach. while driving, i saw kogi's pulling into autobacs and i knew i just had to try it even with a really REALLY full stomach. how could you pass out on something that's rarely near and travels from city to city? waited for about 30 minutes and got some short ribs tacos which where two bucks and it was good. i was hoping it was better, i guess maybe i was too full for my taste buds to work properly but it`s ok. still good!
