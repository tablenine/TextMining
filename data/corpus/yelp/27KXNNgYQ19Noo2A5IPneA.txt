What an experience! No matter what time you go, even if it's in the middle of a weeknight, there WILL be a line-- mark my word. Be prepared to wait. You know the regulars when you see people have specifically brought things to do in line -- the guy behind me was learning how to use his new digital camera and brought along the manual with him. After what seems like an eternity since you're most likely starving when you decided to come to Pinks in the first place, you find yourself in front and then all of a sudden you don't know what to choose. You had all this time to think in line, but you get stuck because there is so much to choose from and you know they're all good -- even the ones that sound not too good. You can't go wrong, but just take it from me when I tell you they're a lot more filling than what you might think while you order on an empty stomache. And some dogs might be a bit messy -- so be careful and take lots of napkins... bon apetite!
