This is my first time here, and I have to say, this place has such great atmosphere once you are thru the doors.  I dined there with a group of 45 people recently.  The food was set up in a "buffet style" setting.  Everything from the sangrias, to the mojitos, to the ribs, to the tomato salad, to the fried potatos, was EXCELLENT!  I will definately be back soon!  Kudos!
