Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
We asked a local where we could get a fabulous pastrami sandwich (Langers was too far a drive) and were directed to Johnnie's. We were so excited and hopeful that our search for the perfect pastrami was going to reach another milestone as we headed to what we'd been told was a world famous location. Well, here's the story ... . . The good news --- . The waitresses were quite friendly, the sliced pickles they place on every table when a patron arrives are quite flavorful, there's outdoor seating on both sides of the restaurant (which is good because it's a tight fit inside with very limited seating), the restrooms are SPOTLESS, and the sandwiches were piled generously with the pastrami. . . The bad news --- . Parking behind Johnnie's was scarce and we eventually had to park across the street (don't jaywalk, but trek to Washington to cross the street). My husband ordered the hot dipped pastrami w/ cheese and I tried it on rye. Pastrami flavor? BORING, virtually no seasoning whatsoever. We asked for deli relish and russian dressing, and piled that as well as the table american yellow mustard all over the pastrami in an effort to get some kind of flavor kick. We ordered nothing but the two sandwiches (no fries, coleslaw, etc.) and the total bill came to $30 with tip, so I recommend a bank withdrawal before eating here as they only take cash. We had mistakenly thought that the significant sandwich price would be a reflection of quality. Â My suggestion is to go to the little Mexican food stand next door which has a sign in the window advertising a pastrami sandwich, fries and soda for just under $5. It can't be any worse than what we got at Johnnie's. . . Sorry, gotta say it ... What a huge disappointment !!!
