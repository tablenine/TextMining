Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
If you want prime rib why would you go anywhere else? Seriously this is the place for great meat! The Spinning salad is awesome, the warm sourdough bread is oh so good and the meat, well that's the best part. If you save room the chocolate Sunday will top it all off! Fast for the day and enjoy a huge amazing meal!
