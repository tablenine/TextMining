I've been to this restaurant twice when I lived in Logan Square. One occasion was for the Meet the Parents night and the other was my birthday. Both times I had reservations (necessary on weekends). It's one of my favorite, true Italian restaurants in Chicago. . . All of their food is excellent. I loved their minestrone soup and bruschetta as appetizers. Their pasta is amazing. I had their butternut squash ravioli and it was so good. They have one of the best tiramsu's I've ever had. Every time we went there, the food was great and the service was good too. . . The only downside to this great restaurant is the size and noise for such a small storefront restaurant. Otherwise, it's worth a trip to the Northwest Side for a good Italian meal.
