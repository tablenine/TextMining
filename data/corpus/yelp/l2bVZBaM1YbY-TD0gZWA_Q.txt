this has got to be my FAVORITE italian restaurant thus far.  my fiance took me here for an anniversary dinner, and it was seriously TO DIE FOR.  the bufala mozzarella &amp; prosciutto di parmathe seriously makes my mouth water just reminiscing about it.  the bruschetta with black olives and the eggplant dishes were amazing as well.  we also shared the sausage fennel pizza, but next time i'm coming back for the burrata and squash blossom pizza!  before coming here, i was not a fan of italian food because i thought olive garden = real italian food.  thanks pizzeria mozza -- you saved an entire type of food category for me!!
