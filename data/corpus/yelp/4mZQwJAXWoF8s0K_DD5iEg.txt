I cannot speak for the other Versailles location, but this location is fantastic.. . - The waiters are very nice and attentive.. - I love the free, greasy bread you get to munch on before your meal arrives. - I ALWAYS order the ox tail stew. I think it's one of the menu items that is such a hidden gem, that every one looks over.  The flavor of the stew is so rich and delicious, and the meat on the oxtail is cooked so perfectly -- meat falls right off the bone.. - The rice, beans, and plantains that comes with all dishes is absolutely delicious too. - Large portions at reasonable prices (about $10-$15 bucks/ person), I always have enough for two meals!. . NOTE:  I know a number of friends who dislike Versailles' signature garlic chicken, and never set foot in Versailles ever again, as a result, since that's all other people recommend.. I do not like their garlic chicken either, but there are just so many other wonderful dishes on their menu (like oxtail stew =D) that are worth trying. Don't let just one dish turn you off, from all the other wonder dishes they have to offer. . . Love this place.
