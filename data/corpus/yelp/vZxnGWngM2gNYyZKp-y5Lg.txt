still amazing. i think those people who gave less than 4 stars probably went on a sunday and we all know you never go to any sushi place on a sunday. . . tonight i had the best sushi experience of my life! . . tip: sit on the bar BUT sit towards the bathroom away form the door. those sushi chefs know that why are doing. . . yum yum yum yum yum yum yum. THE BEST!!!!!
