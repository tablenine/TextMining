Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
The place is absolutely crammed at all hours, but the close quarters and open-air seating give it a rowdy South American atmosphere. The dinner dishes seem to be pretty authentic and are definitely good-tasting, especially the steak chimichurri. The drinks were fun and exotic but my friend had to send back her mojito, claiming it wasn't strong enough. Our waitress dealt with it fairly well but may have charged us extra. This would be a good place to bring a large, drunken party. . . All good fun...if you can handle the crazed crowds.
