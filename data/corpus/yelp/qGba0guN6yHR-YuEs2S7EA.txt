Love it! . I guess it has to be your type of scene, it's not a yuppy place by any means, so I guess it doesn't fit well for some in Wrigglyville, but the food is awesome, fast, and the staff is nice. You have to try their brunch and it's one of the best late night places, if you've been in the area bar hoping. Regardless of how many people dislike them or aren't impressed, they have plenty of loyal customers to keep them going.
