My friend Jessi M, who is also on Yelp, introduced me to the awesomeness that is Souper Jenny. She has a great guide on how to best navigate your visit on her review here:. . http://www.yelp.com/us.... . . Top tips: check the menu online, bring cash!. . The food is fresh and delicious, menu changes all the time as a result. Jenny is also big into the ATL Street Food movement and now has a mobile truck that she brings to cool events like the VaHi Summer Fest and serves lobster rolls and other delicacies.. . I love supporting local businesses and Souper Jenny is just fantastic!
