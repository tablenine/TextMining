Oh Oinkster, how you disappoint me!. . So I was drawn here by Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, I'll admit it. . . First impression as I walked in: these prices are ridiculous! I had their chicken salad sandwich- basically SEVEN dollars for dry mashed up chicken between two pieces of bread. My boyfriend had the pulled bbq pork sandwich which I can say was not any better. I don't really know how you could possibly get all of the flavor and juice out of a piece of meat, but the Oinkster did it. No amount of BBQ sauce on the side could save that poor sandwich. We also had a side of chili cheese fries- their cheese was bland and their chili tasted like it came out of a can. Seriously, this food was not what I expected, not to mention the price. . . Dear Oinkster, I'm sorry it had to come to this, but from now on you can find me at Tommy's up the street in case you ever want to stop by. Seriously, if you are going to charge me 7 dollars for a sandwich, I really expect it to be somewhat tasty. I'm really not asking for much. :(
