One of the best bone-in ribeyes I've ever had.  The steak was cooked a perfect medium-rare (a lot of places tend towards the medium side).  . . Mashed potato side was great without being too creamy.  Creamed spinach was just okay. . . But I came for the steak and I got to admit it was pretty awesome.
