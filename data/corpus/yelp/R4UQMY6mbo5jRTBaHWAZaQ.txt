As we entered at 11:30am my friend had warned us that they usually play loud punk or metal. Oddly enough we walked in to the sweet sounds of the Culture Club. No matter as I wasn't there for the music. I ordered the classic italian sandwich on the potato roll. The size was perfect and the sandwich was great. To top it off they had my favorite Zapp's Gator Tater chips. The slices of pizza were ridiculously large as well, so might have try one of those next time...
