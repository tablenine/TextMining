Restaurant: Alfredo&#39;s Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
Big big props to Alfredo's! I have to admit that I have always wanted to go to Alfredo's, but for one reason or another never ended up there. When heading to Tara the other night for a 7:15 show we stopped at Alfredo's at 6:15 and missed the dinner crowd by about 15 minutes. We got a great booth towards the back, had an awesome waiter and half-carafe of wine and a very quick, but incredibly tasty meal! Being a big fan of Steak Pizzaiola I had to order it and Steven was fine with sharing it. Considering it is one of the largest steaks I've seen it was Â good thing too, we ate several meals off of that steak! The sauce with the nice big mushrooms was great and while very different from the Steak Pizzaiola that I make it was great and the break is just delicious! Definitely a keeper, which everyone, for the most part, knows who has ever been there!
