Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Ever wonder what's in the Byzantine-Latino quarter?  Papa Cristos!  This place has great Greek food at a reasonable price.  I'll be honest, I don't know if I've tried anything with meat in it.  Not because I'm a vegetarian, but I seem to prefer my Greek food without meat.. . So based off of the dolmas, humus, and spanikopita (and the cheese version of this, which I don't remember the name of) the place is awesome.  . . Ample seating, both indoor and outside.  I just wish they stayed open a little later for later diners, but I am also an advocate of people in America not being such workaholics, so it's probably nice that the workers don't have to be there all night.
