I will never, ever, ever understand the hype about this place.  It bleeds pretentiousness out of the freakin' walls... and not even the charming, hipster-laden pretentiousness.  The quasi-ironic, why-can't-I-afford-to-move-to-New-York-City, no-one-will-ever-understand-me-but-Andy-Warhol pretentiousness.. . The menu sounds far more interesting than it is, and it's a little pricey for the portions.  They change it up every once in a while, which I think is a great thing for a bar trying to emphasize its food offerings, but every time I try something there all I end up thinking is, "Wow, this side salad is great."
