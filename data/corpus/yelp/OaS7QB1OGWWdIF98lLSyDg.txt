Sushi quality is prime. Fatty tuna, albacore, all good. I went here with another person and we got the seafood salad and deluxe sashimi plate. So much sashimi for ~$35 bucks. The seafood salad was very standard and nothing special really stood out there. The sashimi was so good that I recommend it to anyone that is a sashimi lover.. . 3 stars because it was $75 after tip for deluxe sashimi and seafood salad (no alcohol). That's pretty steep for the whole experience. This review might be affected by my date. Was not a stimulating conversation so might have a little bias on this review.. . Pros:. you're going to get quality sushi. . cons:. price
