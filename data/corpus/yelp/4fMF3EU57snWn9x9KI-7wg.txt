Tried this out for the first time a few weeks ago and just went back again. The Quintessence (shhh!  It's a secret) is an awesome high gravity beer. The Dark Star is no slouch either. Organic beer was wonderful as well.  On the the food. Love the local/organic theme. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the food. Loved the special pizza with chicken, fresh jalapeños, and peaches. Fish tacos were great with fresh fish lightly battered and fried to perfection. Easy to get to, ample parking. A must try!
