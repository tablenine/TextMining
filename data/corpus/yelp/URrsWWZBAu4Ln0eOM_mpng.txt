Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I was visiting LA for the weekend and my sister insisted that I had to try this place. She told me it was famous for its hot dogs and celebrities are among its patrons. She also mentioned the long lines, but when we got here, I didn't expect a line that snaked around the corner. We ended up waiting over an hour. Save your time and money. I will say now that it's not worth the wait. . . I settled on getting the "Planet Hollywood" dog because I wanted to try the Polish. I think they actually forgot to put the diced onions because I didn't taste any. The bacon was rubbery instead of crispy and the mushrooms looked like they came from a can (which they probably were). I tried some of my sister's Ozzy spice dog, which tasted a lot better. Maybe because they didn't forget the onions. We also tried the nacho chili cheese fries, which weren't spectacular. The fries ended up soggy from all the cheese. I think everything ended being around $10 per person. If you ask me, I would have just been as happy with a Polish from Costco at one-tenth the cost and no wait.
