I went to this place while I was visiting the area based on the yelp recommendation and it definitely lived up to the reviews. The service was great and so was the food. It's a cold rainy day and I had the soup of the day which was light and healthy and flavorful. I also had a veggie wrap which was surprisingly tasty. I rarely pick the pure veggie options, but it was great.
