So I've been to Daikokuya Costa Mesa, Daikokuya Hacienda Heights, and finally I've been to Daikokuya Little Tokyo. My review is pretty much the same with the Hacienda Heights Daikokuya. I didn't not notice anything different in the consistency of the noodle and the taste of the broth. We ordered the typical ramen dish, and the shredded pork dish.. . I think it's very much the same as the Hacienda Heights Daikokuya. It was a really long wait (1.5 hour) and it was quite a drive for us from Orange County. Now, if I want a fix of ramen noodle, I'd go to Hacienda Heights Daikokuya.
