Restaurant: Krog Bar
Category: Tapas Bars
Great atmosphere and quaint.  Nice choice of cheeses and tapas to go with the great wine selection.  Not too too expensive either considering the quality of food and wine.. . I believe there is also a restaurant adjoining the bar, but I have only been to the bar right on Krog St.. . Might be too fru fru for some, but if you enjoy good cheeses with good wine, this place gives you a different setting than your abode.
