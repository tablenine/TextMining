Despite his wildly overrated reviews, I have to say that FLIP was pretty darn good.  We were seated quickly, had great and attentive service, and enjoyed several items (most to our liking).. . I thought the poboyger was the best, especially with the fried lemon on top.  My husband found the cod to be his favorite.  We also tried the pork belly cheeseburger, which was to our liking (but I would have liked the pork belly to be a little more crisp).  My favorite side was the fried rutabega, which remained nice and crunchy and went very well with the goat cheese foam.. . The burnt marshmallow shake was amazing.  The Krispy Kreme one was a disappointment - a bit too sweet without much texture.
