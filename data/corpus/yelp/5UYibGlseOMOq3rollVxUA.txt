Please. Hear me out. Gobo is NOT good.. . I know what you're thinking. But... but... the reviews, they seem so positive. Right? I know! That's what's so crazy about it!. . Maybe they were too busy that night?  Maybe the chef didn't like the way I looked? Maybe the staff has created a bunch of fake Yelp accounts to attract business? Maybe there was some kind of worm hole in the entryway, and it transported me to a different Gobo - in another dimension - a dimension where chefs pride themselves on their terrible food? . . Look, I'm open to these theories and more, but this place was just awful. It's like zen palate, but with waaaaay more oil,  and 3 times as expensive. Seriously. Skip it.
