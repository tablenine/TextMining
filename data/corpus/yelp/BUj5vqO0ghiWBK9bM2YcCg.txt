Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Alcove is the best cafe that I have been to here in Los Angeles. I make it a point to stop in whenever I am in the area. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because as just about everyone has stated, the parking does suck. The only other reason is that some might find the menu to be a little pricey. Other than that, you can't miss with Alcove. I've had a few of the items on their menu but I usually order the Alcove Burger because it's just so good (you have to add the bacon and avocado though). And their onion rings remind me of donuts. I know that may sound a little weird but just give them a try.  Do yourself a favor and go to Alcove.
