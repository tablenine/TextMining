Restaurant: Suehiro Cafe
Category: Japanese
This place was tough to comment on since the only reason I ate here was because Big Black House (aka Daikokuya) always had a 45 minute wait. I don't love ramen THAT much and nothing else on this street even looked safe to eat. But Suehiro always had tables available and a small crowd eating there. . . At first the plain simplicity of the meals here didn't impress. After awhile, I realized how much I craved such simple Japanese dishes and really came to appreciate this place's brilliance. It's an inexpensive diner that serves Japanese comfort food quickly. The quality is consistent - above average but nothing great. Prices are cheap and you can get away for under 8 bucks a person total. Plus they serve beer and the waitress talks with an super high pitched voice in Japanese.. . I'm certain to eat here many more times as I repeatedly visit Daikokuya, write down my name, hear that it's a 45 minute wait, then leave thinking, I don't like ramen THAT much.
