Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
The best gourmet shop/cafe is all of California. Everything is amazing and I was told most were Joan's mother and grandmother's recipes.  Inventive and WOW prepared foods. Heavenly desserts (marshmallow in a chocolate cupcake-OMG). Excellent cup of coffee, and impressive cheese selections (cheese guru, Chester,  is the bomb). Decor is just heavenly, too. As it is pricey for cafe, I do wish I could afford to eat one of my meals here every single day. It's that varied and that delish. But the bi-monthly trip makes for an extra special treat. The actual Joan is so dang cute!
