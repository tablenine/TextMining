Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
Perhaps my expectations were just too high. The steak was great (bone-in Filet). The velvet cake was great. The cream spinich was fair, mushrooms were typical, and the waffle potato thing was weird and bad. . . My main disappointment was the dining room and overall experience. The ambiance/environment was that of a nice corporate cafeteria. Busy, lots of distractions, just plain odd. The server was pretty weak too. I've had better server/dining room experiences at chain restaurants.. . Go for the steak, hope you get a decent table, and expect a 3-star experience and perhaps you'll be impressed at the end.
