Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
This place is a little hard to find...it's literally a wooden gate that transports you into a different time and space. It's such a beautiful place. The ambiance is definitely on the romantic side. The lighting is dim with candles everywhere, AND they have different rooms. . . Everyone has a French accent here and the servers are great. If you ask them anything about a dish, they will know the ins and outs of it. So if you need to pair your meal with a glass of wine, they will know what you need. . . Although the filet mignon was a little dry and my pork was a little dry (we asked for medium rare), their plating was beautiful. In addition, deserts were absolutely delicious. . . Parking- you can find parking on the street or valet it, but definitely try finding street parking since you're going to be paying a lot for your meal, along with tip. . . Definitely go for dinner if you're looking for a romantic spot.
