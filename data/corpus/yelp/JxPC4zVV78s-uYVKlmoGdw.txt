Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Forget about Mel's or Cafe 50s.  If you want to experience an authentically 50's burger joint, you need to visit The Apple Pan.  The menu is limited, and I strongly suggest the Hickory Burger.   Its probably one of the best burgers in LA-- right alongside Father's Office and Fred's 62s.   . There are no booths, only a counter.  Its small and quaint, yet always busy.   The waiters are also the cooks, and you can watch them prepare your burger.   The waiters are old tough men,  and sometimes mean.  Don't take a long time figuring out what you want, and don't ask too many questions.  Order, eat, and get out of there so a waiting customer can sit down.  Tip well despite the bad attitude.  Its one of those few times when its cool to be treated like crap.
