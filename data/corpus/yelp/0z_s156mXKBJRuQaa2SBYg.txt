I would NEVER expect this place to be as popular as it is. There is absolutely nothing too special about the griddle. This place needs some remodeling really bad. Our table was wobbly, chairs were thrashed, and the silverware seemed like it was from 1940. Sitting outside kind of sucks, the traffic is SUPER loud and all the tables are crammed really close to each other. People watching is always a plus though! Next time I want to try inside.. . SO, my first time here wasn't that great. The service was horrible. It took FOREVER for a waiter to take our order. Maybe if you sit inside they pay attention more? Anyways, I ordered 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and a fruit cup. They forgot my toast and it took forever so my eggs got cold. The fruit cup was okay EXCEPT for the melon being SUPER unripe and tasting like shrimp. Ya, it was pretty bad. My friend got the Fiesta Scramble...I tried it and that was actually pretty good. Because of this, I will totally try coming here again. Too bad I'm not into pancakes, because I guess that's what this place is famous for.. . The memosa was amazing. Best OJ ever. I also had a bloody mary, which they make with soju, and that was pretty good also. My friend and I got there around 9am and there was a 10 min wait...when I drove by again at around 11:30am there were a bagillion people outside. So getting there super early on the weekend seems like a good idea.. . Sorry Griddle, you get 2 stars for now!
