BEST beer garden EVER!. . I've even been here a couple times when the beer garden wasn't an option, and I loved it then, too. Sure it's a little sad to go and not be in the beer garden, but I got over it quickly.. . If you're looking for a snooty see-and-be-seen bar, then don't go here. It's not for you and the crowd here really doesn't need you there. I certainly would prefer you went somewhere else. . . If you like places that have good burgers, reasonable pitchers, and an atmosophere that lends itself to good conversation with friends, this is a great place. We recently had a birthday party here and it was a great location for lots of beer, burgers, and good friends. . . And we even had the party indoors.
