Heard about their sweet happy hour deals and decided to check it out with my partner after work one night.  It just happened to be the rainy/blustery day that followed our delicious 60 degree February day, so we were both primed and ready for some cocktails.. . Ordered the goat cheese bruschetta and the tuna tartare.  They get mega points for style here, as the dishes were beautifully arranged. Not only that, but the tasted great too.  We both complained to each other about the lack of toast points with the tartare, but we suffered through (just kidding, the dish we thoroughly enjoyable off a fork as well).  The bruschetta was quite tasty as well and in a style of presentation I've never before seen. . . Drinks were knock off the day strong, and the service attentive.  The atmosphere was also very nice too.  We like to come to Devon's and pretend we're more chic than we really are, and nobody seems to mind. . . Bonus, everything we ordered was $6.50 - lovely symmetry.
