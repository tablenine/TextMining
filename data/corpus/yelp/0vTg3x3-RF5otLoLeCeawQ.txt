Valet? For breakfast? Not sure if it is just due to the construction, but I indeed just had my first breakfast valet. . . It has been a while since my last West Egg experience and glad to know that it is keeping up the same ambiance as before - a bit loft-ish with some fun artwork, and of course a good breakfast selection too. . . Being the carb-hungry girl that I am, I went crazy on the a la carte menu with biscuits, potatoes, gravy, grits and a side of sausage. Pretty tasty and a good call for a breakfast that's heartier than a iced-caffeinated-anything!
