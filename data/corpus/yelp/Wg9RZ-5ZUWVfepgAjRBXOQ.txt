I don't know what I expected, but I think I just expected more than I got.. . Look, it's all very tasty-looking.  I mean, how could it not be?  It's fat, salt, sugar and candy, for crissakes.. . But here's the thing.  I like my food to be food.  Not dessert masquerading as food.. . The blueberry pancakes were delicious...as cake.  They were cake. They weren't pancakes.  I cut out a wedge, and it would've been terrific...as a light cake.. . I had an egg and sausage dish and the sausage was seriously horrible.  It tasted like 99c store hot dogs cut into pieces, and mixed up with some eggs.  My colleague had a pesto scramble which she said was ok, and my other colleague had waffles.   I can't speak for their meal, but mine was AWFUL and bland.  I guess because I didn't order butterscotch smothered whipped cream choco-pancakes.. . I can put butterscotch whippedcream chocolate into a pancake and it'll be tasty.  It's not exactly innovative or even hearty and satisfying.  But to eff up scrambled eggs, spinach, tomato and sausage?  That's sort of amazing.  There's no excuse for starting off with crappy ingredients and fooling your customer with piles and piles of junk food.  . . I mean, yeah, this is America.  A place with gargantuan portions and full of empty-calorie HFCS-based products is going to succeed, of course.. . But it just won't be on my list of go-to brunch or lunch spots.
