Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
If I were you, I wouldn't listen to my own restaurant reviews, because I am NOTORIOUS for falling in love with a restaurant because of ONE dish. And it will be the only thing I eat there. And I won't try anything else. And then I'll recommend it, like I'm praising my (unborn) child for their amazing talent in the elementary school play.. . I also like to reference children that I do not have performing in school plays that don't exist. . . That said....I LOVE Gingergrass despite having been introduced to Gingergrass by my latest frenemy who should die a painful death. One day, when she wasn't crazy, or rather, when she hid it better, she brought me a Vietnamese beef sammich. Now, whenever I'm in LA, Gingergrass is always on my shortlist of places to visit for the beef sandwich with an extra side of chips, thank you very much. Every time I go there, my boyfriend always tries something different on an (previously) endless quest for his "beef sandwich." After countless attempts, he's resolved to picking up a fish taco nearby and both us taking it to go. . . The few times I have eaten there, the service is pretty blahzay. So I avoid having to pay my catholic guilt-forced 20% (POST TAX) tip by always taking my meal to go. Remember to order your sandwich early because apparently my undying love for the sandwich doesn't end with me. They tend to sell out of it by 7. Why? I don't know. In the world of people who want to run a business efficiently, you sense something popular, you make sure you have enough to last a night.. . But hey, that's life in MY world of rational thinking.
