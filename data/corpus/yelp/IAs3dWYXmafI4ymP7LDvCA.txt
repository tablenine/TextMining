Every girl has a different bar for determining whether a boy likes her. Mine is whether he will take me here. It's not the cost, but the experience. I love the presentation of the meal, the atmosphere, the subdued lighting, the booths, the mashed potatoes.... . EXCEPT: This has happened 2 out of 2 times, which is why I gave it three instead of four stars. Two birthdays. 2 different months, 2 different servers. I told the front desk and each server ahead of time and each server forgot!!!
