Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Not exactly the easiest place to get to, but well worth the trip. Nice crispy taco shell, tons of shredded cheese on top, and instead of ground beef, it's made with some sort of shredded beef, so good! I preferred the food here over the (supposedly) more authentic El Taurino.
