A kid in the candy store?? Bakery delight. You must get the Cuban Steak sandwich and the Guava smoothie!!! incredible. Also they have every kind of baked good, bread, cupcake, even steak salad!!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the parking is out of control, the seating is very limited, the lines are crazy, but the food comes fast and its totally worth the wait.
