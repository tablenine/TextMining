So I definitely think that this place is overhyped. Is it good, yes? Does it have some cool sausage's that you may never see anywhere else? Sure. But its just ok, nothing special. Fries were yummy, but I was unimpressed with my mozzarella and sun dried tomato sausage, and I found the people actually serving the food to be uninterested in making the dinning experience any better. They have a good beer selection, but I'm really in no rush to go back, I think i'd prefer a bacon wrapped dirty dog and go to some other bar.
