The sushi was fair... I've had better, and cheaper for that matter.  The last time we were there it was a Sunday night and the sake was half priced.  The service was fair.  The manager was a bit standoffish when we asked him to please turn down the music.  It was so loud that it was almost impossible to carry on a conversation.  But I do agree with the other Yelpers that the ambiance is very cool.  Go for the atmosphere and if you want to whole "LA experience".
