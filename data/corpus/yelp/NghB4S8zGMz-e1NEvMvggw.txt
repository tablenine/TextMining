Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
They make it known that they're old... we got a spiel and a pamphlet as we entered the place.  I did read later on Wikipedia that this location isn't actually the original restaurant... it's only been at 1001 Alameda since 1951.  The crowd was generally older too; we were some of the youngest there.. . They have a few old-timey snacks like pickled pigs feet and pickled eggs.  Apparently everything was pickled in the early 1900s.. . I'm used to getting au jus in a cup with modern French dip sandwiches, that's not the case here.  If I'd checked Yelp beforehand I would have known to ask for it double dipped or wet, but basically it was a roll lightly brushed with juice, plus meat and cheese if you want it.  I got the turkey with American cheese, a pickle, and an iced tea.  It was all okay.  I was glad that it was relatively cheap, especially for drinks.  I guess the main goal here is just to say you've been to Philippe's.  I'm glad I checked out this landmark LA restaurant, and I plan on going again to see if a "wet" sandwich is any better.. . It's cash only, fyi
