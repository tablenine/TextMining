Restaurant: Cameli&#39;s Gourmet Pizza Joint
Category: Pizza
Ah, the great Atlanta pizza debate. May it never end.. . I know a lot of people swear by Savage Pizza in L5P. Others like the New York style slices at Rosa's on Broad St. And nobody seems to have anything bad to say about the pie at Little Five Points Pizza.. . But for my money, Cameli's is where it's at.. . I used to go to Cameli's for lunch. I'd sit and get a monster slice with a sweet tea and read Creative Loafing. That one slice was all I needed and the tea kept my blood sugar (way) up.. . The Pizza at Cameli's is thin crust. The outer crust is tough and chewy, the way crust should be. The sauce is tangy and the cheese and other ingredients are fresh.
