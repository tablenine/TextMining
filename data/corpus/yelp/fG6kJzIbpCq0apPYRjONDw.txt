Just left the LA Wine Festival at Raleigh Studios in disappointment for the lack of food, we head over to C &amp; M for more vino and real food.. . They don't sell alcohol, but they own the wine shop next door?????A little strange, but whatever. So, they open at 5 and we were the first ones there at 5:15. Awesome. I love special attention. I went next door to buy a great Spanish wine (only appropriate for the meal we were about to partake). Awesome, no corkage fee. But, they serve wine in little juice cups; whatever. The ambiance was cool and trendy, warehousey. . . Food: We just ordered food to completely cover our 4 top. There was octopus, manchego cheese, asparagus, beet salad, abondigas, sauteed mushrooms, steamed mussels, flatbread, shrimp and a bunch of stuff I can't remember at this point. I do remember not liking the shrimp, it was the strangely unbearable sweet sauce. YUCK! The mushrooms were not properly sauteed. They didn't allow the alcohol to burn off, so they just turned out to be slimy, garlicky and alcoholy. . . On the flip side: the abondigas (meatballs) were fantastic!! They served it with a cilantro sauce. The octopus was tender and really savory. . . Overall, the food and the wine and the full bellies made for a good time. This a good group thing but not worthy of date night.
