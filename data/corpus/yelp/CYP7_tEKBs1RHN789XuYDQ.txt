After giving much thought, this place is not as good as i initially thought. The ramen is aite and Â the broth is pretty damn good. The other rice bowls and other shits can suck my pee pee. So with that being said, compared to Hakata in Gardena where the BROTH, RAMEN, OTHER DISHES, ATMOSPHERE, VARIETY and CHOICES DESTROYS DAIKOKUYA with a baseball bat. seriously. period. foreal. im not playing. like you got knocked the fuck out chris tucker friday debo shit. . . FOREAL
