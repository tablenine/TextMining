Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I've never felt more uncomfortable in dining experience. We were sat at the " bar" which had no booze and was just us facing wall. Â This is not my kind of burger place. I really wanted to like unami and i dont care about spending good money on a good burger. This burger had no wow factor, the service was awful, fries were awful, the waiter was a sarcastic hipster, and there was no beer served. . . Go find the grill em all truck if you want a good LA burger.
