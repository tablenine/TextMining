Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I wont go into a long diatribe on this place but my wife and I have given it plenty of chances to say the least. The service is consistently terrible and cavalier at times. For $11 bucks for a sandwich the food is average at best. I feel that if they could cut the menu in half and do things better rather than have more items and be less than average it would be a better place. . . Bottom line, I support this community heavily but after 6 times there, I wont go back.
