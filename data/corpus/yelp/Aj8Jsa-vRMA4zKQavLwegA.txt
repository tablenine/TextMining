pulled up to the curb, rockstar parking. bingo.. two-top open right next to the car. bingo.. not too many melrose douchebags around...puhhh...the one right behind me gets up as we sit down, bumping into the back of my chair...i hear him tell the girl he's with: "i'm a popular guy, people like me" (in a persian accent) and they walk into the sunset, uhh, his convertable beamer...at least he opened her door first.... . food: minutes too late for the $7.95 breakfast deals before 11am, but who cares?. what did matter was that they were out of the crabcakes for my benedict, no crab today...but who cares? there is a real black forest ham, WITH BACON, benedict. forkin right!!!. poached egg on toasted croissant.. that is the best ham in LA.. . delicious.. . the potatoes were weird though: 1/8 " thick slices, cut down further into segments, ok, but they came out soggy and burned.(??). (here's my recommendation: parboil the spuds, then golden-brown 'em to a slight crunch in butter/olive oil blend.). (just sayin...). . i still like the place. a lot. the owner kamil kicks ass
