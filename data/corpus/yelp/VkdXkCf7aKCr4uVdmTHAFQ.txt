Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: American (New)
Good, New-American type food. I enjoyed it. . . My fiance and I took his mom and his brother here while they were in town. We wanted something relaxed, but SMART, you know? Well, Uncommon Ground is just that. . . We started off with some goat cheese artichoke dip, which was FANTASTIC. I had to restrain myself from licking the container it was in. I LOVE GOAT CHEESE. It came with toasted pieces of buttered bread for dipping. . . Next, I had some halibut on carrot risotto with parsnips on the side. Very good. I died when I ate the carrot risotto - it was so creamy and flavorful! The fish went perfectly with it. I literally cleaned my plate. I contemplated holding up my plate to the waitress, and asking a-la-Oliver, "Can I please have some more?" . . I restrained myself. . . For dessert we shared banana bread/chocolate chip bread pudding and chocolate cake. The bread pudding was good (it came with whiskey gelato), but it was a little burned. I hear the chocolate cake was good as well (it came with mint gelato). . . Our waitress was incredibly friendly and the food presentation was beautiful. Obviously, it was delicious.. . A good time. I'd be back most definitely.
