Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
First things first.  Canter's is an institution, and if you're looking to visit because it's one of the seventeen Jewish delicatessens listed on Wikipedia, don't be deterred by criticism of the food.  That said, bring your camera the first time, because it's only worth going out of your way for once.. . I've been to Canter's more than once, as it turns out, because it is open 24 hours, and it is kind of a cool spot that's not too hard to wind up in when you live in L.A.  The place seems to be busy at all hours of every day, and the clientele represents as wide a slice of the city as you're likely to see under one roof.  The decor is very old school, with Formica tabletops and framed photographs on plain walls.  The kaleidoscope light fixtures add a bit of color, but you don't really hit up Canter's for the edgy interior.. . And you shouldn't make a destination out of what is essentially average food.  This is especially true between 8 AM and 4 PM any day except Sunday - in other words, whenever Langers is open.  You won't find that bona fide knock-out pastrami at Canter's.  You'll get a reasonably tasty sandwich with passable rye and meat that's well-seasoned and not too fatty.  The matzoh ball soup is another Jewish deli staple that pales in comparison to Langers' version.  The matzoh ball tastes okay, but has a sort of wet paper texture and it doesn't float.  The soup itself is very salty with flavors akin to Campbell's chicken noodle.  The pickles, at least, are rather delicious.. . So to recap and stress my first point - don't bother with Canter's if you're in it for a great deli and nothing else.  But if you want to drag your feet over some well-worn Los Angeles carpet, do drag your ass to Fairfax - in landmark status, even Langers doesn't quite stand up.
