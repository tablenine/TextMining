Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
I grew up down the street from this place, and some of my family lives across the street from it now. I can't find anthing bad to say about Manuels (what tepeyac is known as) I live their machaca burritos, and their large plates. the inside is small, that's why there will ALWAYS be a line and if you're smart you'll call your order in and just pick it up. During lunce I will never show up, too smart for that.. . If you want to try some good food this will be the place to go. Manuel the owner is a flirt and he will make you take a shot if he likes you, but he likes everyone, especially the ladies.
