1 fish. 2 fish. huge-snapper-with-the-head-still-attached-red-fish. blue fish. . And the place is shaped like a boat! SOLD!. . We got the platter for 3...there were 4 of us...and we had a TON of leftovers. . . Their mango-something (tasted more citrusy than anything) frozen margarita went well w/ the platter.. . Service was good and quick...till she forgot for like a half hour to bring us our check...but I was so full at that point I wasn't ready to do such things as...stand up...or....walk myself home.. . I'll be back!. . 29/52
