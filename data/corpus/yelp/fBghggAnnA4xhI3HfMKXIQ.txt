Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Really good tacos here, and their guacamole is delicious too.. It's not a very well-kept secret though... at any time, there's a really long line either outside or inside. On the weekends, the wait takes forever.. Still, nothing satisfies like around 4-5 Tito's tacos.. Ignore the late-night TV commercial though, which is one of the worst commercials I've seen, and actually nudges me into NOT going!
