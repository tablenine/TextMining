Go for the salad bar if you want keep it classy, but really it's all about the perfectly-roasted meats and cheese bread. Their tres leches is rich, but damn good too. I see myself going back to this place time and again. It's a hedonistic paradise for meat lovers and gentile wolverines... drop what you're doing and just go dammit, this place is awesome.
