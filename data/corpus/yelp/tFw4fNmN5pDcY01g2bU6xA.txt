Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I didn't know what Pinks was until I passed by it on my way to Social.  Mind you, I just moved here so I don't know where the food craze is yet!  And clearly, people wrapped around the building and down the street is where its at! What can I say, I heard it is all about the "snap" of the hot dog which makes it sooo good. Don't hate me, but I could just go for a classic Polish dog from Cosco. I guess it is the experience of Pink's that makes it. You gota do Pinks just once, stand in the line with the people, here the snap of the dog when you bite into it and just enjoy the ambience of beautiful LA...(har har har).
