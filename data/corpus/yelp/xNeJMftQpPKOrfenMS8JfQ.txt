Really cute decor.  Good service.  Really good food (at least what my party tried).  The parking situation is AWFUL.  I went in the late morning on Friday and was woefully unprepared to have to drive around for half an hour trying to find a spot.  We eventually just parked in the CVS parking lot, but I ate really quickly because I was so nervous about getting towed (I'm a goody two-shoes).. . I had the Pangaea (From their menu: grilled roti [indian flat bread] topped with two scrambled or fried eggs and spiced tomato sauce. served with hummus, feta cheese, kalamata olives and cucumber-onion salad) and it was delicious.  Others in my party had the Belgian waffle with fruit and breakfast tacos.  Everyone enjoyed the food a great deal... I heard no complaints about the food.  It was a really nice place to have breakfast/brunch.
