Restaurant: Pho Dai Loi
Category: Vietnamese
After a long night out drinking there is no other cure than a good ole bowl of Pho. I was a bit skeptic of pho in Atlanta, but my friend who took me to this spot swore by it and she was definitely right. Again the first sign of any legit Asian restaurant is seeing who eats there. Of course on a Sunday afternoon there better be a slew of Vietnamese and that was definitely the case. We ordered pho, vermicelli and both spring/summer rolls and I'll vouch for the authenticity that I've had in Philly, Virginia, Orange County and Dallas.
