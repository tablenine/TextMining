Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
I love Ian's. My favorite pizza in the city. Just be adventurous and actually try some of the creative pizzas they have, it annoys me when I bring people here and they just get a slice of cheese and pepperoni after I hype it up so much. You won't be disappointed.
