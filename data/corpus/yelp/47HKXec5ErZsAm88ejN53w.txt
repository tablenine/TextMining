I'm not sure if my standards for breakfast/brunch are just ridiculously high, but I have yet to find ONE place that impresses me with their breakfast cookery.. . Stopped in to Deleece this morning around 11:30 for brunch. No wait! BOOM CITY. . . Alright, so one of the cooks/chefs comes out looking as if he has not seen a shower since February. I am in the industry, and generally do not care about the appearance of the person making my food, but seriously. It was gross. . . I am not into calling people out on service but... let's just say that our server left a lot to be desired. A lot. . . On to the food! I heard about Deleece's breakfast mac and cheese. This excited me. Bacon and eggs and MACARONI AND CHEESE?! I quickly scanned the menu... scanned some more... FUCK! It's not on the menu. Disappointed, I ordered the breakfast sandwich. This came with white cheddar, eggs, bacon and spinach on sourdough. I won't go through everything wrong with this meal. But my bacon was verging on raw, and the eggs were so overcooked they literally had brown crispy edges. It came with the most revolting oily "roasted" potatoes which were completely unseasoned except for some rosemary. . . My dining companion ordered the corned beef hash. This was actually well seasoned, but jeez louise it was greasy. It came with gross flavorless melon, burned eggs, and toast (the best part of this plate).. . I feel like this review is really scathing, but I was very very disappointed with our meal and the service. I won't be coming back.
