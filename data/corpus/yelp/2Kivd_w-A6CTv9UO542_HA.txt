Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
we came here a couple of years ago to celebrate a raise. i will be absolutely honest with you -- the sole reason i chose this place was because david and victoria beckham had just moved to the LA area and came here on one of their first date nights. we came here for dinner the very following night. i figured that this place MUST be good if they chose to eat here on one of their very first dates in LA from europe?!?! . . okay so anyways, this restaurant is really low-key. so low-key that it's pretty easy to miss on the street. when you walk through the doors it seriously feels like you have stepped into a foreign country. the ambiance is wonderful!! we had the seat on the inside of the restaurant but right up against the open window. i did think it was weird for my side to be sharing one long bench with the people sitting at the tables along my right. the foie gras appetizer and the rack of lamb entree was absolutely delicious. service was friendly and attentive with my broken ankle and all!
