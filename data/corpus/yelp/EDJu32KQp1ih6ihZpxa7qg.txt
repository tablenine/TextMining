BRAVO!  The chef can cook fish...and in my opinion, that is a big deal and especially difficult to find in Chicago.  The flavors are interesting and compliment the seafood...sauces are not overbearing.. . Four stars because, like many other yelpers, I found the attitude of some of the staff a bit too cold and snobbish.  My first visit was a service disaster as the waitress never once looked at me, but focused solely on my boyfriend...it was so deliberate and bizarre, but that was a couple of years ago...during our latest visit, the service was fair.. . So, I probably won't return soon...the food is good, but it is not my favorite place and just doesn't wow me or seem very welcoming...
