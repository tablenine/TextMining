i'm in atlanta for work and had heard really great things about this place  and i've gotta say it is pretty spot on.  located right next to a river, it's a really nice relaxing atmosphere (would make for a really nice date night).  very interesting menu, a more modern fancy pants take on classic, rustic comfort food.  . . do yourself a favor and order the beet salad.  i'm not really a fan of beet salad in general, but seriously, amazing.. . i also had the rabbit (poor little rabbit), which was slow roasted over a bed of bacon ravioli and swiss chard lightly covered in an amazing candied-garlic sauce.  (yes, i did say bacon ravioli - freaking brilliant!). . everyone at our table was extremely happy with their meals as well.  service was friendly, however, timings in between courses were a bit slow.. . overall a great find in atlanta.  crowd was a bit older/stuffy/mercades driving, but their prices were fair $20-$32 / entree.... . if you live in atl or are visiting, i really recommend this place.  also, theres a bowl of those chewy mint things near the exit (i freakin love those things).
