Restaurant: Manny&#39;s Coffee Shop &amp; Deli
Category: Delis
Manny's is a Chicago institution.  . . The food is served cafeteria style, so if you're looking for a corned beef or pastrami sandwich, you have to squeeze by the ole fogies who are waiting for the daily specials up front.  i usually get the pastrami on kaiser w/ pickle and latke.  The fruit salad if quite delicious- ripe and sweet, which is unusual for a cafeteria-type spot.. . Sandwiches are pricey, but unless you're a heifer it'll last two meals.  Gino is very friendly, has a few tricks, and always pokes fun of my friend who grew up with Manny's once a week.. . The only beef I have with Manny's (ha) is that it lacks any sort of atmosphere in the dining areas.  I understand that it caters to the wham-bam in-n-out lunch crowd, but the space reminds me of a generic low-budge banquet hall.
