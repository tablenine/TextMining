Lively restaurant with a wide selection of fresh seafood.  The halibut, butterfish and mahi were all fresh and prepared with tasty sauces and fresh sides.  We ordered the wedge and poached pear salads, and both were nicely prepared but somewhat small in size.  The waiter recommended the two signature deserts, which we ordered during our dinner service.  Both were ok, but nothing special.. . The price fixe menu is a real bargain for those looking for a three course dinner for $35.00.
