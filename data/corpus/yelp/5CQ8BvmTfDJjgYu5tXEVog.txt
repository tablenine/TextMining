Restaurant: Medici On 57th
Category: Bakeries
If it weren't for this place Hyde Park would be the worst neighborhood to eat out in the city. Every place else in the HP is mediocre at best, or too ethnic for frequent visits (sorry dudes, but I just can't do Thai more than once a month). The atmosphere is relaxed and homey, but clean, and the staff is attentive.. . Pretty much everything on the Med menu is really enjoyable. My faves are the Moroccan ragout, burgers and pizza. The fries are legendary and the desserts are to die for. I often visit just for a brownie sundae after a long day at the library. It's a perfect place for big parties, especially because it's BYOB!. . Let me expand upon the pizza: In a cluster of pizza places, the Med pizza is just right. Not chewy deep dish crap like Edwardo's, not cardboard with cheese on it like Cholie's. Just PIZZA. Fluffy/crunchy crust with creative, delicious toppings. (Florian is a close runner-up though!)
