Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Whenever I make it to SoCal I have to hit up three places: 1) Roscoes, 2) the Hustler store, and 3) PINK'S.  So far at Pink's, I've ordered:. . -- The Patt Morrison Baja Veggie Dog (during my vegetarian phase): Good, but SO hard to order when you see the other dogs available on the oh-so-meatalicious menu.. . -- L.A. Philharmonic Conductor Gustavo Dudamel Dog:  What the hell was I thinking? I was so disappointed.  It was a stretch hot dog, guacamole, American &amp; Swiss cheese, fajitas mix, jalapeno slice, topped with tortilla chips.  I want to yak just thinking about it.. . -- Bowl of chili: It's like the chili that you use to top your nachos at 7-11 when you buy nachos... mushy and poop-like.   It's probably best to order it only when you're SUPER plastered.  I'd opt for the chili fries instead.. . -- French fries: Okay, but as I stated above... I'd opt for the chili fries instead.  You'll probably be too full from your hot dog to devour the whole thing anyway.  . . -- Some spicy hot dog that I can't remember the name of: BOMBEST THING EVER.   Pretty sure it was one of the spicy polish dog combos.  I guess I'll just have to go back and try them all.  Haha.. . Anyways, I can say that it's not really worth the hour-and-a-half wait if you've already tried it.  I'm sure there are other hot dog places in the area that can give you a decent hot dog with most of the toppings you want.  HOWEVER, it's definitely a cool place to take your noob friends and the wait isn't really that bad if you're in good company.  Nothing is really that bad if you're in good company.  :)
