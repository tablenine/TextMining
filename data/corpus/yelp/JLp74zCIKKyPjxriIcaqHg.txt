Whenever I'm in NYC I try to make it to Buddha Bar.  Not only is the food great (Sushi for example) and the drinks are great, but the restaurant's architecture and decor are like no other -- I mean, you have a giant Buddha in the restaurant!  I love the meatpacking district and there are many great places to eat and hang out in the area.  If you go to NYC, do yourself a favor and go to Buddha bar, only if to get a drink at their fabulous bar.
