Gosh, what happened? I've been wanting to try this place forever and finally made it there. Maybe it's because I went close to closing time but I was sad. They hardly had any desserts out and it was dark inside. . . BUT I will say, they have really tasty ice creams. The banana de leche was sooooo good. Had some cookies, eh ok. Had some cupcakes, eh ok. Just ok. . . Other than that, not impressed so much.
