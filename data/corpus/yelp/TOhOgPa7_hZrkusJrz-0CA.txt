Restaurant: Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant
Category: Chinese
My family came here for lunch for my brother's 36th birthday today. I haven't eaten Chinese food in the San Gabriel Valley for years now but I remember growing up with fond memories of the food. Â Today did not disappoint. The restaurant is quite beautiful and dare I say swanky for a family style seafood place. We ordered the seafood chow fun, squid with black bean sauce, salt and pepper pork chops, deep fried flounder and salt and pepper shrimp. All the portions were generous. The salt and pepper pork chops were tasty, crunchy and finger licking good. The squid with black bean sauce impressed me. This is the dish where most restaurants skimp on the squid and put tons of filler onions and green peppers. There was an impressive heap of steaming tasty squid and a decent portion of onions and peppers. My dream come true. The salt and pepper shrimp was crunchy and delicious. My brother doesn't even like seafood and he ordered 2 plates of the salt and pepper shrimp. I found the seafood chow fun and the flounder decent though not necessarily outstanding. This place makes me wish I lived in LA.
