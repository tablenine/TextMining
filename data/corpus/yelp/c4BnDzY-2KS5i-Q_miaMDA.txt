Is it illegal to have sex with a burger? Cuz after eatin at this place, I now suffer from Umamiphilia... and I'm about to do some autoerotic asphixiation with an Umami Burger in my mouth!  Well... I probably won't go that far, but I'm definitely comin back regularly.. . My favorite burger joint was Lucky Devils in Hollywood... but I like the taste of this a little bit better. The bread, meat and all the other ingredients mix together and just savor in your mouth.  The Original Umami Burger &amp; The SoCal Burger are crazy good.  Can't go wrong with those options.  The onion rings are awesome and the fries are okay. They have this homemade ketchup that like puss... oops, I mean crushed tomatoes!  Pretty tasty!. . I should give this place 4 stars because it's small as hell, valet only and there's a long wait to eat.  But since they let you BYOB (bring you own beer) I'm givin it a 5!  So if you want a 5 star experience like me... walk across the street to A&amp;G Food Mart and buy a 40 oz, crack it open and eat that Umami Burger like it was yo last meal!
