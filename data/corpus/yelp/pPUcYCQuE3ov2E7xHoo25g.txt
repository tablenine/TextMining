Restaurant: Baraonda Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
I had my first dinner at Baraonda last night and really enjoyed it. The patio is a little tight but it was nice to sit outside. We love to share meals so our waitress made some good serving suggestions. I thought the food was top-notch. We split the Bianca Pizza (mozzarella, olives, goat cheese, parmigiano) and the Penne Checca (with fresh roma tomato, mozzarella, garlic, basil, olive oil). . . For the most part, the staff was great. Our waitress was just a little delayed getting to our table so another waiter came over and took our salad order and told us about the specials. I didnt even think we were waiting that long so I wasnt bothered at all. . . ***DO NOT park at the Georgian Terrace! Before we left we checked the website and it definitely said that you could park there, so we did. The hostess was hesitant to stamp our ticket assuring us that we were wrong and that it wouldnt matter. We ended up paying $9 to exit the Georgian Terrace but when we got home and checked the baraonda website again it definitely said to park there. Today the website says to park at Bank of America and there is a sign outside of the restaurant that also says that.
