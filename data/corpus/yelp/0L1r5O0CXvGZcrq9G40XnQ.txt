I've been here a few times now and think I may be done with this restaurant.  The food is only mediocre and the wait staff seem to be preoccupied with trying to look hip to bother to actually serve the customers.. . I've tried the salad, the burger, the chicken sandwich, and their mexican tortilla soup.  I was just not impressed, I'd put in on par with Applebees or the like.. . The place its self has a great atmosphere, its all quite neat and clean and very stylish.  If they spent half as much on improving the staff and food, it would be well worth the money.   . . The price of the food is inflated, I'm guessing they're expecting mostly expense account lunches and drinks and spill off from the conference center.. . SG
