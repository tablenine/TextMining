Ok, let me start by saying that YES, this place is good but sadly I think that MASTRO's maybe better. I rarely eat red meat, but when I do I go for the best.  This place is probably "cooler" thank Mastro's as it def has a younger vibe. I do however grabbing a drink at the Boulevard in the hotel as well.  The drinks are strong and Eduardo is my favorite (server).
