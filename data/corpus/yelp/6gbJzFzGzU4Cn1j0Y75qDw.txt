This place rocks. If you're looking for "fast food" that is actually healthy for you, made from scratch and tasty to boot, this is the place to go. It's a great alternative to Whole Foods or Alon's. They make fresh sandwiches, salads and soups with excellent ingredients, and you can mix and match side dishes. I'd give it five stars, but I think the staff at Alon's is probably a tad more friendly. (Note: the food here is pre-prepared; not made to order)
