Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Not bad, but not the Holy Grail of Mexican food. Yes, the food is plentiful, but what good is that if it's not over-the-top delicious? Even though I lived in Mexico, I'm not such a stickler for authenticity that I'll take a good place out of the running just because it uses cheddar cheese. Tastiness is king. Unfortunately, El Tepeyac doesn't take me there.. I found the comments about the place so passionate though, that I did decide the restaurant merits a blog post:. . . http://cruzandocalifor....
