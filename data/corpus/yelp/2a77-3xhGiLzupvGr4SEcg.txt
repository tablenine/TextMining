When I come to Burbank, this is one of my first stops (besides It's a Wrap). I love their sandwiches. I don't remember the names of them, but one was vegetarian (grilled vegetables and very tasty) and the others had meat. What really makes the sandwiches is the way they are put in the press. . . Oh yes, and I cannot forget the banana chips that come with the sandwiches. Wow - so much better than those banana chips you can find in the bulk section of the health food aisle. . . I also learned that if you come here early in the morning (I think I was here a little after 8:00), you can buy bags of their yummy pastries for next to nothing. I bought a huge bag of dulce de leche cookies for $2. It was heaven. I had enough for me and enough to share. I also threw some in the freezer to have with coffee later in the week. . . It is difficult to find seating, but I prefer to sit outdoors. Inside is kind of bustling and too echo-y to have a conversation.
