Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
First statement: "It's a place you should try at least once."  That's the universal sentiment from a very unscientific poll I've conducted with friends of mine who's been to Urban Belly.  It's uncanny how unanymous this was, however.  The food's undoubtedly good and is worth a try for sure, but there are two issues that hold people from progressing into "can't wait to go again" territory after the first statement.  . . One, it's expensive for what you get... the 'OMG, eight bucks for four pieces of dumplings?' factor still stings long after the savory goodness of the morsels themselves win you over.  Same thing with the ramen noodles where 'wow, this is the new height of ramen-dom I've yet to experience' quickly is overturned by 'OMG, thirteen bucks for a bowl of ramen?'  In the grand scheme of things, $8 appetizer and $13 main isn't shabby, but in Asian countries, these are considered quick and easy street snacks, and I can't seem to shake off this Asian-boy mentality.. . Second, the decor.  It didn't work for me.  It's got the dark, hushed gray theme and wooden furnishings... a feeling of gravity to it which I'd normally find pleasing, but it's also got these self-service utility carts and exposed beverage cases that doesn't make it feel casual, as opposed to being just awkward.  The wonderful wooden tables have a glass top to protect the wood, which lessens the natural impact of the wood, and all in all, I was amused by the decor than anything.  It's just didn't create this linger-with-friends-over-BYOB-beverages type coziness I thought it was shooting for.. . So, go try Urban Belly for sure.  It'll probably become your favorite noodle place.  You'll then have to do a bit of soul searching to figure out if you can justify the prices for yoruself.
