My BF and I had two pizzas, wine, and one dessert.  $68 later we left with satisfied bellies.  We had reservations at 10:30 pm last night and had to wait about 10 minutes for our table.  This place is loud and packed!  We had the tomato and oregano and another one with squash blossoms and mozzarella.  I  was famished by 10:30 pm, so I don't know if I was just really hungry or geniunley enjoyed the pizza.  I probably ordered the most simple pizza on the menu, but I was very impressed!  This place is indeed over-hyped, but the pizza is different from the usuals that I frequent (Mulberry, Albanos --yummy).  We were looking at the large amount of crusts and just wished we had some great marinara sauce to dip it in.  Our server was very nice and patient, she really helped us out in find a wine to go with our meal.  The yogurt gelato that we had was satisfactory.  None of their desserts are very rich.  I was yearning for something chocolatey, but they don't have that on the menu.  The tables are very close to one another, so close, that you had to move your table to get out of your seat.
