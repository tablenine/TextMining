Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Ugo gets 4 stars in my book for their delicious gelato. I personally think it is the best gelato I have ever had (in California). I have taken so many friends here and they all loved the gelato. Â There are so many selections and it is all very good. . . As for the food, I don't think it is great.
