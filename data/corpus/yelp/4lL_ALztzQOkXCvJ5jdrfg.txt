Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
You travel through the dimension of horrid people of every kind of characteristic..some peddling themselves on the street corner for money...others sit thoughtless in what is to become  the Twilight Zone. . It's late midnight on the Hollywood scene..as we look for this Hot Dog stand that was well advertised on TV, as one of those gourmet foods restaurant.. . We approach the area and we see a lengthly sea of people around the corner and begin to look for parking. The line blocks the driveway for parking..but we manage to get through...with a few patrons under the wheel. . Once in line..you begin meeting weird strangers. They get in your conversation and you get in there conversation. People driving by, yell at you, press there horns, throw stuff at you and of course you hear the howling of sirens blaring through the LA. streets...cars chasing other cars...and an occasional shots fired...typical hoodlum night. . Made it to the window. They have an assembly line of half dead workers making the food. .    Your stuck with one person and they make your order. They look at you..you look at them.. and blurt out your unusual order that will forever change your life.....maybe? .     My friend ordered the Lucille Ball hot dog..and I forgot what I ordered..but it was good. People disappeared into the night. The evening ends as we travel out of LA. and back out of the Twilight Zone. . \
