Kamehachi is the best place for authentic Japanese food in the city of Chicago.  The atmosphere is wonderful, and the food is delicious.  I go there every other week.  Prices are reasonable.  Great place for a date as well (which is usually the case for me) The Sushi &amp; Sashimi Combination is an excellent choice!!
