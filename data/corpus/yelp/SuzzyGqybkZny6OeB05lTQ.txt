Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
My new favorite diner.. . First of all, the menu is huge. They have everything from a huge breakfast menu, to appetizers, to lunch sandwiches, and full dinners like pasta and others. The selection is huge. . . What we ordered:. Onion Rings. Vanilla Milkshake to share (real ice cream!). Swiss Avocado Chicken Sandwich. Hot Open Faced Turkey Sandwich. Cream of Chicken and Rice Soup. . All of it was excellent. And our waitress - super friendly. When you order a sandwich, you get a choice of tons of sides... and one of them is mac and cheese. It is the creamiest, homemade mac and cheese I've had in a long time. I'd be fine making it a meal. Of course, we didn't finish everything so we brought stuff home - and it was still very good the next day. On the way out, when we were paying we spoke to the guy for a little bit and he was so friendly and welcomed us back and told us his favorite menu items. Really nice place, cozy atmospere, good food, friendly staff, and huge selection. Love Stella's!
