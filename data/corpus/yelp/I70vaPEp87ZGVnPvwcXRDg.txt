I love Noche! The staff, the food, the drinks, the atmosphere, the music, the patio....everything is fabulous! They have specials nearly every night and they are all totally worth fighting the crowd over!. . * $1 beer (Dos Equis) on Sundays. * $10 ALL YOU CAN EAT, yes!...all you can eat, tapas on Mondays. * $5 Margaritas/$5 Sangria/$3 Vodka drinks/$2 Tecate EVERY day of the week. . Doesn't get much better than that. . . Tapas you MUST try out: the Grilled NY Strip Steak with Chipotle Au Jus, the Sun-burnt Tuna Steak with Mole Amarillo (my personal favorite!), Fried Chicken with Chipotle Mashed Potatoes and Natural Jus, Fried Lobster Tail with Spicy Apricot Glaze, and ANY of the tacos (grilled chicken, crispy fish, lobster, &amp;/or grilled steak) -- all of the above are out of this world good. So good.. . Lots of good drinks and shots paired with awesome bartenders that will definitely take good care of you! Go, go, go!
