Best Brazilian BBQ place in LA!  I don't think I have eaten this much in my LIFE!  We had our green light (meaning keep serving me!) on the whole time and it was just a race between the server, the meat, me and my stomach.  I was literally trying to clear the plate before the server came so there would me more room on the plate... I love the cheese ball... I probably ate the whole basket full of it.  I had no shame in being the carnivorous beast at such fancy restaurant because the food was just so fantastic!  Next time I go, I will slow down a bit and act like a lady haha!
