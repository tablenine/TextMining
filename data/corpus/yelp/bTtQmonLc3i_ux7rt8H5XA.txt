Restaurant: Crepe Revolution
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
When I first learned about that Crepe Revolution was opening in West Village, I was really excited.  The only viable breakfast options in the area are a Waffle House and a J. Christopher down the street, and I thought a fast casual crepe spot would be perfect for the post college UGA and Georgia Tech folks that flock to West Village.  Imagine my surprise, then, to learn that the "revolution" part of Crepe Revolution is that they operate predominantly as a lunch and dinner restaurant, and that their breakfasts are limited to weekends.  I was also surprised to see how elegantly appointed the restaurant is (my wife calls it pretentious), and that it has a full bar.  These choices shift Crepe Revolution from breakfast place, in which there's little competition, into a market in which neighboring McCray's has the casual bar scene on lock, and Lime has a pretty strong hold on the sophisticated bar hopper.  It doesn't make much sense to me, but, hell, I'm not a restaurateur.  . . The crepes here are pretty good, though I do wish they were a bit crispier around the edges.  They have a huge number of options, of both the savory and sweet variety.  I find them to be huge as well, it seemed like they put a half a chicken in my chicken pesto.  The service is also extremely friendly, and I was more than pleased to see they hired one of my favorites from Rev Coffee.  I only wish they'd do something more for the breakfast crowd.
