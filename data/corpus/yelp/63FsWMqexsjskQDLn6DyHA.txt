Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie

this place is not worth the wait for what they say. i ate here on feb.28, 09 and had to wait for an hour. I though it was going to be a great pizza. when we ordered the special it looked good, but eating it was not so good.  the crust was this and a little burned and like cardboard.. you are better off buying a frozen pizza like di gorno, or  cpk. I warned you not to wast your time waiting. go to mozza for a great great food, pizza..in melrose and highland. good luck.
