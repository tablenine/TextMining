Wow. The food here is AMAZING. You defiantly get what you pay for. This place made the food I normally dislike taste wonderful. . . What to order:. -Buricotti (from the mozzerella bar). - Maccheroni alla Chitarra . - Crisp Duck al Mattone. - Grilled Beef Tagliata. . What to drink: . - a full bodied red wine. they also give you the whole careff too. . . Service: A. . waiters and servers are attentive to your every need. when you leave, someone comes and fold your napkin. when your friend is in the bathroom and you want to wait until the person comes back to start eating, they put a silver cover to keep your food warm. i've never been served so great, even for a fine dining restaurant. . . food is pricey, but well worth it.
