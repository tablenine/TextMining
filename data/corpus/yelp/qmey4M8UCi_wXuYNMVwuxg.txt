I heart diners and this place is no exception.. . Check out the matzo ball soup... it's one giant grapefruit sized matzo ball in a bowl of delicious soupy goodness. The cheesecake is excellent as well... New York Style... but New York prices also, ouch! . . There's not much else like it in the area so if you're going here you have to at least give it a star for even existing so far south in the loop. And I think this is a place that has a range of quality on their menu... not everything is great. I got a veggie omelet once and it was pretty awful, i think it just had tomato on it and maybe pesto sauce? It was weird. . . Stick with something traditional and diner-y and you shouldn't go wrong. . . PS- their service is fabulous. Very sweet, good people.
