Juicy (or more aptly known, Soup) dumplings that even beat Manhattan's Joe's Shanghai...I've been hearing about this place from my formerly resided Alhambra friend (who happened to live just down the street from this find) for over 5yrs before I stepped into this dumpling haven.. Yes, it's worth waiting in line to eat here...but, if you can't handle the queue, just show up 20 mins before opening and you'll be served up right. Or, you may want to race over across the parking lot to their second (smaller) location to nab a table.. I personally prefer the regular fare juicy dumplings over the much hyped mini dumplings w/soup that is only served (while quantities last) on weekends, but, you have to try them once to see for yourself.. The appetizer vegetables and the fried rice cake ovulets are also delicious accompaniments to your dumplings.. If you left room for dessert, head over next door to the Phoenix Bakery &amp; Cafe for their assorted rice cakes, walnut tarts and hot dessert "porridges."
