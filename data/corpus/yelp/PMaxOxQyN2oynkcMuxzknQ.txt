Huge fan! ... I don't get good Thai food often in the OC and my friends lean more towards late night Korean after clubbing in the Hollywood area... But the few times i've been to Ruen Pair, it was delicious! And those times I was sober :) ... I wish we would go there more often!. . Anyways... my fav is the porriage combo. Basically it's a biiiiig bowl of white rice porriage with a big plate of sides like black eggs, preserved veggie, salty egg, asian sausage... *drool* just thinking about it... I've had a few other dishes and they are also very delish!
