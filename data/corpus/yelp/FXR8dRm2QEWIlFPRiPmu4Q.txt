Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
Have been here twice, and didn't love either experience.  The employees are impersonal, and the champagne cocktails all suck.  Would be a cute date place, but it gets so crowded on the weekends that it feels like a trendy lounge.  It's much more intimate on weekdays.  Cocktails average $11/glass, which is typical, but the majority of the drink list is by the glass or bottle.  You can get import beer too (one of which was $55 a bottle).  Decor is swanky, and the atmosphere and lively.  The average age of the crowd was maybe 35+.  I'd come here again but only because it is convenient.  They play jazz in another room, but they charge cover.
