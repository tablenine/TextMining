If you've ever seen that straight-to-video movie called the "Ramen Girl," you'll know that the lead character trains under a master ramen chef in Japan. He yells at her a lot, she cries a lot. The chef tells her she must put her heart and soul into the preparation of the broth. After a year of arduous training in Japan, she makes ramen topped with... corn, tomatoes, and peppers? Go figure.. . Aside from saving you 2 hours of your life in watching the movie, I thought it was interesting in providing a little bit of insight into the work that goes into making ramen. I've yet to visit Japan, so I can't vouch for the authenticity. All I do know, is that the flavors from the ramen broth don't come from some little packet of seasonings. Safe to say, that holds true here at this Little Tokyo location. . . I thoroughly enjoyed my kotteri style bowl of the house special ramen. The broth was intensely rich and flavorful, yet not overly salty. I was a bit disturbed by the molecules of pork fat floating on the top of the broth. The website says it's back fat. People are trying to get rid of their back fat by hitting the gym, and now I'm slurping it? Sounds bad, yes. But it perfectly clung onto every strand of noodle for some added back-fat flavor. . . The slices of pork was buttery and meaty at the same time. The bamboo and sprouts provided a nice and fresh, crunchy contrast in texture. There was a subtle hint from the strands of seaweed. Even the hearty mound of chopped green onions was tasty. And that egg? I could've eaten about a dozen of those. I'm sold on oozy and gooey yolk.
