I'm probably in the minority here, but I think this place is totally overrated! The best part about it is the mixed crowd. Very diverse, which is always nice to see. . But in a restaurant, the best of anything should be the food, and I think the food here is just fine if you like a gut-bomb. I;ve been here twice, and after the first time never imagined going back, but ended up there again recently, not by choice. . The arugula salad was fine. Their signature appetizer of roasted garlic (roasted to a near pulp) in oil served with rolls was so-so. The melted cheese appetizer with crunchy toasts was quite good. I forget the name. . But my sea bass was horrific. I got the asparagus preparation which meant I got a plate of sea bass (a rather small cut for the price), a few spears of asparagus, and a pile of moroccan couscous DRENCHED in oil. Absolutely the most oily plate of food I have ever eaten. I felt like I could only eat the top layer for fear of a heart attack.. I don't even remember what I got the first time, it was forgettable. . The ambience in the bar is kind of cheesy but it's fine. The restaurant design feels like a gimmick that would have been considered classy in the mid-80s. . Sorry. I don't think this garlic joint compares to the rest of the places on "Restaurant Row" in Beverly Hills. I've been to Mortons and Benihana, which are better, but they all kind of seem like so-so, overpriced cruise ship food to me.
