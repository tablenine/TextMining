Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
All you can eat Korean BBQ for a great price? (If I remember correctly, it was $15 per person.) For it's price, this place offers a very good deal.. . I've been to a lot of Korean BBQ places, and honestly, I have to say other places do offer better quality meat, but hey, with a price like this I am not going to complain. They have a lot of pan chan (side dishes) and dipping sauces, so overall, the taste is pretty good. I'm more than satisfied everytime I visit this place.
