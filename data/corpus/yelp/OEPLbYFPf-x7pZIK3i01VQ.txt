Don't be fooled by the 3 star review.... there is absolutely nothing wrong with Feast. Everything is good and sometimes thats all I need in a place that can keep my bill under $30.00. The menu is solid with a wide variety of menu choices for breakfast (which is served all day), lunch and brunch. I've never been here for dinner but I believe it would be just as solid as my day dining at Feast has been on many occasions. . . I really like the blackbean burger with avocado and chipotle mayo and the breakfast croissant rocks..... Â  and there are tons of other options that are suitable for a casual lunch while shopping around Bucktown.... . . Don't expect fabulous decor, service or jazzy specials..... not at Feast my friend. But they do have a great patio for eating outside once the weather defrosts here a bit. . . My fav highlight of Feast is they don't close down during the hours between lunch and dinner so you can always find an open door to a late lunch or early dinner and sometimes I need that a lot more than fancy presentation and fusion flavors.
