Had a fabulous afternoon here while whiling away time between meetings and dinner last time in NYC.  They didn't have Wi-Fi, but I picked up a signal from nearby, the staff was totally cool (like, you kinda want them to be your friends they're so cool) and they have wine.  Hear that?  They've got VINO!  Cute decor, too, intriguing-looking patrons, and nibbles to boot.  So much kitsch, and it works.  The dog theme is rockin.  Sold.
