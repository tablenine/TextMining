I'm not going to lie.  My friend and I were hoping to spot someone famous here.  I'm officially not a fan of The Hills (having watched only one episode in its entirety), but even I know that Lauren and her posse hang here on occasion. We saw no stars, but what we did see (and taste!) was some yummy yummy food.  To me, that's what's most important.  . . Everything, and I mean everything, looks completely delectable.  You'll undoubtedly spend 20 minutes plus on the sidewalk waiting to be seated, and in that time the entire menu will pass by your greedy eyes.  Within five minutes I decided that I wanted a wrap, a salad, a burger, a scrumptious salad, sweet potato fries (!!!),  perhaps a cup of fruit -- hell, I wanted it all. . . I decided on the Chicken Chow salad with a side of sweet potato fries (to tide over my carb craving, of course).  The salad was fresh, and interesting: grilled veggies &amp; chicken breast, feta, cucumber, tomatoes, all topped with a yummy house vinaigrette.  I was happy. Order just the half salad, as that's plenty.  I can't imagine what the full size looks like, or who could eat it.  The sweet potato fries were also great -- they had a nice, crunchy outer texture.  The "side" portion is ginormous, more like a pig trough than a bowl meant for humans.  We didn't complain though! . . A fun place to grab a bite (if you don't mind waiting just a tad), and I doubt you'll leave unfulfilled.   I hear breakfast is also fabulous, but busier.
