The Atlanta classic!  Where else can you go anymore to have the greasiest of greasy foods (it's like the Exxon Valdez crashed here) brought directly to you while you sit in your car.  And don't forget to top it all off with a Frosted Orange.  Yum!  Make sure you have a good health plan first though.
