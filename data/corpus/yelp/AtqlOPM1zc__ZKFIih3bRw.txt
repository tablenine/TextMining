Category: Southern
Had my first taste of Roscoe's 4th of July weekend and it was well worth the wait!!!! Â . . My sister and a friend joined in the goodness. We each ordered the waffle combo with wings plus a side of mac n' cheese.....delish! Just be prepared for a long wait, especially around the late night/early morning hours after the club.
