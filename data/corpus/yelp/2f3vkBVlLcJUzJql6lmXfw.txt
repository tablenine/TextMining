Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
I was in Chicago for a business trip.  Reserved Roy's for dinner based on the wonderful reviews from Yelp.  . . Last week was Restaurant Week in Chicago.  Dinner was $32 for a 3-course meal (two of my co-worker got that).  They also have a winter prix-fixe menu for $35 (one of my co-worker got that).  And I got the regular menu (entree and dessert).  Menu: . http://www.roysrestaur.... . . Comp. edamame was great with a coating of salt, sugar, kayan pepper...gives it a little kick... YUM.  We asked for an extra bowl...and we polished that off too!. . Entree: ROY'S CLASSIC TRIO. Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Roy's Original Blackened Island Ahi &amp; Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish - $29.95. - This dish was perfect - Three pieces of medium size fish.  I personally loved the butterfish (cuz it smooth as butter!), then the ahi, the salmon.  . . Dessert: Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé. - OMG OMG!!! I haven't had a good souffle for a long time.  The melting choc was hot, thick and delish...and great with the vanilla ice-cream!!! To Die For.  Must order if you like choc.. ------------------------. It's a bit pricey to dine here.  But I think it's all worth it, for the great service, great food and great decor.
