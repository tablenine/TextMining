Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
I remember when they used to be only in Glendale and everyone would have to drive there for there great Â pastries, it's great having them so close now, I probably go there once or twice a week.... . I loooove their sandwiches, my personal fave is the Feta sandwich, and not only is it delish its uber economical, you can get anything starting at $2.99, pastries starting as low as .50 cents. . I was just telling a friend last night as we drove by there that I could eat Porto's every day and not get sick of it, Cu's there's always something to pick, they also have the yummiest smoothies..... . plus whether you want to eat there or you're on the go service is great! good ambiance.. . One of the best Bakeries in the Valley, heck in L.A.!!!! MMmmmmm
