Mind-blowing Momma's French Toast and bacon on the level of pork belly. . . Went on Good Friday and only had a limited wait of 15 minutes.  There's a reason there's a line though  - food this good wants to be eaten.  Our server was fantastic.  If you make a point to go one place for breakfast in L.A.  make it The Griddle.. . Food was delicious, though I'd have preferred a Vodka Bloody Mary to the soju one they offered.. . Thank you Wayne Chinsang!
