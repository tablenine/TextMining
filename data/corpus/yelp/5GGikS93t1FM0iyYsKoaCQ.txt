Restaurant: A Taste of Heaven
Category: Bakeries
So many quips can be made about Taste of Heaven based on the name. I unintentionally put a high barometer on the experience I would have here just in that name alone. Me thinks I was not the only one.. . So let me start with some heavenly praise:. . Good Coffee. Slightly above average food. Great sweets to choose from. . Now with the devilish scorn:. . I haven't had bad service but certainly not very cheerful. A little bit pricey for the food that you get. Wait times can be a little long at busy times during the weekend. . I'm sure to come back as I do like their french toast options but the great thing about Chicago is that there are many options for brunch and for now this place is not in my top tier of the brunch rotation! . . I'll taste this place in moderation unless I get a sign from you know who!
