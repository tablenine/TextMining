Restaurant: Cho Sun Ok Restaurant
Category: Korean
Just heard Cho Sun OK was closed temporaily by the Health Department in early 2010. They can kiss my rosy behind goodbye, never going to go there again. Please see what I thought of this restaurant before the Health Department gave it a kick in the butt.. . Probably the best Korean restaurant in Chicago. Their meat is top quality, cooked tableside and all of the food is freshly prepared that morning. While the decor is extremly getto (think 1980s stlye) and you will need to wait to get a table this shouldn't put you off coming here. Their unmarinated beef is amazing and the "burnt" rice they serve near the end of your meal is great (yes I am not asian and I always thought burnt rice should go straight into a trash can). The service will be fast but not friendly as they are too busy dealing with the full restaurant. I have never been to a restaurant like this before but I will go back again.
