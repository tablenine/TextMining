Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I usually HATE sharing things I like with strangers - because I hate strangers and they'll just ruin something I love. But I'm compelled to write this in light of Joe, the owner, passing away 2 weeks ago. My family will miss you.. . THE single best pizza in all of L.A.. I've been eating here with my family since 1978. Neither the food nor the atmosphere has changed one bit since then. Including the GIGANTIC wait on weekend nights. We'd just order take out to avoid the lines back then. . . Casa Bianca is the perfect small town - what the Rock once was - Italian American Pizza Parlor. They believe in hiring kids who attend or graduated from ERHS, and the atmosphere is distinctly homey.. . This isn't some new hipster dive for you to critique. The Casa will be there long after your self-important brilliance has faded to black. So have some respect, and shut up, be patient, be polite to the owners and staff. Order a pizza with 'zesty green olives' and canadian bacon or the pasta al bianco with extra garlic. And enjoy what small town life used to be like.
