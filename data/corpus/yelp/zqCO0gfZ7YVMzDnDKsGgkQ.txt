Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Vietnamese
If you go to Joy Yee's on any given night, you'll find that the place is filled with non-Asians.  While that isn't necessarily indicative of the quality or authenticity of the food, it does show just how wildly popular the place has become.  It's not hard to guess why.  The food is tasty and inexpensive and the portions are massive.  It's definitely not your typical sit-down-and-eat-family-style type of Chinese restaurant but more like a casual diner that caters to young folks.  The place gets crowded for dinner like you wouldn't believe (especially on weekends) so either go early or be prepared to wait.  Seating is tight, the noise level is definitely not conversation-friendly and the service is sometimes spotty.  But then again, you are eating in Chinatown .... . BE SURE TO TRY: The lemongrass chicken wings (get the appetizers -- plenty big for sharing), the shrimp-pineapple fried rice (served in a pineapple!), the kimchi fried rice (the kimchi flavor is subtle), the seafood chow udon (cooked in a satay BBQ sauce -- delicious!), the shrimp in lobster sauce and Malaysian style seafood baked rice. . TAKE A PASS ON: The butter fried squid (it tastes like it sounds -- way too buttery) and the lemongrass pork chops (a bit on the dry side) . . DON'T FORGET: To try any of their boba drinks (fruit smoothies with tapioca balls).  Feel free to mix flavors (my personal favorites are the mango-lychee, watermelon-lychee and taro-coconut). . LAST WORD: Definitely check this place out for the tasty food, cheap prices and the best boba drinks in Chicago.  It's not the most authentic Chinese food around but I guarantee you'll be satisfied when you're finished with your meal.
