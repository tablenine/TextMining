Ok, I'll make this quick and easy:. Yes, it's the old Pontiac space. . Yes, the Pontiac was a nice place to have a beer outside, but the food sucked and the waitstaff were thieves disguised as hipsters.. Yes, this place isn't "cheap" and it's overly crowded and sceney.. Yes, the tacos are fucking awesome... no two ways about it. Â The tacos are great... I'm a taco fanatic and this place does them super authentic with really top notch ingredients.
