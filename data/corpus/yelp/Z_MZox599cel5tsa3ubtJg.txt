Category: Latin American
I went to Coobah for their NYE three course Chef's menu. For $45 per person it was a steal. . For starters I had the Jumbo Lump Crabcake with Diced Linguica Sausage and Piquillo Pepper Aioli. My entree was Chilean Sea Bass with grilled baby Bok Choy and Miso-Ginger Beurre Blanc. My dessert choice was the Crema Chocolaté which is a chilled chocolate custard with a hint of ancho chile and Patron XO Café with fresh berries and crispy wafer cookie. Doesn't it sound phenomenal? Well, it was! Every spoonful was heaven.. I enjoyed the meal and the drinks, I started with a Raspberry Mojito and drank the best tasting Sangria I have ever had in a restaurant. Live music, friendly service, great drinks, perfect food. Every course was very enjoyable, great ambiance, perfect date place or a night out with the girls.
