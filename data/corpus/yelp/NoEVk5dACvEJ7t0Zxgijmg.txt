Food = amazing. I had a fish encrusted with macadamia nuts. It was delicious. I also started out with the lobster bisque soup. Creamy and oh so good. The Roseberry Martini was excellent too. It had pieces of fresh raspberries floating in the drink, which I loved. . . I would give it five stars, but this place cannot handle weekends. We made reservations and we're seated almost an hour later. No apologies...nothing. . . Not cool.
