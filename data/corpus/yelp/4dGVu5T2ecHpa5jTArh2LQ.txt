Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Great place for prime rib! Probably best place for prime rib. It's not cheap, but it's good. Call ahead if you have a large party. They're good becuase they only reserve half the resataurant, the other half is for walk in. . The people are mixed, not the usual west side poche. . . Love their spinning salad and lobster. But go for the prime rib and creamed corn!
