Restaurant: Mayan Palace Mexican Cuisine
Category: Mexican
Being 100% Mexican, I am VERY particular when it comes to Mexican food. This place does everything well! From the food to the drinks to the service....all good. My recommendation in Combo #1. Tuesdays and Thursday are 1/2 off Margaritas. Also in the back they now have an outdoor patio area. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a good Mexican restaurant.
