Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
I went on Sunday after the final Cubs game of the season. They have an impressive selection of inventive pizzas and the prices were reasonable (under $10 for my wife and I to get a slice and a soda). The staff was friendly and the place was clean.  . . All that said, I got the Chicken Alfredo pizza and was pretty disappointed. The chicken and mostaccioli were rubbery and bland, the sauce was light, which to me was the  best part and the crust was sinfully boring.  . . I know what you're going to say and yes, I did sample my sister's Mac and Cheese pizza. I liked that a little better but not enough to make me go back if I can avoid it.
