This place is AWESOME.  I took my boyfriend there for his birthday brunch.  I got the crispy french toast (french toast covered in corn flakes with berries, bananas, and some vanilla maple syrup thing) and he got the Loxex, which was a smoked salmon scramble with some kinda chives creme fraiche and tomatoes and potatoes on the side.  Everything was really excellently cooked, had huge portions, a friendly staff, and an enticing menu.  I love that they serve breakfast all day and the lunch stuff looks equally awesome.  They accidentally got our order mixed up and as a result we each got two iced lattes instead of one, which was awesome!  Best french toast I've had in a while (they only serve it on the weekends).  Good location, cute decor.  Definitely coming back!
