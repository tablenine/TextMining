Very good breakfast! If you like pancakes, this is your spot.  A lot of variety and the pancakes are huge. The black magic pancakes looked good but I didn't get a chance to try them. I was fortunate to go during the week as I hear the weekends have a very long wait. There is good parking behind the building. I will be back, enjoyed my meal at Griddle.
