Really good pho, period.. . The soup to noodle ratio is perfect. I am not a fan of places that load you up on noodles. Especially since the broth is the best part of the dish. they use really high quality cuts of meat. The meat stays tender even when it has been swimming around in the hot soup for awhile.. I love that the broth is light ,flavorful, and not greasy at all.. . The crepes are my favorite. the give you the rice paper wrappers so that you can play with the rolling. They are super generous with the purple mint (my fave) and other odd looking herbs. I noticed that if the place is not too packed and you wear something low cut, your crepes get a lot more fillings. ha hah ahhaha h. . The bun bowls are well balanced. Again, really good meat. . . I understand that some may complain that the place is pricier than most. But you get an open kitchen ( such a rarity in the world of pho restaurants) and some really delicious food.. . The bathroom is pretty odd. I am not a fan of the green lighting and tiny mirror, but again, for a pho place, it is pretty unique (in that is clean.)
