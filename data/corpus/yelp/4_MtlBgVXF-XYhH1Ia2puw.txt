My second time at Sun Wah for the duck dinner was even better than my first (at the old location). The new spot is bigger, cleaner, and seems more organized. . . We had a group of four for the duck dinner and ordered apps, but they weren't really necessary as there were leftovers. The apps were dissapointing and greasy (fried scallops and won-tons with practically non-existant filling). Stick to the duck dinner and be sure to order extra bao buns. They throw in 2 small cups of sorbet and fortune cookies for dessert.
