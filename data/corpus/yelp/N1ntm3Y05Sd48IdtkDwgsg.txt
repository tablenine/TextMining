So cute on the inside!!! From the outside it looks like a dump. One of my friends had been here a few times and invited me out to dinner. I was a little skeptical, but figured that I haven't had too many horrible crepes. It was actually really delicious and had the perfect ambiance for date night. The wine list was only okay, although I did get a very good pinot there which the waiter tried to talk me out of buying to order a blush instead! Who recommends a blush at a French restuarant!?! But I digress... The food is really good! The crepes are made perfectly and filled with wonderful things that you would never think of. I had something with a cream sauce and chicken. Yum. And of course the dessert crepes are great too!
