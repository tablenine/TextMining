Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
so, this place has been reviewed so many, many times i do not understand why my take on it would be helpful to anyone. but yet, here i sit, typing, reviewing this place.. . here are my thoughts, easily organized for your perusal (or not):. . + finding this place was (as in started out) like a godsend to me (and, i could say, my boyfriend, too), because tasty sandwich delivery is something that we are lacking in our sort-of-logan-square-maybe-humboldt-park neighborhood.. . + the sandwiches are incredibly tasty.. . +/- the menu is huge and there are so very many options, but it is easy to go overboard. i always order a damn "milton f" (make-your-own) sandwich (and once a salad) and, because i am gifted enough to know what flavors work together, they always taste great. however: 1) the price starts to get Ridiculous when you do the milton f thing (i mean, really now, $2.50 extra for skirt steak and THEN i have to pay extra for cilantro that i am charged for even though there wasnt any on my sandwich!?); 2) you can really screw yourself over if you put together the wrong stuffs.. . + one should never be unable to find something they like to eat.. . + apparently they have lagunitas red ale on tap right now but i wouldnt know because i only get delivery because i am a chump.. . + their sides are tasty as all git-out. go for the baked beans!. . - their sides, their salads, their sandwiches (except when you get one single order of a la carte fries, it seems...) are so fucking TINY. tiny, tiny, tiny. good for lunch, i guess; not so good for dinner or when you are so very hungry.. . - expensive! so very expensive!. . + banana chocolate malt!. . - did i mention: EXPENSIVE? because it is. expensive. totally.. . so, three-and-a-half bigguns for jerry's. maybe someday i will actually, physically eat there...
