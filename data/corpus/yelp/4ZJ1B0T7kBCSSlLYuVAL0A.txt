One word - MEATFEST! Or how about Carnicide...ha! Bf has been wanting to try this for awhile now out of curiosity. I had tried a Fogo in Dallas years ago and remembered having a good meal but that it was a MEATFEST.  . No ambiance...tables close together and very simple decor.  Meat was ok, nothing great a bit too salty. Sides are just ok....the cheese rolls are yum....salad bar basic. Prices are pretty ridiculous for what this place is....I mean we arent cheap, we dont mind spending $$ if it is worth it. $60 a pop for the non stop meat....but I'd rather get a Wagyu at Cut for that price and not barbecue.  Also if prices werent high enough they have a bartender with cordials walking around dining room and selling drinks....if you thought it was about 5 star service and not to see how much more they could squeeze outta you then it might have been cool. . Pros: Entertaining watching each table and just how much meat one person can really digest in one sitting.. Cons:High price for average food and atmosphere. . Overall: Its kinda like a novelty....Beni Hana like but not as much fun. I wouldnt recommend for what we spent. ($300 for 2 people that included basic bottle of wine that was $80) Kind of feel like cattle and quick turnover but with 5 star restaurant prices.
