Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Without being redundant, the dumplings are excellent.  I did say, "How good can Xiao Lung Bao get?"  I thought I had the best, from Shanghai to other "good" places here.  These are the best, so far.  I think one of the secrets is that they serve it the minute it's done in the steamer.  The quality drops from then.  If it's cold, use it as food fight ammo.  I hear the ones served in the mother shop, in Taiwan, top all the branch stores.  I might try that some day.   The ones with crab meat/yolk is more grainy in texture but more "fragrant". Order the bean paste dumpling for dessert.  Same dumpling but filled with sweet bean paste.  Excellent.  Service is as good as a busy place can reasonably muster because the down side on this place is the wait.  Unless you go before it opens, even at almost 9 p.m., expect to wait.  By the way, the price cost them half a star here.
