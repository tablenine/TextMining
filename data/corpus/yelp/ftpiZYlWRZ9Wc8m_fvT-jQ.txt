This place ain't bad because their Ramen portions seem to be slightly bigger than most places and the broth wasn't too salty nor too light.  I think it's comparable to Shinsengumi except the ambiance is cooler.  They have a bunch of advertisements and signs hung up on the walls that come from the 60's Japan.  I guess you can say it's also cool just because it's situated in the heart of Jtown.
