Category: Sandwiches
This place reminds me of Bakeman's in Seattle for a number of reasons:. . . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . . 1) The food isn't really all that good, yet seems to get a pass because it's old. . 2) It has the same cafeteria type feel with large crowds. . 3) They both sell stale berry pies for dessert. . I admit, I go there somewhat often but more because I keep hoping that if I eat another dipped beef sandwich, I'll somehow understand what the big deal is about.. . That said, if you want a nice dipped beef sandwich....well, my recommendation is Chicago.. . . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . . ...that is, until I find the right place here in LA.
