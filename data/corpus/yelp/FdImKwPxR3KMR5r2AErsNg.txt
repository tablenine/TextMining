FINALLY had a chance to check out this restaurant after hearing such rave reviews from friends and i was SO NOT DISAPPOINTED!  we came in on a tuesday nite hoping the restaurant wouldn't be too packed.  street parking was abundant and it was still a 20 minute wait for our table for 3.  that was no problem since we were able to sit in the bar area and order a couple of strong worth-your-money mixed drinks.  i must say that the asian bartender wasn't attentive or eager to serve -- maybe a bad night??  . . i love the new yorkey-ness decor of the place -- i seriously thought **maybe i should change my wedding venue to this place instead**!  . on to the food -- we ordered family style and my favorites were the clam pizza, the ravioli, and the portabello fries (of course!).  we had one of the chicken dishes, but it was a tad bland.  the service was helpful and very attentive (and totally made up for the buzzkill bartender up front).  one of the waitstaff grabbed our leftovers and was suppose to pack them up to go, but either we ended up forgetting to bring the box with us or he forgot to come back.  either way that was such a shame -- such GREAT food should NEVER go to waste!. . we were so stuffed, but the food was so good we were eager to try their desserts.  unfortunately though, they ran out of crepe suzettes.  also the bakery up front closes earlier than the restaurant :(  oh well...there will still be a next time!
