Restaurant: Tokyo Delve&#39;s Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
Ohhh wow. I went to this place last night for my friend's birthday party and this is definitely the worst sushi experience I have had. First of all, our wait was AN HOUR even though we had made reservations! Then, the sushi was horrible! It tastes like rubber and is pre-prepared. I thought you couldn't go wrong with sushi, but apparently I was mistaken. And since you have to pay a $12 minimum per person, you pretty much have to order some kind of gross food. We came here for sake bombing and the beer was kind of gross as well. So make sure you've eaten before you come here! I didn't and felt sick after their shitty sushi. . . The only redeeming quality Tokyo Delves has is the music and entertainment. They play great music that everyone can't help but sing and dance along to, from Grease to the Ying Yang twins. They make you dance on the chairs, which is a lot of fun as long as you don't fall down! They also did a great rendition of an N'Sync performance. . . But then guess what? A HUGE fight broke out and some assholes threw mugs, tables, and chairs around and cops came. The security sucked and were not very effective at stopping the fight. I'm sure this doesn't happen every night, but it's still something to consider.
