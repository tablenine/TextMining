I think Toast was one of those experiences where my Yelp expectations actually ENHANCED my experience.  I totally expected high heels, trendy labels, condescending clientele, long waits and snooty service.  Instead, we waited with an amenable crowd for 20 minutes, sat at a prime spot outside and were pampered soon after by the service staff.  . . The service was seriously top notch. Both waiters, host and bus boys all checked on us regularly and attentively (eye contact, smiles and all) and we were never for want of refills or recommendations.   We were never rushed and actually felt a little pampered and important (in a customer not Hollywood way).  All in all, it was great little brunch experience.... . well, except that I didn't really uh.. like the food.  . . I ordered a protein scramble that was bland, boring and tasteless and though they had a fairly creative menu and a nice presentation- I was a little bored with everything.  I don't think I'd return because I found the food itself a little uninspiring, but I have to say the service and ambiance were simply great!
