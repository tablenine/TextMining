Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
The Wrigleyville branch definitely has its own feel, while also staying true to the Ian's name.. . For example, the restaurant is painted in traditional bright Red, with the lovable Ian's Pizza pie logo. But, they pay homage to their proximity to the Cubs and include a baseball in the logo.. . One not-so-pleasant difference between this location and the Madison one is the music. They prefer to play loud, weird stuff. Not the best when you're trying to yell your order to a worker with lots of people around.. . They have some cool regional varieties of pizza that Madison doesn't have, my favorite being S'mores pizza.. . When I went with my friend Felicia, we both got two slices, which we agreed was more than filling. I grabbed a slice of a chicken parmesan and a piece of S'mores pizza to add a dessert.. . The chicken parmesan featured rigatoni noodles with chicken and delicious cheese. It was cooked to perfection and tasted awesome.. . They made the S'mores pizza while I waited (it only took about 14 minutes), so I got it when it was nice and fresh. With toasted marshmallow, bits of graham cracker, chunks of hershey chocolate bars and a nice drizzle of chocolate syrup, it was amazing. The end of the crust was a little overcooked, but that was a small worry, as the rest of the pizza was freckin' sweet.. . Overall, I am pleased that there is an Ian's branch to serve my homesickness when it gets really bad. Nothing is the same as the one in downtown Madison, but this is a nice alternative!. . The Price Rating: The Journalist- Kids who are doing alright- this is the middle of the road. They are good with money, but aren't going to get rich in an industry of dying newspapers
