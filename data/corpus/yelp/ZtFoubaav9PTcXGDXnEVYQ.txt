This place is the best for cajun seafood. the waiting period is a bit long during peak hours but it's really worth it. . . Even though they didnt have plates or utensils they provided a roll of paper towels (which we emptied by the end of dinner). . My group ordered 2 pounds of shrimp and 1 pound of crawfish with 2 orders of fried catfish with seasoned fries with 1 order of sweet potato fries. The bill came out to around $150 for 5 people? Im not too sure but it's includinng tips. it's pricey but very good!. . My favorite seasoning is always the whole shabang, even though I cant handle it that much. My favorite item is the fried catfish with seasoned fries!. . Be sure to run a couple of laps at the nearby Almansor park in the morning afterwards though....
