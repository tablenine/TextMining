I've ate here many times which is why I decided to pick some up for a tailgate party. Contacted their catering director, Tai, and she was fantastic! Figured I would have to pick up the food on Saturday and reheat due to the early start on Sunday, NOPE! Met me at the restaurant at 7am Sunday. Planned on having to buy utensils, sterno, etc. NOPE!! Included in the price, which was very reasonable and so much more convenient. Not to mention the food was outstanding, everyone was raving. Highly recommend for your catering needs!!
