Restaurant: Bone&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Steakhouses
I've only been to Bones once.  Was visiting a client out in Atlanta and had him decide on the restaurant.  Spent all day working on his data and trained a new employee.  Atlast it was time to head to dinner!. . Took a 15 minute drive from the office to Bones.. . Arrived and had a few drinks before being seated.  . . All agreed upon the appetizers and sides to be shared family style.  It's been years so I don't exactly remember what we ordered.  I do know that everything was good.  I ordered the ribeye and it was cooked perfectly.  We ordered a few bottles of wine and each ordered dessert.  By the time the dessert arrived we were well into our 3rd bottle of wine and I was ready to die at that moment.  A true perfect dining experience and the best part of it....all paid for by my company.  Damage was steep...but wth I was told to entertain the client!
