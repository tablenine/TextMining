A very confused place but great for a cheap everything. For all the fruity drinks I've had only the Lycheetini was undrinkable. I usually stick to the mojito. Â I may be a lightweight, but you WILL get drunk for cheap. It's the high sugar, cheap booze content I presume. There's almost always some ass falling all over the place by close (sometimes that ass is I.). . The best was when they made drinks 3 bucks. It was written on a new sandwich board sign which basically said, and I paraphrase: "We'll give you three dollar drinks just stop breaking/stealing our sign"! Also if you have a big party they'll invariably bring you free shots that look like windsheild washer fluid and taste like free-based raspberry ass. It's not as bad as it sounds usually.. . One thing though.... STAY AWAY ON WEEKENDS!. UGH....Frat boy/student central.. Good place to bring the younger brother/sister crowd when they come to visit though..... . Also music can really blow sometimes. If it's not too cold to sit outside, by all means DO.
