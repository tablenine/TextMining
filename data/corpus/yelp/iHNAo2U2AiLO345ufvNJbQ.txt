Restaurant: Baraonda Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
A small group of friends went here for an evening birthday dinner, but nothing about it struck me as special. Average waitstaff, average atmosphere, slightly crowded and loud... but what did strike me as out of the norm was the food. Horrible! . I ordered the chicken, and my husband ordered the fish. Both were dry, overcooked, unseasoned, and bland. And if that were not enough - to pay that much for food that bad?! I don't know if it was a fluke - or perhaps just a bad menu choice... but I won't be going back. . It's a nice enough place, and convenient if you're visiting the Fox Theater just down the street - but don't look to be blown away.
