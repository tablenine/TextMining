We have lived in the area for a year now and last night was the first time we ever went to this place.  And boy were we glad we did.  When we walked in, wasn't the fanciest looking place, looked a bit run down but we ventured upstairs to the (heated) patio and loved it!   Great view and very cozy.  The chips and salsa were served right away, which were pretty good.  My  husband ordered the Paella and I ordered the Fish tacos which were not fried but grilled Tilapia.  Both orders came within 10 minutes and both were equally delicious!!!  I am not a huge mexican food fan but I'm so glad that we went there because the fish tacos were the best I've ever had.  I wish we had known about this place because it would have been a frequent food spot for us.   The other great thing about this restaurant is that it's Latin so you have your choice of fare... Mexican, Spanish or Cuban.  Next time we visit, I'm trying their Cuban Sandwich.
