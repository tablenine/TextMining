Was staying at the Biltmore up the block and wanted a place I could walk to, so this was it. Crowded beyond belief, of course, on a Friday night at 8, but we sat at the cafe tables and got served immediately.. . Noisy as heck, but the food was really, really good, even for this New Yorker's fussy palate. I had the lasagne and the portion was HUGE and extremely tasty. Prices extremely reasonable, too.. The bread in a sandwich bag was a little cutesy, though...but the waiters were just cute and gave excellent, super-attentive service. And we weren't even young and hot like everyone else!
