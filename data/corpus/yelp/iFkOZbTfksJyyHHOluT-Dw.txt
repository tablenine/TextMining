So lately, all that's been on my mind is Thai food. I've eaten enough that I probably changed my genetic makeup and now I'm part Thai. Yeah, I am pretty dramatic.. . Highlights:. 1. Two words: "Thai Elvis"...enough said.. 2. Pineapple Fried rice was awesomeness.. 3. Pad see yew was delish. . Low...darks?:. 1. The OTHER lounge singer. She was...terrible and grabbed her hair way to often.. 2. The service was bleh, granted it was a busy night (although you'd think they'd compensate for it) it was beyond hard getting a server's attention.. 3. The . . All-in-one-sentence:. Flavorful and mildly entertaining.
