Everytime I go to Genki Living for crepes, I see the hordes of people outside of Sinbala.  We finally went over the weekend, and alas, I was disappointed.  Really, I wanted to like it more than I did.  It's quite possible that since I just went to Taiwan last month, my tastebuds are still spoiled!. . We ordered five things, and two were good: the sausage rice (#1 of lore), and the papaya milk (one of my favorite things to drink in Taiwan).. . We also had the green onion pancake, which was a little too fried for my taste (too browned and too drenched-in-oil tasting).  I had the fish ball soup, which had a nice clear broth, but the fish balls weren't the white cuttlefish ones I was expecting, but rather the Japanese tempura-style ones.  Meh.  Finally, we decided to try their napa pork dumplings.  These were OK.  I thought the dumpling skins were good, but the filling wasn't that great.  The cabbage inside was too crunchy.. . A huge plus here is the service.  It's VERY friendly for an Asian restaurant, and lots of the servers speak Taiwanese.  I'm interested in going back to try other types of sausage, and so that the bf can try an oyster pancake (I'm not a huge fan of these in general, but everyone seemed to be getting one, so maybe next time!).
