Restaurant: Ruen Pair Restaurant
Category: Thai
Living so close to Thai Town, I have had many, many experiences with Thai food. Some good, some awful. This one went very, very well. . . Came here on a humid 95+ degree day and their AC was just barely able to take some of the edge off the heat. That didn't stop us from getting our grub on. We ordered the Chinese broccoli with crispy pork, pad thai, chicken satay, and pineapple fried rice. I have nothing negative to say about any of these dishes. I'm not even going to try to critique them, because you can read previous reviews extolling the virtues of all the food at Ruen Pair. . . The parking IS horrendous. No need to go into that. If I had to describe the restaurant itself, Ruen Pair is like an Accord and Sanamluang is like a Civic. Both very reliable, but one's a bit more refined and streamlined than the other.. . We will definitely be back. 4 solid stars.
