Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
First off it's an impressive looking bakery, perhaps 3 store fronts large. The cake selection is impressive and many are in line to pick up New Years cakes. We ordered sandwiches and coffee namely the Cuban sandwich. I was expecting a handsomely stuffed pulled pork sandwich and it was just a sad sandwich anyone could make. A couple of slices of pork, pickles and cheese on a supposed Cuban bread roll with some dried chips that were maybe plantains, totally tasteless. We both agreed it was a forgettable sandwich both eating only 1/2 of it. Coffee was forgettable too. While Berolinna's in Montrose in much smaller the sandwiches are much better.
