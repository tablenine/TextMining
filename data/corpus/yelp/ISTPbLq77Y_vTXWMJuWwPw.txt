I would give the place an A on the space - large, airy, and enough room between the tables to navigate easily. Brunching with a friend, I thought that the food was just OK, but with much of it cold, despite the presence of warming dishes, the original flavors were lost. Service was indifferent, and the glacial expressions on the faces of the staff did not make one want to return.
