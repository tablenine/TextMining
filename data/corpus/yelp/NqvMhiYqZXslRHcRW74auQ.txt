Cool restaurant in a neat neighborhood. Busy place and lively. Food is solid. Prices a little high for dinner but lots of options. The calamari with jalapenos was spicy and moderately breaded. The accompanying sauces were fantastic. Their salsa is decent, more smokey with chipotle if you are into that. Chips were crispy and appropriately salted. The skirt steak was quite tasty. The shrimp not a great value. The dessert of avocado lime cheesecake was amazing. Great decor with an associated decorative store. Pricey store but great glass blown functional and decorative elements. I saw people ordering margaritas that came out in some of the great glass blown "pitchers."
