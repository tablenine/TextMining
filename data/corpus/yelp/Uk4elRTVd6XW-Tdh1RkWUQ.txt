I just love this place!. . What we had: (party of 2) $308.57 PLUS Tip (You gotta tip at least $100 bucks at a place like this... service is always outstanding here!). . Glass of Veuve Clicquot. Glass of Rombauer Chardonnay. Sparkling Water. Tonic Water. Chopped Salad. Wedge Salad. Jumbo Lobster. Filet Mignon. Sauteed Spinach. Lobster Mashed Potatoes. Sauteed Mushrooms. Key Lime Pie. Pecan Pie. Cappuccino. Regular Coffee. . Portions are HUGE! We only ate about 1/4 of the food ordered, and I'm not one for left-overs. But, everything is delicious here. I had the lobster, which I always get, and it was cooked to perfection.. . To get the most bang for your buck, try to come here with a group of 4 or more people so you're sure to finish all the side dishes. Desserts are ENORMOUS. I didn't put a dent in my pecan pie. But, when you come here... you just want a little of everything.
