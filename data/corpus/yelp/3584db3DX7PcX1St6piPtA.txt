I was feelin' pretty hungry after the Solider Field 10 Mile Race, and being right next to the Red Line train stop my brother &amp; I thought what the hay? I was feelin' dehydrated, and he needed to eat something other than nuts to hold him over any longer. . . Walked in &amp; was greeted emilitatly, the host sat us in a pretty filled dining room. Very friendly, he asked us how our weekends were going...so that was cool.. . Sat down &amp; was served warm tortilla chips with some yummy salsa. My brother ordered the Camerones Diablos, while I went for the Carne Asada. (I was starving!) The food was just OK. The shrimp seemed to be a better dish than the steak. Even though they cooked it to the perfect state--it was a bit salty. . . In my opinion the food is really over-priced. We paid more than enough for two people for lunch without drinks. Oh well--I'd go back for the chips n salsa. Otherwise I'll stick to my other favorite joints for Mexican food. The service was good though!
