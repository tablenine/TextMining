I guess I went here when I was little with my parents but I don't remember much or really loving the food, I guess that should have been a signal to a future yelper that this place is definitely a three-star [maybe even three-and-a-half] type of joint, but no more than that.  What's cool is that it's open 24 hours.  What's also cool is that the menu is pretty extensive, I saw a little girl order what looked like calamari and fries, while her dad got a stack of pancakes.  The downside is that for being open all hours of the day and having such a broad menu with many, many options is that the price of most things isn't the cheapest, but it won't break your bank either.  The food to me is hit or miss, some things are average and some are pretty good.  . . When I came here as a kid I ordered the spicy mac-n-cheese.  I remember worrying about the heat level, and when the steaming heap was plopped in front of me and I took the first bite, I didn't like the flavor and thought it wasn't spicy at all.  I came back here recently and re-ordered the mac-n-cheese hoping for it to be spicy and out of this world as everyone says it is!  What came looked appetizing but it's taste was pure cream, overdone, with no spice, let alone much of a taste at all.  I'll save my money in the future and crack open a box of Kraft instead.
