GOOD LAWD Their FOOD IS DELICOUS!!!! My Friend and I went here on a Whim as we waited for someone to meet us. We had a Goat cheese pizza that tasted sooo good!!! .. The ambiance was just like any other Beer drinking bar but the tables had a little class to them :) The employees were extremely nice and so was the bartender. Great place to just hang out. Hate that I don't live around the corner
