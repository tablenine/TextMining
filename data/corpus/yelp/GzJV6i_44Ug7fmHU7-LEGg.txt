Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
Brunchy Brunch Brunch...I love Brunch.   That Bloody Mary was AM.A.ZING.  I had the Palmer Omelette and the potatoes were creamy and fantastic.  The place was starting to fill up as we left at 11am, so get there early to avoid the crowd.. . My only issue is the prices.  Dunlay's on the Square has a Logan Square vibe....but a Lincoln Park bill.  Go for the 1/2-off Burger Night on wednesdays....but keep your bar tab in check or you'll max out that credit card in a hurry!
