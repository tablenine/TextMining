Category: Sushi Bars
The restaurant is contemporary, accessible and ideal for locals who want the freshest fish in town.  Tried the "Latin Heat" with jalapeno and cilantro or the Ocean Sundae-everyone's favorite. This maki combines tempura shrimp, avocado, cream cheese and tobiko chili sauce.  I was really really good!!
