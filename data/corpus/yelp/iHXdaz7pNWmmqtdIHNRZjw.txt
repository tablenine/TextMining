Hmmmm...I don't know what I can add to 400+ reviews, but I'm going to give it a shot because I LOVE breakfast food!!. . My DH and I came here for breakfast today and it was definitely worth all the hype! We got here about 9 am (Saturday morning) and there was no wait. It was busy inside but we were seated right away wit awesome service.. . I had the Apple Cobbler French Toast and it was amazing!! My DH had the short stack of Banana Nana pancakes which were good. We also shared the 2 egg breakfast with bacon. I had to dock them one star because the bacon wasn't crisp and the eggs were a bit over done. I have to say that they are probably better known for their griddle menu (hence the name) than their egg dishes. . . Wished we lived closer...we would frequently visit!
