Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Great beer, lame sandwiches. The beer selection is extensive and well-chosen. Rather than just a meaningless list of names, the beer menu is organized by type and includes detailed descriptions and vital stats to satisfy the most refined beer connoisseur. Their description of Samael's Oak-Aged Barley Wine (. http://beeradvocate.co.... ) is hilarious. My friends and I were quite happy with our beers, especially my Sprecher Black Bavarian (. http://beeradvocate.co.... ).. . Unfortunately, I cannot be quite so positive about my Jerry's Reuben. Despite being listed as a hot sandwich, it was not at all hot; the cheese wasn't even the slightest bit melted, nor was the bread toasted. The pastrami was a bit bland, and the inclusion of tomato and celery was just strange. The sauerkraut might have been good, but it was only present in trace amounts. At one point there was an interesting but overstated clove taste -- perhaps part of the sauerkraut -- but it was over pretty fast. My friends were equally underwhelmed.. . Overall, I'd return for a beer outside on the sidewalk, or maybe venture inside, but the sammy's struck out. Unlike the other reviewers, we had no problem with the service here. The waiter was adequate, if not overly outgoing.
