Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
We got there right at closing time (10 p.m.), but they were nice enough to take our orders (for take-out only).  I had the port &amp; stilton burger, and my hubby had the classic umami burger -- we both preferred our respective burgers.  I was expecting the stilton to be overpowering, but was pleasantly surprised by how subtly it combined with the port-caramelized onions (yummmm).  I was afraid that the meat would be cooked too much after I realized they hadn't asked how we wanted our meat cooked.  I sighed with relief and joy when I bit into my burger and saw juicy pink/red goodness -- it was cooked to perfection!  Oh, and the bun is like none other -- slightly sweet and a tad denser than the usual buns that are filled with air pockets.  Plus, the bun-to-meat ratio was great.  I think this place now tops my list of favorite Southern California burger joints, even surpassing Father's Office (caveat: fries are better at FO).  Can't wait to come back here...
