Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
OK so I came here with family while on vacation. We were exploring Hollywood blvd. I kept eyeing this sushi spot on the top floor of the mall but held out because my family was so adamant that we were eating at pinks. OK whatever I cant argue with wanting a good hot dog that everyone talks about. . We get there and the line is around the building. It was about and hour wait. Not too bad. I'm patient anyways. They Take NO cards!!!! ATM or CREDIT. Had to run down the street to an ATM. Well the one plus they do have is the fries! Chili fries were good. Hot dogs whatever. I do like that you can pretty much put whatever you want on it. But I suggest you come to the bay area and try a Casper's Dog. Good old fashioned hot dog without all the toppings to hide a not so good dog.
