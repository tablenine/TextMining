Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
Bossa Nova, when my friend first suggested this place, I instantly thought of  that rhythm button on my parents casio keyboard.  My brother and I would set that rhythm off and dance in a weird wild dance that involved spinning and jumping off the couch.  . The resturant serves decent fair and has a hip crowd.  I had a Churrasquinho no Po, basically a skirt steak sandwich, plus plantains always yummy.
