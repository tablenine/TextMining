The fries are perfect here. They have about 7 different dipping sauces to choose from.. . I tried the 'duck and bacon' sausage it was pretty good I love all the toppings you can pick for the sausages. 'Mango Jalapeno' is also another must have! I think all the sausages are good here, get what looks good to you on the menu I'm sure you won't be disappointed. . . Sausages, fries and beer what more could you ask for.
