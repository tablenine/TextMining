I went there with my husband and friend. . . We tried the five-course chef tasting menu, which was quite an experience. . . Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. . . Among our courses:. Deconstructed Waldorf Salad. Savee Egg with beans. Seared Scallop with lima beans. Celery Vinger Soup. Woodfire Quail with apples and turnips. Braized pork belly with radish, cumin carrots. Banana fritters, choco mousee, vanilla creme. Apple shortbread and glazed apples. . The food was fantastic, the presentation was innovative and the techniques that were used served as a guessing game of enjoyment. . . I highly recommend!
