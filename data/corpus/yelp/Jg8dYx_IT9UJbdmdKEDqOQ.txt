Restaurant: Pizzeria Uno
Category: Pizza
I finally made it to the birthplace of deep dish, Pizzeria Uno.  The quality control here appears to be lacking, my pizza wasn't fully cooked.  I think I actually had better Uno pizza at the chains in places like Orlando or Phoenix, which is not right.. . Lou Malnati's is better!
