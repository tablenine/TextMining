Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
With all the fancy do-dad's, and humdrum now a days, it's nice to find that simplicity still exists.  My boyfriend and I always wondered what treasures this little shack held, and after reading the reviews we figured it was time to dive in.. . First off, I felt like an idiot for staring at the menu so long (I'm sure the owner felt the same!)  After I ordered up two fish tacos, and one shrimp taco, I browsed the pretty diverse salsa bar to conjure up the perfect combination.. . Initially, I wanted to order five tacos, but I'm glad I didn't as they were extremely filling for their size.  If I can offer any tip, it's not to underestimate the salsa. :S  I couldn't stop hissing from the heat (maybe I'm just a pansy, haha.). . They tasted extremely fresh, and the meal was really light overall; plus, lunch for two under $10?  I'm always in.
