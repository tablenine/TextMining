the good-   high quality sashimi,  very reasonably priced.  If you weigh actual quality of food vs dollar amount... this is hands down the best deal in town.  the sashimi combo comes with a hefty portion of hand selected tuna that is sometimes sold at lesser joints as toro.    Yellowtail Kama is also one not to miss. . . the bad-  killer waits for both the lunch hour and weekends.   if you show up at wrong time for lunch, it is quite possible to wait over an hour.. if you show up on a sat even... expect to wait 2 hours for a table for two.  that being said, I'll wait as long as I need to do get my GEN fix... why go elsewhere with no lines to eat crappy overpriced sushi?. . additional notes:  this Japanese restaurant is J owned and operated..  the wait staff has more or less been the same for the last 10 years.  there's one busboy that's been there ever since my first tasting.  throughout all the years, sushi gen has been able to do what many other restaurants can't seem to do.. THEY REMAIN THE SAME. . . Sushi Gen has been in my Top 5 for a loooooong time now..   do me a huge favor.. read and enjoy the review.. but don't go.. there's enough of us lining up already.
