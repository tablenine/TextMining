Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
Versailles is an institution, kinda like Tito's Tacos or Roscoes Chicken &amp; Waffles. They make a few things that get the amazing reputation and a bunch of other stuff that nobody ever orders.. . The two standouts are the Garlic Chicken and Cuban Roast Pork. Versailles has many other menu items like Lomo Saltado and Oxtail, but most are disappointing and take a lot longer to get out of the kitchen. (Oxtail is indeed a rich and tasty exception.) Skip them for the two standouts above.. . Unless it's late in the evening, the chickens are turned out of the kitchen so often that it's rare you'll get an overcooked bird. Usually the chickens are juicy and crunchy-skinned, slathered with garlic sauce and are way too much for one person. Drawback: rice, plantains and beans on the side don't soak up the amazing sauce, so you have to scoop them into the chicken plate yourself. Messy.. . The Roast Pork is similar, fork-tender and succulent, garlicky as all get-out, in bed with a huge serving of white rice and plantain slices. Dump in some black beans and you're all set. You'll take half the plate home as leftovers inless your name is Shaq.. . Inside tip: they'll offer onions to go with your plate; ask to get them grilled...like In-N-Out, grilled onions give just the right sweetness to balance out that spicy garlic sauce.. . The Venice Blvd. location recently got a face-lift of fresh, colorful paint and moldings; it's still not a luxury experience, but Versailles is now a little less dive-y than they used to be.. . I go there every month or two, and many times I take out-of-towners for a cheap meal. Most want to return when they come back to town (even if they don't remember the name of the restaurant)...how's that for a testimonial?
