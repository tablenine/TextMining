undoubtedly the most beautiful restaurant i've been to, but it's just a restaurant, which is why i dont understand why someone would have their wedding here. i ordered an alcoholic drink, the lemon zen, which had absolutely no alcohol in it...at least that's the impression i got from drinking it. it was good, but $12 for essentially juice is a ripoff.. . i ordered the lamb chop, which my friends and i agreed tasted like beef..more like galbi to be precise. they must've used the same sauce or marinade for the short ribs. the calamari was good, a bit chewy, but the sauce it came with was spicy and really good. . . the complimentary birthday dessert was SUPER good. it tasted like a tres leches cake with a creme flan on top...mmmmmmmmmm. it's a nice place if you want to impress your gold diggin girlfriend ;) but it's not worth the price...
