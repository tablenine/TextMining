ZOMG this place rules because of the entertainment ! the food is good and all, but not amazing + i REALLY dislike the communal seating. kinda cheapens the whole effect + i feel like i'm sitting in a high school cafeteria. good for large groups maybe but not good for dates. the cheesy singers are so awesome + it's really funny to watch the servers buzz around with their headsets. ha.. . ordered: fried tofu, coconut soup, papaya salad with raw blue crab, pad thai, combo seafood with chili paste, deep fried whole fish with chili + garlic sauce, steamed whole fish with spicy basil soup. everything was yummy but not ZOMG amazing not OM NOM NOM NOM good jfdklsjfksajfjasfslkajfls !. . will come back to try their " wild things " menu which has deer, frog, etc.
