I absolutely loved this place! First of all, it is BYOW, which usually accounts for most of a bill at a restaurant. We brought five bottles of wine for five people! Our waitress offered to keep it chilled for us. We all ordered something different and shared everything.. The food and music were great. The best part was that after an awesome meal and great wine (for free), our bill for five people came out to $52. I will definitely be returning!
