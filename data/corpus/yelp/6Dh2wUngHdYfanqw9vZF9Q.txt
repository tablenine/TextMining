Category: Mexican
No me gusta. . . The space is festive and our waitress was awesome, but the food is no bueno. I enjoyed the cheese dip, salsa, and warm tortillas (major plus!) but my main entree was VERY disappointing. Fancy mexican or not, I want my food to taste good and not all blend together as one big blob on my plate. Zero thought put into this food. Pricey, bland, and just off.
