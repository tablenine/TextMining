Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
I've enjoyed every meal I've ever had here, even though I don't make it there as often anymore since I left the South Loop area.  Basically eveyrhing appears and smells delicious, and no matter how I order my eggs or burgers, etc. it's always done just right.  I will always recommend Eleven City to anyone who is looking for a place to sit down in the South Loop and enjoy well-made food.
