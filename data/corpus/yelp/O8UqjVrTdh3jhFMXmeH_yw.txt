What a great surprise in a restaurant! It's a tucked away spot in the West Loop, perfect for a night out in Wicker Park or before Sonotheque. I had the basic chicken and broccoli and was very impressed with how fresh it tasted. The sauce was a perfect consistency and there was no hint of MSG or "weird chinese flavor" in the food. I was starving and even though the portion size was small, it was a perfect size. Four starts due to the close seating proximity to your neighbor and it was a bit loud, definitely a spot for friends. . . Don't forget to bring your BYOB and save room for the comp cheesecake!
