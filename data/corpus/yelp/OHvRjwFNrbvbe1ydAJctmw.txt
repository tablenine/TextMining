I think this place kinda had an off night or something, and that we didn't order the right dishes.  My "bleu salad" was literally drowned in dressing, making the lettuce rather hard to find.  My linguica sandwich was ordered without mayo... it had the mayo.  Come on, sausage and mayo?  Those go together like peanut butter and thumb tacks.  .  The fried plantains were good, but way too greasy.   However, the italian food smelled AWESOME there.  I wish I would have gone that route honestly.
