Category: American (Traditional)
"Johnnie's Pastrami" the name of the place will clue you in on what to get here, you see where I'm going with this?? number one rule on trying a new place " if it's in the title of the place that's what you get"!! pretty simple. I don't want hear people bitchin about the Johnnie's stirfry not being so hot. and all you cheap asses who can't afford to spend a dollar more, don't comment!!  You have no tastebuds!  your tongue is in your wallet .Always crying how you can get pastrami cheaper some where else! Johnnie's does pastrami right. plain and simple. why has Johnnies been there so long? Cause they got it right!!! Now go ask your momma for an extra dollar and quit cryin and man up! Cheap people suck.
