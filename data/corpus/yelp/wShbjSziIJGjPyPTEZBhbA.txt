Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
ugo is taking over culver city. . . it's so damn confusing. you got the cafe on one end. the wine bar on the end end. and the restaurant in the beginning.... got that? but you can only order from their SPECIFIC menus when you're sitting in the right segment of UGO. . . now i used to like this place. i mean, who wouldn't like filet mignon under 20 dollars? the italian wines they had were quite nice. the chopped salad superb. the extensive gelato collection (amadeus dream) was heavenly.  but then the hick waiter had to spoil it all for me. . . i'm a nice person. really i am. i'm understanding. i'm polite. especially with red necks. especially with red neck waiters trying to be cute in an italian restaurant. . . on one specific occasion the same asshole comes by while i dine with my fellow asian girlfriend. we're enjoying a lovely meal. he interrupts. . you ladies finding everything okay ??? (insert texan drawl). yes...thank you..... you guys sisters or somethin'???. ummm...no. (at this point wants for him to get the hell out). ...can i ask you something?. . at the same time:  me: no  friend: yes. . soooo...do ya'll eat dogs or something? . . me: SHOCKED SILENCE friend: nervous laughter. . yes i might be overly sensitive. so what? do you want someone asking you if you eat dog after a delicious filet mignon? really finishes the meal on a high note eh?  in all honesty, i don't think he meant anything by it. it was just idiocy and lack of culture. he was a struggling actor. i didn't get his ass fired. but honestly, the food is not good enough for me to go back. and suffer more dog jokes. . . on a side note: the wine bar is super fun. it's like dave and busters. but with high end wine. and gelato infused with champagne! : )
