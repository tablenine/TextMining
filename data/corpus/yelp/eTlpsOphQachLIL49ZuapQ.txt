Came here at night with some friends and this place was PACKED! It was in a pretty sketch place of LA and the outside looked really warehouse industrial. I ordered the duck and Kielbasa both of which were pretty good, but considering the price I think I'd rather just go to costco and get a polish sausage and soda for 1.50. The ambiance though was a completely different story! It was pretty cool inside despite being so crowded and the beers were pretty good. They all come in different sizes/amounts though so make sure you check the serving size before your order! Definitely a cool place to hang out with friends and grab a late night sausage ;). . I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars for the atmosphere, but I'm going with a three just because the sausages were alright tasting, but not like I'm gonna empty my wallet right now and buy the whole lot of them tasty.
