Finally after many years of searching I've found THE best breakfast in the country. Huge portions of everything. " Mom's French Toast" is the balls. Coffee is served in a coffee press and is fantastic! Never have seen pancakes so big. Home fries cover half the dish. Crowded this Saturday morning but no wait,and very friendly staff. Maybe run into a few cops and get your tickets fixed! DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE.
