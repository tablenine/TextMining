At the suggestion of the Yelp folks, I finally made it to Toro Sushi on a Saturday night.  We go there at about 7 PM and it was an hour wait.  When they took our name down they also took down my cell number and said they'd call me when our table was ready which I thought was really cool. So we walked to a few grocery stores near there and found one that had a bottle of sake since it's BYOB.  We went back about 45 min. later and our spots were ready early (we sat at the bar).  We had seaweed salad (it was good but the portion was bigger than most places), the sashimi appetizer, a dragon roll, and an OH MY GOD roll.  Way too much food for two people as the rolls were HUGE.  But it was SO good we ate it all (we were stuffed).  We chatted with Mitch and watched him make up rolls and serve them.  I asked him, "What's that your making?"  And he said, "The kick ass roll."  Turns out it wasn't on the menu.  He was just making it up as he went along for someone and it looked SO AMAZING.  The prices were reasonable.  Service was a little slow but they did the best they could considering how busy they were.  And they did heat up our sake for us which was really cool.  If there wasn't such a long and so very few tables (there were only like 10 of them) wait I would have given it 5 stars.  Fantastic sushi.
