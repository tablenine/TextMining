Some people are calling this place Wurst coochie, I am just going to call it the sausage place for simplicity. If you want to pronounce this place in proper German, good luck!. . Ever since I had a Bratwurst at Alpine Village during Oktoberfest, I was dreaming I could get my jaws into it again. This place fulfilled my dreams and then some.... . This place not only serves Bratwurst it serves 21 different options! Hell even if you're a veggie lover this place has 3 different vegetarian options! The prices range from $6 dollars to the exotic sausages which go at $7.75. You pick two toppings out of the Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut Sweet Peppers, and Spicy Peppers. . . I ordered the Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers with the onions and spicy peppers...whew those spicy peppers were not bad and I consider myself a semi-pro when it comes to hot stuff. I also ordered a Kielbasa which is a polished styled sausage with all peppers, which turned out great. Some people experienced over cooked sausages, well they cooked mine to perfection. Lucky me! I forgot to mention they serve fries in small and large sizes. You get to pick 2 sauces out of 10 options. So far only tried the Sundried Tomato Mayo and Chipotle Aioli. Both are recommended.. . Beer selection is A grade but pricey. My friends and I went on a Wednesday night during the rainy week and it was still jamming with people. So be prepared to be in line to get into this place.
