Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Milk is kind of a unique place.  If you happen to drive by Beverly Blvd and catch a glimpse of the store, you would think it's exclusively an ice cream place based on the name and the decor.  Once you go inside, you'll be surprised that they also serve sandwiches and baked goods.  Since I went there after dinner, I ordered a triple chocolate shake (chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips and chocolate sauce)...yes, sounds like an artery clogger (which it was), but it wasn't as rich as I thought it would be.  It's definitely a different taste than your average Baskin Robbins offering.  My friend had the strawberry shortcake malt which he really enjoyed (vanilla ice cream with strawberries at the bottom and pie crust pieces  (?) at the top).  All in all, a nice place to grab some ice cream after a dinner.
