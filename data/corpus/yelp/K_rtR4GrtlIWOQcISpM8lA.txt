Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
Dearest Gino's!. . Now I have never really been a big Chicago deep dish pizza fan (Unos, Giordona's, etc.) but I do enjoy very tasty slices once in a blue rabbits ass, however on our Sunday outing with the "family" you sincerely disappointed me :(. . The service was great (three stars) but the pizza was not.....the sauce was soupy resembling a can of tomato sauce just dumped ontop the large deep dished suasage pizza we ordered, leaving everyone at our 8 person table bewildered as to 'WTF happened to the Gino's they grew up knowing." . . No, No Gino I know you are favored amongst some but to me outside of the service you have failed this east coasters taste buds.......Love the valet at 13.00 and the location *tears up* but the food!!!!! Mayne damn!
