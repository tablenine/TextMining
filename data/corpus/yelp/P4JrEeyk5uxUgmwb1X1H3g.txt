Holy Crap Y'ALL......what else can I add to 404 reviews?? I was in Burbank for business and passed by this restaurant on Magnolia and Hollywood Way around lunch time and thought....uhm, this looks interesting. Boy was I in for a surprise! First of all there were like 30 or 40 people in line. I immediately pulled out my phone to yelp Porto's....I wasn't standing in this long line without a review. I saw the 4.5 stars and carried on with the line....but it does move fast. I ordered a feta cheese and tomato sandwich which comes with their fried banana chips. I LOVED it!!! First of all I think it set me back like $3.50 or something crazy good like that and it tasted like the feta cheese and roll were flown in from France.....(the frenchies make really great feta too...not just the greeks!!). Any who.......luckily I was able to find one little table open for my weary bum and sat down and ate one of the most memorable feta cheese sandwiches I have had EVER!!! I'm craving to go back. Am I really going to drive the 30 miles to go back, YES!! I also ordered a chocolate croissant, which was good but I'm a bit picky on my croissants but I ate every last bite so that is saying a lot! If you are ever in Burbank or Glendale (I understand that is the original Porto's) do stop in for a wonderful meal at an exceptional price......enjoy!!!
