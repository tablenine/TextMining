Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
When I lived down in Santa Monica, I'd constantly hear about Tito's Tacos. People would ask me if I'd been there, did I love it, etc. So I finally ambled down to Culver City, and... eh.. . The tacos are good, but they're nothing to write home about. In fact, until now, I've never felt the need to write about Tito's Tacos before.. . I'm most surprised that so many people share my point of view. I thought I was the only one unmoved. So why is there always a long line?
