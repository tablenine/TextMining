You'll spend a lot here... but I have to say.. they have the freshest sushi in town. I once spent $50 on dinner for myself here. . . The times I have come here, it has always been busy. I have waited 30min-1hour before. But the food is good.. so I don't mind all too much. The place is very clean, and they even give you hot towels. (NICE!) . . Parking in Little Tokyo seems to always be hectic. They do have parking for in that lot though. I think it ranges $2-5, but it beats driving around forever to park.
