Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
The name speaks for itself! Far and away, the best pastrami in LA! It is very rare that I ever order anything but the pastrami with mustard and split with some chili cheese fries or onion rings (could I clog my arteries any more?) and of course the pickles! It's cheap and is YUMMY! It's also a great place to eat on the patio on a late night after hanging out.  Just curl up by the fire pits and enjoy your meal.  They also have a jukebox player where you can pick some old tunes to make it feel like an episode of "Happy Days".  All in all, a great place to get an AWESOME pastrami sandwich!
