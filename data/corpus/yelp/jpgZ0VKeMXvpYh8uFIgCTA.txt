Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
Definitely a fan of Smoke Daddy. We went with a friend from out of town and had a blast. They have decent live music, a front patio and great food. We had three people at dinner and ordered one of the platters to share, which was plenty of food for 2 guys and a gal. The favorite among the group was the pulled pork. We did have the BBQ chicken wings to start, which had a great dry rub on them. The sweet potato fries were awesome. Mondays, when we were there, are $3 draft beers and they have a great beer list. Perfect for a low key summer meal with friends.
