Yet another nice culinary addition to Avondale, Urban Belly brings a touch of casual class to a soulless strip mall. I went here with a few friends from out of town, and they were very pleased. After taking them to Kuma's and Hot Doug's earlier in their visit, they seemed to really dig my neighborhood.. . We got the soba, udon, and ramen as well as a couple of the dumplings (can't remember which, but they were yummy). We shared everything, but I could have easily downed a bowl of the soba with room to spare. The ginger candy they give you at the end was nice. I've had ginger candy before, but theirs had an interesting "bite" to it that I was unfamiliar with. A nice touch.. . Dining experience was good - we waited for about 20 minutes for a space, along with a bunch of Asian folks. Always a good sign. We didn't chat with the other people at our table, but I'm certainly not averse to it. I think we were too busy gorging ourselves to talk.. . My only complaint is that our waitress seemed kind of clueless. When she seated us, about half the table was open. She wanted to seat the 5 of us in a long "L" with 4 people on the side of the table and 1 at the end. When we asked if we could sit with 2 on each side and 1 at the end, she seemed confused or miffed - I couldn't really tell which. I mean, isn't it better for other diners if we sit in a more compact arrangement? Ah well, it's not like that's gonna keep me from coming back.
