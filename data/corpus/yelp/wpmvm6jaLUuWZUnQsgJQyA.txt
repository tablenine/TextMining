This place is exquisite with impeccable service. Well done. . . I came here with friends and had an enjoyable experience. The bar area is sleek and cool and loud, the dining room is more upscale and fancy. . . The food is very very good. Is it worth the money? Probably not. But, it was still very tasty. Had the dish that so many yelpers recommended: chatham cod. Very solid. The beef tenderloin was also good. The lobster risotto to start was amazing! And, they didn't skimp on the lobster meat. There were very big chunks. The artisanal cheese plate is very good and was actually cute looking, if that makes sense. . . The dessert was to die for. The apple strudel was magnificent, with the flaky and buttery crust and ice cream to go wit it. . . I would not come back, only because I thought the cost was too pricy. But, I would come back for the food and great service if it was on someone else's dime.
