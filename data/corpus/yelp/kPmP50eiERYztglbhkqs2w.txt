An out of the way hole in the wall, but definitely worth the voyage! The food is incredible. Delicious chicken, fabulous green sauce, and killer Sangria! I was very spectacle about Pervuvian food prior to going to Pio Pio and let's just say I am a believer. Well done Pio Pio, I will be seeing you again soon!
