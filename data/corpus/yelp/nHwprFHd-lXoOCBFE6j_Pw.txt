Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
It's a might hard to find a soulful southern staple like chicken and waffles in LA, or Southern California in general for that matter, but Roscoe's makes up for the shortage on all accounts. . . Some of the best fried chicken you've ever tasted finds it's way next to some fluffy, scrumptious waffles and ends up right in front of you, just waiting for ya to dig in. Pair that with some butter, maple syrup, and good company and you'll have a meal that you'll remember for some time to come. Talk about full though! I ate here yesterday and I still don't feel very hungry.. . Service is adequate, but not exceptional and I think it wouldn't hurt to clean the restaurant itself a little more often, but overall a great experience.
