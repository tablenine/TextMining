It's the original and it's the best! . . I can wholeheartedly recommend the:. French dip (beef) with mayo and American cheese. Cole slaw. Pickles (ask for extra - they're THAT good!). Lemonade. . The lines will be overwhelming but they move fast and it's cheap. . . I've been many times before and I will go many times again.
