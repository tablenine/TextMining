Just okay, but overall, pretty bland for southern.  . . Feed would be the perfect comfort-food-greasy-spoon-hole-in-the-wall-alterna -hipster paradise, if only the food were better. The reason people love other places like this is first and foremost -- the food. Unfortunately my experience with Feed is that it has been average at best. It is pretty inconsistent.. . Last visit - food was served just slightly warmer than cold.  I placed my order then went into the bathroom to wash my hands, and when I came out it was sitting on the counter waiting.   While I appreciate the speedy service (it was an empty Sunday evening, so there was no rush) the two minutes was a little too quick for me to accept without suspicion that it was just warmed over.    The prices are good with generous portions, so I can't understand the folks complaining about prices.   But, the fun decor minus really good food....I can't understand the 5 star ratings either.. . Last meal there - slow Sunday evening - total of three patrons - chilly temperatures and it seemed like heat was off in the dining room.  I had roasted chicken...was just okay.  Mac and cheese - worst ever in my life.    And sorry, but the mashed potatoes and gravy tasted the same as Popeye's, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but not exactly what I was hoping for in a home-style meal. . . I was literally depressed when I left.  Not a good feeling when you go for comfort food.
