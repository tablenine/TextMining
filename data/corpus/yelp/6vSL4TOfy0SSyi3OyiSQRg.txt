The last time I ate here was with my mom. She got the lamb and I had the duck red curry. Really enjoyed my dishes although the curry was a little too spicy for me. The servers were a little spastic that day. Our server was young and she tried, but they just arent' that coordinated over there. . . The decor is a little tired and needs a lift, but recommended if you're in the area and craving casual thai food.
