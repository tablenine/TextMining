Personally, I don't think TAP would survive outside Midtown.  TAP has a few attributes that make it successful precisely where it is now.. . - A spacious patio on Peachtree and 14th Street. - A friendly waitstaff. - A trendy looking decor. - A draught beer list that is above average. - A complimentary valet. . The menu looks interesting, but the execution is off, as has been reviewed before.  However, I was found of the "meat and cheese" appetizer, if only to shout the famous SportsCenter catchphrase in the bar.. . If you head here, stick to the high end beers, as the cocktails and "cheap" beers are overpriced.  Also, enjoy the patio or the cool bar - inside tables are a waste of time.
