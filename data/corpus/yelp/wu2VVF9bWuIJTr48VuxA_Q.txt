This might just be my new place!! A good friend of mine and I decided we needed a Sunday adventure, even though we both had to work Monday. We went for dinner and drinks. I had The 50 Burger which had bbq sauce, cheddar, onion rings and was on a pretzel bun. It came with fries so I got the sweet potato fries. The food was just absolutely delicious. My friend got the Mac &amp; Cheese and hers was so good. It has a smoked taste to it kind of. The burger was huge so I had some to take home and some more fries. Can't wait to dig into that for dinner. . I had a few Cheetah Woods...love the name. It's peach vodka with lemonade and ice tea. Very good and very sweet. Then I switched to a beer cocktail, which I'd never considered before. It had berries, vodka I think and beer and it was delicious. We had quite a few drinks and it was just a great time!! . Can't wait to go back sometime!!
