Unbelievable. I split my meal, so I could take some home and experience it all over again! They were out of the fried chicken by the time I got there, so I had the lamb burger, and it was amazing. It had so much flavor, and I was pleasantly surprised by the topping of goat cheese, basil, and jam. I can't wait to go back. the Bar is also another plus, a solid date place.
