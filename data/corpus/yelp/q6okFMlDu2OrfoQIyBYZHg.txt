mmm,mmm,mmm, phillippe is delish and an la instiution that actually deserves the lines running to the back of the room.   . . not only are the sammies delicious but so are their puddings: egg custard and tapoica.  . . my only beef (ha ha) with them is that they do not take credit cards.  cash only , my friends.   oh, yeah, parking is a bitch, too, during prime time.
