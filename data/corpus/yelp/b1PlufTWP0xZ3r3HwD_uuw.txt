Had Easter Brunch here. It was pretty good. The croissant sandwich and the sweet potatoes were very tasty. The mac n'cheese with lobster was different but very good. The pancakes were like pancake balls, about golf ball size, filled with Meyer lemon filling. The pancakes were just ok, nothing special. The service was rather slow, not because it was Easter, I think they're just slow. The waitress was 'meh' at best. Overall, a nice Easter Brunch in the outdoor seating area, not sure I'd go back though.
