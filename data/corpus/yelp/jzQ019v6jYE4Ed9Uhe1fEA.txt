Restaurant: Fogo de Chao

If you crave the best meat you've ever tasted, go to Fogo de Chao.  They have like twelve kinds of meats, all perfectly grilled, all sliced tableside.  You have to beg them to go away-they will keep bringing you more.  The salad bar is great, some very nice choices to accompany your meats, but be careful not to indulge too much on that, as you'll want to try all the lovelies they bring to your table...I made that mistake.  The plantains are nice as well.... We went for dinner, it is about $60 per person, worth it, but I hear the lunch price is half that, for the same food and service...so next time we'll try then. (Tough times call for tough choices LOL). A++++ service and a really cool dinner idea, especially for groups.
