Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
ATTENTION: For all you garlic aficionados! The Stinking Rose=Garlic heaven!!. . I love the interior of this place, because it has that artsy fartsy vibe with black&amp;white photos of famous Hollywood stars all over the walls. They have a ton of different sauces lined up w/ funny names such as "Butt Twister" and "Queen of Farts." Clever huh? Anyways, they have their own separate, closed off, aisle for couples only-looks like a cute place for a romantic date. For some reason, this place kinda reminded me of the Venetian at Vegas, because you feel like you're in a tiny/cartoonish village in Italy. . . Now on to the food! I ordered the Salmon with lemon butter sauce. It was very good and of course, it had that slight taste of garlic. My only complaint is that the food is way too salty. Other than that, our server was very pleasant and I enjoyed my meal there. Of course, I had to try out the GARLIC ICE CREAM. WTH you say? I know...I just had to! It had caramel covered over the scoop of ice cream, and my first bite of it was disgust! But, after a few more nibbles the garlic taste does wear off. It's a unique taste, but my taste buds weren't ecstatic about the flavor. This place is a must for those who are bored of the mundane Italian restaurants that L.A. has to offer.
