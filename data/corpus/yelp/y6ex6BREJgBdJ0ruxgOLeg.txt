Category: Steakhouses
My wife and I love coming here.  It seems to be a relatively reasonably priced steakhouse and the sides are decently sized.  Plus, having the . http://restaurant.com.  coupons definitely help.. . our favorites for dinner:. . 1. Fried green tomatoes appetizer - It seems to be kinda hit or miss . . . sometimes it's totally out-of-this-world good . . . other times we've had it . . . mmm . . . okay.  I really like the way that have their mixture of crispy fried green tomatoes with goat cheese and the pesto. . . 2. Filet - I love their black-pepper crusted outside.  Coming off the grill, it's perfectly burnt on the outside, leaving the inside moist and tender. Plus, the fact that it comes with an included side is a nice thing, whereas at other nice steak houses, you have to order sides separately (a la carte). . 3. Black truffle mac-n-cheese - Do not be deceived.  This is very very very good.  However, it's also been kinda hit or miss.  Some times when we've ordered it, it's been a little runny/watery.  The last time it was perfect.  The cheese was stringy and literally we couldn't get it to break between the bowl and our mouths.  Sickly good.. . and if you just want a quick bite for lunch, we've found that we really just enjoy ordering their house salad with steak.  They are very generous for their steak portions, and we love the mixture of greens, blue cheese, dried cherries, and black pepper.. . Only reason for 4/5 stars is inconsistency.
