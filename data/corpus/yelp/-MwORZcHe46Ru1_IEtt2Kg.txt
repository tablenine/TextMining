Restaurant: Crawfish Shack Seafood
Category: Seafood
Crawfish Shack has nothing on Southern Seafood.. . It's mid-day, my girlfriend and I are in the mood for crawfish.  Our first choice is Southern Seafood. We take a glance at our watches and see S.S. is closing up as we speak.  Our only alternative is Crawfish Shack.. . It's hard to locate the establishment due to it's poor shopping center location off the road (Buford Hwy). . . The place is bustling with late comers and pickup orders.  We order 5 lbs of crawfish, 2 lbs of steamed crab legs, side orders of corn and potatoes.  The total came close to $50 bucks! That's a lot to satisfy a crawfish craving.. . The crawfish were small and not that well seasoned.  The steamed crab legs where exactly that, just steamed.. . The sides were $1 a piece, quite steep for a quarter piece of corn on the cob. . . If you are in the hankering for crawfish or seafood? Plan ahead and make your way to Southern Seafood.  The crawfish is perfectly seasoned and on point with its spices.  The fish is driven intown almost daily from Alabama.  Doesn't get any fresher than that my seafood fans!
