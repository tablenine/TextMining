Came back before going to the USC basketball game yesterday. We got there early enough to have dinner. The food was good as always and service was excellent. I had the Miso Sea Bass. Yummmmm. The sea bass was cooked to perfection and the bak-choi was a great compliment to the sea bass. . . I'm not a beer drinker but server suggested couple of beers that were tasty (one that was hoppy and one that wasn't - not sure what that means. I know hop is an ingredient). . . I'm beginning to love the vibe here at LA Live (I know I mentioned this several times so you can tell my enthusiasm for this place). . Just a quick note that nothing is cheap at LA Live. Â But then again, what isn't in major cities..
