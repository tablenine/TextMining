The set up is cute and everybody was extremely nice, which is also a plus. A friend and i had this eggplant and albacore in a slight sweet black bean sauce. It was pretty good and of course we had sushi. . . The sushi was good, the fish was fresh and they didn't use massive amount of rice on the sushi. The rice is also nicely seasoned and didn't fall apart, which is key to a good sushi. . . The only thing i was disappointed were the spicy tuna rice cracker. The rice cracker were not crispy on the outside. It seemed they slightly pan fried the outside of the cracker, which is a no no for rice crackers.. . Also, we got dessert similar to banana fosters with vanilla ice cream. It wasn't that great. Just stick with the green tea ice cream.
