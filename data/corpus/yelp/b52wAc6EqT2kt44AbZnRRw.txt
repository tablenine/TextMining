Restaurant: Nava
Category: Tex-Mex
I actually really like Nava and I have been there once before this visit (I don't live in Georgia). I enjoy the food because I think the hint of Southwestern-- and not Tex Mex-- influences really makes it stand out from other decent restaurants you find in cities. For some reason, I am really fixated on their blue corn bread, even though I have definitely had better cornbread in other places. . . Nava is indeed unique, but I was extremely disappointed this time around due to the fact that the host gave us attitude right when we went in and would not seat us because my husband was 'wearing a t-shirt.' He was actually wearing a sweater under his jacket. When we showed it to him, he tried to come up with another reason why we did not meet the dress code. The funny part was, while he was in the middle of finding another excuse, the other hostess (or manager...not really sure) came in to the lobby when he was in mid-sentence and just offered to lead us to our seats without a second-glance. . . Our waiter was clumsy and a little awkward, but I give him props for trying and plus he was really nice and sincere. Everything else went pretty well...The calamari with sweet onions was good, but not as crispy as I like them. The lobster tacos were fancy and tasty, but I couldn't really make out the lobster since the other flavors were a bit strong. My scallops in red chile were fresh and juicy, though I can't say the same for the bed of tomato grits they came on. Maybe I would have enjoyed the food a bit better if the host didn't ruin my mood at the beginning. I remembered enjoying Nava last time when I ate there 4-5 years ago and I was really looking forward to going there when I was in Atlanta this time...
