Restaurant: Twisted Taco
Category: Mexican
I've been frequenting Twisted Taco for about 3 or 4 years.  The service is incredibly friendly and helpful...  and fun.. . Thursday, Friday and Saturdays are always good party nights with a packed bar downstairs and karaoke upstairs.  . . Lately, I've been attending Monday night Trivia, with a chance of winning gift certificates good toward drinks their extensive menu, featuring Fajita Wings and all types of yummy tacos, burritos and nachos usually, available before 11pm or 12 am (depending on the night)
