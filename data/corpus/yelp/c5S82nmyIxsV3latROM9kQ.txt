The best fall-off-the-bone ribs I have had in Atlanta!  This is a regular place for great service, excellent food, and the best looking patrons!  OK, maybe they just *think* they're the best looking.  Don't go for the attitude, go for the ribs and chicken finger platter!  Spinach and Limas and cornbread are some of my favorite vegetables here.  I tend to stay away from their rice dishes (I don't like Uncle Ben's-type).  Try their Mandarin Turkey Salad -- it satisfies when you need a little light meal.  The portion isn't very light, but, it is good.  I don't remember the name of the balsamic vinaigrette, but it is my favorite dressing here.
