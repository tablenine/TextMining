Disclaimer: this would be a 4 star review if one of the following were true. . 1) I lived or worked in or near Decatur. . 2) I had come to the Grange with a relatively full stomach, rather than the point of starving where it nearly turns on itself for food. . 3) I didn't have such a chip on my shoulder toward Irish and Irish themed bars.. . So yes, take this review with a grain of salt if any of the above actually do apply to you. If you don't mind Irish pubs and you aren't all that hungry and you're already in Decatur, the Grange may very well be your best bet. But for me, it's a solid B average. A nice, central bar with a rather impressive beer list (although I was never given a menu so couldn't check out their entire span) and friendly enough staff. They share their closest parking with Watershed so on popular nights out parking can be seriously tricky. The food was a hearty mediocre: I had the shrimp and chips and the shrimp was pretty bland and tasteless while the fries were solid and well seasoned.. . And there ya go. An average review for an average bar. That's pretty much all I can say about that.
