Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
Don't you hate it when you go to a promising-looking Thai restaurant, order your favorite dish, and get a pile of greasy, limp, formerly frozen crud on your plate? Me too. Fear not: Sticky Rice is here.. Try the bamboo grubs, or the quails, or dig into the great vegetarian and vegan selections. I love digging the meat out of the young coconuts and covering it with chili sauce. Mmm-mm.. The service here is friendly and fast, and the decor is just plain fun. Definitely my favorite Thai in Chicago!
