Bar, Brunch, Dinner - honestly you can't go wrong at Gilbert's.  I've frequented this place off and on for the last two years I've lived in Atlanta and I've never been disappointed.  Last night I was completely wowed by the Mussaka and the Pear &amp; Arugala Salad.  It was ridiculously amazing.  The portions were also the perfect size.  I love when restaurants don't overdo it with the portion size - or underdo it for that matter; I can't stand some of the gourmet places that leave you starving afterwards.  The serving size is always perfect at Gilbert's.  Brunch here is another one of my favorites because of the all you can eat menu.  We're not talking buffet either, this is pure, order off the menu, not sitting in some heat lamped countertop for hours, goodness.  The french fries are AWESOME!  Service is always great, and definitely with a smile.  I know I'm going to keep coming back again and again.
