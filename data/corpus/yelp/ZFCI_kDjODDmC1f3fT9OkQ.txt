Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pinks is an LA thing that you are required (by law I think) to go to at least once.. . Unless you go at an odd hour like 9 AM on a Tuesday, expect to see a long line that is constantly growing.  It's hard to tell if most of the people here are locals or tourists, but it doesn't matter.  They all gather here to share a mutual love for mystery meat shaped in a phallic manner.. . I usually get the chili cheese dog and the chili cheese tamale.  I know, it sounds strange... but they do serve tamales.  The fact that they offer them with a chili cheese option, scores extra points with me.  On top of that, they sell old school sodas in glass bottles.  That is a nice touch.. . You're not going to be overwhelmed by the flavors offered here.  It's hot dogs after all.  There's more hype than food.   You'd think with all that salty meaty goodness I'd experience constant food-gasms.  But honestly, I feel like I'd have to fake it sometimes.
