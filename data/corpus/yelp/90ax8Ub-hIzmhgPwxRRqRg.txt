Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
This place came highly recommended to me, and it did not disappoint.  I have been here a bunch of times by now, and have yet to be anything but thrilled with the food and service.  They have a "build your own sandwich" area on the menu, but you'd never need it with the varieties that the have in place.  Great beers, coffee and tea too.
