Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I think this is one of those places people have fond memories of, or ate there since they were a kid. But for me I don't see the hype. Probably because when I was a kid there was only El Cholo's and this was all we knew. But now with all the Mexican and hispanic food places open I can get authentic, tex mex or dare I say it, Taco Bull.....
