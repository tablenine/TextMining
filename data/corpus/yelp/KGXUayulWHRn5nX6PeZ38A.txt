The kimchi was very WOOF!. And the Soju was GRRR!. .. and no, this wasn't typed by a dog.. They cannot type, unfortunatly.... You can have a bad experience if YOU DON"T COOK IT TO YOUR LIKING! Good thing people tend to their own meat... (giggle) and cook it however they want it..  Bring friends, buy alcohol, and enjoy.
