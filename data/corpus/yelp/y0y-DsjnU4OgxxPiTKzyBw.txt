Visited this establishment for the first time last night.. The service was a bit slow, but it was good.. I went with the recommendation of the Monk fish and it was TO DIE FOR! It was perfectly cooked! I do not eat Beets, but everyone who ordered the beets as an appetizer LOVED IT. The Fries with the steak Frites were amazing as well; what made it was the super yummy garlic mayo with it. . A friend of mine had a meat dish with a truffle mashed potatoes and it truly was orgasmic!. . Overall, I loved the atmosphere and the food. I would definitely visit again.. We brought our own wine (with corkage fee) and did not have time for dessert, so I cannot comment.
