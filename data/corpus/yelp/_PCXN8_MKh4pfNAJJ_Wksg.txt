Been here a couple of times...I really want to rave about this place, but for the fact that it is slightly overpriced.  I recommend the Hangover Pasta. Nice looking restaurant with a minimalist vibe to it, and a good beer selection.  The problem is that everything costs a few bucks more than it really should.
