How's this for a "Useful" Review?  Cleo's still has 10 cent wings on Monday nights, including Buffalo, teriaki, and jerk, and even surprisingly classy bar fare like baked goat cheese.  The servers are funny and cool, and they have Fat Tire, Blue Moon, many other great beers, and a nice patio.. . Enjoy.
