Restaurant: Nan Thai Fine Dining
Category: Thai
Best panang curry in Atlanta!  Most creative thai menu in Atlanta!  Best ambiance of all thai restaurants in Atlanta! Best service of all thai restaurants in Atlanta!  Let's face it.........Nan is the best thai in Atlanta.. . I use to bestow these platitudes upon Tamarind (old), but Nan has stepped up the game.  Obviously, the owners were not satisfied with being a really good thai restaurant, they wanted to be great (Tamarind-old &amp; new as well as Nan have same owners).. . If you love thai....go here.  If you appreciate good service.....go here.  If you like your food listed and plated with some creativity.....go here.  If you have a third date....go here and thank me later :p
