Been there a few times and have to say the restaurant is great!  I don't consider most restaurants to be great.  But, the dishes have amazing flavors.  Don't expect to get filled up quickly though.  I found the less fillings ones, towards the top of the menu, were better than the more filling ones, towards the bottom of the menu.  I don't think this is a good restaurant to eat often because you will be acclimated to the flavors over time and of course, the price is high.  Oh, the chocolate desserts are amazing!
