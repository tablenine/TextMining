Wins the blue ribbon for best vegan pho in LA. Â Feeling sickypoos? Go here. Feeling hungover? Go here. Feeling like you need some food therapy? Go here. It usually comes out in about 5-10 minutes so it's a quick fix unless it's a weekend night. The mung bean crepe is another vegan option that is delish and comes with a mound of veggies and green herbs. Pho me anytime. Just remember it's cash only.
