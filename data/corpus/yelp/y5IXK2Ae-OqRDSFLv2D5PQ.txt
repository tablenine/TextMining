Restaurant: Over Easy Caf√©
Category: American (Traditional)
This place is small, therefore not a good place for a group gathering (4 was pushing it, they only had like 4 tables for 4, and the other 10 tables were for two). It is a very popular restaurant + small tables = a lot of waiting.. . We went on Saturday morning and we had to wait 45 minutes. Oh, and when we went (Jan 3rd) it was not that cold; but I would not go right now (-30 with the windchill) because you'll have to wait outside. They do serve you free hot coffee though. . . But perhaps it would not be as busy in the wee hours of the morning, or on a weekday.. . I forgot the name of what I ordered, but it was an omelette with spinach, goat cheese, and portabella mushrooms. Delicious. I would have opted for the egg white option, but that was going to make my eggs super pricey.. . Salt &amp; pepper shakers were cute.
