Gosh, just look at the line outside this place...I always hated waiting for a table here, but yet I keep on coming back. I guess I just can't resist their tender and succulent chicken rice. . . If you are Singaporean, you probably would say you've had better, as I've heard many times from my Singaporean friends, but I've never had the chicken rice in Singapore, so I'm giving it my 5 stars!
