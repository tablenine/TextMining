Restaurant: Highland Tap
Category: Steakhouses
highland tap is a must if your in the burger and steak game. the atmosphere is warm and cozy which invites one to just order up and unbuckle the pants. prime rib great, burger super good too. my husband loves it and i love any place that makes him this happy. the prices are fair for what you get and the servers are sharp. will return again and again!
