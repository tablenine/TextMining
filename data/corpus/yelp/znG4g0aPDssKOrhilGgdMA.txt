Go for the meat (market) and stay for the fish.. . The bar downstairs on saturday had several pairs of attractive women looking around for attention. The drinks are pricey so there's a barrier to entry for cheapskates. I'd go back there to meet a pretty girl. But that's not why I was there last night. My group of 6 friends had a hard time finding a place to stand while we waited for our table. We were always in the way, but the staff was really polite as they maneuvered through our human obstacle course. . . When we finally sat down at 10:30 (only reservation we could get), we took a look at the menu. Once again, not for cheapskates. Cheapest bottle of cold sake was $46. Maybe I'm missing something, but usually when I go out sake is between 10 and 20 for a carafe. We opted out of sake, and just ordered whatever appealed from the menu. The food was pretty good, but not incredible. Sushi preparation was traditional and presentation met expectations. For such a fancy place, I expected the sushi to be a little more innovative. Seaweed salad was fantastic. We split 3 desserts between 6 of us. We got out of there with a bill of $70 per person upstairs and about $20 - $30 for 2 drinks a person downstairs.. . I might go back again with a group of people, or an attractive woman who likes the idea of sushi. For someone who hasn't had amazing sushi, Bond St would garner 5 stars based on good food and great experience.
