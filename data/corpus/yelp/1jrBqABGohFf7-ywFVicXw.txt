If I'm going to pay $10 for a sandwich, make me the damn sandwich. Don't give me a couple of flatbread corners and two strange piles and let me do it myself. And if that IS what you're going to do, make sure that it's better than the DIY sandwiches I've got at home.  . . At least 4 people on staff were wearing a shirt proclaiming "I heart Lola's Lechon!"  A devout lechon lover, I asked the girl at the counter for a jibarito, hold the tofu (to which I am alergic) and give me the LECHON! Nope. No dice. They don't make lechon, they just wear it on their uniforms.. . For $26.46 I got the Korean Kogi, tostones and a very greasy tofu jibarito called the Boriqua. I do not feel I got my moneys worth in the slightest. No one at my table was impressed with their meal and we all agreed we wouldn't be back. As a matter of fact, the tostones were the only thing that got them that extra star.. . Other things that I didn't like: there's no waiting area so we were told to wait in the Green Eye. I brought beer, I didn't want to go get more at the bar. It is essentially a fast food joint with everything being do it yourself, from getting silverware to pouring waters. The only difference between this and your local burger shack is this place has a hostess and the tables get bussed.. . In short, I'll never be back and I won't be sending anyone I know their way either.
