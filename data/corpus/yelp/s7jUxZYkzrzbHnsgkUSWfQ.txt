Restaurant: La CrÃªperie
Category: French
Authentic cuisine, savory dishes and original decor all create an excellent dining experience. La Creperie lacked the rather snobby atmosphere I have found in many other Chicagoland Crepe restaurants with a truly homely feel and scrumptious entrees. The dishes range from truly original and exciting to the palate to a creation you'd be certain you could make at home... But it wouldn't turn out nearly as delicious!
