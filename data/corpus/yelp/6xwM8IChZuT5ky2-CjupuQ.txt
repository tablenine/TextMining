Been hearing a lot of good things about The Counter so figured it was finally time to give it a try. The place was pretty busy and we had a group of five so we ended up waiting about 20 minutes for a table. At least you can grab a beer or milk shake while you wait. While we were waiting we looked over the menu pretty throughly and already knew what we all were going to get before sitting down. I ended up getting the burger of the month which was the an ahi tuna burger. The wasbi sauce on it rocked! Â  They have some great option for sides / appetizers including, fried pickles, regular and sweet potato fries. They also come with different dipping sauces, which I loved. I'm a big fan of trying different sauces especially since ketchup is pretty gross. To wash all this delicious food down I had the peanut butter shake which was really good. A friend got the eggnog shake and that was pretty good as well. . . Over all The Counter is worth checking out if you're a burger fan... and really who isn't? They could use a better beer selection and maybe some tater tots... and come on, where is the pretzel bun option? Still a solid place though.
