Restaurant: Adobo Grill
Category: Latin American
I had been craving margaritas for a while, so my boyfriend did some research and came up with Adobo. He read that the margaritas were affordable and delicious; the food and guacamole were supposed to be great. What we found was another story altogether. We had made a reservation, and expected to get seated at a good table for a nice date-night out. Instead we got seated on the THIRD floor at the last table in the back (talk about prime seating). Of course I promptly ordered a margarita: it couldn't have been less authentic. Instead of tart, it was sweet like a sugar-y margarita mix you can buy at Dominick's. The drink arrived in a dirty tumbler. The "mezcal" margarita my boyfriend ordered was $2 more than mine, but used the same, low-grade mix. My boyfriend then ordered the table-side guac, since he had read such great things about it. It was mediocre at best, and they give you a very small portion. We had one other appetizer and two drinks each. We decided against ordering entrees since we weren't impressed with the food. The kicker was the bill came to $100!! I definitely don't recommend it. It's a restaurant that gets by on the theatre rush and false hype. Check out Riques (Uptown) or Fonda del Mar for great, authentic Mexican.
