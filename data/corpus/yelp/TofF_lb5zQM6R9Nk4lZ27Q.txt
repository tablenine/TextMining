So I was turned 29 this year and I was sick of doing the same thing every birthday. It's is really a hassle to get a big group of friends together because people always flake, then you have to change your dinner reservation.... blah . . So this year, I did it differently. I only invited 7 of my friend to an evening at the Magic Castle. I don't like to toot my own horn but toot toot, this was a great idea. I don't think I've had this much fun watching magic ever in my life. . . Sure every corner your turn there is a bar or a bar maid asking if you want a drink but that makes it more fun for everyone! Not only are there fantastic magic shows you can go see but there are tons of magicians walking about and doing tricks. . . Personally I liked the close up magic the best! I didn't eat here. I had a sweet hook up so I was able get in without the dinner requirement. I have heard bad and good things about the good but I'll never find out! . . Alcohol makes magic that much more fun... well if you're friends don't get into a fight and get kicked out of the castle
