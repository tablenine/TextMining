My friends make fun of how much I love this restaurant! But they all completely agree that this place is "THE BOMB" ! This hawaiian fusion steak &amp; seafood just makes me want to go to Hawaii. There is not one dish you will not enjoy! At this point I've have literally tried almost everything on the menu. . The service is outstanding! Everyone welcomes you with a smile, very polite, and just down right fun to talk with &amp; be around. . My favorite dish that I have got all my friends hooked on is their Seared Ahi-Tuna. And last but not least you MUST get their Hawaiian Martini !
