This place would be great if it weren't for the migraine-inducing, loud Celine Dion dance remixes playing.. . Plus the waiters are douchebags. My boo asked one a question once, and he walked off. He also asked the waiter to do something with the music, and the waiter walked off again. He got a very lousy tip that night.. . The food is not the best sushi ever (think of this place as the McDonald's of sushi), but I'd rather try my luck at the Murder Kroger getting shit sushi than walking into this place.. . Overall=Total utter crap.
