AWESOME Irish pub! This is an ideal place for a happy hour with some friends or co-workers. They have a bunch of good beers on tap and a staff that it very friendly and attentive. The building itself is beautiful inside, with a nice layout that keeps the noise down. Late at night, it morphs from a nice gathering for a beer and conversation to a livelier, louder bar for mingling and drinking. It almost seems to grow with your mood as you go through the evening. . . Food is pretty good, and I strongly recommend the vegetarian shepherd's pie!
