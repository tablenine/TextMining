Overpriced, lethargic service, there was ONE piece of bacon on my BLT.  WTF?  If you don't drink coffee like me, but drink tea, be weary, they had only five bags of tea in stock, and no variety. Then the busboy took away my bookmark for the book I was reading when he cleaned away my dishes.  When I asked about it, no one was very interested in looking for it, and when I asked that they do, it was half-hearted at best.  That made me sad, why would someone mistake a bookmark for trash?  It's not a used napkin.  Yes, it's just a bookmark, but c'mon!  After a crappy, overpriced meal and bad service, did I really need to lose a personal item as well?    . . This was the first time I had ever been there, and it sucked, and I never got my bookmark back.  I will never return.  DO NOT patronize this restaurant, there are MUCH better diners in the city to choose from.
