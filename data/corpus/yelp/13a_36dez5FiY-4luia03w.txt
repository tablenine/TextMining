I went and tried Bari's after all the glowing reviews on here. I have to be honest...I was kind of disappointed. Maybe expectations were too high. You do get a huge sandwich for reasonable prices (I ordered the Italian sub), but it was nothing really to write home about. The D'Amato roll dwarfs the meat and cheese, making the sub hard to eat, and the flavor wasn't really anything exceeding what you could make yourself at home. Am I missing something here?
