I came here armed with cash ready to load myself with delicious potato balls but ended up with a Red Velvet cupcake, a Fruit Tart and a Triple Chocolate Mousse as well! I couldn't resist =-). . First things first: Since WHEN did Portos start stuffing their potato balls with chili? I haven't been here for about 2 years and I don't recall there EVER being meat in those balls (no pun intended). But don't get me wrong, I was DELIGHTFULLY surprised! They are SO good! In fact, I am craving them right now as we speak.. . Their Red Velvet cupcake is pretty good as well. Not as rich and decadent as Sprinkles, but hell of a lot cheaper! ($3.75 vs. $1.60). The frosting on the cupcake is just as delicious as Sprinkles though, in my opinion.. . The Triple Chocolate Mousse was way too rich and chocolate-y for me. I know some of you might be wondering, "what's so bad about that?", but it's just not my cup of tea. Other than that, it was really light and refreshing for a heavy chocolate dessert.. . Lastly, their fruit tart was the most expensive item that I bought, about $2.60 I believe. The tart itself was very buttery and flaky, and in my opinion, perfectly baked. Their custard however, wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped it to be, but you can tell that Portos uses only the freshest and juiciest fruit for their tarts!. . Portos is absolutely delicious and insanely popular for a good reason. It is almost a guarantee that you will not find these chili filled potato balls anywhere else! Definitely a must try!
