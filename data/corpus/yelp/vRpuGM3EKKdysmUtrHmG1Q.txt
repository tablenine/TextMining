Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Overrated, but one of those things where you have to do at least once if you're in LA. The line is almost always long and it does not move quickly. However, I have noticed that the line is sometimes shorter in the early lunch (11a-12p) and dinner (5p-6p) hours than it is at off-peak times like 3 o'clock in the afternoon. The summer months are especially bad because it is a tourist spot. The parking lot is also kind of crazy but sometimes you can luck into street parking. . . Overall, I'd say go if you've never been. If nothing else, to say that you've done it and to form your own opinion of the place. Personally, I would never wait in the line if it's super long and winding down into the parking lot because I just don't find it worth it, but I know some who worship the place and don't mind wasting an hour of their life waiting to buy a hot dog. To each their own!
