Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
I did it...I couldn't resist.   After being a part for so long, having conflicting schedules and many many miles in between.  All the months and months, even years, of craving and yearning the cajuny, garlicy goodness of what is boiling crab...was finally put to sleep.    Each tender morsel and every finger licking moment gave me great satisfaction...It put me on cloud 9.   And as i still linger in this moment and savor each  flavorful goodness,  I'm happy...couldn't be happier.. . Service? What service? who has time to worry about service when they're in the zone of breaking, peeling, pulling and sucking the head (don't get any dirrty ideas!) i didn't have time to worry about service.  Service to me was making sure my drink is filled and leaving me at peace with the only thing that mattered to me in that moment...my 2 pounds of crawfish.. . Thank you God for listening to my prayers and opening a Los Angeles location of Boiling Crab.  There is a god! Hallelujah!
