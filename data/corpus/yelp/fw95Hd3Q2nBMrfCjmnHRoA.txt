Definitely a fun place to go with a group.  The ambiance is great and just a good vibe.  They're always playing music and its never too loud which it nice. The hostess wasn't the nicest.  We waited about 25 minutes in the bar and luckily we were sitting next to one of the owners.  He overheard our complaints and came up to me and apologized and he sat us in a very exclusive area.  After that the waiter was very nice and very attentive. . The food is great.  I recommend all rolls.  My group shared 5 different roles and they were all great.  We finished it about 10 minutes flat.  . The area is great as well.  Its Hollywood, so that pretty much explains it.  . Just make a reservation so you don't wait forever.  Even with a reservation, their is a bit of a wait.
