Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Fathers office has the potential... but was very disappointing.. . A group from my company decided to visit this local bar because of the good words we had been hearing... The staff is very unhelpful and rude. The bar tenders are very nice and accommodating but everyone else running around with earpieces like they are some kind of pit crew is just plain annoying. Â They don't know anything about the beer either. I would expect a cultured experience but got the opposite.. . One of our company executives arrived and was immediately lectured on bringing in "outside food" (empty snack size bag of Cheezits).
