How can you go wrong with a rattlesnake rabbit hotdog?? So does that mean the rattlesnake ATE the rabbit? Hence, the combo? Probably not, but I must say that it was one tasty hotdog! Having lived in Germany for four years, I thought the bratwurst was excellent and brought back some fond memories of deutchland.. . I accidently walked in through the back entrance with my friends and we thought it was kind of cool that the building was unmarked and had such a huge door... then realized we walked into the back door.. I really liked the set up of the whole place.. it's a casual, family-style feel with the bit tables set up for people to be able to get close enough to meet others. . . One thing I won't forget is the Curry-Ketchup that I got for the fries! Amazing and I would go back just for that stuff! Good selection of beer as well.. . . I'll definitely be heading back...
