Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
Absolutley one of my all-time favorite places to take folks who are new to or visiting Chicago. There is nothing like it anywhere. The pizzas are kind of like something you might get if you gave all the essential ingredient of pizza to Buckminster Fuller and said, "Wow me." They are served upside down in a bowl. The crust is a dome on top,cheese on the bottom and everything else inside. The server flips the bowl over a viola, you've got a bread bowl full of sauce and meat and a couple whole mushrooms under a blanket of cheese. Man, it's goooood. The grinders are fantastic too but they will take you down for the day. I rarely get the grinders as our regimen is never strayed from. First get a couple of beers and the flat bread. Then the salad with the 2 dressings that when mixed are unbeatable and then the pizzas. Then whine about how full we are during the cab ride home.
