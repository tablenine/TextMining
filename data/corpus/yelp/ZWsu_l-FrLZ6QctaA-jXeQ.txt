This places is great. You can read that from nearly any review. Why write another? Mostly because I am at working and I can almost say I am being paid to write this review. Plus it afords me the oportunity to tell a short funny story. . . Long story short, After getting hammered at Akbar me and guy headed to meet his friend at freds for some post drinking eating. No more than sitting there for 5 minutes my guy knocks out and I am left to converse with his friend whom I never met previously. The waitress thought it was quite funny how quickly he was out and was sleeping in the booth.. . That asside the food is always great. You really can not go wrong with everything. last thing I had there was for breakfast and it was an egg goat cheese breakfast sandwich with avocado if i remember correctly. It was just good. . . You cant beat the atmosphere and it was just such a beautiful day to sit outside and have breakfast with a friend and enjoy the morning.
