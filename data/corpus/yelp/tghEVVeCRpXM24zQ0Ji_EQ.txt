Restaurant: Taka Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Just moved to Atlanta last summer, and have been trying to find the quality sushi restaurants in the area.  Taka is definitely high on the list - thank you Yelpers for the detailed reviews!. . The prices are definitely a little high, but worth it.  I dined solo at the bar with the idea of splurging a bit on myself, and dropped $54 without batting an eye (I expected to pay that much based on the reviews and online menu).. . Before I go into my order, let me stress that the rice consistency is *perfect*.  You can pick out each and every individual grain - no smooshed rice here!. . - Miso: Mild and smooth.. . - Special: Uni wrapped with Flounder: Beautiful minimalistic presentation, and some of the freshest uni I've had.  Teeny tiny pieces (4) though - like smaller than the pad of my pinky.  For $11, I probably wouldn't get this again.. . - Chirashi: Great selection of high quality fish.  Taka had this made for me within 5 minutes of placing my order.. . - Ikura + Quail Egg Nigiri: YUM.  Perfectly sized to [comfortably] eat whole in one bite.. . - Green Tea Ice Cream: Topped with a cookie-biscuit - yum.. . I'll definitely be coming back to try the Okonomiyaki, Udon, and Hamachi Kama.  Eventually I'd like to do the Omakase, but am a little tentative based on the reviews here.
