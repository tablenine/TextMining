This was a yummy date night.  Parking was super easy and seating at the food bar was quick.  I ordered the Knuckle Sandwich- fried tempura battered lobster on a toasty buttered bun.  Delicious! Hubbie ordered the Pulled brisket burger which was juicy and the bbq sauce was really tasty.  Both 'burgers' were great.  Fries are yummy and onion rings are ok.  After dinner we had no room to try the shakes but we will definitely come back to try other items on the menu.
