Look..you don't go to the Varsity for health food.  . . This place has the best hot dogs....anywhere....period.. . The burgers, or "steaks" as they're known, are good too.. . When you get to the counter and hear "What'll ya have?", have your money in your hand and your order in mind.  They're not patient people.  The end product makes it all worth it.
