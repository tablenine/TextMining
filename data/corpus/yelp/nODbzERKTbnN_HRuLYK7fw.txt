Definitely one of the best restaurants in downtown - perfect for a date!. . I've had a few different pizzas and pastas. Never tried anything from the deli counter (although it looks delicious) and their mixed drinks are amazing! I've been here twice for breakfast - I've had the berry waffles with a peach mimosa both times. And a side of breakfast potatoes! So good.. . Only downfall is parking (there is a parking garage a few blocks away - walking distance) can't remember the name though. It can also get really loud inside (the ceiling is super high) so hearing whoever you're with can sometimes be difficult.. . if its super busy I see people construct 'mini table' out of the small round tables in the bar area. Its a bit quieter here and the service is quicker.
