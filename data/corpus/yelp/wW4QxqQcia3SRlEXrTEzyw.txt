I went to check this out after seeing another yelper's review which was not so good, but i believe in making my own opinions and the outcome was...... what was that person thinking.....! I really like the staff, great service, reps Jose and Kaitlin ( sorry if i misspelled names) were really helpful and informative, rare quality found in your everyday shop keep and waiter these days........ The sandwiches were pretty tasty with crisp toasted bread and flavorful innards .... i had the prosciutto and provolone and my hubby had the roasted chicken sandwich and we tend to share so we could both try different items in any place we go and both were very good. Nice setting, busy ambiance and trendy decor. I also couldn't help myself and tried the blue velvet cake.... moist, sweet and had a surprise of real blueberries within.... yummy! I can't wait to come back and try more things...... so many choices......... bottom line ....... i will revisit that's for sure!
