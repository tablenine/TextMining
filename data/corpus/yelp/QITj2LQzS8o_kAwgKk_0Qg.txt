Tonight was my first time. After all the Yelp buzz I headed over for a quick taste. I ordered meal # 2 The 10pc shrimp with two sides. I tried the hush puppies and Corn. The shrimp were GOOD! . . I am from Charleston, SC, where we KNOW seafood. This was good. It wasn't over cooked and chewy and it was spicy enough to make my lips tingle. The corn was good, you can choose to add butter, and hey why not? . . I drove home smelling the shrimp from Buford highway to Roswell Road...it was a long drive! It was so worth it though, as I was there I called friends who were waiting to see what I thought, and they headed over. Â The hush puppies are good, but my only gripe is that they are tiny. Don't be so stingy with the hush puppie love folks! I'm definitely going to make my way back and try more of the menu, but from what I sampled today, yes folks 4 stars.
