What better way to celebrate a 10k race in Chinatown than to head over to Sunday Funday and follow that with some cheesy tots and a Diablo Bleu burger??? This single burger is close to the best burger I ever ate, period. I have had one since at a different location that was not quite the amazingness of this single burger so be warned they don't always do it to perfection Â Everywhere but back to this particular burger. Perfectly medium rare, spicy onion rings with a sirracha sauce and Stilton bleu cheese, te juices fromthe meat wet out the bun and I just wished I had eaten another and added a bodingtons but I was being good, next visit I will chow down two!!!
