Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I flew in from LA a few weeks ago and toast was on my agenda..not because the food is so terrific--which it is ..but because i had to get a jill fix/it had been a few years. I am very confident most everyone there at any given time feels the same...she is terrific and the soul of that place. Simply stated, Toast on Webster is so successful because of Jill .   There are plenty of great breakfast places in Chicago  but Jill only works at this one.
