Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Gastropubs
Wow is all I can say about their Earth burger!  Wow wow wow!  . . I found this little gem while out attending the East West tag sale held by Urban Outfitters and Refinery 29.  One word, disappointing sale and and I had to pay to park.  Boo!  . . After my disappointment I built up a little appetite and found Umami burger which is located inside this mini shopping center.  The restaurant is fairly small, so make sure to avoid the rush as you'll have to wait a while.  I had the earth burger, the sweet potato fries and the tempura battered onion rings.  The fries were great and is a must to compliment your meal.  My dad had the Port &amp; Stilton Burger and he thought it was great because as he said the beef is really fresh tasting, but he was disappointed in size as their burgers aren't huge.. . The burger definitely made up for my disappointing shopping trip.  YummY!. . I will definitely come back again, but maybe try out another location as parking here is a bummer.. . FYI, the onion rings and everything else is a little greasy so don't be surprised by oily fingers.
