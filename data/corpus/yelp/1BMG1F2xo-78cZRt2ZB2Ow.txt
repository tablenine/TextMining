YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM.  Need I say more?. . This place is the busiest place I've evern been to.  And the fact that it's so big and it's super packed - this MUST be a happenin' place.  Make sure you get a number if you're ordering pastries, but a tiny hint to pass that line and get your pastries - go to the cafe area (where you order drinks and where the cakes are at) because you can get your pastries there too and the line isn't as long (although it's still pretty long).  . . Since I don't live in LA, I make sure I go here every time when I'm visiting my friends.  The MUST HAVE is the potato balls :P  I always have to eat at least 2 and then get some to go so I can eat it for breakfast the next day (or have it as a midnight snack, hehe).  The guava pastry is yum yum too.  I haven't really tried anything else of the patries, but I've had their sandwiches.  The Turkey &amp; Cheese croissant sanddwich is the BEST, especially because it's on a croissant.  You should also try the cuban sandwich and the midnight sandwich.  It's not as big as if you were to get it at other delis, but that's why you order the potato balls to fill you up.  Oh, and if you want a drink with your sandwich, get the fresh squeezed OJ - it's not sour at all and I love the pulp!. . I haven't tried the cakes but there are tons of people coming in to pick up cakes.  They do look really good and very nicely decorated.  I guess I should give it a try if it's someone's birthday when I happen to be in LA!
