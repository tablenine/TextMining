Restaurant: Stone Soup Kitchen
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I ventured out  for brunch late Sunday morning.  Feeling a bit under the weather, I was craving some comfort in the form of yummy cheese grits.  My guy had raved about the ones from Stone Soup, so I decided to check it out.  I lucked out on a parking spot (it was pretty busy, likely since Chomp &amp; Stomp was going on) and made my way to the only vacant table inside, book in hand.. . My server appeared almost immediately, and while not saccharine sweet, was definitely personable.  Coffee appeared almost immediately, and I chose the Gringo scramble (eggs, chicken, salsa fresca, avocado) with cheese grits and a biscuit on the side.  I was offered no less than three coffee refills (about every five to seven minutes) before my food arrived, and my water glass was refilled without me having to ask.. . When my food arrived around 20 minutes later, I was pleasantly surprised.  The stone ground cheese grits with butter and cream, were !awesome!, and the biscuit was great...  made with whole wheat flour, it reminded me of my Uncle David's (which is high praise from me).  The scramble was very good, but the eggs and the chicken arrived a little bit cold - pretty much my only negative for the experience, and I still ate every bite.. . I didn't experience the rudeness or lack of promptness of service that some others have mentioned.  Granted, I brought a book... but when I'm eating at a smallish restaurant that's very busy and obviously not fast food, it doesn't bother me to wait a few minutes while it's prepared.. . All in all, Stone Soup is definitely worth a try - I plan to return many times!
