This place is hidden behind The Grove. IT's a little place that has it all. Milk Shake, Sandwiches, dessert, salad, coffee etc. What a best way to enjoy you saturday afternoon with friends to grab a quick bite b4 heading to the shopping mall.. . I really like my chicken salad and also got the sorbet as well.
