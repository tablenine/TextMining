If you're looking for a high quality brunch at reasonable prices, then Sola is the definite place to be.  Not overly crowded, I've never had a difficult time getting a table around noon on weekends.  Don't come here if you don't expect to leave in a food coma and/or with a third-trimester food baby.  The adventurous kalua pork hash and rich short rib benedict are great combinations of flavors and the decadent chocolate chip banana bacon pancakes are incredible.  Definitely take a trip to the northwest sometime soon to try Sola.
