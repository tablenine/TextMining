Well finally decided to man up and get in line.  We got there around 10:30 and didn't get our food until probably 12:20 or so.. . To be honest the food is pretty tasty but its not even worth a one hour wait.  I have no idea what the hype is about.  Taco trucks don't have 1 hour wait lines, 2 is just ridiculous.  Taco trucks should be about getting some decent grub on the go, quickly.  . . I suppose this is a sign that there is plenty of room for other Asian fusion food trucks to pop up as well but until that happens or we start seeing more of these trucks the lines at Kogi will probably remain and I'm not gonna go back, although I do enjoy their food.
