I've been here twice for restaurant week. Once back in '08, when Chicago Restaurant Week was in its infancy, and once again for this year's event. . . I've got to say -- I was a lot more impressed with the food last time. Perhaps I've become more jaded, or maybe because the service was adequate but not spectacular, I've just come to expect more of my dining experiences. . . Pros:. -Easy free parking in the area. -Complimentary coat check. -Delicious starters (both the quail risotto and the salmon). -Solid entrees (we both had steak options). -Amazing desserts, especially the terrine: a ménage à trois of chocolate, peanut butter, and devilish bacon.... . Cons:. -Restaurant week options changed from what was advertised online -- where was the pork belly??. -Restaurant week entrees were not the restaurant's most popular options.. -Our waiter was a little awkward, for example, when I asked if I could decide on dessert later (i.e. after my main course), he abruptly said, "No, you can't." Maybe it's just a matter of style.... -Key lime dessert was overly tart.. . All in all, probably not a place I'd put on my short list again.
