Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
If you eat right, food coma is guaranteed.. . Among a group of 4 we split the following:. 1. The Golden Ticket: My favorite of the meal, but I might be biased since I LOVE bananas in baked goodies. These pancakes are GINORMOUS... 2x the size of my face!! maybe 3x... They were moist and even pretty good as leftovers.. 2. "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast: Chocolatey, Chewy, amazing stuff. 3. Mom's French Toast: Your basic french toast, I didnt think there was anything mind-blowingly good about it, but it was good nonetheless! In general, I think the french toasts had better texture and were more well made than the waffles and the pancakes.. 4. "The Griddle" Waffle: Again, your basic waffle. 5. Tequila Sunrise: Nice contrast to all the sweet stuff. The sausages were flavorful and tasty!. . All in all, a great brunch experience! . I must say though.. the best pancakes I've ever had were from Pastis in NYC...
