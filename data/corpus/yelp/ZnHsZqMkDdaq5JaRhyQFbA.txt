Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
God, the hype.  The second I start eating meat, I have people in my ear "Omigod, you need to try the Office Burger at Father's Office."  Yeah, you know whatever...I could care less about some overpriced burger at a bar.  So I sit on it.  I ignore the hype.  I even have the audacity to go here and just drink and not bother with the burger.. . First visit--I go and have a mango-flavored beer.  And it's fine, I guess, but way too overpoweringly mango...ey.  My friend orders the fries and they are a great complement to the beer to even out the overly sweet with some lightly salty.  It's fine.  Though I could care less to come back.. . Second visit--having just gone through a breakup, my friend Dale says "We're going to Father's Office, first round's on me".  Ehhhh, fine.  Without even really looking at the menu, I go ahead and order an Office Burger and a white beer that I can't remember the name of.  Dale orders a burger, fries to share, and some stout.  For the record--we ordered our burgers medium.  So they come out.  And...well I can't really describe how good the burger was.  It was just undeniably, melt in your mouth, perfect complementary flavors, perfectly toasted bread, ass-kickingness.  Uh, ate it in several large bites.  Dale tried to savor it, but just scarfed it down with me.. . Never in my LIFE have I been okay with spending 12 bucks on a burger.  But I'm ready to go back.  Seriously, let's go.  . . Gotta stick with a four-star rating though, because I have to say that the burger is all that stands out to me.  The fries worked great with the burger or the beer, but I really wouldn't miss them.  The beer is fine--but every place that serves fancy beer is the same.  Decently good beer, a little high on price, and an overwhelming selection where the wrong choice leaves you at least $7 poorer.  . . But the burger...
