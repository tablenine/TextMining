Wow this place is yummmee.   Never have i appreciated the art of ramen before having some Daikokuya.  Granted, i've always loved soup.  I crave Pho at least twice a week, and ramen, to me, has always been second rate to that Viet staple.  But Daikokuya has got me questioning my tastes now.  . The Ramen here is spectacular.  The fried rice just as good.  The only negative was having to stand in line for about a half hour waiting for a table in the tiny place.  Now, i have heard talk (specifically from the group of friends i had dinner with last night), that some low ratings have been posted in the window in the past.  I heard talks of C's.  Ugh...  Normally, anything lower than a B rating screams to me STAY AWAY.  Last night, however,  i was put at ease when I saw the sign reading "B" proudly posted front and center.  Thus, i ate in peace.  And afterward, I experienced what it might be like to be pregnant, my belly was so full.  It was humbling.  But it was all worth it, cause that meal made me sleep so sooo GOOD.
