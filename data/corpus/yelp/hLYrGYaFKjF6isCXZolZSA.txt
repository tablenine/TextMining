Hit up Flip for lunch today with Katie W.. The hotness hasn't worn off as the parking lot was full at 11:45 am.. . We were seated at the bar immediately and the service was pretty quick. . The atmosphere was even more casual than I had imagined.. . Breakfast Burger - bentons bacon + country ham   sausage gravy   maple foam - I don't eat seafood so several of the menu choices are out for me. I'm typically not very adventurous and was going to just get the Flip burger, but I thought what the hell and went with the breakfast burger. I found it to be very tasty. I don't know if it was the sausage gravy or the burger itself, but there was a nice spice that lingered on your palate for a while. This was offset by the sweetness of the maple foam. Very juicy.The consistancy was a bit looser than a typical beef burger, but the patty didn't fall apart. Messy, but really good. . . Fries - really good fries. Nice and crispy on the outside. I didn't find them overly greasy (they are fries though) . . Sweet potato tots - I'm not sure how I feel about these. My first one I found a bit bland, but actually likes them a bit better after they cooled off a bit. Definitely could have used a dash of salt, but none was to be found on the bar. The crispier ones were better. The texture on the inside was not what I expected (neither good nor bad). . Krispy Kreme Shake - very good, very sweet. I think a half sized one would have been sufficient. It is just like drinking a doughnut. . While not a cheap meal, I certainly found my experience enjoyable. The size of the burgers is a bit on the small side (especially for the price) but it was plenty of food for me with the sides and shake (I actually had some leftover). Certainly a nice change of pace.
