Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Chances that you are reading these reviews on PINKs are:  . 1. you're a tourist in LA looking for good food finds and \. 2.  you just recently moved to LA looking to scope out all the must-do's/must-see's here.. . I'm guilty of #2.  Yes, it's an experience you should try but I'd leave it as that.  The hot dogs are fine and I give them credit for the crazy concoctions; however, the 45 minute wait and end result of smelling like greasy for the price of $5 dollars is only worth one try.  My advice:  try it out and take their ideas to create your own concoctions at home.
