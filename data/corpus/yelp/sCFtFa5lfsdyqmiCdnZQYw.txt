Interesting Building and Ambience- Modern but preety cozy and intimate. Side note: Please leave your kids at home. . Im not sure why people bring their small children to a more upscale restaurant for dinner. It can ruin the experience for everyone around, and is preety inconsiderate but it just always surprises me. . . Anyway, . started off with the brussel sprouts, Amazing like the best thing i've ever eaten in my life! Â  if my mom had only made them like this when i was little, I feel like I missed out all this time!. . . Skate wing- also pretty incredible- I highly recommend it. . Wanted desert, but just couldn't manage it. . . Also all of the waitstaff was extremely attentive and just right. . I'll be going back, and I'll make sure I dont eat for a few days. I want to try everything, and I'll keep you posted.
