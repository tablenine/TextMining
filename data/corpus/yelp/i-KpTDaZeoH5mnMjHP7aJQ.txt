After getting a Groupon here, we stopped by for lunch.  First of all, their fries are delicious - we got their garlic Parmesan fries and sweet potato fries to start off with.. . I split a burger of the month (ahi tuna burger with nori, radish, scallions with wasabi aioli) and their Counter burger on a pretzel bun with my sister.  The pretzel bun was probably one of the best parts of the Counter burger and the sun dried tomato vinaigrette sauce.  The tuna burger with the wasabi aioli was definitely an eye opener.  They do have a decent beer/wine selection in addition to the burgers.  My other sister also tried their eggnog milkshake which was pretty good.  Overall, we had a fun filling experience here with friendly service.
