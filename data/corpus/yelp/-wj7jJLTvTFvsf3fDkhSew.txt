Restaurant: New Wave Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
Logan Square desperately needed a place like New Wave Coffee. The neighborhood has attracted independent, creative-minded young folk in a rapid fashion for many years now.. . On my last visit I liked my Elvis Costello sandwich a lot and the hipster help is pretty friendly. I've been here a few times and have never had a problem w/ a drink order. The food is definitely on point for the price.. . New Wave is decorated with lots of great album covers, many of which I used to own. My former tastes are now Hipster Irony. Point taken! Nice mix of couch/comfy chair spaces with chair/table work spaces. And there's nice original art on display and for sale everywhere. One shortcoming here is they like to play the music loud, and even though I love the music that they play, it's way too loud even if you're just there to socialize. It doesn't have to be a library, but seriously, only Spinal Tap's amps should go to 11.. . I've heard lots of Missed Connections happen here and I wouldn't be surprised. All eyes were on me and every other person that stepped through the door (making me feel not so special afterward). So if you're looking for a Hipster Love Connection, you should be able to find it at New Wave in about 2 and 2!
