Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's I guess is an institution of some sort. Every time I drive by, there are lines and lines of people outside. I wonder why.. . The best thing about Tito's tacos is that they are cheap and they have a nice tasty salsa. Other than that they are forgettable. The meat is bland and the tacos honestly don't taste very good unless you drown them in salsa. . . I have tried their burritos too. I at one point thought they were good, but too heavy for my sensitive stomach. The red sauce on the meat was very tasty. . . So to sum it up, I would only go here if there was no line and I don't have money money to go to Johnnie's Pastrami which is located on the same block.
