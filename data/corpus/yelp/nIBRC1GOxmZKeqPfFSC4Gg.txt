Okay, the only thing great about this place is the location. The views are incredible. I was born here and It made me feel like I wasn't in Hollywood. The views from the bar down the hill are especially beautiful.. . BUT! When I come to a restaurant its more about the food , not the view and my food was crappy. I had the Filet Mignon. ... umm, it was a waste of cow....pure waste. Some idiot put some poor cow through hell so he could be cooked with no care...Kudos to the chef : /..The kinda nonsense that makes you want to go Vegan. It was dry and flavorless. Thank goodness it wasn't affecting my pockets ...I would've sent it back. . . Service was okay. I say okay because the waitress was nice but not spectacular and the hosts were rude. The guys at Â the bar were super sweet ...bc of them I give the service a B- even though from first glance it looked like a F. . . The Drinks at the bar were the Best part of the night. . I'd go back to the bar to chill but wouldn't waste my time at Yamashiro.
