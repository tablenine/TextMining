Restaurant: Alon&#39;s
Category: Bakeries
I absolutely LOVE Alon's! It is one of mine and my friend's favorite lunch, treat, munchy spots. Yes, it is a little pricey, but I think it is well worth it. The desserts are so decadent and so delicious. I picked up a midnight cake for my family . . . always delicious and never disappointing. Alon's gets a little crowded and a little hectic, and the parking is a pain on the weekends, so be choosy about what time you go. The customer service is always great, particularly one of the guys behind the dessert counter, too bad I don't know his name. He was wonderfully helpful and friendly.
