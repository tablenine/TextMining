bubble tea.  everyone knows this is the best place in the midwest to go for it.  summertime...i'd highly recommend the strawberry/raspberry freeze with tapioca...DO IT.. . i'm so happy they built this place...the chinatown one is TINY...so there's always a wait...the evanston one is bigger but there's always a wait at that one too!  also, the blenders are farther away from the tables in this one so you don't have to scream over the "vrrrrrVRRRR!!!" action coming from them.  . . food...um, they have every type of asian food there...nothing is spectacular since they don't have that one SPECIAL dish...well, not including their drinks.  . . chairs...don't try to look cool sitting on them...you'll fall off.  they're in this weird diamond shape so you have to seriously sit straight forward and completely upright or it won't work...plus, the backs are really skinny so again, if you sit diagonal or anything, you'll fall off.. . hey...strawberry/raspberry freeze with tapioca...that's all i gotta say.
