Restaurant: Zenkichi
Category: Japanese
This was a great Dine in Brooklyn meal. Having only tried one other DIB that was NOT good, I wasn't sure what to expect. Zenkichi delivered and then some. The meal included 3 courses, plus a miso soup and small salad for only $23. We walked straight past the slightly hidden restaurant at first and then walked into a sleek maze of a restaurant. I liked the private booths, esp since we could not see the table next to us but we could hear rather um interesting snippets. . . The service is very friendly, our waiter was very Japanese (brought back fond memories of a recent trip). They were very attentive so we did not need the service button. . The menu hade a couple options, most of which were favorites from the a la carte menu. I liked that they did not seem to shrink portions. The maguro appetizer was delicious, very fresh, generous cuts of tuna. For an entree we all got the miso cod and shared the kakuni pork belly. The cod was quite good, although the marinade is a little salty. I've tried a lot of miso cod since my early foodie days at Nobu and this one was quite good, though definitely not in the top 3. The kakuni was supposedly cooked for 3 days but I did not find it meltingly tender - tasty but not something I would order again. The nigori sake flavored cheesecake was quite good - the sake elevated the dessert. . Overall a very good dining experience and the prices are reasonable for the quality compared to Manhattan - $48 tasting menu, a la carte small plates are decent portions
