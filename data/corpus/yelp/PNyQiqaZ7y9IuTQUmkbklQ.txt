OH. MY. GOD. . . I have been dying to go to this place for literally, months. . . The idea of korean food and mexican food making culinary love got me so excited, which is curious because I don't really like mexican food that much (not the american brand, anyway). For the longest time, this place was only open on weekdays (NOW OPEN SATURDAY!), and fortunately (or unfortunately, depends on how you see it) I lost my job and was able to finally try this place last week. . . Love at first bite. And second. And third. And... well, you get the idea. The owner is always trying to branch out and try new recipes and ideas... and he is working on getting a taco truck together- truck is already in Atlanta, waiting to get going. . . Here is a list of deliciousness that I have gratefully put in my stomach and I fully recommend:. Beef taco. Chicken taco. Pork taco. Fish taco. Shrimp taco. Tofu taco. Bibim bop. Sesame fries. Korean burger. Flat-iron steak sandwich. Fried sweet potatoes. . Quite a list, but there is a lot more food I am determined to taste. OH SO GOOD.
