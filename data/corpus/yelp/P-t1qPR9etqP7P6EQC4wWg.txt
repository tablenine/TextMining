Oh Sola. You've made me rethink my stance on steak. I used to wonder what the fuss was all about. Why do people go so crazy for a chunk of meat that doesn't taste like anything? Now I finally know why, and I daresay my life will forever be altered.. . Now that my drama queen moment has passed, on to the rest of the review. I bypassed the prix fixe menu because I ate NY Strip steak a couple nights ago. Our host suggested the special, a hangar steak. He said something about it being the most tender cut and less fatty. It was the steak with baby bok choy, chestnuts (the ingredient of the month), carrots, and this mystery puree on the side. The meat was soooo good. Tender but not fatty. Juicy. Perfection. I tried my friend's NY Strip from the prix fixe and there is no comparison. Hers tasted like something from Applebee's compared to my hangar steak. I also tried my other friend's short ribs, which were also delicious. Mine was a 10. Short ribs were an 8. NY strip was a 6.. . I had the hot fudge sundae for dessert which was pretty good. My favorite part was the bruleed banana. . . Good service, nice amuse bouche, lovely and minimalistic interior, awesome steak.
