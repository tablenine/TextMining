Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
We came to Eleven City Diner after seeing that the wait at Yolk was TOO LONG!    I never went to Eleven City Diner before because I heard that their food wasn't so great, buuuut after going, I think it is good!!  I ordered a Turkey Burger (I usually order this  if it is on a menu) and it was good.  Then I had a taste of the espresso mocha cake and it was yummy too.  I guess I don't have anything to compare it too:  Haven't been to many "jewish diners".... Ok....this was my first....but anyways, hey their burgers are good, the fries are good, etc.. . Our waitress was nice, checked in a few times to make sure we were doing ok and left us alone when we were in conversation.  ooh and she asked if we needed refills:  That's KEY!. . Good food, good service, worth going back to!
