Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
The Pad See Ew was amazing! Best I've ever had. I had it with chicken and the chicken was a little dry. I would probably try a different meat next time. My cousin got Panang Noodles with tofu, with rice instead of noodles. It was good but didn't have much in there; just tofu and two pieces of tomato. Â I wouldn't order that next time.t This place is definitely affordable (my dish was $7.50) and my dish was excellent, so I would come here again! The service was good too.
