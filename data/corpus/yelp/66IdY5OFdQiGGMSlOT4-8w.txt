Not that I am a lush, but I would have to be VERY drunk to rate this more than one star. . . We had high expectations. The hype was what pulled us through the door and we sat down and was immediately disappointed as our first plate of food arrived. It wasn't special or great. The chicken was dry, dry, dry, dry and the waffle was rubbery!. . The syrup wasn't bad. Hard to say this place is great, because it wasn't even good. Really disappointed.
