This place is incredible! i like coming here to get my sugary fix and it never fails!. . I've tried the blue velvet cake and its really good! the cake itself is very soft and has just the right amount of blueberry taste.  It can be a little on the sweet side tho.  I've also tried the Coffee tofee crunch shake and it was good!  although it was made with coffee ice cream, the end product was pretty good cause they put chocolate crunch and whip cream on top of the drink.. . I was happy today that the line wasnt long.  Whenever i go the line usually goes all the way out the door.  The customer service is good.  One thing that might suck about this place is the parking.  But its worth  looking for parking just to get a piece of Milk!
