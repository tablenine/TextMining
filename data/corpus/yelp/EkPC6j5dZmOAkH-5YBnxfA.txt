Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
Every time I hit up Penny's, I expect it to be better than the last time.  Yet, every time I remain disappointed.  I feel obligated in some strange way to order a noodle dish.  One would assume that it was their specialty.  Maybe because it's labeled a "noodle shop."  Maybe because the place is freakin' called "Penny's Noodles!"  . . Yet, each time I order "Pad Se Eu" or Pad Thai, I crave the sauce to be just a bit sweeter, the noodles not to completely clump together or for my taste buds to dance at a savory new flavor.  And that's the other thing...they can't keep the amount of sauce consistent.  At times my noodles are drowning and others when I felt the noodles were dry.  I end up leaving a little sad inside each and every time.  . . But fear not!  There are some decent things on the menu.  Personally, I can't get enough of their Japanese Gyoza.  I should just get three orders and grub.  . . Penny's is cheap and easy, but doesn't blow my mind (reminds me of a date I had once).  The service can be hit or miss.  Overall, a bit crazy and inconsistent (yet another date).  Crazy - not in the, "going to send you to an insane asylum" kind, but the sort of crazy that reminds you of that neighbor who's off just a little bit, yet the neighborhood wouldn't be the same without him.  . . Oh yeah, they deliver too.
