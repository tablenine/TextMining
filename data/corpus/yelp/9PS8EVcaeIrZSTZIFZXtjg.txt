Bleh! I've had such high hopes after hearing the rave reviews. And I LOVE fried chicken. Chicken was boring and the waffle had the consistency of a pancake in waffle form. Why not eat a pancake in pancake form. I much prefer Popeye's or even KFC. I've heard the original location in Los Angeles is much better. I'll have to give it a try. Perhaps my hopes can be relifted.
