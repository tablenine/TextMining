My wife and I used to love coming here in 2007, but since that summer we both feel that the quality of the food has gone down.  The rolls used to be packed with fish, and now they seem like they use more rice.  The fish hasn't tasted as fresh the last two or three times we went there.  Maybe management changed or something, but the quality just isn't there anymore.  I prefer Zuma sushi now.
