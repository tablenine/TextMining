It's fine.  You kinda have to understand what you're getting into when you go in.  It's going to be kitschy and too loud and overpriced for what it is.  That being said, it was all those things, but it was good enough.  The food was fine, the service was fine, the decor was fine -- all were fine, not great.   I do like that they offer turkey and veggie burgers, for those of us who don't do beef. (I'm a poultrytarian.)  It might be a fun place to take someone in from out of town, but I can think of plenty of other Andersonville spots with better food and less chaos for a cheaper price.
