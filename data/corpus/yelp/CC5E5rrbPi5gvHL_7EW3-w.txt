Category: French
This is in no way the best crepe restaurant I've ever visited, but it's a reliable standby with very good service, extremely reasonable prices, and is a perfect way to accompany an evening at the Landmark Century Cinema. The savory crepes, as well as the dessert options, are great comfort food. As for the wine list...don't expect much. If you're looking for true French dining then go elsewhere, but it's a fun place for a casual dinner.. . As for the atmosphere, it's definitely stuck in the 1970's, but so what? Old magazine covers and other photos cover the walls, and it's a cozy spot to hang out. This is not a place I'd go out of my way for, but if I'm in the area it's a restaurant I always keep in mind.
