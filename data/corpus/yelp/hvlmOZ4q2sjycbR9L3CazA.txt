I just returned from lunch at Oinkster, and I've got the meat high. These peeps make the good meat....oooo, the good meat.. . The pulled pork sammich is just tops. It's fat and messy and moist and packed tight with red cabbage and carmelized onions and is just one big drippy juicy yumfest. The burgers are quality.. . Here's the thing about the fries - they're double-fried. Once in veggie oil and once in animal fat. They give me diarrhea. But they taste soooo good, especially dipped in garlicy mayonnaise. Whoever calls it "aoli," give me a break. This is mayonnaise! All crispy on the outside and soft and flaccid at the same time. My favorite type of fry.. . I had never tried pastrami before I came to Oinkster, and since then I can say they have the best. It's like roast beef and bacon combined! I can only have about two bites before I feel ill. It's like eating a Krispy Kreme - heaven and bliss for a few bites, but any more and you want to hurl.. . Their salads are fresh, they make their own decently tasty, not-too-heavy dressings, and their sides are great (plantains, mmm, and beans that are more like chili). They have a respectable beer list of local brews and imports, and there are iced teas from Intelligentsia. Also: cupcakes, which look pretty but can get dry sitting out all day. . . Excuse me, I think I need to go take a post-meat nap....zzzzzz.
