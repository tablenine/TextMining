I went back last weekend for brunch, and got the pinapple french toast.  I almost cried. it was such a work of culinary art. Really.  And I almost just cried again remembering it.  All the flavors and the textured blended together just perfectly.  I've had french toast all over the planet from dive diners to the four seasons, this was hands down the best ever.  Seriously.
