I feel like i'm waiting for my car to be serviced when I dine here. Yes this used to be a garage, yes there are authentic mexicans from mexico preparing your food, and yes the food is pretty damn good. . . My experience there was a bit on the negative side, we had a really unhappy waitress. She was Asian, and I didn't know if she hated her job or hated being Asian. She just looked plain miserable, and wasn't even happy to see a fellow yellow with a handsome smile asking her how her day is going. . . My only rationale for her employment there was a natural ability to calculate one hell of a check, sans calculator too might I add. She was short(not height..well maybe), rude, un-attentive, and didn't smile once. . . On a lighter note, definitely try their pork belly tacos, and the taco with grilled peppers and cheese. Oh start with their guacamole- it's perfectly seasoned with a great balance of lime and salt.. . I'd come here to sit outside, people watch, have a drink and enjoy a good taco. I want to insert a pink taco joke in here somewhere but I'll keep this post classy.
