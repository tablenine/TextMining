So good.  Try their French Toast with peaches and cream.  I have yet to find something on their brunch menu that isn't amazing.  Even their basic eggs, sausage gravy and buscuits is good.  I don't know how they do it, but they do.. . It can get a little long to wait for a table, but its a good place so worth the wait (nevermind its not worth it, just go to Dennys so my wait is shorter)
