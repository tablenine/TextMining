Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
vwry disapointed. I'm aware of Mr. Batali's talents in the kitchen but after last night's visit to Osteria Mazzo I began to doubt of his talent to make AUTHENTIC Italian food. All three of us ordered pasta dishes and every single one was over seasoned to the point that we could taste the main ingredients on the dish. I've traveled through Italy for several months, and never have such kind of "Italian Food" if you can call it so. Sorry, this might appeal to the average person, but sorry Mr. Batali, I was not impressed!. By the way, the restaurant itself was very nice, with very good ambience. The wine list very extensive and accessible price ranges...
