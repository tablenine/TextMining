Well, well, well Kogi you and I finally meet.   After a few months of battling myself on whether I would brave the long lines to partake in the phenom I finally gave into my urges and my friends and decided to give it a whirl. . . First and foremost there wasn't really a line.  We ordered almost immediately and waited only a few minutes for our food.  Their menu is pretty basic with tacos, burritos and a special black bean quesadilla that looked delicious.  We decided on the beef short rib and chicken tacos and a spicy pork burrito.  When we received our tacos i started to devour them immediatley noticing the crunchy yet soft delicate quality of the toasted tortillas and the spicy juices of the pork melding with the tangy kim-chi esque slaw.  . . Wait a minute!?  We didn't order pork tacos!  oh no!  Lucky for us they gave us the wrong order therefore we got 4 tacos for the price of 2!  yay!  All delicious.  Spicy pork was definitely my favorite with the short rib a close second. ...the chicken was chicken but still moist and  seasoned well.   The pork burrito was also a nice treat.  It honestly tasted almost exactly like the pork taco except there was a delightful addition of egg. Which gave the burrito a hearty, belly filling quality.  . . Although the Kogi truck is a touch more expensive than your average taco truck it is well worth the price( $2.00/taco) because of its attention to detail and layering of delicious flavors and ideas.  But I'm not convinced it is worth the wait, unless you have an unsatiable craving.  Get there early and enjoy :)
