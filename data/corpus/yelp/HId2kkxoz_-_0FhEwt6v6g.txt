I've been coming here for years, mostly after pre-ordering over the phone.  Make no mistake, the lines here are often long.  There's a separate line for those who pre-order.  It definitely saves you some time.  A tray of their AWESOME potato balls are great to bring to a party.  These bad boys are mashed potato filled with seasoned ground beef, breaded and fried.  You can get them cold and re-heat in the oven if you're picking up a few hours in advance, or request them hot (it costs just a little more) if you're headed straight to your gathering.. . Most recently, I tried a few items from their cafe (no pre-ordering):. . 1) Cheese Omelette on Croissant - it was ok, a little too buttery for me. . 2) Fruit Salad - good seasonal variety in a nice size cup. . 3) Roasted Pork Sandwich (slow roasted pork, mojo garlic sauce and grilled onions on Cuban bread) - good and I need to give it another try because I brought it to a picnic and ate it after it was already cold
