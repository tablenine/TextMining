Walking into Wurstkuche, a small joint located off of Alameda in downtown Los Angeles, one can almost smell and taste the entrepreneurial spirit that surely was responsible for converting an unremarkable warehouse into a wonderful sausage and beer emporium.. . The young-ish owners of the establishment are still bustling about the place, still experimenting with their service protocols and sanding the stools in the cool back-bar space.  The decorum is still a work-in-progress.  The service is still a work-in-progress.   Heck, the back bar is totally a work-in-progress.. . What is not a work-in-progress is the overall concept, the quality of the sausage/brats, and the beer selection.   I spoke briefly with one of the co-owners of the place - he was affable and offered us all beer samples.  What he did not mention verbally but still managed to convey was the fact that he and a few friends decided to take their simple concept of providing high-quality exotic sausage sandwiches and beer and doing something about it.. . And I'm mighty happy they did.  I was a little wary of how long it took to order our food (we had a group of 9), but other than that I really enjoyed the sausage selection (I chose the jalapeno brat) and the toppings you can add, including onions, peppers, sauerkraut, etc.  The beer selection ranges from PBR to a variety of German and Belgian brews on tap.  The belgian fries, while yummy, were not as crispy as I personally prefer but the variety of dipping sauces more than makes up for this "imperfection.". . So if you are ever around the downtown area and in the mood to fill your stomach with both sausage and belief in the American entrepreneurial spirit, I would recommend Wurstkuche.
