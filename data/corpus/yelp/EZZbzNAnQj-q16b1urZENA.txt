Hands down, the best hainan chicken outside of Singapore!  Flavorful, tender and juicy meat (i prefer dark meat, but costs extra) resting on a fluffy pilaf of chicken flavored rice. The place is tiny and packed (especially during lunch), so be prepared to wait.  Their outside "patio" tends to get packed too.   I personally don't mind calling in, then picking up.  But, it's up to you.. . Keep in mind:. Parking is typically whatever you can find on the street.  . Cash Only!. Closed on Sundays!
