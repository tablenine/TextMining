No doubt why this place is an institution around here.  Try anything and you won't be disappointed.  The garlic chicken is the most popular, and  is great any day.  I also like the arroz con pollo.  Been here for lunch, and the Cuban sandwich is really good.  I've also tried the oxtails and steak, both excellent.  Everything's good, and it's not too expensive.  You won't find anything like this around here.
