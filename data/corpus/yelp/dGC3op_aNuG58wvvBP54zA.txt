1000th REVIEW!!!. . Eat It OR Beat It?. **EAT IT!!**. . This place is not hard to miss especially with the amount of people waiting outside! When I got here, it took about 20-30 minutes to get a seat. Upon entering the restaurant, almost immediately you can smell the delicious buttermilk pancakes! And let me just say, an order of pancakes can honestly feed 3-4 people! These pancakes are HUGE! Be cautious of over-ordering!. . "Golden Ticket" Pancake:. ABSOLUTELY the best pancake I've ever tried. You'd think with such an enormous pancake, the quality would be down... but not with Griddle Cafe! The "Golden Ticket" was very fluffy and the fillings were perfect: bananas, caramel, walnuts, and streusel! SO VERY tasty, I can't tell you how great this was. I asked our waitress some of the most popular menu items and she recommended this one!. . CONCLUSION:. This is definitely a MUST-TRY and afterwards, a nice hike to Runyon Canyon Park is perfect to burn off all those well-worth calories! Again, I caution against over-ordering because a couple next to us ordered two pancakes and a breakfast side. Just by facial expression, they were overwhelmed!
