Bad parking (Golden Deli Lot what do you expect), long wait, lotta $$$ but come on we are here to get our grubs on so bring on the Medium size Lobster and I will eat til I puke......so tasty a dish that I have been dreaming bout it since, wish I hadn't washed my hads so well afterward or I would still be able to taste the buttery goodness...Yummy....other stuff here was good by as EVERYONE says, Lobster is the way to go!!!!
