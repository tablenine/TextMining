Came w/ a big group of 16 and they were very accommodating. Made reservations, but on a Friday night at 6pm, the restaurant was not very full. Some of us got there early and sat in the lounge and got $5 appetizers. . . PHILLY CHEESE STEAK EGG ROLLS = most amazing things ever w/ that cheese dipping sauce. SO good. you get 9 pieces for $5 during happy hour (5-6:30pm) so good!!!. . My friend and I split the Rustic Lasagna (~$16). It was very tasty w/ a pink sauce and chicken, mushrooms, spinach and cheese! but it's not what you would imagine lasagna to look like. Instead, it looked like enchiladas. Pasta was cooked al dente. Perfect for sharing.. . The waitress was sooooo nice and entertaining too! Very enjoyable experience especially with a large group.. . Parking at the Beverly center $1/hour for the first 4 hours.
