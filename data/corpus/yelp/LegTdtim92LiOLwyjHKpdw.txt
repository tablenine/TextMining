Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
Oh why oh why can't you just have a full bar damn-it?! I don't want to bring my own wine (LOL I'm bringing the whine right now ;) ) - I want hard liquor, mixed drinks and I'm tired of having to get there half an hour early to go to Terroni down the street to get a little buzzed first. (BTW TIP - Terroni will tell you you can't have a table if you're just going to have a drink - but tell them you come all the time for drinks and they always give you a table - and that if they need the table then you'll move to the bar - then you'll get a table). . . But oh well Cobras &amp; Matadors, alas it's BYOB... . . Good thing your food and atmosphere rock the effin casbah (well atmosphere more than food but both are good). . . MAKE RESERVATIONS HERE. . . I've never come here when every table wasn't taken. AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT A PLACE. I really hate empty restaurants - they just depress me. This place is always bubbling with energy and fun - it's a great alive vibe. . . Order the chorizo thingy and get the shrimp on the bread thingy. Meatball thingy is good too. Hell there's lots that's great here - I've yet to have anything I actually didn't like (just like some things more than others, but that is life no..?). . . Great date place. You'll probably drop $60 - $90 on food for two but it's fun and you feel part of a cool scene - without it feeling like a scene. Great menu too - inventive and exciting. . . It's another unique place with a great vibe and I'll be going back again and again - though probably not more than once every 2 months.
