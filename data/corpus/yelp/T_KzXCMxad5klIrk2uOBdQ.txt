Call me sentimental, but this places reminds me of the reciprocated love of brothers: my brother introduced me to this place a couple years ago and it serves as our sanctuary of brotherhood, where we reflect on childhood and gaze into our uncertain futures...in our hot pots of water.. . Yes, the wait is long - think the time between Portishead's follow-up release to Dummy - but I think it's worth the wait.  Plus, there are typically shops open at night for you to browse during your 45 min to 1 hour wait.. . Nevertheless, the meat, thinly cut but thick in flavor, comfort you for your troubles and wrap your taste buds in their deliciousness.  The limited seating (maybe 20 bar stools total) and unattractive decor make this a no-frills, no nonsense place for you to dine, enjoy the splendor of its meat, and get the hell out cuz the drill sergeant host is waiting to fill your seat.. . Can't wait to go back!
