Everyone in need of saving money should make this a regular stop for casual dinner and drinks.  . . This place may not win any culinary awards, but man!  ... this food is pretty damn good considering the price!  Due to my petite stature, I always enjoyed being a cheap drunk, but this brings me to a new level!  I can get plastered for under 10 bucks!  and have a meal along with it for another 10 bucks... and it is not disappointing, i promise.. . this place is so worth a try... and in these tough times - I give it an A++. I would give it 5 stars, but th food is not THAT amazing (though it is good)
