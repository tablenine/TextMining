Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I expected a little more because downtown Culver City offers many very good restaurants. To the left you have Tendergreens and on the right is Fraiche. Both have excellent food. Ugo, not so much.. . The prices were very promising since it was less expensive that I would have imagined from such a nice space. We sat outside where people watching added to the experience. Then came the food. The potatoes were pretty, but they were soggy and needed more seasoning. My frittata was fine, but the panini wasn't a panini at all. The bread was a French roll that was way too thick and not very interesting. . . Servers were nice, but were a bit forgetful on my visit. I'll try their wine bar - maybe - but I don't know if the restaurant will get another visit.
