This place reminds me of Damion &amp; Pythias in Westwood except that it's:. 1 - actually good for you . 2 - cheaper . 3 - with better service . 4 - more popular! . 5 - next to melt gelato vs. diddy riese which is much better! . . Add 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp; 5 and you have a summation of MANY reasons as to why you should avoid heading out to CPK, Chipotle, Tender Greens, etc. and eat at Veggie Grill! . . What I loved.... * protein style - kale, kale, kale. * agave syrup - delicioussss. * All Hail Kale Salad - with quinoa!!!
