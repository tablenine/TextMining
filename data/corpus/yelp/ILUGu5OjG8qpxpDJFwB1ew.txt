5 stars for their creamed corn.. . their shrimp cocktail isn't bad either.. i like their meatballs in the wait area.. . their famous spinning salad is one of the two salads i'll ever eat. the eggs and beets are the best part. and their dressing is good too.. (the second one being the chinese chicken salad at CCC.). . the california cut is a decent size when ordered with mashed potatoes and creamed corn.. . and a slice of their warm chocolate fantasy cake which comes a la mode.
