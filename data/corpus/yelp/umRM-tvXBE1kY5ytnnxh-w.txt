I went to dinner last night at Feast.  I've been wanting to try this place out for a while.. . So first things first!  Half price bottles of wine on Monday and Tuesday nights!  Fantastic bottle of  Weingut Fritz-Josef Schwibinger Riesling Niersteiner Kranzberg Blanc 2006, had to google that.  Very tasty, crisp and sweet, a wonderful riesling.. . I had a Apple and Walnut salad, that would knock the lights out of the pathetic excuse of an apple walnut salad at mcdonalds.  Candied walnuts, triangle pieces of smoked gouda, crunchy and tart green apple, in a honey-thyme vinagerette.  . . My friend Jamie had the beef burger with cheddar and bacon, great burger and sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries are divine, and a crispy and light treat.  Such a breath of fresh air from the run of the mill french fries.. . To top the wine, cheese, greens, and meat, we had to order desert, we got the lava cake, divine!  It was also served beautifully with a design of sun beams around our piece of lava cake.  . . All in all great meal.  We each paid $24.09 plus a tip of $5 each, so $30 each, for a great meal.  Totally worth it and I will go back, for brunch next time lets hope!
