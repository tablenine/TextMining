Some of my favorite reviewers gave this place lower scores, and I just don't know why. I have nice experiences with this place every time I go!. . The location is great.  The parking is adequate.  They will have valet on the weekends, and during the week, you're on your own. Most of the time, I can find a space on the bridge, and then it's a short, free walk.. . I was a bit sticker-shocked when I first came here, but found out quickly that they serve generous portions.  Like, on the menu, they say that the sashimi is only two pieces per order?  It's usually four big pieces, and sometimes, mostly if I get takeout, it is five!. . I like ginger side salads, and they are good here.  Just tried the seaweed salad last night, and that was quite good!  Edamame is so-so -- it's very salty!. . I'm surprised that this place is never super busy -- I think it's one of the better places in town to get quasi-reasonably priced sushi.  MF Sushi is so good, but unless you are there for lunch, it's so expensive.  I think Zuma is a great alternative for something not super-duper expensive, but definitely not the low end of RuSans.
