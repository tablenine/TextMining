Restaurant: Osteria del Figo
Category: Italian
I always get takeout from Figo, but recently dined there and was pleasantly surprised.  Besides ordering and paying before you sit down, there is nothing "fast-foody" about this place.  The inside is really homey and comfortable - the old school Italian style works well in the trendy space. . . My friend and I would have sat there all night chatting away over eggplant and walnut stuffed ravioli with my favorite Siciliana sauce.  I will definitely be back to enjoy the atmosphere, not just for the delicious takeout.
