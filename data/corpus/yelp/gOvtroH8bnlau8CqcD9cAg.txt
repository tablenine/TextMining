Nothing really terrible to say here - I just was not impressed.. . I arrived slightly before my friend, so I grabbed a seat at the bar to grab a drink and conquer the menu.  After a quick glance at the beer list, I knew something was awry.  Although having 3 Indian beers may get credit for authenticity, it does not help when they suck ($6 for Kingfisher? What is that about?).  Having 3 mediocre English beers does not help in any way.  Good Indian food deserves a good IPA, and there are none on the menu.. . The Bengali Tiger, which is (spicy) green cardamom, black cardamom &amp; vanilla bean infused vodka, tamarind-date puree, pineapple, &amp; spicy ghost peppers was quite good; actually, it was the best part of the meal.  . . Maybe I should not have ordered traditional Indian dishes to avoid a potential bias toward my favorite Indian places.  But we did.  Both the lamb rogan josh and the chicken tikka masala were a little soupy and less flavorful than I would have expected.  The tamatar baigan bharta was good, but not great.  We also tried the goat cheese, red onion, and sweet pepper naan, which just tasted like a failed pizza attempt. . . Our waitress was nice, but she seemed more than a little out of it.  The hostess had to come over and help out on a number of occasions, simply because the waitress was spacy.  Weird.. . The atmosphere was nice and relaxed, but I just can't get over the feeling that every restaurant on this block has the same feel.. . I could probably be convinced to go back, but I would have to order differently.  Definitely more focus on the bar.
