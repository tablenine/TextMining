Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
A friend and I were walking down 3rd today after finding that our original restaurant was closed for a private party. I was heading on down to Toast, but as we were walking we happened to spy the cupcakes in the window. Knowing our sweet teeth, that was all the enticement we needed.. . We both ordered vegetarian meals. She a garden vegetable sandwich, and I, a grilled veggie sandwich with goat cheese. Everything was fresh and flavorful. It was served with a wonderful little pickle side, which is apparently a staple of the place.. . After lunch was through, we headed straight for what we really wanted: the cupcakes. As I was standing in line for the bathroom (side note: my only complaint is that the line for the restroom can back up considerably), I noticed that Angelino had rated them for their cupcakes, as had the DailyCandy and many other magazines. I was excited. I ordered the cloud cupcake, and my friend, the peanut butter. For those of you who don't know what a cloud cupcake is, it's a chocolate cupcake with a massive marshmallow topping covered in a thin layer of chocolate. We split the cupcakes and we were both in sheer nirvana. Hands down, the best cupcakes I've had to date. . . Friendly staff, a wonderful little atmosphere, and killer cupcakes. What more could you possibly want from a fun little lunch place?
