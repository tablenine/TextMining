This place is okay. I am not sure why people are so in love with this place other than it is cheap. You get what you pay for though.. .  The chicken is pretty good, not the absolute best as people are saying. The menu is simple, like in-n-out which is nice. The ambiance is very loud, and cramped, which I guess if you are getting a relatively cheap meal at a sit down place is bareable. . . The french fries are terrible, that is really what put me in a bad mood about this place. They were kinda soggy, not cooked all the way. The chicken didn't make up for it, what can I say.  . . Chicken and frites, the chips better be good. The salad was mediocre, avocado was a nice touch, but didn't save it. The plantains were, okay.  Maybe we went on a bad night for the french fry cooker, but I am not sure if I would go here regularly because of it being so loud. I guess it isn't the restaurant's fault, but put some sound dampening somwhere, maybe nothing can quiet the loud yups that have to out-scream each other. . . Sangria was good, and the service was pretty good, hence the 3 *s. Oh and they only take amex which is kinda weird, most restaurants are the opposite since amex really screws the merchant with fees.
