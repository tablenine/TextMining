Restaurant: Francesca&#39;s Forno
Category: Italian
There are very few restaurants in Chicago that could fit a party of 6 in last minute on a Saturday night. After being denied by many restaurants I tried Francesca's Forno at 5:30 pm on a Saturday with the hopes of getting 8:30 pm reservations for 6 people.  The guy hesitated at first, but then said he'd be happy to fit us in. I was thrilled, but unfortunately we weren't able to sit right down when we got there and it ended up being a 40 minute wait. Besides the wait and slow service I thought the food was great. We decided to split many dishes including the caprese salad (the best I've had in a long time), rigatoni (pretty good, but not sure if I'd get it again), salmon (very tasty), and ordered every side on the menu (the potatoes and the spinach were my favorites). We were full and happy after the meal...and especially happy that all that food and a few glasses of wine came to $28/person! Overall, Francesca's Forno was a great find and I'll be dining there again in the future. I just won't plan on going here when I have somewhere to be later in the night since the service was a bit slow.. . Edit 1/28/07: My friends and I headed to Feast for brunch and didn't want to wait for 45 min.  The nice hostess at Feast suggested the brunch at Francesca's Forno so we headed on over.  I didn't have high expectations since it was pretty much empty, but the brunch is as good as their dinner.  W ordered an eggs benedict like dish over garlic toast, chocolate chip pancakes with berries, and a fritatta.  Everything was delicious, especially the fried polenta and parmesan fry side orders.. e
