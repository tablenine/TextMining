I. Love. This. Place. . . This is the perfect place for a big or small group get together if you're in the downtown area. Biggest drawback - it being in downtown (I live in Culver City). Largest plus's - amazing European beers on tap (cheap $6 Belgian white ales that tingle your tongue and marry with their exotic selection of sausages and fries). . . You feel like you're stumbling into a secret exclusive clubhouse full of LA yuppie foodies that purely live to celebrate the joy of pairing weird to classic gourmet sausages with delectable beers. . . The decor is dim, dark, communal, and unique. Price's aren't too bad, and not knowing too much about Belgian ales, I picked the cheapest one on the menu at $6 and it felt as if fireworks had hit my tongue when it met my taste buds. . . With a menu like Mango Jalapeno sausages, Austin Blues - hot and spicy, tri-pepper &amp; hardwood smoked pork, and Rabbit, Veal &amp; Pork Seasoned with White Wine, this place makes you feel like you've discovered the next new frontier. . . This must have been what Christopher Columbus felt like when he hit the West Indies. So set sail.. . Also, this is technically a 4.5.
