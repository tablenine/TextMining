Restaurant: Shopsin&#39;s
Category: Diners
It has always struck me as strange that while we normally snub any restaurant whose service is anything other than cordial, attentive and organized, there are certain institutions New Yorkers flock to BECAUSE we will be treated like shit.  . . Really, who doesn't love the Soup Nazi?  Admit it--you secretly intentionally botched your soup order, didn't have your money out, didn't step to the immediate left, just to hear him scream at you.  And everybody gets a kick out of the brusk waiters at Peter Luger's, who'll bite your head off for ordering fish, getting your steak anything less than medium rare, or needing more than 30 seconds with the menu.   . . At Shopsin's, you may be called an asshole, told that they're closed when they're not, and/or berated for ordering the same thing as your dining companion (or even as the people at the table next to you).  You may see people get kicked out for being creepy.  You will most certainly wait longer than you'd like to, be told to get your own coffee, and hear the word "fuck" thrown around more liberally than in a Tarantino flick.   You will eat mac &amp; cheese pancakes, pulled pork, oxtail, tostones, eggs (214 different ways), chili cheese fries, 63 kinds of soup, etc etc etc etc ad infinitum...or perhaps "ad nauseum" is more appropriate?. . You will pay a little more than you'd like to for everything, but come on--abuse (and food) this good ain't free!
