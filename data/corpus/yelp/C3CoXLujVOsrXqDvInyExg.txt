Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
mmm.... mmm.... mmmmmm.  that's the only noise that comes outta your mouth when you're chowin down at tender greens.  it's seriously good!  don't let the leafy greens, wholesome grains, and fresh foods scare ya!. . this is my go to lunch place when i'm in the office. never has failed me and always satisfying. beat the lunch rush by ordering ahead. it can get extremely crowded there. not only to place your order, but also to dine there. overall a wonderful and delicious place!
