Restaurant: Tasty China
Category: Chinese
I wasn't sure if I would ever find a truly quality chinese restraurant in Atlanta, especially not close to me in Marietta.  Tasty China has all the necessary ingredients for me, delicous food, spicy food, consistant quality, and good service.  Some of the dishes I have had are really similar to ones that I have had when I studied abroad in China.. . I have heard that it can get crowded, but there is usually only a few tables occupied when I eat there.  That is until last time.  I went on a Friday evening at about 6:30 pm and we were only on of about 4 tables that were full.  By 7:30 or 8 almost every table was full including a 15 person party sitting right next to us.. . Now for the food.  I have loved every dish that I tried.  I usually start with an order of Dan Dan Noodles and then get a different spicy beef or pork dish.  I haven't been adventurous enough to try some of there exotic dishes yet, but I might have to later.. . This is a great place to try more authentic chinese food and have a great time doing it.
