I'm not familiar with downtown dining, so I found Bottega Louie on Yelp and was swayed by the affordable yet hip vibe reviewers were giving it... and they were absolutely right. . . I met some old classmates there on a Monday night and there was no problem getting a table (they don't take reservations).  The food was good and very affordable.  Portabella fries (my favorite app) and calamari were excellent for sharing.  Stuffed artichoke not good for sharing.  Lasagna was really good, but basically two portions worth.  It'll put you in a food coma in no time.  Service was friendly and attentive.. . Here's the downside.  Like others have said, this place has high ceilings and feels very open - looks great for ambiance.  But, it lends itself to echos and a really really LOUD environment.  You'll have trouble hearing other people unless they are sitting next to you, and you just might lose your voice shouting over other patrons.  So, while it's good for groups, it's also too loud to have group conversations... and mind you, this was on a Monday night.. . So, if you're looking for a hip, casual vibe, good food that doesn't break the bank, this is a great place.  It's probably not, however, a good place for an intimate dinner.
