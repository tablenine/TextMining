My friends and I went on Monday, which is half-off night, and that's definitely the best and ONLY night to go to this place. The surroundings are sick, I never fail to appreciate great decorum (no matter how cliche and LA it can be). The service was a little slow, but that's expected at a place like this. We split about 7 rolls between 3 people, and each one certainly did taste really good. We were paying about average on half-off night, and I can honestly say I've had better at other, similar places. We had green tea cheesecake for dessert, kinda sad that they don't offer Mochi. Still walked out spending about $35.
