The first time I went was just to get a drink.  It was so packed I couldn't get to the bar so I left.  The second time I went was to actually try the food since it was so busy the first time.  We got there around 930 and had to sit outside.  It took about 15 minutes for a waiter to recognize that we were there and offer us drinks.  We were all ready to order at that point and both wanted the burger.  We were told that there was only one burger available so I let my girlfriend have that and I switched over to fish and chips (which I believe were $22).  The food came out pretty fast.  The presentation is terrible.  Everything comes in a bucket type thing.  My fish and chips were really greasy had a terrible flavor and were really small.  The burger was good but not worth the really high price.  Actually paying took a really long time too.  . Overall just a terrible experience.
