Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
Do you like mozzarella?  The kind that is so mind blowing that you actually have to ask yourself if you're tasting a little bit of heaven?  Well, if you do, than it is a must that you go here.  The restaurant has a Mozzarella Bar in it for crying out loud, I mean does it get any better than that?. . The entree food is delicious, can be a little salty here and there, so I more recommend this place for light afternoon/early evening appetizers.  They have a great Italian wine list, not as comprehensive as the one at Del Posto in NYC, but the in-house sommelier will be able to guide you toward the right direction for sure.  They have all kinds of mozzarella with extremely eclectic topping combinations; I had one that was garnished with garlic, lemon and hazelnut....SO surprisingly good.. . A little pricey, but definitely worth the adventure in mozzarella-land.. . There's always some celebrity in there too, if you're into that; last time I sat next to Lionel Richie.. . Oh, and prepare yourself to wait a month for a reservation, unless you're willing to go eat there at 5:30 or 10pm.
