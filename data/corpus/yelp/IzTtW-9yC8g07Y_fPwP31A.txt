This is a great place to have breakfast.  The menu is varied with tons of healthy options.  I have never had a bad meal here.  My girlfriend had the shrimp and grits.  The dish was creamy with plenty of shrimp and very tasty.  I had some sort of omelet with goat cheese, mushrooms and basil and it was very good as was the toast (I'm not a fan of biscuits) with apple butter.  If there's a long wait, as there usually is on weekends, you can get some coffee and check out the queer bookstore across the street .
