A good, but not great, burger can be had here.  If it were just a little bit bigger, it would cross into great territory.. . The service here is fantastic.  Very solicitous.  Ditch the bathroom attendant, though; that's far too cheesy for a nice place like this.. . By the way, the decor here is very dated, somewhat spartan and not all that nice, in my opinion.  This is not a place to take a date or to impress a client (unless you know that your date or the client in question happens to like Gibsons).
