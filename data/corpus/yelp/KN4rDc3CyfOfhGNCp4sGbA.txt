Restaurant: Over Easy Café
Category: American (Traditional)
with sadness i have to rate this place down.  i live in the neighborhood.  my girlfriend and i love the food (though i do agree it may be a bit over-priced) and the staff.  but the owner is an a$$hole, and apparently a notorious one.  last weekend we sat at the table closest to the kitchen and spent the meal trying to converse while he berated a cook because someone didn't want scallions on their salad.  he was screaming obscenities into the kitchen from the common area by the bathrooms.  nothing we haven't heard before, but it was pretty awkward and tainted the meal a bit.  on the way out i suggested to him that that table should perhaps be moved because "when you have your outbursts it is a bit uncomfortable."  he proceeded to tell at me across the restaurant as i walked out .  . . my girlfriend an i were pretty incredulous about the whole episode.  a few blocks down damen we were talking about it and i said "he was such a jerk!" and another store owner heard me and said "you guys talking about that guy from over easy?"  reputation proceeds him.. . so, if you go, don't sit in the back.  don't complain.  you will probably like the food.  just avoid the douche owner.
