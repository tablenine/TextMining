Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Vietnamese
Did I tell you about the time I went into the Joy Yee's bathroom and discovered that the door knob was covered in feces? . . Did you know that their menu is a thing of beauty, and is more amazing because it makes the really bland food look almost divine?. . There is so much food here, but it's unfortunate because it never really does any of it well, except possibly the smoothies. I've been here many times because other "friends" (I'm not sure if they're my friends because they like this place) keep bringing me here, which is fine, but I think the seizure-inducing yellow wall color is giving me headaches. Every dish tastes like the cook knows how to prepare a dish, but is two days from leaving and doesn't care anymore. Their food is not prepared with care or attention, and it shows. . . The meat is overcooked, the sauces are bland, and even the rice is poorly cooked (and it's made from a rice cooker!). The smoothies on the other hand are pretty tasty and fresh, albeit very very sweet. But there are better places to eat. Eat at a real Chinatown restaurant then come here (or Saint's Alp) for a non-alky drink.
