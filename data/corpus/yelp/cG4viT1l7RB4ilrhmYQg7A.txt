I just realized when I wrote my review for Cut that I had neglected to write one for Mastro's.  I'd say comparing apples to apples...the rib eye at Mastro's is comparable to Cut.  However, Cut is a little bit better because they offer the Wagyu.  . . However, the lobster mashed potatoes...awesome!  And service is also very good.  It's a bit pricey but definitely a good choice for a special occasion.
