Simply the bomb. Really good sandwiches. Gotta give hommage to the originators of the French Dip. Make sure you get yours double dipped in the Au Jus and not just single dipped, or even worse, not dipped. . Wouldn't recommend the mustard crap tho. Sorry. I know it has a history behind the the mustard, still taste like shit. . Go with the beef followed by the lamb. Turkey, not so much. Place is always packed. I go here before my Dodger games and grab them to go. Then its off to the parking lot with some Hefenweizens, you know how we do.
