Oh geezzz.....  They will cut me half and never find the bottom part.  Ouch!  The greatest classical building that I have seen in LA.  There is a lot of history behind this place;  If you're a tourist looking for something to do...this is the place to bring the kids.  Can you say cliche?  Every trick you have seen on tv is here.  The food?  I'm with Mona.  It should disappear.
