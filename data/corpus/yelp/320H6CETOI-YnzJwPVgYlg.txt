I love Porto's!!! Who cares about the line, I don't. Even when it was raining and I had the worst cramps ever, I stayed. Why, because that horchata smoothie is a friggen' goldmine. . . The cheese rolls are amazing! I went with my mom and we left with 3 full bags of food. The prices are unbeatable for the quality of food they provide. And the plantain chips are better than all of the chips in the world combined. Might I add that the mochas are also fantastic.. . I just made myself hungry talking about Porto's...
