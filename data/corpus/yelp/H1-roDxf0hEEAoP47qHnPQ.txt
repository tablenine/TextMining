Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
Dunlay's on the Square is a casually nice restaurant right on Logan's Square. The walls of this restaurant feature local Chicago-themed art, and the food is pretty good. Not fancy, but not too casual either.. . Steak is pretty decent and they have a good collection of wines and other bar options. The meal is good, and the service is decent.. . I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you're in the neighborhood, you should stop by.
