Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Not that there is much to add to almost 200 reviews, but i just couldn't resist.  I absolutely love Father's Office.  I simply just liked it in Santa Monica, but now I love the new bigger, lighter space in Culver City.  . . The small food menu does not disappoint.  Yes, the burger is fantastic, but i think my favorite item is the sobrasada appetizer.  And of course, you must get the fries... regular or sweet potato, i'm not sure which one wins out, so get both!. . If you're ready for something super interesting and delicious, try the Alagash Curio, it's a beer made in whiskey barrels.
