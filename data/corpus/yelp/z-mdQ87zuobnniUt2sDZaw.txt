After salivating for several months, FINALLY the day came... and it was worth it. The pizza crust was amazing in texture- crispy, light, bubbly at the edges. The fennel sausage topping with spring onion - awesome. I love fennel - I'll eat it raw, cooked, any form whatsoever and it was perfect in the sausage. Michael S. ordered the prosciutto pizza - which was... Meh. Poor Michael S. - doesn't he know just to let me make all the decisions?  sigh.. . Service was very good despite how busy the restaurant was. And some good wine recommendations - when I could actually hear the server speak. Most of the time I had to smile vacantly and nod,  pretending to understand what my dining companions were saying cuz it was so freaking loud. They were probably shocked at how uncharacteristically agreeable I was. (minus 1 star. I hate being overly agreeable). . I'm already salivating over their squash and burratta, funghi, and anchovy pizzas to try next time ...  Michael S. and I are working on communicating with sign language for our next visit.
