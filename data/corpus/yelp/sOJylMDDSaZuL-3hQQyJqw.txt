This is burger heaven!!!  Everyone raves about this place, so naturally I thought it would be overrated.  But it is, hands down, the best burger I have ever had.  I went there for my birthday, and I still have cravings for it all the time.  The meat practically melts as you bite into it.  And if you're going to spend that much on a burger and intake that many calories, you might as well get the full works, with the sweet potato fries, and a nice, heavy beer.  The combination is indescribable!. . I would go back regularly if it weren't for the high price.  But you get what you pay for!  . . It's a nice place to relax and hang out with friends, although it might be difficult to find a table.  It was packed, and we basically had to peel our eyes for someone to leave, and then grab their seats.  The doorman is a little unnecessary, and it sucks that there's an age restriction for great food.  But once you're 21, this is the place to get one of LA's best burgers!!!
