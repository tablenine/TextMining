Yummy, yummy, yummy I got churros in my tummy! Delicious churros here. I didn't get to try the food, but I did go to the wine/beer shop next door and picked out a great bottle of Spanish wine to enjoy with my churros. Ambience was great, service was decent and the price was reasonable. Will definitely go back to try the entrees and to eat the churros again. Yummo~!
