Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Why do so many people like this place? The prime rib isn't even THAT great. I've had better at Houston's, and Houston's isn't even a great establishment either.. . I think the only good thing about this place, is how much $ they can steal from your pocket. They've effectively managed, to create a buzz about nothing. They then conceived the idea, to package this nothing, with plenty of pretty wrapping. Then, you get Lawry's. . . Oh, the Yorkshire Pudding is pretty good, That's about it.. . Yuck
