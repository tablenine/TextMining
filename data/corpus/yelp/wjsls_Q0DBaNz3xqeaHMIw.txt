this place is delicious. i cant believe how inexpensive it is and for the quality of the food. get everything! its all delicious!. . my favorite part of the place is that there is no sign and you can literally drive by it with out ever noticing it. which i did several times when i first was trying to find it.. . very very very good pho. pho sho.
