Ok it was hell trying to find the place but once I got there the valet guy was great and super informative about where I was going and once I got up to the door I was taking off gruad it was a really old looking door I guess it added character to the place. . . I looked over the menu before hand and i already had my mind set on the lump crab cakes...so that's what I choose as a appetizer.. i wasnt that impressed they were a lil too fishy not enough favor to much of an over power the fish taste... so I'm glad I didn't get that as a my main dish.... . . I ate at the bar, so I could see they had a nice wine selection, The bartender was great (Cathy love you ) I think she made my night a lil better... She created this great Spicy Mango Maritigia which was to die for. I think they should add it as a reg item on the menu.. . I ended up with the special for the day which was a ny strip with garlic potatoes and sautee spinach.. I think I licked my plate when it was all said and done with.....
