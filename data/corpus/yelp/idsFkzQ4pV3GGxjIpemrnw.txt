kogi bbq is really good but i dont think its worth more than an hour wait.  The line can get as long as a couple hour wait which i dont know why people would wait that long. Luckily i waited less than half an hour and it was worth it.  Kogi bbq is a must try. . . As for the food, i tried the short rib burrito and it was delicious!  i usually get the burrito over the taco because it comes with a lot more meat and flavor! i tried the kimchi quesadilla once and it liked it even though im not a fan of spicy food.. . The kogi staff is so nice especially the roja and verde trucks.
