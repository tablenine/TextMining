Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
i had the #5 miso ramen, which was a tad too bland and mild, even after a liberal dousing of chili oil (drop by drop it took me several minutes to get half a spoonful). my friend ordered the #4 though and that has a nice kick. the soup was good, but lacks the mouth-feel of the soup at santouka and daikokuya. it comes with thinner, leaner cuts of pork, which held up nicely with the noodles, although there was probably a tad too much bean sprouts. portion was large and they served sake. everyone around us were talking about "man vs. food" and one guy was trying the #2 challenge, but i don't think he made it. . . the parking situation at weller court was a pain though - their parking ticket dispenser was broken and the gate was up, and since no one stopped me i drove right in. as i was heading upstairs i even asked the parking attendant if i had to pay in advance and he said no, just pay when i get out. so when i got to the restaurant and saw that my friend had parked in the same structure and got a blue ticket and i didn't, i went to speak with the parking attendant who had me head back upstairs to grab four 15-minute stickers from orochon. i went upstairs, and they wouldn't want to give me the stickers because i didn't have a time-stamp without a ticket. thankfully the lady went downstairs with me and had at it with the parking attendant, who got the lady to slap four stickers on a used ticket and i was able to finally leave. but gawd what a nightmare. . . so yeah kids: park in another lot. and order the #4. or just go to daikokuya and save yourself the trouble.
