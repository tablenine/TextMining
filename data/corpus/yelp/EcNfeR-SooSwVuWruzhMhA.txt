Ok, so while I haven't been in Chicago for too long, I can firmly say that thus far, Opera is my hands down favorite Chi-town eatery.  The main menu is lengthy and bursting with different flavors but the highlight for me was the separate vegan menu that they laid atop the extensive wine list.  We started with the vegetable spring roles.  They were greasy but they were delicious.  I had the ma po tofu which was silky steamed tofu in spicy black bean sauce with garlic.  It was amazing.  My friend ordered Hainan Kaipong Rice.  It was so good.  I don't think I could recommend one over the other.  Just get both.  Seriously, you will not regret it.  The vegan menu was less expensive- the bill came out to a bit over 30 for the 2 of us.  Not bad for a trendy 'lil restaurant.  . . Just a side note- walking to the restroom at Opera is like stepping into a fun house at the state fair.  Just go there- you'll see what I mean. . . GO ALREADY!
