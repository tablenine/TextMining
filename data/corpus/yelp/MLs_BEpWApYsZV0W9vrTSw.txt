Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Fan-Flippin-Tastic!. . I'd been here once before a few years ago with a good friend. We randomly wandered upon Jerry's and being in a total state of starvation, decided a sandwich would be "good enough". We sat outside on that warm summer night and I can't speak for her, but I fell in love- no not with her! With JERRY'S!. . I'm happy to report that I now live in the neighborhood and I come here OFTEN! I'm determined to try everything on the menu! It's just that good. I don't pretend to know how many sandwiches they have on the menu, or even how many different sandwich combos a person could come up with here- but I'd say 200+. . . I've become addicted to the buffalo chicken sandwich which is a problem because if I'm already repeating things on the menu, I'm that much farther from sampling EVERYTHING. Oh and did I mention the selection of sides to go with your sandwich? From baked beans to mashed potatoes to a fruit cup to mac n cheese to spiced apples... lots of yummy options. . . I've not yet come by at night for the live music but I do plan to- and soon! I LOVE this place. It's not just boring old sandwiches- they are very creative. And the menu is uber user friendly- they section it off by meat choice (or vegetarian). . . My ONLY insult is that you get a can of soda, not a glass of soda. Yes, they do bring you a glass with ice in it. But I like the taste of soda when the syrup is added in the restaurant versus just slapping a can down in front of me. Picky yes, but that's the only bad thing I could say. . . Well, and that I wish you got a pickle with every sandwich- to me that's the beauty of American sandwiches! Always a pickle on the side. Â But if that's the worst I can say about the place- then really- there's nothing to complain about!
