After all the hype, I expected Jesus Christ himself to cut my roll.. . Everything was good, and I know Janna V will grill me for this like a piece of Unagi, but I prefer Ra or even Wakamono.. . Bonus points for half price bottles on Wednesday.  . . Those who know me are well aware of my snobish attitudes about wine and asian food...  the sparkling wine we ordered was wonderful, especially at @ 4 bucks per glass!. . I would go back, but only on half price bottle nights.. . Please take my review with a grain of salt, or wasabe.  As a vegetarian, I can only comment on the quality of the basics, as fish has not crossed my palate in 17 years...
