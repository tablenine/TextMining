The chicken pesto pizza was amazing! A very chill place in the Highlands to grab pizza and a beer, the outdoor patio looked nice, but we stayed inside. Â Great atmosphere for groups or a couple people.. . Only downside, their cheapest pitchers are PBR, then everything else is at least 5-6 bucks more, but our waiter was very nice and gave us Miller Light for the PBR price, so they definitely aim to please!
