This is one of our breakfast favorites. Outside seating for the dog and near griffith park for hiking :). . Our favorites:. Bearded Mr. Frenchy (crushed cornflakes on french toast, mmmm!). Eggs in the hole (perfectly done every time). Hashbrowns! They are well seasoned here, not a pile of mush like they are everywhere else, you won't need the salt and pepper. . Love the atmosphere, fun mix of people and staff with really short skirts! Solid service and the coffee keeps on coming. . . Very doggie friendly, always bring him a bowl of water (or ice) and say hello!
