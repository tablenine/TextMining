My girlfriend raved about this place so I had big expectations coming in.  I really enjoy a good burrito, which is why I love Tarascas on Clark.  The first thing I noticed is that there were NO burritos.  Not a single burrito on a Mexican menu.  I was a bit disappointed.  I ended up getting a combination platter which was tasty.  I thought the beef was much better than the chicken.  We had queso with the chips, which was good.  . . I enjoyed the food, but for the price I think you can do better elsewhere.  The ambiance was also very loud, it was not at all intimate.
