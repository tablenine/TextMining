I never knew this was Vietnamese cuisine, but whatever it's labeled, it's damn good.. . Been here a couple times, mostly on the job's dime, so that was carte blanche to go plum nuts! . . The underground aquarium is pretty tight. One night I even saw Sidney Poitier and rapped to him for a quick moment.. . I usually get the Cracked Crab and that was scrumptious...but their thang is the garlic noodles - DA BOMB!. . Pricey, of course. So, fellas, if you're taking a date, make sure she's worth it! LOL!
