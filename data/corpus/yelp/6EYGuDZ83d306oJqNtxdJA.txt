This market isn't located in the best place in the best place in town but well worth the trip. They have complimentary valet parking which makes the trip in and out pretty quick. We went because my bf was looking for a particular type of ouzo. We were pretty hungry after watching the world cup game, so decided to get some lunch/dinner. The Gyros sandwich, gyros plate and saganaki plate were all amazing. It was a busy market so they definitely know what they are doing!
