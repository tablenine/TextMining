Restaurant: The Izaka-ya by Katsu-ya
Category: Sushi Bars
Katy always knows where to go when we're down in LA and I suppose that Izaka-ya was no exception.  I can't honestly say that they have the best sushi anywhere, but it certainly is very good and very fresh.  What is more interesting about Izaka-ya is their wide range of creatively-prepared rolls and cooked dishes.. . We really really enjoyed their crispy rice with spicy tuna and their Agedashi tofu was rich and custardy - almost like chawanmushi.  Deeeeee...lish!  Topping it all, and cementing the fourth star, was their Yellowtail Collar.  This cooked piece of fish was simply extraordinary and good enough to solely justify coming back here.. . Why no five stars?  Well, the atmosphere is very generic, low-design, and quite noisy...not a place that makes you feel warm or welcome - just come in, order and eat.  . . Too bad, but eat and eat well you will.
