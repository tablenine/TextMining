I've been here twice. Both times, the service and food were excellent. Both times, I couldn't believe how LOUD it was! During the weekend dinner rush, it's seriously ear-piercingly, mind-numbingly loud. Sorry, but all the risotto in the world isn't worth an evening of reading lips and screaming to be heard above the din.
