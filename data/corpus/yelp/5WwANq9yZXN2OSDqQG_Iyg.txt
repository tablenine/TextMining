Five stars represents my take and that of the three Texans WHO SWORE that they were going to hate this GEORGIAN BBQ when I took them there. The meat truly FALLS off the bone. The portion sizes are truly WAY too big, so it's great for groups or cheapies who don't mind sharing. . . Service reminds you that the concept is hole in the wall, but the food is ridiculously good.
