if you want a normal burger, than this isnt the place to go. This burger joint is for the people who want to sample the unusual and have it placed on a freshly baked bun.  Try the corned beef burger with sweet potato tots. If you like milkshakes definately try the Burnt Marshmellow Nutella shake.   I look forward to another visit.
