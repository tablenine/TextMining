Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I love Titos Tacos, and you'll love Titos TOO!. . I wouldn't suggest that you go there thinking you'll have the BEST tacos on the planet!  It's really all about the cheap authentic experience that gets your foot in the door, while the crunchy tacos (+cheese is a must!) and crazy delicious salsa that keeps you coming back!  It's definitely a MUST for anyone living in LA.
