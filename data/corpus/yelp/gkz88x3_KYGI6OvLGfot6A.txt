Shmen 1 N 1, I couldn't care less about the swine flu if that means I can still eat at this homage to our snouted friends.  I ordered the hot ramen, and it was literally a religious experience - I had no idea pork could be so succulent, so tender, so explosive.  The thin slices of the Berkshire pork seemed to melt into everything - the broth, the ramen, my mouth!  The broth was truly divine - I swear I saw the Virgin of Guadalupe in the swirling oil slick and floating green onions.  The dish was incredibly well balanced in terms of flavor and texture - I especially enjoyed the pickled veggies at the bottom of the bowl.  I was worried that the heaping pile of green onions they threw on top would be overwhelming, but it really wasn't - it in fact really helped to enhance the overall texture.  And the ambiance was nice too - I call it crowded chic - as in, the place was so crowded, and we were sitting so bunched together at the kitchen-side barstools, that it had to have looked really trendy from a certain perspective.. . But I'm going to keep coming back to the pork.  Despite what John Mccain might think, I never want to cut this pork (or the luscious fat marbled throughout) out of my spending bill.
