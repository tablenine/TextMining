Restaurant: Little Five Corner Tavern
Category: Bars
This is one of my favorite Little Five eateries.  It has a great rustic bar feeling and they can open the big garage door window when it is nice out to let in the air.  I am a creature of habit and I always get the black and blue burger with extra blue cheese.  It is spicy and cheesy and wonderful.  The fries are perfectly cooked and salted.  The service is helpful and friendly and they have just the right L5P flair.
