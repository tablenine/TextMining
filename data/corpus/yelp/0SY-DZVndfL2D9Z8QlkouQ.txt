My second visit here was on Sunday evening with three of the girls.. . Gen ordered the soup, mini wrap, and side combo. We thought the soup was a cup...Nope, huge bowl! She got carrot ginger---really yummy. The ginger flavor wasn't too strong or overpowering, which is usually what I am nervous about when it comes to ginger-flavored things. This combo comes out to $13.50 and oh boy was it worth it. She took most of the soup home and half of her wrap as well.. . Sarah and I both got the Farmer's Press sandwich with sweet potato fries. I just cannot say no to sweet potato fries. Theirs are yummy yummy. The Farmer's Press was delicious also. I took half of it home and ate it cold the next day for lunch mmm. $10.95.. . Natalie got the full veggie salad (the one with the gardenburger on top) She got the dressing on the side, not sure if this is standard Toast procedure, but I recommend it because they brought out a whole gravy boat full of balsamic dressing. I would be sending it back if the salad was already tossed with that much dressing. Gross. Anyway, her salad was HUGE and she wish'd she'd order the half portion.. . When I came here the first time, it was at the suggestion of a friend who lived in LA and met me there. It was a busy busy weekday. I also drive by here nearly everyday, and let me tell you, I did have a pretentious perception, BUT after Sunday's visit I feel differently...Maybe it's because it was a chilly October Sunday evening and the place was mostly and older crowd?. . I would definitely come back, I still want to try this place for breakfast and all the bakery goods looked like they have potential.
