Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
Gloria's is a totally great hole-in-the-wall type of place. Blink and you'll miss it's shady strip mall location even with its big obnoxious palm tree'd sign outside. The interior could also definitely use a facelift but I guess that adds to its ethnic charm. The menu is a veritable pupu platter of Mexican, El Salvadorian and Central American dishes. All the familiar favorites are included as well as such delicious items as pupusas (I highly recommend the pork and bean &amp; cheese ones) and El Salvadorian tamales. The pupusas come with a great slaw but the red sauce could definitely have much more of a kick. The service here is first class, everyone was super friendly and efficient. Gloria's certainly isn't fine dining but its a wonderful bang for your buck.
