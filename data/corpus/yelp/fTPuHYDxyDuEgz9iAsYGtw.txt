The only time I ever hit this place is in the winter, when they're offering their turkey-cranberry sandwich. I always get the tater tots as well. . . I've been here for breakfast once and it was okay. . . Food is pretty decent in general and reasonably priced. Average dinner without drinks is anywhere from $10 - $15. . . It can get pretty loud during the evenings so this probably isn't the best place to go if you wanna talk. Worst nights are if a big sports game is going on.
