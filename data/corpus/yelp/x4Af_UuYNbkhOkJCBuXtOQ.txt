Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
small location &amp; you have to valet your car or park on the street. not the best location because its hard to see the sign &amp; can miss it if you don't know where you're going. but so worth the trouble! side dishes are yummy &amp; they refill them promptly. the meat quality is the best i've had (&amp; i'm korean &amp; have had my fair share of restaurant kbbq). there is someone who understands english too! a rare find in ktown. would definitely go back but a little pricey for everyday.
