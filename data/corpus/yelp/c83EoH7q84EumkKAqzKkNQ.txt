I give Geisha 4 stars because I enjoyed the sushi at Katana so much more... . . But Geisha is FUN. Huge space, friendly service... didn't see any stars that nite but the week before my g-friend saw the entire cast of Laguna Beach. . . Definitely a scene, but you're in LA... and when in LA.... worth a visit but I won't go back, so many other places to try!!
