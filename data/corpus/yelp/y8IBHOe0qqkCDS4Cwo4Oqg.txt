This is a great place for a date, special occasion, night on the town, or to take your out of town guests. It is unlike most hotel restaurants in that the food and service are both very good, but they pale in comparison to the views from the top of Atlanta and if you stay for an hour you'll see the full skyline as the restaurant makes a full rotation hourly! . . If you live in or have visited Atlanta and haven't been, you need to fix that ASAP!
