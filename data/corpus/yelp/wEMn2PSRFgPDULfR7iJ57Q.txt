Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Okay, I'll start this review by saying that I'm petitioning to get the 1st handed to me instead of one of the two ahead.  . . Father's office is officially open.  And what a wonderful change from the original.. . I have to say the free parking and the much more ample space make this a home run.  Soo much better than the other location.  Same great atmosphere, same great beer, same great food.  But I have to say a cooler and younger crowd.. . The heaters on the patio make all the difference.  Food was a little slow but the anticpation of trying to hunt down a table suppressed any anger over that.. . I still think that there system of ordering food and scoping a table is going to be a problem as this place gets crazy.. . Also I can't believe I saw so many grown ass people waiting in line outside.. . All in all a great addition to the culver city bar scene.. . Woo hoo Father's office!  Now give me lots of props so i can get my 1st 1st!!!
