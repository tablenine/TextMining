I have traveled far and wide in search of the best Shabu Shabu and this place wins, hands down. First of all, the wait is TOTALLY worth it and is actually part of the experience. I like to have either Ceflore or octopus balls on a stick while I wait. I also love that there are only two options on the menu (and by menu I mean a piece of paper taped to the wall): MEDIUM and LARGE. Seriously, that's it. Those are your only two options. So...if you're a vegetarian, I probably wouldn't recommend coming here because the size refers to the amount of sliced beef. I have constant cravings for this place...their dipping sauces are amazing and I'm so happy they've started bottling and selling! Oh! And I even love the way they rush you to your seat, practically throwing the plates of food at you. The minute you're done, it's like they can't get rid of you fast enough, saying "thank you, thank you, come again!" in a friendly, but very urgent tone. I understand - for a small place, they gotta keep filling the seats to make money. In fact, I find the whole experience charming.
