Mmmmm just had some for the first time last night.  . . Broth...great.. Noodles...good, but could've been better.  Perhaps it was because we were one of the last groups of diners.... Pork...luscious!. Green onions...plenty!. Garlic paste...drool.. Ginger...looove that you can add as much as you need.. Fried rice...boooo!  "Don't order the fried rice" -waiter.  Guess the rice wasn't good enough for frying.  At least he was honest.  But I do hear the fried rice is excellent.. . Great.  My fingers are still swollen from all that sodium.  Eff it was worth it!
