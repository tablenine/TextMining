I co-organized a company team dinner for 26 people. Given the economy, we were worried about finances so we opted for the Winter Fusion Prix Fixe Menu. It's a really good deal - an appetizer, entrée, and dessert all for $35 per person.  They even printed up a private menu and put our company name on top. . . Table was ready when we got there. They were completely cool with letting us sit even though the whole party hadn't shown up. We had two waitresses/waiters and they were great with the group. . . I pre-ordered spring rolls and dragon rolls for the group.  They were delicious, especially the dragon roll.  Then for my options - I selected  the chicken katsu salad, Hawaii Kai Style Beef Short Ribs, and the Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle.  The short ribs were so tender. I would definitely get that again. Most of my co-workers who got the blackened shrimp seemed to love their meal, while my boss who got the flat-top grilled salmon steak was disappointed and kept eyeing the others with shrimp. Someone felt bad for him so offerred him one of her shrimps! . . So while our dinner was rather affordable, our alcohol was not. The drinks were almost as expensive as our meal tab!  We had a couple of bottles of wine we brought...which seemed to be a good idea. Cork fee was $20...while most of the bottles of wine were $44+.  . . A definitely must try.
