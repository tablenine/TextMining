The Fresh Mango with Tapioca had me hooked after my first sip. So so good. The place is very clean, the service is above average for the area and very quick. Fresh ingredients are the key to the great food and fruit drinks. The Garlic Chicken Lunch Special is $6.50 and comes with soup. The portions are large and well worth the prices. Try the Vietnamese Giant Shrimp with Pork dish if you're feeling adventurous. Everything I've ever had here has been excellent. Are you going to Joy Yee yet???? Can i come?
