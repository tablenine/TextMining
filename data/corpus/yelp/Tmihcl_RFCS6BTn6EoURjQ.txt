I am updating this based on the fact that I had such a better experience for happy hour than I did when i went for dinner there. Â Like i said in my first review I wasnt thrilled about this place but we were in the area, my friend was craving mexican food, I a margarita AND we found a spot so I said sure why not? . . This place totally redeemed itself with happy hour! We shared a nice size portion of nachos ($4), a chicken taco plate that came with two tacos and rice and beans ($5) and two margaritas for I believe four bucks each. So our bill came out to like $20 which is so cheap for dinner because it completely filled me up plus the margarita was super strong! i only needed one! In addition, the food actually tasted better this time. The chicken tacos were actually tastier than the carne asada ones I had two weeks ago.. . I probably wouldnt be back here for dinner because of the crowd and how hard it is to get a table but I will def be back for happy hour where the price is right and there was not a crazy line out the door!
