My friends always gushed about this place for months but I never went... just because. . . Anyways, recently my friends finally dragged me to brunch and albeit my food was just okay, I'm willing to give it another chance. The service is lackluster but since good-looking people work there, I'm forgiving. . . I come here with friends for a drink (or two) when we want to feel like ~sophisticated adults~. The drinks, by the way, are strong, delicious, and cheap. It's okay if you don't like the food but like to drink, Â come here and hang out with a Wild Whiskey. . . I live around the corner so out of sheer laziness, I'll probably be spending a lot of money here at least once a week. Go me.
