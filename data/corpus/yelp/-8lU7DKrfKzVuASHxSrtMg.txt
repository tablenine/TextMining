Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
YUM...prime rib. . .and meatballs while you wait for your table!. . This place is beautiful because they did a great job with the decor - When you walk in it looks all extravagent.  I think it's the lighting or something but it makes everything look so rich and warm-feeling.  You think you have to be all dressed up to dine here, but don't worry about wearing jeans and a t-shirt :). . I've been here for dinner with gfs and also for a wedding reception.  Both times it was a great experience.  I think I liked going with my gfs and being served by the waitresses because they dress up like in their maid outfits and they all have accents.  I liked that the most and they were so friendly and prompt with service.  The two sides I got were the creamed corn and spinach.   I never know which cut to get, so I just asked for a suggestion and got that - and of course I loved it! (By the way if you guys know which cut to get that tates the best and doesn't have too much fat on it, please let me know!)
