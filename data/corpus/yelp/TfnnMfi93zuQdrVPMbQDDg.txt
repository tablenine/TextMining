Restaurant: Le Colonial
Category: Vietnamese
I've been to the Le Colonial in San Francisco a few times and loved it, so when I moved to Chicago I was thrilled to see they have a location here as well. The food is fresh, inventive and beautifully prepared. Le Colonial was my first experience with French Vietnamese food and I absolutely love all the unique flavor combinations they put together. . . The restaurant is divided into two floors. The downstairs is a more formal dining room and the decor reminds me of Casablanca - lots of orchids and ceiling fans. It's very peaceful, for lack of a better word. The upstairs is more of a lounge - there's a bar and comfy couches for having a pre- or post-dinner cocktail. It's very dimly lit with lots of candles and smaller tables, as well as a sort of covered patio. They serve food upstairs, but I really prefer to eat downstairs and then have a drink upstairs afterwards.. . All in all, this place is great for a romantic meal or for out-of-town guests, as well as a nice place to stop in for cocktails (all of their specialty drinks are delicious and pack a punch) before a night out in the Gold Coast.
