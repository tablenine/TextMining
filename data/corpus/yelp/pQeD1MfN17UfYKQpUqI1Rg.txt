The perfect place to get breakfast after a hike in the hills not too far away.  Pet friendly dining on the sidewalk, but it's a popular place to walk dogs with no shortage of ill tempered dog owners.... . The breakfast specials are the ones to order, a separate one page menu that typically comes with the regular menu.  The migas always hit the spot.  Be prepared for long lines during the weekends, and a grab bag of mostly friendly staff.. . I'll go back for sure, but it's not going to be a regular place.
