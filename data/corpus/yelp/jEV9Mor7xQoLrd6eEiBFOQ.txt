I've been so excited to come here ever since I saw the place on Iron Chef.  But..what a disappointment.  The best part were the sides -- the broccolini and the leek mashed potatoes were very good.  We got the special, which was a casino beef something.  it was terrible -- it was so tough, not very tasty, and we had to spit out a number of really tough bites before we gave up in it.  The scallops were OK -- super small and really peppery.
