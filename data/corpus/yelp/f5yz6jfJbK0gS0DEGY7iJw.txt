I went with a group and we arranged for a fixed menu so that the bill could be easily split up. For starter I had the romaine heartS which was a single heart (boo!).  It was good but essentially it's like a really small ceasar salad with plaintains for croutons.  My main dish was the mahi mahi with tamarind glaze. The fish was good but I didn't care much for the cumin scented cabbage. Desert was a tasting of the torta de tres leches, goat milk cajeta flan and barcelona chocolate cake. Liked the tres leches and choc cake.  The flan seemed too stiff for my liking.. . Get there between 4 to 7 and take advantage of happy hour drinks and appetizer.  Note: they are for the HOUSE mojito and HOUSE sangria.  They might try to upsell you on their other drink varieties so take note.. . Valet parking with validation is $5.  Convenient.. . My rating for them is tepid because I think service has a big influence on your impression of the restaurant.  In this case, it seemed like a chore for the server to attend to us.  He interrupted conversations to take the orders. He kinda of just threw the plates with the deserts onto the table and we had to ask what was being placed before us.  He messed up the coffee order and didn't offer to correct it -- when the woman said she would accept the decaf he should have said "I'll be right back with your regular coffee."  Instead he seemed happy he didn't have to go back to get another cup. And in the end when we had  to take care of the bill, we wrote a note describing how the check should be split and he didn't get it right. He really could care less about us and for a restaurant of this level I would have expected a better experience. The bus boy clearing the plates had better manners.. . I wouldn't recommend the restaurant based on this experience.  Oh, and the volume of the dining room can get pretty loud.
