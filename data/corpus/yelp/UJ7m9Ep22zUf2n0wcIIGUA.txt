Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The Griddle should be a mandatory meal stop if you're going to be in or near Hollywood in the morning.  I don't know what it's like at lunch or beyond, because I try to be there at 8 when it opens.  Yes, by 8:30 there's a line to wait in.  Hell, I didn't even know they had a lunch menu until my third visit!. The pancakes are their signature dish, and they are huge.  Cartoonishly, Scooby-Doo huge.  And they're creative, including one with Bailey's and Kahlua, with bananas and caramel, and it goes on and on.  I recently had the Apple Strudel French Toast, which was thankfully a little smaller.  The egg dishes are large and delicious too.  The other signature feature is their French-press coffee, of which they offer three intensities.  This is a classy touch.  . The service is quick and friendly, the clientele is very industry-heavy, but not pretentiously so.  People have production meetings and so on, at either indoor tables and counter or the outdoor seating.  When I was there this past week, there was soft Delta blues playing from the speakers, which added a calming underscore to the hum of activity and conversations.  I'm a big, big fan, and always recommend my friends stop in.  All have become instant fans.  . Arguably a can't-miss dining experience, perfect for the neighborhood.
