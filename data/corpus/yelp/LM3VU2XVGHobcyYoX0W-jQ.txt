Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
For a place open this late on the Sunset strip, it's kind of surprising but the food here is really good.  It's not really Brazilian in any way, but they gotta say that for the name I guess. They have a smattering (yes, a smattering) of everything.  Case in point: We had caprese, lamb skewers, shrimp wrapped in bacon &amp; gargonzola, and fries.. . But I had my heart was set on fried Yucca, and they were out! So I have to dock a star for that.
