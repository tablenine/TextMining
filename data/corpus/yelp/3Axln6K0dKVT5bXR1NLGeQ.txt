Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
2.5 Stars. . So, apparently I'm one of the only people in LA who's not a fan but whatever, here I go...little goldfish swimming upstream. . . Price: Awesome - who doesn't like $1.50 for a fish taco and $2.00 for a shrimp taco. . . Tacos: . I got 1 shrimp and 1 fish taco and found them to be meh. The fish taco tasted mainly of oil and batter and the shrimp taco was really heavy on the batter too. I did think the salsa bar was neat but here's where the real problem hit. I'd tried a couple salsas and before I'd even finished eating I felt an unpleasant Â indigestion burn as the salsa hit my stomach. This was the kind of exploratory tingling that suggests that you are going to be in for a rough afternoon. . . Oh and lest you think I can't take the spicy, I'd like to point out that I grew up in Indonesia. You want hot chiles? There's a reason we're on the ring o' fire and it's not just the volcanoes. . . Service and Atmosphere: Ordering on this particular day did not happen efficiently. People were not being served in the order they came. It was hard to get anyone's attention. Once you ordered, however, the food came out pronto. Also, the place is vaguely dirty and looks like it could use a go-over from our friends, clorox and lysol.
