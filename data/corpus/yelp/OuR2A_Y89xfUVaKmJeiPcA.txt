My ex gf took me here once for my bday and the food was average.  I think this place is way over hyped.  I had prime rib and it was pretty dry and was not tender.  The service was pretty prompt and they were friendly, but the place was fairly empty.  Valet parking is right in front, so that's pretty easy..  Would I come here again?  Probably not, but the atmosphere was romantic and it was a good experience.
