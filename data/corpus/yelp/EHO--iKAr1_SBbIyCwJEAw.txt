Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
After posting a review a couple months ago, I have returned for round 2! . . Why don't all you suckers who give this place 1 star go back under the rock from which you crawled out from! . . Tito's is a Mexican place that serves taco's, take it for what it is! Only get the tacos! It is not a 5 star fancy restaurant.. Maybe people have different ideas of what "authentic" really means! BUT next time, please look behind the counter and see that there is a short little Mexican lady that cooks the food. This is how a lot of Mexicans cook their tacos. If you only see white people in line, you must be color blind because I see Mexicans in line all the time, including me and my husband! . . It really doesn't matter in the end though, because just like many of you have noticed...... They are not going out of business anytime soon! Â :)
