i just had dinner here for the first time and it was well above average. had the kumamoto oysters, clam and dungeness saffron risotto, pork bellies, sweetbreads and a tasting of ice cream (black sesame, champagne sorbet and cream cheese gelato) which was all exceptional! even more was the top notch service! will return soon!
