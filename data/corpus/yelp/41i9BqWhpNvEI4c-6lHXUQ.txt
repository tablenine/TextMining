bow chica wow wow- the noises in my vegetarian mouth that is not pampered nearly enough in this fashion. this was one of my favorite meals ever. I love the small plates, the creative flavors and combinations and you get to try lots of different things with the small plates- it was all exquisite and though pricey, worth it. Â my brother lives in chicago and next time I'm in town, i'll demand an encore of this meal.
