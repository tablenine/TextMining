I was here for the first time over the Fourth of July holiday. It was insane. It looked like they were giving away the store. So many people. There were people everywhere. I was a little nervous with the crowd the way it was...my mother hates waiting for a table...and we were quoted 45 minutes. Though, I have to admit, with this crappy economy that we have it was exciting to see such wonderful business. My worries were for nothing. They took excellent care of us. We got in faster than expected and the food and service were excellent. We will be going back for sure.  You must have the Old School Platter.  I've been dreaming about having it again ever since I left.  It's to die for!
