Food worth the work.... . I've ate here a few times and each time I havent been disappointed.  As everyone has mentioned, the big wow of this restaurant is their lobster with their house seasoning.  The lobster is moist, flavorful and just one of those dishes that you dont mind cracking all the shells for to get every piece of delicious meat that you can.  Seasoning is just out of this world.  You get this nice sweet boom boom pow in your mouth.. . Service was excellent.  Our server was personable and gave great recommendations on dishes to order.  He even recommended that we order less because there would be too much food.  Any wait that tries to save you money is a good waiter in my book.. . Originally, going to this restaurant was definitely a pain at the old location just because of the horrendous parking and the fact that they only accepted cash.  However, since they moved to the new location...all that has changed.  They accept credit card and even though the parking lot is small there's a good amount of street parking.. . As with any type of good food comes a stiff price.  The prices here are a little on the expensive side compared to other asian seafood restaurants but I think the quality more than makes up for the price.  You get what you pay for in my opinion.
