Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Last night, driving around LA with boyfriend, trying to decide if we wanted hamburgers, sushi, or Canters--basically, I was deciding if I wanted ketchup, soy sauce, or pickles--I suggested Mozza.  We were in the 'hood; why not?  And then an overwhelming need for tomato sauce came over me, so we went there.  . . I hadn't had a good experience with Mozza to date.  On three separate occasions, I've called to see if I can make a reservation, always to be greeted by a rotating line-up of snarky hostesses who dismiss me on the phone.  They hang up and laugh at Dumb Girl who thinks she can get a reservation for two weeks from now.  That annoys me.  I just had to get that out there.. . A very nice hostess sat us almost immediately at the pizza bar.  One star.  That was a sizeable glass of wine for the price; another star.  Anytime I get more bang for my buck, I'm a happy girl.  The green beans with mustard and hazelnuts antipasto was delish.  Green beans were a little crisp, mustard sauce was mustard-y, and hazelnuts added that somethin' something.  Three stars.  . . Burrata cheese, in general, amps up my rating of any place.  Even better is the fact that boyfriend doesn't like cheese, so I got double the burrata.  So the moral of the story so far is to go to Mozza with a cheese hater and then you get to reap all the benefits.. . We had the squash blossom pizza and the prosciutto, arugula pizza.  Both were absolutely awesome.  That crust made me suspend most of my misgivings about this place and its laundry list of over-hype.  So yes, I'd return.  I'll think of the crust as I weasel my way in for a table.  . . Oh, sweet, sweet burrata and crust.  You slay me.
