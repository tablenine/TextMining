Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I don't know what's so great about this place....it's just another typical thai restaurant to me. I prefer Noodle World over this..but that's not it. I forgot what dishes we ordered that day but one of it is pad thai and you know how it has bean sprouts in it right? At first I thought it was just bean sprout too but as I looked closer...it was a darn cue tip. Can we say GROSS? How the hell did they come up with a cue tip in my food? Ughhh....so you'll never see me at this restaurant again!
