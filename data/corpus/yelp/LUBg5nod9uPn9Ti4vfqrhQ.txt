Lovely lunch experience for my Chicago day o' leisure.  Went alone for a late Friday lunch because I had a craving something fierce for steak.  Iron deficiency?  Anywho, no, the food wasn't really anything spectacular, but it was still a great meal &amp; a nice experience.  . . Ordered the lunch special.  Even opted for the $5 glass of wine, as before I knew what glasses were on special, I was about to order the very same cabernet.  Made me feel like I was already on the right track.  I know myself &amp; that I always leave 3 course lunches feeling nasty because really who eats a full app, entree &amp; desert, so while the desert choices looked tempting, I told the waiter I didn't want any.  He immediately offered 2 apps instead, which I couldn't pass up.. . I really liked the pace of lunch: very leisurely but not slow.  The room was basically empty &amp; I came late, but they didn't rush me at all, I probably sat for 2 hours &amp; read the paper &amp; savored every bite.  Popover was killer.  Wedge salad was great.  The 'extra' appetizer I ordered, surf &amp; turf dumplings, were gummy &amp; underseasoned, but hey, there were the extra ones anyway.. . Both sides that I chose for my steak - asparagus &amp; mushrooms - were buttery &amp; tasty.  Steak was perfect medium rare, as ordered.. . I really had such a pleasant Friday.
