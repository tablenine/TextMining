Restaurant: Adobo Grill
Category: Latin American
I admit, I initially feared for Adobo.  The neighborhood is just too chi-chi, the interior too big and too corporately "done".  . . But I have to say, even though they could stand to make the gap between the price of the entree and the size of the entree smaller (right now things just seem pretty pricey for what you end up getting), the end result of the food is quite good.  . . We started off with chips and salsa appetizer.  This came with 4 different types of salsa - Pico de gallo; chipotle salsa; tres chiles salsa; and a Chef's special - which in our case was a pureed avocado with peppers that packed a little bit of a punch!  (The spice level on this might be too heavy for some, but for me it was heavenly.)  Then I ordered the fish tacos, which while good, were really small and almost appetizer size. I was glad to have gotten the chips at that point!. . Also, the service here was impeccable. From the attention at the bar (BTW, their version of a cosmo:  good, but their Mojito: friggin amazing!  you must try this!), to the host station, to our waitress, everyone was really cool, friendly and eager to please.  Which was nice to see!  Even the valet guys were great!. . This is a tough area for me to get to, but I would definitely come back if I had the chance.
