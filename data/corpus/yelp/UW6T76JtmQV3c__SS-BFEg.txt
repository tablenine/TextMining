Headed over to Toast this past weekend to check out a new place.  We new that it would be busy and there maybe a wait involved.  Showed up around 11:30 on Saturday and to our surprise there was a limited number of people milling outside waiting.  We spoke with the host who was very pleasant and gave him our name.  He stated that the wait would be about 30 minutes unless we were interested in sitting at the bar which was available.  Never ones to shy away from a bar (regardless of booze being served or not) we quickly told him the bar was perfect.. Taking a look at the menu it seemed to have your typical brunch foods until I looked up and saw the days special...asparagus, tomato and blue cheese omelet.  I was in heaven and was eagerly anticipating this meal.  I was not disappointed what so ever and devoured everything on my plate.. While Toast is out of our way for an "all the time" brunch spot, I would certainly be back if I was going to be in the area.
