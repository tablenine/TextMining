Okay...I only came for coffee which was good by the way.    The pleasant surprise was that this cottage-style cafe existed in Los Angeles, a city overrun by chainy coffee places (Starbucks -- cough, cough).  The patio was a great place to relax and enjoy a nice conversation.  They have heat lamps too, a bonus for those chilly nights.
