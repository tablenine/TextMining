Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
huge fan of fraiche!  downtown culver city is an exciting place to go these days and fraiche is my favorite restaurant there.  the ambiance is very nice and i'd recommend sitting out on the covered patio especially on a warm night.  last time i was there, i had the baby beet salad with ricotta, which was probably the best beet salad i've had yet.  that's saying a lot since i've been on this mission to find the best beet salad in the world!  then i had the pork chops, which were also very delicious, tender and moist.  so all around, i would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
