This place came with high expectations due to a friend's recommendation. Lines were long... they also gave away free cheese rolls when I was there. The cheese rolls were delicious. . . Now the bad part... Ordered Cuban sandwich. Took 15 minutes to get my order and this is not counting the wait time to place the order. Customer service is non-existent. Cuban sandwich was so-so at best. . . guess my best experience was the free cheese roll. Â I think they use too much better. Way too fatty for my taste.
