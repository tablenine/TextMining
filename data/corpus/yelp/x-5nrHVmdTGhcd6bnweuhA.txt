I'm not sure what else I can say that hasn't already been said, other than I LOVE this place so much that for lunch I drive all the way from my office in Sherman Oaks to enjoy their amazingly good delicacies.. . Try this place if you're in the area or not, and I'm sure you'll walk out with a huge smile on your face.. . They get very busy for lunch, so come early... Like 11:00am early.
