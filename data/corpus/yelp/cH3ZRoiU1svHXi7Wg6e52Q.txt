Beautiful hotel.  Sexy decor.  Poor service and mediocre food.  Perhaps it was an off night.  We went on a Sunday evening.  The valet drop off area was rocking.  Surprised when we got seated that there was like very few patrons in the restaurant.  Waiter was doing the best he could.  Nice kid.  Food was just ok....fairly edible but nothing to go nuts over.  Looked like a few folks from the wait staff must have called in sick that night as I only saw like maybe 2 or three waiters the entire night.  Getting drinks took a long time.   Getting the check took an eternity.  I'm just glad that the couple we went with drove and paid for the valet.......my lady and I only had appetizers...one of the folks in our party got the fish...I think it may have been grouper or snapper.  He is a chef and had very little to say.
