mmmmm... what can i say about spring that hasn't already been said. the place is elegant and welcoming; the food is so tasty and fresh. i went with my boyfriend and my trusty sidekick "groupon". we had a blast! our waiter was attentive, helpful, and very personable. he made the perfect recommendations! could anything they serve there displease me, though? i THOUGHT i hated brussel sprouts but i was wrong. so very wrong. whatever you do, get the sprouts!. . had the tuna starter, the quail eggs and italian anchovies around it were delectable. carried on with malted sweet potato soup and then the barramundi with ricotta dumplings and sage. im a sucker for sage, and it was perfect. lots of little tastes and muses in between courses, we were treated to Â herbed hot chocolate and some kind of radish yummy. it was my birthday and they brought me a little s'more with a candle... cute? so cute. we had already ordered the lemon cardamom cake for dessert, but you wont ever hear me complain about two desserts. everything was fantastic. . . the cocktails look delicious and i will definitely venture back here to try one or two at the bar, and i'm sort of intrigued by the tasting menu (can i get the brussel sprouts with that?).
