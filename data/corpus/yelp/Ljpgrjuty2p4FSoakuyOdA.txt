Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
The fact that the overall rating for Tito's Tacos is only 3 stars is absolutely absurd.  Yes, the tacos are greasy...that's what makes them so good!  I usually order two tacos with cheese and a side of rice, but practically everything I've tried there has been delicious.  To be fair, the guacamole is less than ideal; it is soupy as opposed to chunky.  The only other downside I can think of is that parking can be a pain sometimes...but it is totally worth it.  I have lived in Southern California my entire life and Tito's continues to be one of my favorites.
