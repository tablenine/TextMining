Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
What a great Asian fusion mix. Urban Belly has strong Korean influences and from what I could tell also some Thai with a Japanese / Vietnamese twist. . . When I showed up, we ended up waiting outside for about 30 minutes for a seat. They then have you stand in line to order and pay before your meal. I think if they had you order outside and pay when done, it might help with too many people being inside at once. After you order they seat you at a communal table with a group of people. Â The communal seating I could do without. However, that was how I was seated while eating on a recent trip to Korea (maybe its traditional), so can't fault them if they are trying to provide that kind of dining experience here. The menu isn't huge, which helps make the choice of what to eat easier and gets people in and out quicker. You don't have to wait long for your food, it comes our really quick. Everything I had was great. The pork belly was fatty and delicious. Urban Belly's Kimche was some of the best I have had outside of Korea, it tasted fresh, wasn't watery and had just the right amount of spice. . . Urban Belly rocks! I'll have to go back and try some of the other goodies like the lamb and brandy dumplings.
