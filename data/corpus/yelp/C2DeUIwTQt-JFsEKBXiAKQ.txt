Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
I have to agree with the majority of the other reviews of this sushi restaurant: simple, but very good. You really can't beat a good deal when it comes to sushi. Hide provides just that. The restaurant is not too big, but not too small. Service is somewhat quick, since I think they'd like to increase turnover and profit. Quality is excellent; value-top notch. I highly recommend Hide for all y'all sushi lovers. Bring cash and a hearty appetite. Bon apetit!
