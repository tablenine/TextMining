Restaurant: Ciudad
Category: Latin American
Ciudad seems acutely aware that their happy hour is a very poplar choice for the younger Bunker Hill set.  As a result, don't expect your waiter to smile (ever), don't expect to hang out on the patio (that's for diners only), and don't expect to be able to hold a conversation (it's incredibly loud).. . However, the $4 mojitos *are* good.  Seems like people will do anything for a $4 cocktail.  Maybe I should build build a restaurant around a $3.99 happy hour cocktail.  I'll call it the Irish Smoothie.
