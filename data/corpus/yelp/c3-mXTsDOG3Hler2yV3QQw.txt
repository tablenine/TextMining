Well heres the thing I love birds but you must know if you are going to eat there get there early cause when the drinkers come good luck. I met a friend there for some drinks and at like 9ish we ordered some apps and we had been sitting there way befor it  got busy and the door guy told us we had to get up cause  we wernt on a list after I order 30bucks of apps from the waitress lol it was funny  they lets us eat but giving us a look lol I didnt care cause I went there to drink, and I have been during the day to just ate and it was yummy so if your going to eat make sure you get there on time or your shit out of luck
