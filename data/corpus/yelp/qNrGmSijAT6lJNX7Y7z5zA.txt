First and foremost, the red-sauced chalupa definitely overshadowed everything else. My first bite at this place was this chalupa appetizer and it was just so strong, so flavorful and packed such a punch that everything else I ate after that wasn't quite what it should be. . . Regardless though, it was all really good. I liked that it was small and comfortable. I liked that somehow, the owner/manager/whatever-he-is knew that we were new to his establishment. I liked that Guy Fieri's image was on the wall.. . Most of all, I think I liked the red sauced chalupas best, but next time I'm not ordering them just so I can get a better sense of whate verything else tastes like.
