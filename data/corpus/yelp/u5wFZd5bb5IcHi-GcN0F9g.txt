I don't care if this is a place for "drunk food" or not. It's horrifically bad. Crappy experience all around - terrible food, unfriendly service, got my order wrong. I live very close, but I'll never eat there again.. . If you want some awesome late night food, go in the basement to Underdog. They have some great food for after a night at the bars. I suggest the chili dog.
