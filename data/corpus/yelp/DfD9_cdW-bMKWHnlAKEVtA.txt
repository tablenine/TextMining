Blue velvet cake: all that it's cracked up to be. Sure it has food coloring blue #2783742, and would be a good dye to light up your colon before getting an xray.  But, if you love red velvet (who doesn't?), this is actually a variation that hits it out of the ballpark.  Sweet, perfect proportion of blueberries in a cream cheese frosting.  Heavenly.  Make sure to have enough milk to wash out repeatedly the refined sugar aftertaste.  Probably injecting some insulin to go with the cake would be a good idea, too.  But it's worth it.. . Tres leches cake: disappointing. Not sure if it's a pudding like someone else said or a cake. But by the time I got it home, the cake was soaking in a tub of white milky sugary juice.  Was that the pudding melted?  Was that juice always there when I bought it?  I think it may have melted.  Anyway, the cake is very forgettable.  It's got a little funny taste, too.  So far, Gulfstream has the best tres leches cake in LA, but I'm still looking.
