WHAT a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Â Went there finally after hearing all the hype and was only met with bad service and bad food. We went for Sunday morning brunch - we asked the people dining next to us whether their food was delicious and were met with unenthusiastic responses about their french toast (which was dry) and some eggs with a side of bread that looked like Wonder bread. I still decided to order the French Toast and it was edible -- nothing to warrant the raving and hype. We tried to ordered the Eggs Norwegian (eggs benedict with salmon) and asked to sub. the english muffin with a croissant. The waiter proceeded to tell us the establishment was too stingy and would not allow the substitution without offering to do it for an extra charge. We then ordered the oatmeal, which had bananas cut with a onion flavored knife and was so soggy I could have microwaved it better myself. To drink -- the lattes - size of an espresso were 6$ each!. . DON"T GO!
