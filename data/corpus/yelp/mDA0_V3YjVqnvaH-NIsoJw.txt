Eats is a cheap place to Eat in the Midtown/Poncey Highland district that has evolved over the years. When I first started coming in 1995, they served only Jerk Chicken, Steamed Vegetables, Black Beans and Rice and Pasta and (Turkey) Meat Sauce. Now they have meat loaf, lemon pepper chicken, various sauces for pasta and so on. But I stick with the original as it hasn't changed.  The Jerk Chicken has a great flavor and never dry.  Hell I even enjoy the sweet tea.. . Because of the neighborhood and being directly across the street from City Hall East, Eats gets people from all walks of life, that can also be because it's not only "Eats" it's cheap eats.. . I also love the eye candy that comes in now and again!
