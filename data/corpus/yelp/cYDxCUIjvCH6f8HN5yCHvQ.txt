Waffles yumm... Food here is the shiiiieeet!! I've been to every one of them but just getting around to the review .. Took the kids to this one and they were not to exicted about chicken AND waffles. So ordered the chicken for them 1st and the waitress and me was on the same page and she brought the mac/cheese which they loved .then she brought the waffle bomb that knocked them off there seats. Two 9yr olds with mac and cheese and waffles they were alseep all the way back to the house .
