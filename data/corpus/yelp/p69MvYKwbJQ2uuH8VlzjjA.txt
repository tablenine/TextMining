A different experience with the play on garlic. I love garlic so it was interesting to taste it other than when you use it food for flavor. The roasted garlic with the bread was delicious. I was afraid to try the garlic ice cream but I was glad I did because as scary as it sounds it was actually good. Take a chance.
