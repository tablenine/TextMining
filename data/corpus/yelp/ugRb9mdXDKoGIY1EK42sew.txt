Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
On a monthly basis, I have the fun experience of participating in a dinner club. One night we decided to check out Ping Pong for a Chinese twist.  The atmosphere is comfortable and clean.  I ordered a very refreshing drink called the Gossip Girl which has passionfruit vodka, tropical nectars and a squeeze of fresh lime. It was so good!  Then for dinner I ordered the Buddhist Enlightenment which had a really nice flavor that consisted of simmered seitan, tofu ribbon, shittake, napa, peapods, glass noodle in soy broth all for the reasonable entrée price of $12.  (There was a lot of food, so I had plenty to take for lunch the next day- nice bonus, huh?!)   I'm kind of craving this dish again now as I write this review, so I might be stopping by in the near future.  Overall, the girls were pleased with their chicken and beef dishes as well. I think we were all surprised how good the food was and we didn't have to spend $50 to enjoy a nice dinner. Go Ping Pong!
