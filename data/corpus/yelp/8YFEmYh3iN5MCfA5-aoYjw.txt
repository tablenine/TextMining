This is a bar to be attended with a large group on a non-party night (not Thur-Sat).  When possible, this place is quick with the food and the drinks.. . If you're here on a party night (Thurs-Sat.), prepare for the crowds.  Yes, the cheap prices and general concept of this place drew other people with little money out also.  You weren't the only one.  This place gets packed.  When it's packed, service goes down the tube.  . . This place gets marked down for inconsistent service as well as getting insanely crowded.  This place is also marked down for being a bit out there (I mean, 10th ave. really?!)  I guess they can offer everything so cheap with rent being much lower out there.
