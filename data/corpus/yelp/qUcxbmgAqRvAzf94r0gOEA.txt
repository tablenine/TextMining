This place is so cute! I came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, it was a perfect day to sit out on the patio. We ordered a gyros wrap and a lamb sandwich, both of which were delicioso!  Then my sweet tooth couldn't resist gettin a few baklavas on my way out.  I cant wait to come back and order the dinner plates.  Too bad they close early on Sun and closed all day Mon!
