Another amazing Buford Highway option.  . . I like this restaurant, plus, it is BYOB which always makes it even more economical.. . The staff is great, I'm pretty sure one of the cute server girls is into me.. . Food is excellent.  Other people are commenting on it a lot better than I can.. . Ambiance is a B.  The interior is not bad, but, not great.  Outdoors is a mess with a confusing parking lot/valet scene and it's located in a strip mall.
