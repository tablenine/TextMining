Restaurant: The Bagel Restaurant &amp; Deli
Category: Bakeries
This place is the great jewish deli right out of NYC.  Why there aren't more places like this in Chicago amazes me.  . You are able to pick up bagels on the go or you can sit in the back and enjoy their full menu.  They have wonderful matzo ball soup which is perfect during these Chicago winters.  I like going here by myself and reading a book.  The waiters are incredibly nice and the food tastes like it was made by the jewish mother you never had.
