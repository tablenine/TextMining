Went to dinner at Gilbert's on Monday night.  It was really good.  There was hardly anyone there and the waiter paid ALOT of attention to us.  But I'd definitely recommend it.  I had the Turkish Meatball appetizer and bowl of Lentil Soup.  Very good!  My brother had a falafel, his fiancee had a chicken sandwich and our friend had a lamb burger.  Quite an interesting mixture of food.
