Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
The food at The Pig is great, and while my son is staying at Children's Memorial Hospital, I tend to live on their creative soups, salads, and sandwiches. The Nicoise Salad is my favorite, but their hummus is also out of this world. For the serious carnivores, I recommend The Hobbit sandwich, a bacon laden, artery clogging sandwich that I have enjoyed multiple times. My favorite soup was the roasted garlic and onion, a creamy blend with hunks of the breath defying veggies. . . The atmosphere is cool- set in an old Lincoln Park home with cozy couches upstairs. In the winter, you can often find students studying in front of the fireplace.. . My main issue with the place is the service. While the hipsters at the register are usually polite, it's rare to get a cold salad or sandwich in under ten minutes and on one occasion, an order of three sandwiches and a salad placed in advance for pickup took 50(!) minutes to prepare. Â I don't know what the hold up is but that's my only real complaint and it has been such an issue that I have walked out when I've seen more than two people standing around waiting for their food.
