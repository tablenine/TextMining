Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
The host/owner was very quick in seating myself and a friend late on a Saturday evening. We filled in the last booth, but were seated and served quickly. The food was also served fairly quickly after our order was placed.. . My friend decided to order the Mediterranean bread, and it was delicious, especially when the extra spice mix with shaved garlic was added to the olive oil with pesto-like topping already present. It was very filling, and I didn't think I'd have room for the pizza pot pie I had already ordered.. . The pizza pot pie might not be aptly named (it didn't quite fit my definition of either pizza-flavored or a pot pie, but was filling and tasty. With subtle flavors from the onions, peppers, cheese and sausage it made for a good filling meal. The half pound size would be a good amount for all but the famished--especially after an appetizer.. . The beer selection on tap is slim (only two), but the selection of bottles was good enough to make up for that fact.. . All in all it was a good experience...not a place that yells "you must come back soon," but a good place for comfort food when you're walking by and are hungry.. . One other fact to take into consideration...the small sign at the entrance that claims that only cash is accepted. This might be missed by some people, and might cause problems in this age of plastic payment...be forewarned.
