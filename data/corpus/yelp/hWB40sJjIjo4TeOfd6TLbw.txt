Restaurant: A Taste of Heaven
Category: Bakeries
Charming and Delightful at breakfast this morning! Â This is a cute little place in trendy Andersonville. Its certainly A Taste of Heaven. The staff was attentive and welcoming. My delicious coffee never got less than half full in my cup. I ordered the insanely delicious grilled cheese omlete that was eyes roll around in your head good, write home and tell your folks good, rush to . http://Yelp.com.  and write a review good.. u know what I mean. I ordered a side of the chicken sausage which was sage spiced perfectly. The home fries styled potatoes were warm and freshly made and seasoned to perfection. The portions were so massive that I couldnt even finish it all. The entree also came with a wonderful warm fresh green bean/assorted veggie side salad.. wonderful accompaniment. I will be back again and again!! Must try this place if you havent already.
