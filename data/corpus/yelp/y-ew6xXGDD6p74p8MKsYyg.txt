This is a nice place to go to when you're an out-of-towner. I'm from Nor Cal and I've tasted waaaaaay better sushi than this! The food was mediocre and it was a bit pricey. I haven't been to a place where they were actually serving sushi AND having bar service in the middle of the night. I guess the three stars would be for the ambiance, and fast service. Great place for a date...but parking is a bitch.
