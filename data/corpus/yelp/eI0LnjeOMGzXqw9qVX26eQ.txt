I dunno... it is true that I have only eaten here after/during a night of drinking. But each time it has been so absolutely satisfying that I can't help but say "Yay! I'm a fan." I try to order something new or different each time I go (provided my memory is coherent enough to recall what I purchased the previous visit), and so far I have yet to be disappointed. The wait in line can be long sometimes since it can get packed late at night, but I've always gotten my food just a few reasonable minutes after placing my order. . . If you go in expecting some gourmet Mexican food, you are barking up the wrong tree. There are several "upscale" Latin-Mexican eateries in the area. But for what it is, I find Flash Taco to be a pretty darn decent little joint: a good variety--oooh, beef tongue!---of quick, convenient, inexpensive, made-to-order Mexican food and usually a chance to make some new friends while standing in line in the wee hours of the night.
