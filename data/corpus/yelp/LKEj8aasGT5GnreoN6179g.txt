Make sure you try Over Easy whenever you get a chance! I have been here many times and enjoyed every trip. We were just there this past Sunday for Brunch. Arrived at 10am and only had a 20 minute wait. Not bad since I have waited way longer for a table here. The time went by so fast. The Hostess was a hoot and kept everyone entertained and the free Julius Meinl coffee is an added bonus. . . I thoroughly enjoyed the sassy eggs. Over Easy's version of Juevos Rancheros. Very good with a base of red potato hash topped with spicy chorizo, salsa, guacamole, two eggs your way and finished with cheddar cheese, sour cream and a little hot sauce! Whew that's a mouth full and even better every time it hit my mouth. The staff was very attentive and believe me, they were busy as usual. I've never tried their lunch menu but everything I've tried on the breakfast/brunch is delicious. There is only street parking but usually not a problem. Definitely worth the wait!
