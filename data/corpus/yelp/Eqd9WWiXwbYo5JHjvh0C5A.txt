I went here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend and LOVED it!  I Great, sexy date spot.  The restaurant sets a cozy, romantic mood - you enter the wooden, non-descript entrance and are led down dimly lit paths to your very own private dinner booth, with a sheer orange gauzy curtain as an entrance. There's even a mini buzzer in the booths should you need your waiter/waitress!. . We ordered the 8 course omakase (at $50 a bargain for all the food you are getting) and the food did not disappoint.  Even my boyfriend, who is a vegetarian and normally has slim pickins at restaurants was impressed at how good the vegetarian version of the prix fixe was.   Each course was brought out promptly, and there was lots of detail paid into the whole presentation and experience of the meal.  I also liked the fact that afterwards i was satisfied but not disgustingly full.  As far as service, considering the fact you are tucked away in a private booth, the servers have managed to strike the perfect balance of being attentive without being overly annoying.. . I am a fan of this place and highly, highly recommend!
