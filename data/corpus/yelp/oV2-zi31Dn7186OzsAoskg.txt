My friend Derek is a server at this place and I knew I wanted to visit on my trip to Chicago. He said to come in and he'd Â take care of us and boy did he ever. This place is super cute and much larger on the inside than it looks. We sat in a large open room with cute frescoes painted on the walls. Upon ordering D warned us that the portion sizes were HUGE! SO be prepared to take a lot of food home. (We actually had to call for someone to pick us up because we couldn't carry all the food home on the train). . . For starters we split a caprese salad and grilled calamari. Both were excellent. I really enjoyed the squid being grilled and not fried per usual. For my entree I had a seafood soup with a tomato broth, think chippino. The soup had a bit of spice and huge chunks of shrimp, salmon, squid, scallops and bow tie pasta. My boyfriend had the cannelloni of the night with smoked mozzarella and chicken. . . Now by this time the doggie bags were piling up. But hey you have to have dessert D tells us and who are we to argue. I would like a moment of silence before I talk about the chocolate bread pudding which is the size of a football and served in a puddle of caramel sauce. . . My boyfriend declared it the best dessert he had ever eaten. By the time the meal was over we had amassed a gigantic bag filled with left overs to take home. Rose Angelis is a fun place that's perfect for large groups who want to share the large portions. And if you want a great server just ask for Derek!
