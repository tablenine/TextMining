This is one of my favorite restaurants in LA. At one point I was having dinner here at least once a week. . . I get the Pollo Empanisado, which is simply breaded chicken, with the sides of rice, beans and fried plantains. On it's own, it's pretty boring, but if you order a side of their mojo (garlic sauce) and pour it all over everything (including the plantains!) it's fucking AMAZING.. . When my ex and I would go here we'd eat in total silence because we were just way too into shoving every bit down our throats as fast as possible. We'd always leave with one of those "I ate too much" stomachaches, but would be back there as soon as we could.. . I'd also recommend the Cuban sandwhich. Sometimes it can be a little hit or miss, but when they get it right it's the best! The sangria is good too.
