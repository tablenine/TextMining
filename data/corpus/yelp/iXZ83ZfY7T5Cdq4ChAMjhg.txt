Had the bossa nova waffle, a Belgium waffle topped with vanilla bean ice cream and Dulce de leche sauce! Yummmmmy. Fred's has broughten two of my fav things together oh so perfectly: breakfast and dessert! They're open late night but expect delayed service if u show up at 2am, as I did. Not that this would deter me from coming back again next time I'm in LA.
