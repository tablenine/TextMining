It's between 4 and 5.  I would say this is one of the best sushi places in the city.  The fish is fresh and the rolls are spicy and tasty.  . . There are only like 10 tables in the whole restaurant, making for a problem if you go later on in the night.  If you get there around 5:30 or 6, you should be ok.  If you go any later than that, you might be in trouble.. . Overall, Toro Sushi comes highly recommended.
