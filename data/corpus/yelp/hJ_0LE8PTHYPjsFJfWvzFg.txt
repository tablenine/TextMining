Best beer, best turkey avocado sandwich (I don't even like turkey nor sandwiches, except this one!) and best fries.... . this place is perfect for a nice dinner and nice conversation, I love it!. . The staff is great and generally you find all kind of customers eating/drinking. . . It does get crowded, and sometimes the parking gets filled up.
