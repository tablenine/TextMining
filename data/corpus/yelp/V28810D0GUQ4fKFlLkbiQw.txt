wow...our server was kinda bitchy too.  We thought it was just us.  . . It was a Saturday and the place was empty but it took more than ten minutes for her to come and greet us.  When I asked for suggestions she was pretty snarky.  She went and got our drinks and came back a lot nicer and more chatty.  Maybe she had a shot at the bar.. . Anyway, the mac n cheese muffins are delightful.  Get them.
