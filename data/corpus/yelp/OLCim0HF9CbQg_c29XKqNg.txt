ok, Ill go 4 on this, but i wish Yelp would do half stars as well so i could go 4.5. . first, server was GREAT.  made many suggestions, gave us plenty of time to decide and didnt rush us at all.  I believe his name is Jason and i applaud his efforts. . we had two apps.  hamachi sashimi and the shrimp app which they just brought back.  both were very good.. . mushroom salad was great as well. . we had the scallops and the halibut.  both were very very good and well prepared. . had the ice cream desert.  good as well. . here is my thing.  PRICE for what you get.  I really believe that all of the apps are 2-5 dollars to high and all of the entrees are 5-10 dollars to high for what you get served.. . $14 for the hamachi app which had 5 small slivers of fish was a little excessive.  $30 for 5 very small scallops and $28 for a small piece of halibut was a downer.  every entree i looked at could have been much less than it was.  i know we live in downtown so we pay more, but it was kind of over the top. . will i go there again....yes.  the food and service were worth it, but i wish they would take a look in the mirror and realize that they are on the high end of things
