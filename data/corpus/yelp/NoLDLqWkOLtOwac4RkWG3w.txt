I would never go there again.  The Waffle House is better.  The corned beef hash was mushy, gray and disgusting, with less crispiness and browning than it should have.  There was a 2 inch hair sitting neatly on top of the food.  We complained to the cashier about it but he could not have cared less.  The cooks do not always wear hairnets.  . Really gross, and overpriced too!  Really, do yourself a favor and go anywhere else...
