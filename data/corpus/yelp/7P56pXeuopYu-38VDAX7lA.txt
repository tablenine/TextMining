went there with a group of about 10 people, and though the host had called a few nights before to confirm, they told us the prix fixe was no longer happening.  At first they didn't want to work with us, but they eventually came around (not worth losing a tentop, I presume).. I started with a flight of bubblies, and probably because I was at the bar and the place was empty, the very nice bartender was very generous.  Two of the glasses I liked, two not as much, but that happens with flights, and at $15 it was a good deal.  I ordered the tempura green beans which were good but way too salty; the garlic aoli had a citrus tang and was enjoyable.  I also tried the pork rib appetizer with a blood orange bbq sauce, and the meat slid right off the bone and was tasty.  My mahi mahi entry was bland, and there was an odd smell about the dish, perhaps the brussel sprouts.  The best part of that dish were the sweet potatoes.  I wouldn't order that dish again.  I ordered the ganache mousse dessert and they were accomodating of me to sub vanilla ice cream for the oreo mint that was supposed to be in there--and the dessert was fabulous!!!!! (5 stars for the dessert).  There were also these crunchy chocolate "pearls" in the dish, and a hunk of dark ganache on top of the mousse...damn I scarfed it down in about 10 seconds (after 4 glasses of champagne, chocolate was even better than usual!).  The server was nice but damn he pushed the special.  Also, the kitchen was very slow.  I know a table for 10 takes longer, but this took longer than it should have.. I would go back on a Mon or Tues for the $10 flights and to have an app or dessert, but don't think I would bother having the full meal.
