Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Gourmet burgers are just about as common as fast food joints these days. What to expect? Quality meat , great buns, and bursting flavors/toppings.. This place gets 3 1/2 stars.. The Umami burger was good, no complaints there, but the SoCal burger needs more flavor and less grease.. . The sweet potato fries were ok. . Ten bucks each, depending on the mood most may still opt for In N' Out. But worth a try or two...
