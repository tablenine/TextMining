Wow.  This pace has probably the best brunch buffet ever.  Fried chicken, waffle station, omelet station, bagels, lox, biscuits, gravy, mac and cheese, Caesar salad, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.  This place has pretty much everything you could possibly want in one meal.  It's always packed for the brunch so come early!  Or later!  But avoid prime time brunch hours.  You'll probably still have to wait regardless.  They also have a make your own Bloody Mary bucket.  Yum.  I can't drink alcohol since I have an allergy to it but I always am stealing sips from my husband when he gets it.  The price for the meal is beyond reasonable with the selection and quality you get.  I have brought several people here and all have loved it!  It's definite comfort food but wear your expandable waist band pants.  You're expanding belly will thank you.
