ENVIRONMENT. There's a certain expectation of ambience when you're paying $25 or more per entre.  Though I can't put my finger on it, Sola was not quite convincing.  Maybe it was the lack of color.  Maybe it was the t-shirts the waitstaff wore, remeniscent of saturday morning hangovers.  There were also no "cozy" spots to be had.  Everywhere feels like you're in the middle of the place.. . FOOD. Qual Tempura was well worth the trip.  Though serving them bone-in forced me to eat with my fingers.  My wife's soup of the day was splendid, and her short ribs were fantastic.  The lamb special was not satisfactory, being void of flavor and of fatty texture.  For dessert, the best chocolate cake I've ever had.. . SERVICE. The waitstaff (despite the overcasual uniforms) have an encyclopedic knowledge of the menu.  If I didn't know better, I'd say they were cooking it themselves.  Friendly, knowledgeable, accomodating, fast, and of good taste.. . At the end of the night, I left satisfied but slightly underwhelmed.  4 stars in lieu of a 3.5 option.
