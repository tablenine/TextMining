Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I think I gained 10lbs from eating here. . This is a very popular restaurant. I heard so many people talk about this place, so I finally tried it out. The hype is right. They have good chicken and waffles. . . Honestly, I've never had chicken and waffles before, so have nothing to compare it too. I think what makes this dish so good is the gravy. It's finger licking good. My sister and I each got our own, next time we're going to share. It was huge. I couldn't finish it. My brother got a Breast sandwich. The french fries were really good. I don't recommend getting the biscuit. It's too oily and soft, not flaky. . . There is parking, but it can fill up quickly. . . Service was very odd. No one came to our table for 10 minutes. Then the waitress came, but she only checked up on us once after we ordered. Our water wasn't refilled. Honestly, it looked like a bunch of people were standing around doing nothing. The restaurant was not busy when we went. . . Overall, I would recommend this place for the food.
