Food - Cured meats (copa and speck) and cheese (petite basque) were fine but not as spectacular like at Mozza.  Beef cheeks were cooked to great tenderness much like a good pot roast - obviating the need for a knife.  However, it could have used some more seasoning to balance out the soft gelatinous texture.. . Service - Not as bad as some reviews make it out to be ... at least not for me.  The waiter brought us someone else's cured meats and I took a piece before he realized his error.  It didn't seem like he replaced the slice before sending it to its rightful owner.. . Atmosphere - Enjoyable dining outdoors except for the fire engine roaring down the main street.  Lots of foot traffic and people watching opportunities even late in the evening.. . Overall - With a very creative menu, this is a good place to try if you're looking for something different like braised rabbit or calves liver.  In terms of execution there is definitely room for improvement.  It may also be considered a bit pricey considering that the items described above averaged out to about $30 a head.. .
