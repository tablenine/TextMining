Beware of eating at the Griddle. Why, you may ask??? Because after you have any of the pancakes here, any other pancakes you have will taste like garbage. Yup, that's how good the pancakes are. The pancakes come stuffed with just about anything you can think of, possibly even crack, since they can be so addicting.. . The other awesome thing about the Griddle is that they can care less about your health and life, considering  that eating these pancakes gets you closer to diabetes after each bite. This is without a doubt, one of the best, most delicious, slow deaths you can have. I've probably tried at least half of the pancakes on the menu, and have yet to be disappointed. Banana nana, Scotch on the Rocks, Golden Ticket, and Teacher's Pet are some of my usual picks. And not that everyone else providing reviews hasn't already mentioned it, but the pancakes GINOurmous! So make sure you order a full stack on your first visit. You won't regret it... . The reason for the four stars is due to the MINIMUM 35 minute wait, the small tables and bumping elbows if you sit in the isle, and the occasional bitter server that is hating life because he just can't get that part in a Hollywood movie. Otherwise, staff is mad cool and attentive, despite how busy they are. And asides from the pancakes, waffles and french toast, I have really been too impressed with their other breakfast or lunch plates.. . For those who are easily star struck, it's pretty common to catch a celebrity gorging on pancakes, looking hungover as hell (I won't throw any names out).... . Overall, I can't imagine having a better pancake than anything the Griddle can throw at me. This is definitely a must for your  "before I die" to-do list. Actually, going here will actually require you to get things done on that list much quicker, so keep that in mind.
