I just got back from a delicious brunch with my wife at Wishbone. There were a lot of people who seemed like they were waiting for a table outside, but when we walked up to the hostess we were able to get in without waiting.. . She had an andouille sausage omelette with potatoes and a cornbread muffin, all of which were great. I had the corn cakes with sausage patties and eggs. The eggs may have been a touch runny, but I think this ranks up there among the best brunches we've had in Chicago. The sausage in both dishes was a surprise hit - could be the best sausage among those brunches.. . I also had a Jamaican coffee, which includes rum and kahlua. That was strong but delicious. My wife's bellini had pucker in it, so if you don't like pucker stay away from that one. The service was fast, friendly, and attentive, and the art inside is a lot of fun.
