This is my first review. I'm a connoisseur of delicatessens and fine Jewish food, especially quality pastrami. From Amer's in Ann Arbor, to Katz and Carnegie Deli in NYC, I have had many of the most delicious or popular deli sandwiches around.. . I had the pastrami reuben, on challah bread, to go. The order service was quick, the food preparation was moderately slow, and the payment was moderately slow.. . The reuben came with house fries, which were nothing special. They were slightly soggy, lukewarm, not salty enough, and just very boring and detracting from the meal.. . The reuben itself was presented very well. It was open faced and cut into 4 pieces. There was a healthy serving of melted swiss cheese, not enough sauerkraut, a moderate amount of pastrami meat, and not enough Russian dressing/thousand island. . . The cheese was topped with some paprika powder (I don't know why). Usually a healthy helping of cheese is indicative of average quality pastrami. This was certainly the case here. The pastrami was non-eventful. It wasn't bad, but neither was it briny, juicy, and fatty. The pastrami was better than average, but nothing to excite yourselves over. finally, the challah bread was very good. They toasted the challeh, and it was light and eggy. I am not sure if standard jewish delis make their own challah or not.. . Finally, this was a very expensive dinner. I don't mind paying 10-15-20 for a pastrami reuben since Jewish delis tend to charge excessive prices (I wonder why), but the portion size of the sandwhich was small, and the amount of pastrami was just moderate. $13!. . Conclusion, would I go back? Sure, if am nearby, and very hungry for a pastrami reuben, I can see myself eating there again. But I would not travel to eat there.
