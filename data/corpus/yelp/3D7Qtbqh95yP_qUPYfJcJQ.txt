Yummy and cheap. Great place to grub when you are hungry and it is late at night. The place is open until the wee hours of the morning. I tried the spicy soup noodles with flat rice wide noodles, fried catfish with spicy sauce and basil, and green curry with chicken. The catfish was a tad on the dry side, and it would have been nice to have eggplant in the curry; but all else was fantastic. Three dishes, rice and two drinks was under $30. . . Will be back!!
