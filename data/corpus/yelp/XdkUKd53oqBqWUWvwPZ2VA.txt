Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
I used to live about a half-block away from this place.  So, when I told people where I lived, they would get really excited and ask me if I went to Hamburger Mary's all the time.  You could see the scenario playing out in their heads when they asked, like a thought balloon in a comic strip.  They were thinking, "I could wander down here some night and we could all get together for hamburgers and drinks and karaoke and stuff!". . That's when I would lower the boom.  This place ain't so great.  Invariably, they stared at me with a sort of wounded look, the kind of look someone in a movie flashes when they've just been shot in the torso by a trusted friend who was double-crossing them all along.. . OK, if I'm being honest, I sort of enjoyed dashing their dreams.  But really, I just saved them two hours of frustration and marginally edible food.  Woe to those who pop in expecting food in a timely fashion or anything close to decent service.  And woe to those who think that the sign out front saying the place will be open at 10:30am is anything more than an approximation, a suggestion of when the hungover staff will actually open the doors and deign to serve you breakfast.. . I really don't know how this place got a reputation for having good hamburgers.  The fact is--as someone who has eaten at other HMs--you're honestly better off at McDonalds or Burger King.  You can get the same standoffish attitude and mystery meat for a quarter of the price.  . . Hamburger Mary's, I say "Meh" to you.
