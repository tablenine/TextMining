Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I've been going to Orochan for years. If you're a fan of gyoza's...I suggest you don't get them here. They always have a taste of windex on them. I don't know why.. however, the ramen is good. It's not as good as Daikokuya's but it's decent. I come here for the ex spicy ramen challenge. I haven't been able to complete it.. but I will never stop trying till I do! I want my picture on the board!
