Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Great chicken and great waffles can lead to a very full belly.  My first experience of the mystical combination of chicken and waffles was a good one.  I like the down to earth approach at Roscoe's .  It's a place about serving good food to the people.
