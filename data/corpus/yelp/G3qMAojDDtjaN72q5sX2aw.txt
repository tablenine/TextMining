My favorite Taiwanese Deli!!!! Yes, it's the only decent Taiwanese eateries in the Souther California. I like their shaved ice, susuage, oyster pancake and some other traditional twnese dishes.  But be prepare to wait at least 20 mins.  We had a big group last night for 14, and it took them like 20 mins to get our table ready.  This place is crazy almost any time of the day and week and during summer, people are here for their shaved ice.  You can select up to 5 items for the price of $5, which is pretty cheap compare with many places, and the syrup they use on the shave iced is so called "Red Sugar" in Taiwan, which require cooking and it has this special flavor that makes the shave ice taste even more delicious.  Oh, I heart those shaved ice especially during hot days, and I wish they are just right next door but when I'm really craving for it, I think it's still worth 40 mins drive to Sinbala for their shaved ice.
