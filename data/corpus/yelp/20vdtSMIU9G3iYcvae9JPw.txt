Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Heart Attack city... but worth every moment of it.. . Mastro's has great service and a huge selection of meat. Top notch food and top notch service means top notch prices.. . To be honest, I am not a huge steakhouse fan, however Mastros does deliver in the portion department. Our party ordered:. . *Buffalo Mozzarella and Beefsteak Tomatoes- I have had better.. . *Crab Cakes- delicious. Not a lot of breading, very fresh lump crab meat. This is definitely one of the best dishes here. . *Oysters on the half shell. Delicious. Our waiter said the horseradish on a scale from 1-10 was a 20- I beg to differ.  I think he was just weak sauce.  I don't even like Oysters however these were delicious. . *Crab stuffed Mushrooms- delicious and rich and heavy. . * Prime Rib- aka the Brontosaurus Cut. Seriously some gynormous meat here.. . * Bone in Rib-Eye was very marbleized with fat however each cut was just delicious.. . *Wasabi Mashed Potatoes- very rich with a huge kick. Loved it. . *Creamed corn was too creamy for me. I didn't like it at all.. . *Sauteed Mushrooms- again not a stellar side dish. Very ordinary. . *Asparagus- cooked perfectly and delicious. Loved them!. . *Chocolate Cake with a pound of whipped cream on the side. The chocolate was seriously out of control. Rich, decadent and outrageously good with the cream.. . Overall, great meal however my medium rare rib eye was more like medium well which annoyed me.  When paying for such a great place, such a shame where they don't know how to prepare your meat correctly.  Music and ambiance was good however very loud with the music. Most of the time I was just smiling and nodding at dinner.. . I really enjoyed the pretzel bread in the bread basket btw.. . I'd come again, but more like a once a year or two type of place and be prepared to pay a hefty chunk of change.
