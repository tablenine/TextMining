Category: Sandwiches
Delicious french dip! What's different about Philippe's is that the au jus is put on the inside of the roll before they add the meat. This way you don't dip the sandwich into anything and there's a lot less mess. For those concerned that this might make the sandwich soggy, fear not! The bread's outside stays deliciously crispy.. . Bring cash, and order at the counter. The lines toward the middle are generally shorter because I guess people just pick the first one they walk into.. . The chili is a little too greasy for my taste, but one sandwich usually fills me up with no need for side dishes. . . Be warned, is usually totally packed before a Laker's game (or any event at Staples).
