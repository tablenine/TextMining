Not a lover of beef, but found myself here for a late night snack with a hot man friend. Beer and sweet potato fries hit the spot, even if I did have to pick a brew by closing my eyes, swirling my finger around and pointing. It may not be on the top of my list, but I'd go back just to try a few more of those taps.
