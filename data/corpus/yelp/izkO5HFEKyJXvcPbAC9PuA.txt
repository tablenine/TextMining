Restaurant: Pylos
Category: Greek
I could give Pylos 5 stars on atmosphere and decor alone. The ceiling of clay pots leads through a rustic, yet cozy space. It's the perfect place for a lunch or dinner date - there's absolutely no pressure. I always hate that kind of pressure that people around you are watching every mishap of dining etiquette you make. There's a very relaxed and comfortable air to this place, and the waiters are friendly and will help if you have trouble deciding what to order.. . I haven't been to Greece or tried a lot of Greek restaurants, which needs to be fixed asap, but I know for a fact that Pylos is doing everything right. On my latest visit, my table started out with poikilia: pita with tzatzaki sauce, an eggplant dip, and another roe dip that had a lemony bite. They were all delicious of course but I would have to say my favorite appetizer here is the spanakopita during lunch. This is one appetizer you can't mess up. Simple but delectable: baked spinach and feta in phyllo dough. Spanakopita is one of my favorite things to eat and its done perfectly here. . . For some reason, I tend to order the pastitsio every time for dinner. I don't know how anyone could not like it. Pasta with meat sauce with a thick bechamel layer on top with cheese and baked to a nice golden brown. Sometimes I just want to eat the sprig of rosemary that garnishes the dish just because I don't want to see anything left on the plate. When I see my pastitsio being brought from the kitchen I always jump from my seat in joy. . . Always an amazing dining experience and I definitely recommend this place. Even if you never had Greek food before, this is the perfect place to start.
