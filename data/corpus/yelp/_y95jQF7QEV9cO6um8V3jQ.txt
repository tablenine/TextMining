I have one word: BACON!!!! . . This has to be the best bacon in L.A.  The bacon deserves 5 stars but overall a high 4 stars.. The squash blossom quesadilla is YUMMY too.. . This is a great place to have breakfast/lunch.  I am always in the mood to hang out here.  Service is good, lattes are good, and food is super, great comfort food.
