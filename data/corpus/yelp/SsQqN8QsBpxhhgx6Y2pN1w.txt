Restaurant: Flying Biscuit Midtown
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I will never understand why people line up on the weekends to eat at this place.  Living nearby, I see the lines and just shake my head and laugh at the poor, misguided souls that choose to spend time hanging out on Piedmont Ave, waiting for rock hard, too-dense biscuits, lame chicken sausage and indifferent service.. . I will cop to having one or two decent meals there over the years, but I went during the week for breakfast, and I find the simpler, the better.  Eggs and grits and coffee, and that's about it for me.. . I'm happy to leave The Flying Biscuit to those to adore it.  More room for me at the other great breakfast places in town.
