I've eaten quite a few times. I eat the Pork Chow Mein without any veggies. Only the meat and chicken. The egg rolls are the best that i've ever eaten. Very clean place to eat. The employees are attentive even during very busy lunch times and dinner time. Love this place. I could eat here 3 times a week.
