I do have to go back here so I can hopefully up my stars on this place. I was adventurous and tried the penne mattina and I think I won't be so adventurous next time. Penne mixed with eggs was interesting, but once i scraped it aside, I was able to enjoy the sun-dried tomatoes with it. Fruit was fresh and service was cool. My friend had an omellete that I wanted to steal. He gobbled that up and was full for hours.
