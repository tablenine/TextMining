Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
This place makes me happy like I'm 10 years old and it's my birthday wrapped in Christmas. First off, this is one of 3 places where I will eat the eggs. The NY Breakfast sandwich is just delicious, no fancy adjectives, it's just amazing. Joan herself is one the nicest business owners I have the pleasure of meeting, she is a delight and it's shows in her establishment. I tell you anything you get will be FANBLOODYTASTIC. Get the Turkey Meatloaf sandwich order it fresh and you will know bliss. Get a cheese plate and you will get an education in the finest fromage. Get a cupcake and you smile all day. Have a harvest cookie, it's awesome! You're welcome. You can also occasionally be almost trampled by paps if Sharon Stone or Tom Cruise pop by, so that's a plus.
