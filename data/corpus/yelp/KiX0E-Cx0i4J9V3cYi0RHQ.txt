yay! no collard greens on the menu. that's all i ever wanted. the barbecue is great - the last time i was there, i had pulled pork and it was succulent and i just looove those sauces on the table. service was snappy, despite how packed it was, and they reliably called us at the bar next door when we went there to wait.. . so, sorry that the old collards made me cranky. i'm a fan again.
