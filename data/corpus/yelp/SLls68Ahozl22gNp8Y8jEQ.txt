Good food, great ambience, bad service, super pricey... A total mixed bag if you ask me. Food is good, tasty and light, nice menu selections, some great, some OK. Service is horrid, always very late to seat you, even with reservation, and I hope you like where they seat you since it is like climbing Everest to change you seats. Food arrives late and portions are fairly small. Some seats are not comfortable and most times you are touching elbows with the French guy sitting next to you (This could be actually fun). The price is usually high to very, very high. I guess OK for a very special occasion, but forget it for just having dinner.
