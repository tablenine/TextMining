Very tasty food, lovely decor, and good enough service. We chose this spot to celebrate my boyfriend's dad's birthday and as a lamb lover, he was in heaven. Here's how it went down:. - Rabbit and Eggplant Tatin: too gamey for me but the tatin element was buttery goodness. - Hazelnut crusted fois gras "au Torchon": I can't believe I am going to say this but there IS such a thing as too rich, and this is it. It's cold which threw me off and it was just SO creamy. Too creamy. I know, crazy.. - Heirloom Tomato special app: tasty but nothing special. Entree standouts:. - Couscous royale - Pretty damn amazing. The lamb stew component was tender, flavorful, out of this world. - Lamb Shank Special - Falling off the bone goodness. Nuff said.. - Blackberry cobbler dessert was de-vine. . Next time I am going to the little next door and taking all the goodies home to gorge
