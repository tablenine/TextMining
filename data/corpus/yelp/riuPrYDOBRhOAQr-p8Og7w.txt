For the food &amp; atmosphere, I would give it 5 stars. However, although the price was reasonable for an upscale restaurant in Beverly Hills, I feel like I could have gotten something similar (food-wise) for much, much less than $60pp.  The service was also lacking.  I came here with my bf &amp; 2 of our friends &amp; even though we had reservations, we still had to wait close to an hour.  This was almost a deal breaker but we just sucked it up &amp; enjoyed ourselves at the bar.  When we were finally seated, I got the tiger prawns &amp; garlic noodles. The prawns had a hint of coconut &amp; since I don't like coconut I was lucky enough to get my bf to trade his lobster for my prawns.  They weren't terrible, I just don't like coconut &amp; it wasn't in the description.  The lobster was DELICIOUS...garlicky, buttery, cooked just right.. &amp; the garlic noodles are amazing. I think if I were to ever go back, I'd try the cracked crab.  Overall, the food was great, atmosphere was great, price was decent, but service was slow.
