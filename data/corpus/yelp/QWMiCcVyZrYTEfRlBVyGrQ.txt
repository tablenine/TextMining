Yum! We order take out once a week from here and it is always delicious! My boyfriend and I are vegetarian so he gets the Kung Pao Tofu and I get the Asparagus &amp; Shitake mushroom side with added tofu (it is big enough for a meal even though they call it a side dish). This is one of our favorite places and you just can't go wrong! We literally order once a week and haven't had a bad meal yet- that seems hard to do with most restaurants.
