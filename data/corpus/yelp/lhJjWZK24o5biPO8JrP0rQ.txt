Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
Two words: Boo Ya . . This is the best damn BBQ I've had in a long time. The sauce was tangy and the chicken and ribs were amazing. The chicken was soft and juicy and the ribs just fell off the bone. Oh and don't you dare forget to order sides of slaw and baked beans. Damn good.  . . This place is a bit of a hole in the wall, but apparently it's well known in the vicinity. It opened at 2pm on Sunday and there was a line at the door before they opened up. Oh hot tip: they now take credit cards (another yelper said cash only, but they just changed their policy). On some nights it looks like they have live blues, I didn't get to check that out, but they had some good stuff playing on radio. . . If you're ever in Hot-lanta near Emory give this place a go!
