First off- holy crap are the portions here gibungous.  I was here over the weekend with a party of three, and we ordered an udon bowl, teriyaki chicken, and short ribs, and any of those probably could've fed all three of us with leftovers.  The food is also inexpensive, and quite tasty.  The best thing we ate was probably our appetizer- a duck egg roll plate.. . I wasn't so crazy about the non-food part of eating here.  The restaurant was supercrowded, and service was slow.  The chairs were uncomfortable (made of metal) which was not cool.  Also, the menu was overwhelming in the way it was laid out.. . I would certainly go back here again for the food, but the rest of the dining experience was sub par.
