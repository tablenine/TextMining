I like the sandwich with the baguette the best but they changed the menu but they sell the baguettes for a few dollars. The fruit tarts are amazing, they have them 80 per cent of the time. I really like that there is a bakery near me in Midtown. Staff is friendly but I think when they first opened they were disorganized and messed up 3 out of 4 to go orders in different ways. So check your order before you leave. Other than that, you need to try this place, the prices are good!
