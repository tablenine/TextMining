Restaurant: Gato Bizco Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This place has made it onto my frequent brunch list.  I absolutely love my Sunday brunches at Gato Bizco.  First of all, it's waaaaaay better than waiting in line for forever across the street at Flying Biscuit.  Second, you'll get a better meal for your money than at Flying Biscuit.  Third, it hasn't gone corporate like Flying Biscuit and you'll actually SEE the owner in there every single day.  The place has got tons of charm, it's covered in cat icons, toys, pictures, etc.  The staff is pretty friendly and like I said before, always nice to have a conversation with the restaurant owner at the end of your meal.  Lots of wonderful little specialties on the menu too - like the sweet potato pancakes, and the huevos rancheros (which are one of the best huevos I've had in the South).  I personally enjoy the Paris Texas Toast with a side of bacon.  The price tag is not bad either.  This is one of those places that I take out-of-towners so that they can get a good feel for a real "Down home" establishment.  Check it out - and don't waste your time at Flying Biscuit.
