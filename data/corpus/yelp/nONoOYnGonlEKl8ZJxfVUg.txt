Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Planned a romantical date with my best friend Sayuri during DineLA week, and didn't really know where to go. Seeing as my nickname as a little girl was "T-Bone" due to my affinity for red meat, Fogo de Chao seemed like a match made in heaven. Not much else to say that hasn't already been said except starve yourself beforehand, layoff the salad bar, eat at least 2 of the cheesy bread rolls (because they are awesome), and be careful when you drive home if you tend to suffer from food coma, as I had a hardtime staying up midway through the meal. :)
