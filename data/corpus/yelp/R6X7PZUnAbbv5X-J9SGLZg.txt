Eaten here before and have had a great time, fish wass fresh and the service was on point.. . Cue tonight.. . Wow, ridiculously ineffective sushi chefs (2 were in front of us rolling sushi like is a slow motion sport - while also forgetting orders and not being attentive to our party of 2 or the party of 2 to the right of us) and atrocious wait staff.. . Our server wouldn't look us in the eyes at all nor would she address us directly - a request to opt for Sushi Rice in a bowl rather than regular steamed rice was shot down with a resounding NO.  Now I'm not that fragile of an individual and a simple "I'm sorry but no" would have been fine - but the barking wasn't exactly making the meal any more fun on top of the existing service.. . Chalk that up along with continued lapses of service (at this point we'll call that their par for the course) and we left with the most meager of tips, and on second thought, even a dollar would have been too much of a tip.  . . The recap - . . Horrible service, you want fresh fish and great service - Sakura on Centinela is ridiculous and you'll love it, or Kaya on Washington for innovative rolls with incredible taste and A+ service.
