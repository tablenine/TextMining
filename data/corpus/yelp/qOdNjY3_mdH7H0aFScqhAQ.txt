This place has the best Cuban food around (and I've tried many places). The portions are BIG and very affordable (especially for lunch). First timers, go for the Garlic Chicken (juicy &amp; savory) only down side is your breath will be killer all day. For those who like to venture out in the menu try the Oxtail, soo yummy. Also my favorite Cuban drink is a soda called "materva" it's made from a plant and taste like apple cider (TRY IT!!). Hope you guys like it as much as I do....5 stars from me.
