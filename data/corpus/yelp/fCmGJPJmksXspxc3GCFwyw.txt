Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
Very comfortable envirnoment to have dinner in. The atmosphere was great. The service was wonderful. The waitress had the best balance of knowing when to come over to the table and ask how dinner was. She wasnt too push but didn't forget to visit either. She allowed us to talk with out interupting the conversation. Just awesome balance. Additionally she never allowed our beverages to get empty.. . The food was very good as well. I strongly reccomend the seasonal pear salad which was just amazing.. . The salmon was also prepared and taste just amazing..... . Overall it was a great experience and a even better atmosphere. If you are all about the service and being then I strongly recommend Roy's.. . It would make the perfect 1st date restaurant......
