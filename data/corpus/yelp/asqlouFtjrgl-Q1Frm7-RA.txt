Awesome meal, good service. The service wasn't top notch, but it's a small place and it was packed with people. I fear this place will become packed on a regular basis. The waitress recommended the skirt steak special with cactus and it was phenomenal! Really unique. There was also a very entertaining roving mariachi who played some songs for us. The guacamole and salsas were outstanding. Everything was very reasonably priced.
