I've been to the Yardhouse several times in this location and here's my 2 cent on this joint. . Pro: Great draft beer selections (50-70 varieties I believe) plus the half-yard cup. People fought? so much with "yard cup" that they had to replace with smaller version of it.. . Con: Loud metal rock noise (maybe they can mix up some music like hip hop and R&amp;B) Â you can't really have good conversation with your buddies when music is cranking up it's almost bad as having conversation inside of club. If you are younger crowd, try different places as regulars are between mid 30s. Appetizers are OK but little too pricey. Don't try to eat dinner here, you can dine in at better place nearby.
