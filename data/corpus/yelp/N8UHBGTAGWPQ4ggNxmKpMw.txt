Restaurant: Spring Restaurant
Category: American (New)
It's hard for me to find a restaurant that I want to return to again and again because there are so many in Chicago that it's rather difficult to be a "regular" somewhere.  But at Spring, I think it would be easy to fall in love with the place.  The service, ambience, and food are amazing.. . The ambience is quiet zen, with frosted glass, warm wood, and soft lighting, creating a romantic atmosphere.  It's spacious, so patrons aren't rubbing elbows with one another, creating an area perfect for a bit of privacy during conversations.. . Service is top-notch.  Glasses are filled before it's empty.  Dirty plates are cleared away immediately.  Bread crumbs are swiped away with more slices to fill empty plates.  And the courses are brought out in a timely, well-paced manner.. . And the food!  When I say that this is one of the best seafood dishes I've had, I don't mean just seafood in Chicago.  This is definitely one of the best seafood dishes I've had in the world.  Shawn McClain knew what he was doing when he decided to open Spring.  And it makes sense that he would open a second branch in Paris, France.  Lucky for us Chicagoans, we can book a few days in advance; Spring is booked for months over in Paris!. . Kushi oysters were fresh, with a delicately briny flavor.  Maine sea scallops were cooked just right, not rubbery at all.  And the scallops weren't too salty, but had a clean, fresh flavor; sweet soy didn't mask the taste of the scallops.  My friend had the barramundi, which she thoroughly enjoyed.. . The meal totaled just under $120, including a bottle of wine, for two people.  Considering the quality of the meal, the impeccable service, and wonderful ambience, it was worth it.
