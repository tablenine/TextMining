I think this place is super cute. I love chicken and waffles. Â But what made this dish stand out for me was the spicy chile sauce that came with the syrup. There's something about mixing spicy with sweet that I love.. . I love "kitchy" places like this. Service was pretty fast and I would totally come back to try the other retro items on the menu.
