I think this place would be great for drinking and eating small dishes.. . The food is lackluster despite the creatively gay-themed names.  I liked the decor: campy, loud, funny.  . . How convenient, though, to meet your friends for drinks/food and then go upstairs to stand around a small bar and see an occasional drag show; however, why go upstairs? . .    This place is for tourists.
