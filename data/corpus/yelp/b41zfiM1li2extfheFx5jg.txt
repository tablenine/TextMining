It's good but can be REALLY hit or miss. DONT go drunk, you'll probably get the worst thing there off a whim. . . ALWAYS make sure you think about the ingredients, I know it sounds basic but I've gone with people who thought it would be more pizza like but there was nothing pizza like in it. . . I definetly suggest you at least try it out.
