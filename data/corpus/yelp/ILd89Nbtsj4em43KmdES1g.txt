Get ready to get down and dirty for some delicious seafood!. . No, they're not known for the crab as much as they are known for the shrimp. We got a pound of the whole shebang extra spicy shrimp. It was damn spicy, but oh so good the you just can't stop! My nose kept running and I tried to wipe it without getting the scrumptious oily, red, garlic filled sauce on my face, which was quite a challenge as my hands were covered with it. The shrimps were nice, big, and plump. The corn was really good and the sweet potato fries helped settle some of the oily sauce from the shrimp in my stomach.. . Downside is the loooong wait. We went on a Saturday afternoon and still had to wait at least an hour. It's worth it though! I wish they had something this good in SF!
