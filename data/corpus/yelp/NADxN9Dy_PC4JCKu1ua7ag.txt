I loved it!. . Great selection of sausages and beers and drinks.  What could be bad?. . They have standard sausages if that's what you want, or very exotic sausages with different mixed meats.. . Also, a great selection of beers and gourmet sodas.. . Much larger looking inside then outside.. . Expect a line on a weekend.
