I've eaten here a number of times, and recommend it.   I really love how innovative the menu is.  Not your cliche' tex-mex enchilladas!!  Rather, they offer creative, fresh, and tasty fare!!  Here's an example:  I ordered an appetizer, consisting of four sweet masa cups each filled with a different mexican filling:  shimp and tomatoes, plantain, sausage, and mushroom/veggie.  Outstanding!!   Other dishes I've had were equally innovative and tasty.  The tableside guacamole was a bit too salty for my taste, but I trust other yelpers' opinions that it's good.
