Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
If I had to choose one word with which to sum up "Flo", it would probably be: FRESH. As in FRESH, FRESHingredients. Like, so FRESHthat you figure it all got growed and/or killed in the back while you were waiting. . . The nachos appetizer: FRESH. FRESHY fried tortilla chips topped with FRESH black beans, FRESH corn, FRESH pico de gallo, and FRESH cheese. . . The carnitas tacos: slow-roasted pork that is savory as hell, combined with FRESH, FRESH toppings and tortillas and served with FRESH salsa. The garlic spinach side tasted FRESH too.. . The Flo bowl: a FRESH-ass take on paella, smoky and savory.. . The mojito: the mint leaves almost TOO FRESH, so potent they were.. . The espresso flan: A surprisingly delicate espresso flavor in perfect balance with the custard and caramel. Topped with FRESH strawberries.. . I can't explain why everything tasted so FRESH to me. It felt almost cleansing to eat at Flo. It felt like plopping down in the middle of a garden and just pulling stuff out of the ground to eat it.. . I can't give it five stars because nothing blew my mind. Everything tasted really good but nothing was off-the-charts novel. Except how FRESH everything was.. . Whoa - I repeated FRESH so much that the word seems weird and meaningless to me now. Did you ever do that? FRESH FRESH FRESH FRESH FRESH. Far out.
