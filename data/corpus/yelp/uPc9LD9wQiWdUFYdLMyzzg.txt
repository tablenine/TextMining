Restaurant: Lil&#39; Frankie&#39;s
Category: Pizza
Lil Frankie's is really cute inside, a nice Italian atmosphere.  Our waiter was great and didn't chit chat but was always on top of things, so it was a very enjoyable experience.  It seemed pretty pricey for two people though - 80 bucks - although we did have like 7 beers between the two of us so maybe that adds up.  But thinking back, we ordered ravioli and gnocchi and they were both on the specials board and that was it, so yeah, it was pretty expensive for what we got.  Plus I had to run across the street for cash because they don't accept cards.  I'll go back if I'm in the area but wouldn't make a point of going there.
