Mmmm all the taste of meat without the guilt.  I'm a carnivore.  Let's get that straight and out of the way.  I love me some meat.  So the idea of veggie everything didn't get my tummy all excited.. . I ordered the Chill Out Wings for my starter and a Santa Fe Crispy Chickin' sandwich with a side of the spring mix salad and spicy vegan mayo for my lunch.  I know I sound like a heffer, but I was splitting it all with my roommate.  The whole meal was about $20 which wasn't too bad for the amount we got.. . The wings were pretty good.  I wasn't a fan of the BBQ dipping sauce because the spicy mayo was just TOO GOOD not to dip into.  The sandwich was great too.  Of course I still smothered it with the mayo sauce, but even without the sauce it was still good.  The side salad was pretty fancy and tasty.. . My other roomy got the Portobello sandwich.  SO GOOD.  I'm definitely getting that next time.  My mouth is watering right now. . . Who knew a hard core meat eater like me would love a place like this?  I can honestly say I wouldn't mind eating here everyday.  My arteries would probably thank me.. . NOTE: I wasn't a fan of was the tea.  I would go for the lemonade.
