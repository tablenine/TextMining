If you had only one reason to try this place ladies &amp; gentlemen...you'd spell it  S-W-I-R-L...a strong frozen mix of margarita &amp; sangria goodness. . . I'm not even a huge Mexican food fan but the perfectly-seasoned flautas &amp; rice are just yummy..ask for some warm queso on the side.  And if you're like me,  there is a black hole in my stomach where the endless homemade tortilla chips &amp; salsa disappear to...love it!  TMI?  probably.. . The atmosphere is homey &amp; open &amp; there's usually a little wait...
