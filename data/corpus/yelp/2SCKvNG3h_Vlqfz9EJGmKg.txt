Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Oh yum.  I get hungry just thinking about Jerry's.. . Yes, they have a hundred different sandwhiches and with all of the build it yourself options, the permutations are endless . . . but I somehow get the same one every single time I go . . .  Sigh.  I'm so predictable.. . p.s. the hostess IS rude (whoever said that in an earlier review is right).  However, whenever we go, we sit outside with our doggies and they bring them dishes of water so that makes up for any poor service in my book.
