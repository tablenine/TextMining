Came here on a recommendation from a native New Yorker.  This place is a solid burger joint.  When we arrived, the place was empty, but once the Jets playoff game started it was jam packed and loud.. . Had the Buffalo Burger and the Filet Mignon Burger.  Buffalo was interesting, a bit too gamy for a burger, but I'm glad I've tried buffalo now.  Good tastes all around and the fries were excellent.. . Was a bit surprised that there are no free refills for sodas.  Guess that's a NY thing.. . I'll come again next time I'm in New York.
