Shabu Shabu is kinda tricky because you are paying a lot of money for paper thin slices of meat, about $2 worth of cut up vegetables, boiling pot of water, and OH WAIT... you cook it yourself. I guess that is the novelty of Shabu Shabu... well in any case, whatever you do, you must try Shabu Shabu House located in Jtown Village. So freaking good. You know if there is a wait, it's gonna be goood.. . What makes it so good? The price is extremely reasonable compared to the other Shabu places around LA. The meat isn't as fatty as some other places I have had. Also... something about their dipping sauce, perhaps it is laced with cocaine or crack, but it is absolutely delicious. It looks helllla ghetto inside but who cares, just get in, do your business, siwsh your meat around in some water and gulp it down with these crazy good sauce. . . I give the sauce 5 stars.
