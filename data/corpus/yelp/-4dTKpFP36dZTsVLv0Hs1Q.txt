Restaurant: Fontaine&#39;s Oyster House
Category: Seafood
This New England style oyster bar will make a fisherman of us all through both hearty seafood stews and pints of the old brews!. . Weekly specials! Check the website! It's either $2 pints on Sunday or all you can eat shrimp on Tuesday. Maybe it'll spark a craving for bottomless oysters. And for a bar, this place has amazing seafood, the fisherman's stew is delicious and the seasoned salmon is a healthy choice when paired with a Heineken. . . The dcor is that of a fisherman's ship. It's has a very old rustic appeal to it, full of brass objects and anchors as well as little memorable pictures and objects - nothing cheesy. The bar stretches along the far right wall and is sure to be filled with the likes of the regulars on weeknights and newbie's on the weekends. . . So if you're like me, you've probably driven past this corner restaurant thousands of times never taking notice to this place. But inside these chipped doors and smudgy windows, lies great seafood and refreshing beer in a bar that offers plenty of character and charm.
