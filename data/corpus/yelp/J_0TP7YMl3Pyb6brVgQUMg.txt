Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
Still rock solid.. . There is always a little bit of trepidation in returning to your favorite restaurant to try that favorite dish - "what if they mess it up this time?" - Mozza came through.. . The reservation is still difficult to make, at least via OpenTable - My mom was visiting, and I think I reserved two wks in advance?  . . We ordered:. - Octopus with celery and lemon. - Burricotta with braised artichoke, currants, etc.. - Squid Ink Maccheroni alla chitarra freddi (cold) with crab, uni, and jalapeno. - Grilled orata (again). . The octopus was braised - and I don't know how but it was so tender.  Must've been a low fire braising.  I don't even care.  It was so tender and fleshy at the same time.  The burricotta was okay.  We liked the maccheroni (square spaghetti) too, although I've had better fresh pasta, and my orata - oh my orata - it still stood to be my favorite fish dish in town.  Fresh, easy, delicious.  Thank you, chef, you are amazing.. . I'd dock a point for the service or lack there of - the snootiness and the flash by and away by one particular waiter that served us last night - but now I just know what waiter to avoid.  The service there can be a little pushy esp towards desserts.  I wouldn't take off a star just for that, though - don't get pushed around, and know what waitstaff you like/dislike.. . $8.50 for valet but there are a few meters around, and parking's free on the street on Sunday :)
