Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Not Korean?  Not a problem!  . . Usually you need a Korean to help you out if you want a great meal in k-town but Soowon makes any non-korean / kbbq newbie (if you happen to be one) feel right at home with their genuine friendliness and easy-to-read explanations of kbbq and panchan (side dishes). . The Combo A feeds 4 (easily  5) with more meat (with variety) that we ever wanted.  Price?  Comes out to almost the same as AYCE joints, without the unspoken challenge to stuff your face until solid meat comes out of your rear.. . The side dishes are tasty and they refill that, the duk bo sam (rice paper wrapper), and salad (huge bowls) frequently.. . Charcoal is freshly replaced when you sit down.  Water refill service is frequent.  Flat screens let my boys watch their game while I eat up all the tasty beef and pork.  What an awesome idea!. . Gotta say, this is my favorite Korean place right now (if not for a long time)!!  Soowon, you deserve all the stars i have to give.. . Relive my happy eating experience here (it came with a steak and a bottle of soju!): . http://www.yelp.com/bi....
