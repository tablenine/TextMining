OK parking was very annoying for a Friday night at 1030pm, and the crowd was insane.. but the crowd was incredible and lively, which was great. The beers were incredible, so many it was a bit overwhelming. I wish I had more time to read and decide. I am not much of a beer gal, so I ended the night with a glass of wine. But again VERY crowded it was overwhelming. The people were nice, and not too crazily drunk, and the scene was full of young cool people, makes Â you wonder where they hide during the day..hahha.. Alot of white people and mixed Asian crowd, reminded me of California!. I liked the bars decor, but the seating was not available unless you were eating.. maybe I will try going to catch a bite to eat next time. But for 3 beers and wine, the price came out to like 22 bucks.. not bad! that beats going to a lame cheesy bar.. this place is chill and unpretentious, you can wear jeans and a tshirt and still feel comfy. No need to dress up for a local bar.. that's how it should be, like your neighborhood "cheers" .. now give me a couple of months and everyone will know my name there!! hhhha
