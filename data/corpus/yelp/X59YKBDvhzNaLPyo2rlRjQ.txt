Here's a bit of reflection but I swear it's relevant so bear with me.... . So you know how songs sometimes have long intros while the beat builds and then the beat finally drops and thats when the song really starts in earnest. (A good example would be "let the beat build" by lil wayne). . Anyways i was thinking: "Has the beat dropped on my life yet? Is it still building or has the song really begun?". . After eating theses tacos, I believe the beat has dropped.. . Pork, Beef, Chicken. All good. You can't go wrong.. . Boom
