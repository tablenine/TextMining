Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Awesome.. . 4 of us. Ordered the $99 platter and a few beers. Banchan was the best I have had at any Korean BBQ joint. The server was super cool even with all the meat/potato induced swooning from "Bunny".. . They kept the banchan flowing all night and the meat was tasty and plentiful.. . I was on such a wonderful food high that I even ate my chopsticks, and they were delicious as well. The server even got me another pair without me asking.. . My girlfriend drooled on herself periodically thoughout the night and usually only David Bowie can encourage that response from her...and me, when I dance magic, dance.. . Best Korean BBQ experience to date.
