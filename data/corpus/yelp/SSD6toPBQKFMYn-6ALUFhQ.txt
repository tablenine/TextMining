Love this restaurant!  A solid 4 stars after 390 reviews, it speaks for itself.  Definitely try their grilled octopus, it's an interesting dish.  Other appetizers that I've tried here are their steamed mussels, which was delicious, and a variety of dishes from their mozzarella bar.  I recommend trying at least one dish from that section of the menu.. . I think their pasta dishes come in just the right portion.  Some might think that their portions are small at first but after all the yummy appetizers and drinks, you're usually almost full by the time the entree comes.  Also, if you don't like your pasta al dente, make sure to instruct  your server to have your pasta cooked a little longer.  Their pasta tend to be very al dente, a little too firm for my taste.  . . What surprised me the most about this restaurant is their perfectly seasoned, juicy and tender rib eye.  Who would've thought that an italian restaurant would have one of the best rib eye steak I've ever had.  I been here a few times but I've always been too stuffed to try their desserts.  It shall be my mission to leave some room for it next time!
