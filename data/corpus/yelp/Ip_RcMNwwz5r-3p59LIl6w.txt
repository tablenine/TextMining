YUM! Steak of all varieties and other meat as well. Serious wet dream good! . Service is top notch. Worth the wait (due to big saturday night crowds). . My husband and his friend gave up a center-of-the-house table to an upset older couple and ended with an awesome circular table in the corner. We got to watch all the goings on and received some comped apps and drinks. . I arrived late but with enough time to order the Pork Belly and the Mac and Cheese. Seriously well done food. Simple and delicious.. I tried my husband's steak, 36 day aged rib eye and it was superb. Creamed spinach was sublimely good. . He also had the banana cream pie dessert which he really enjoyed.. I might kill to go back at those prices but ya never know.....
