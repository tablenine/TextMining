This cute small place has the best Hainam Chicken Rice.  And for a fabulous price as well.  Their super speedy service accomodates the long wait on weekends.  They also serve the rice dish with the traditional ginger sauce, but also their own version of a sweet and sour chili sauce.  The shrimp egg rolls are also a great apetizer but the best part of Savoy is the Iced Lemon Tea.  They give you free refills, so you can drink your heart's desire and they give you a little jar of simple syrup so you can add as much as you would like.. . The choice of the outdoor and indoor seating is a plus as well, especially when it is a nice day outside.  The only bad side is they are closed on Sundays.
