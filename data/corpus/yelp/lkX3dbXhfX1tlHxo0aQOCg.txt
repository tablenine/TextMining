LOVE this place. Mainly cause of the Teba Saki chicken wings. I can eat obscene amounts of it. I also like the Eggplant with Tofu...the asparagus butter, their Korean BBQ beef is tasty but isn't too meaty. Mostly fat and chewy stuff. Some people enjoy the Hanpen Cheese. Their Pork Katsu is pretty good too. Miso Eggplant is also a winner. With a pitcher of beer. Ok I'm making myself hungry. . . If you come with a big group ask to sit in the Tatami room. It's fun to have to take your shoes off and sit on the floor to eat.. . Only thing about this place is the parking situation: Tandem. Which can be annoying when you have to move your car while you're trying to eat.
