Restaurant: The Real Chow Baby
Category: Asian Fusion
Last night I ventured to The Real Chow Baby for the third time in as many years.  I will not return.. . The first time the concept was novel and I did the all-you-can-eat option, trying 3-4 different combination and never really finding one I liked.. . (There are two ways to order, there is one price if you just get one bowl, but if you want to go back you can and they add another ~$8 and you can go back as much as you want). . The second time I went, I didn't do the all-you-can-eat but rather just one bowl and again was disappointed.. . Last night I went back again, I wouldn't have gone back last night except I was dragged there.  Again I opted for the one bowl order and when I got my bowl back, everything tasted burned.  I had seen them cleaning the grill right before they cooked mine, but thought nothing of it.  My food just tasted smokey and burned.  The waiter let me try again, and while the second bowl was better, it still had a hint of smokey/burnt flavor.  . . I would suggest not going.  However, if you are forced be sure to grab the white "vegetarian" stick and put it in your bowl.  This will tell them to cook your meal on a separate grill (which my date did and her's tasted fine).  . . If you are looking for something similar I highly recommend Amaryn's Thai Bowl . http://www.yelp.com/bi....
