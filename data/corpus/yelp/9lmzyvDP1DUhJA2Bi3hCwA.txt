Phillppes or Coles? I don't know, since I've only been to Phillippes, but the sandwiches and the sides are great! I usually get a lamb sandwich with some pasta salad. Oh, and did I mention the $.10 coffee? What about the pies? Oh, those are delish! . . Easy to get to on public transport, yummy food and great old LA vibe.
