Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
What I love about this place: the BIG portioned, FLUFFY food.  the generous list of breakfast-y drinks perfect for lushes (try the raspberry champagne!).  the knowledgeable waitstaff.. . What I don't like about this place: the long waits (to get a seat, to get your food, to get to the restroom, etc).  the decibel level inside.  the tantalizing choices on the menu that prevent me from making a quick selection (ok, this isn't really a negative... but it did make ordering more difficult).. . Next time, I'm bringing a party of 6 so that I can make a reservation ahead of time, requesting a table outdoors and making someone order for me.   That would ensure an even more perfect Griddle Cafe experience.. . There's a shared parking lot with Rite Aid, behind the restaurant.  From the restaurant, go South on Fairfax and make a right into the lot.  FREE!
