Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
First meal in Chicago! Of course we had to kick it off with some Chicago style pizza. I've had Chicago style pizza before (Patxi's, Little Star, Zachary's, etc), but nothing like the pizza at Lou Malnati's. . . So, we only ordered two things, the cheese bread and a small "Chicago Style Pizza". This was more than enough to fill us. The cheese bread was super delicious. It was basically garlic bread topped with cheddar and mozzarella with a marinara dipping sauce. In fact, it was so good, we ate all three pieces before I could even take a picture (. http://tiny.cc/ecuyw. ). The crust of the pizza was unforgettable. I'm not sure what kind of crust it was, but it was corn-meal-y in terms of texture and extremely crispy. The Chicago style pizza in California does not do this place justice. Best part about this meal, total bill was $25. Can you believe that?! A great kick off to our trip!. . Don't plan on doing anything after this meal; you'll definitely have food coma afterward!
