Restaurant: AMC Fork &amp; Screen
Category: American (Traditional)
Admittedly, i had pretty low expectations (I didn't really "get" the concept of eating a restaurant meal while watching a movie), but our trip to the Fork &amp; Screen definitely was worth the trip.  . . Shows earlier in the day are $5 (try to find THAT price elsewhere in ATL...) and the crowd wasn't bad at all.  People in our group enjoyed their food (just burgers and fries....nothing fancy) and the prices weren't too bad.  . . A few things detracted from the experience.... The chairs were awesome at first...I couldn't figure out what all the hub-bub was about with people complaining.  But by the end of a 2.5 hour movie, they definitely lacked comfort.. . When there are about 20 minutes left in the movie (i.e. at the climax of the film) the staff comes out and delivers everyone's checks to their tables.  The couple in front of us apparently had a dispute about their order, so we got to watch that in addition to trying to follow the movie.  . . Parking is only validated for 3 hours....not enough to cover a 2.5 hour movie + previews + arriving a little before the show starts.  Plan on paying a few bucks to park.. . Overall, though, I liked it.  It's kind of like watching a movie in some rich person's house where they have their own theater and serve you food.  I'd probably go again.
