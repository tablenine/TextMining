Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
For my 23rd birthday, my boyfriend planned my bday with my friends at The Stinking Rose.  I love garlic so I had a huge urge to try this place out.  Once you enter the restaurant, the place was super colorful and many knickknacks everywhere.  The decor reminded me a little like Buca di Beppo.  The service is EH!  My friend and my boyfriend had to ask the waiter to bring the cake 3 times.  The check took 10 minutes to retrieve.  Everything was super slow.  My brother and my boyfriend enjoyed the prime rib.  My brother even commented that the prime rib was better than Lawry's.  I ordered a eggplant lasagna which was not that great.  I enjoyed the garlic fries though.
