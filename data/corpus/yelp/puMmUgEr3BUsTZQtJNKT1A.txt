shopsins is not only an adventure in eating, but an adventure to find!  we circled essex market 3 or 4 times and circled the block couple times too.  they must only want to be found by people who really want to eat there.  sandwiched in between the cheese shop and some frites store, they have no official signage.  our only clue was the 8.5 x 11 posted saying "chairs &amp; tables for chopsins customers only.". . alas, our search was well worth it.  the mac &amp; cheese pancakes, though weird sounding were REALLY good.  Especially with the hot sauce &amp; pancake syrup.  . . we also had the loco moco.  We never expected to see this on the menu in NY, so we had to try it to see how it measures to the loco mocos in hawaii.  we were very impressed.  the meat and onions were caramelized and had a great charred flavor.  the brown gravy was very tasty.  the only difference is that they use uncle ben's rice and we're used to short grain japanese-style rice.. . it's a good thing i don't live here, or i'd probably put on about 20 pounds eating here every week.  i would definitely come back again on our next trip.
