I tried this place a couple of years ago. It is definatly a "hip" place. The food here was good, but a little on the pricey side. I went here with my friend and she ordered the black cod and I had the chicken. Both dishes were good, but not all that filling since the portions were small. I ordered a lychee martini which was in fact very yummy. Our waiter was very nice and animated. Outside, the restaurant doesn't look like much, in fact there is just a small sign outside which we almost missed when finding this place. The inside however is in fact very cool, but it is a small place. It is 2 stories however and we sat upstairs because we wanted to see everything in the place. The decor is very hot, being mostly red. I think this place is great for a group gathering, not exactly a place for a romantic date. They have a bar downstairs by the entrance, so you can go here just for drinks if you want. I would go to this place again, but not on a regular basis. I don't know if they do it everyday, but on the night that we went, they had Geishas walking around and they are more than happy to stop and take pictures with you. That was fun :)
