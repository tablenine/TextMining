This place gets sick pack around 5sh so if I were you going with a party of 5 or more I would go early so you wouldn't have to wait 1-3 hrs. Yes 1-3 hrs I'm not kidding. Overall the food is good, but I wish the favor was soaked in the meat more rather than just the outside of the shells. My friends and I usually order, Crawfish, crab, shrimp with the whole Sha Bang sauce Med! their sweet potato fries, and chicken wings are also good. Overall Its good but I wouldn't wait there for 1-3hrs just to eat I rather just order and take it home. Unless you wanna sit in there better go early.
