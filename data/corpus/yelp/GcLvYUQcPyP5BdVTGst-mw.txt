This place left me at a loss for words.  I cannot believe people think this is the best ramen they've ever tasted.  Look, I've gone to a lot of ramen places and this place is no better and in some ways even worse than some of those joints.   I still like the broth much better at both Shinsengumi and Santouka.  One thing I will admit though---the pieces of pork floating on top of the ramen are unbelievably tender and tasty.  I could've made a meal out of that alone, it was so good.  But really, the pork bones being boiled for 2 days or whatever doesn't add much flavor to the broth.  Besides the ramen, I've tried the fried rice (greasiest stuff on the planet, after a while all the lard comes out), sausages (pretty good), and CA rolls (nothing special).  If you're in the area and there's no wait, it's a pretty good deal but don't waste your time if there's a line.
