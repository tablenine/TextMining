I am addicted to this place. I am not a fan of rare beef, so I get the chicken soup every time, and it is amazing. The garlic ginger sauce that gets served with it makes the meal. It is free-range, fresh, pulled chicken- not some dry freezer-burned sponge-meat I've had at other pho joints. Sometimes the wait seems like it will take forever for a table, but the food is served so quickly that you get seated before you know it. . People have complained that it is bland, but I think it's just because they don't do sodium-overload or use MSG like other spots. I love adding just the right touches of lime, srirachi (sp?) and all the fresh goods that go along with the dish. And as far as people saying they never see any asians here, first of all you are lame for making such a LAAAME remark, and second, you are full of shit. I am here at least twice a week, at varied times, and I always see them, enjoying each bite.. Try the #13 chicken soup. I dare you.. I heart pho cafe.
