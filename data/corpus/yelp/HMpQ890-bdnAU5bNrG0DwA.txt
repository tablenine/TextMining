Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
The pastrami is very bland and can be unpleasantly chewy. Plus it is overpriced. A little more than 10 bucks for a single pastrami sandwich that isn't flavorful or that good and doesn't come with any sides. I have a hard time believing all the positive reviews. I only came here because it was open late. Cinco De Mayos is open next door and I'd rather get my food there if its a late night.
