This was my first time visiting an all-you-can-eat steak house.  It was a bit overwhelming, to say the least.. . We walked in with no reservations around 4-5pm, and the host talked us into having drinks on the rooftop deck.  We had to walk through the "Zen Garden" to get there, which was different (but nice).  The roof deck is beautiful!  I had the fresh-squeezed orange and lemon juice with vodka, and my boyfriend had the ginger bourbon lemonade.  Both were delicious  and refreshing.  The only downside was the service... people that sat down after us ordered and had their drinks before we did.. . Dinner was great.  The servers were very helpful and explained how the concept worked.  The Harvest Table was full of delicious sides and salads that I could make a meal out of, but I didn't try everything because I was so overwhelmed with all of the meat.  Once you take your rock off the coaster, the chefs don't stop coming and the meat piles up fast.  The chefs walk around with the meat that they make, which is kind of cool.  They all seemed pretty young (some of them sounded nervous while explaining their dish).  I enjoyed everything except for the St. Louis style ribs, which were bony and didn't have much meat.. . Dessert is not included, but we decided to try the butterscotch bread pudding after hearing the raves from the staff.  They were right, it was delicious.  It was enough for two (probably even for three), especially after everything we had already eaten.. . I will be back, but probably more for the rooftop bar than for dinner.
