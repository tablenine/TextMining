Maybe I expected too much - I am always hoping to find places that will beat at least Chosun (yeah, it's clean, yeah, it's nice, but the meat quality? Only so so).  The service was okay.  If I were to go to this place again, I would get ribeye and that's it.  That ribeye alone gets this place an additional star.. . Valet parking only (albeit cheap).
