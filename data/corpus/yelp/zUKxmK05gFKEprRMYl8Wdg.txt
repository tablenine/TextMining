Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Great place for cheap, greasy tacos.  Lines are long outside but, go inside..it's faster.  For less than $4, you can get two tacos.  Greasy, but well worth it.  No fuss, just good ol' Mexican lard.  Mmmm...I know they serve burritos, too.  But I haven't tried them yet.  Only went there for the tacos.
