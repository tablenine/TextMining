I should preface by saying that I really don't like ramen that much.  I tend to get dragged along by certain individuals (such as Matt P.) and his girlfriend Katie.  Anyways we tried to go here last week and I put up a big fight because I wanted Chinese (Phoenix Inn) and there was also a huge wait for a table and so a result the mission was aborted.  Now I have to admit that I felt bad for what I had done.  I decided that I would get over my negativity towards ramen and give this place a shot.  (I was also inspired by a guy at physical therapy who couldn't stop raving).  So myself and Infizzle went this Monday and let me tell you: I really liked it a lot.  It is different than normal ramen in that it is somewhat thicker and milkier.  The noodles were very soft and the pork was exceptional.  So overall I am impressed.  It might just be the one ramen place that I can tolerate.  Good work Matt!
