Real food in the middle of the night.. Where else can you go in LA at 3am and have to wait in line to get in?  And have a whole menu of food ranging from waffles and french toast, to noodle soup, to tofu chiliquile?  . There are the asian all night places that serve some unintelligible food types - best braved with at least one person who can read the menu and talk to the waiter.  You will be stared at there, if you don't look like everyone else.... At Fred 62 everyone looks a little odd, and you might end up seated with some interesting characters if you're willing to share a table.  . It gets packed.  For good reason - the food is decent, the atmosphere busy and welcoming.  It's not a greasy spoon, it's not Denny's, and it's not an asian place.  It's the kind of place that looks like it's full of artists and writers.  . A good choice for the middle of the night. . Service can be slow and the wait for a table can be long, as well as the wait for the food.  You might come in at 3, and leave at 5.  You were already planning to stay up all night anyways, weren't you?. . Good selection for vegans and vegetarians.
