Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
I've been wanting to go to Spago forever so we made reservation to eat here in advance since we were going to be in LA. . . Excitedly we arrived on a Friday night and had our car valet parked since there was no parking spot available. Oh I can't believe this is another one of those restaurants that's famous but doesn't quite deliver!! 3 stars for the high price but average food and very rushed service.. . Since it was my treat, we decided to go with the 5 course tasting menu. As soon as we ordered and they took the menus from our hands, the food started arriving. Wasn't it good you asked?  No, not when they kept coming back to back and I couldn't get to take my time and enjoy my food.. . The waiter asked me to pickup another amuse bouche when I am eating one with my other hand, and have another one on the plate already. Give me a break will you?. . We got wine pairing too and for some reason we were having a hard time hearing the descriptions for each plate and the wines.  Yes it was very crowded and noisy too, but the servers were all kinda in a hurry to get in and out.. . A couple came and sat next to our table around 8pm and wanted to do the 5 course tasting menu too but were told they had ran out of the tasting menu.  The manager came and apologized to them, and advise that it was a very busy night. . . Well yes busy indeed, all I felt was that they were just rushing to serve their customers so quickly to turn the tables around! All I can say about my whole experience is that for over $350 a meal, I really expected much better tasting food and better service.  . . To eat and drink all that in an hour was pushing it Mr Puck. Maybe if you let your customers sit back and relax a bit, they might get to enjoy the food and the beautiful patio setting in the evening.
