Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
I adore Gingergrass.  My favorite meal, hands down, is the fish steamed in banana leaves and the green papaya salad.  That being said, I have never had nor tasted a mediocre dish from Gingergrass.  The food is fresh, the flavors are crisp and light.  Yum!. . The decor is simple, clean, industrial and modern.  I like it, but it's very sparse and open - no frills.  . . Of course, I'm not the only one who is enthusiastic about Gingergrass, so don't come too hungry because you are likely to wait, especially Thurs-Sat night.
