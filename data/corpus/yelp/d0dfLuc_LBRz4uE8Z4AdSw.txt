I was brought here by friends for my b-day few years ago and I'm hooked.  When ever I'm in the area, I come here.  The food is incredible here.  . . The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it's very small with crowded tables so it's VERY LOUD.  I enjoy the food but leave with a bit of a headache from the noise.
