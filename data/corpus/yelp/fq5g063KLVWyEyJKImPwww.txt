I've been here twice for dessert &amp; coffee only, both times I tell myself I am not going to come back. . . First, they don't have a dessert menu to look at when you sit down at a table. They have one on their website though. You have to walk up to the front and see what's in the case. That's the last thing I'd want to do after just sitting down or after a meal. We overheard a staff member say it's a visual thing, huh?. . Second, the desserts weren't that good. I had the bread pudding, which is always decent, but my husband had the mocha buttercream torte and it tasted stale. i told him to return it and get something else. He just wanted to get done and get out of there. . . So while we love this part of Lincoln Square, I think we'll get Cold Stone Creamery and sit in the Square
