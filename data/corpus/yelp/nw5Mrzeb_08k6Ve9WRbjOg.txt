Restaurant: The Old Oak Tap
Category: Bars
I should never have only given you four stars, old oak tap.  you are a delight, I like you more each time I go in.  And thank you for finally turning down the music a bit.  Couple more tv's for sporting events wouldn't kill you, but if your not a five star bar, then Chicago doesn't have any.  . . Upscale bar food done perfectly.  Excellent food with a great beer list (with reasonably priced beer.  Dragon's Milk for $8?  Sold. - now it's 10...still not bad)  Service was fine, it was a busy night.  The shrimp &amp; the wings appetizers were crazy good, the entrees were tasty and very well prepared.  . . Being out of pretzels, the insanity of the volume of the music inside (we sat on the patio, but when I walked in to used the restroom, I was overwhelmed how loud it was), and the fact that the busboys seemed intent on taking away my water glass every time I turned my head were the only minor disappointments.  . . Not sure what the plan for winter is, that's a lot of open space on the patio.  Definitely recommend it on a nice evening.
