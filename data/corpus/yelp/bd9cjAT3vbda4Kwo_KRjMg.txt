Overrated.. . Don't get me wrong, those tacos are pretty good. However, none of what Kogi offers is as extraordinary as the hype it receives. The flavors of Kogi's meats rely very very heavily on ginger to give an artificial sense of "Korean" flavor, making the Korean fusion fad quite gimmicky. With the size of the line that the truck garners, there is nothing special enough to justify waiting that long.
