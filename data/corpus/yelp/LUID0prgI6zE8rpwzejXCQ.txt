I could talk about the pastrami like every other reviewer did, but I won't. We know its good. Leave it at that. So why 3 stars? I usually end up paying about 15-20 bucks when I eat here. I'm sorry, but anything that comes in sandwich form should not warrant such an expense. When times are tough like now, we become very aware that 20 bucks can buy enough groceries for a week. I'm a foodie, but paying this much for a delicious pastrami sandwich is not cool.
