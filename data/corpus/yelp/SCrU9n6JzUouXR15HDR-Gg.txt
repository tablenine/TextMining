Restaurant: Taco Mac
Category: American (Traditional)
The usual Taco Mac - tons of beers on tap and in bottles, american and mexican food - except that this one is huge! HUGE! Plus the location is great on Peachtree St. I can see it getting packed and exciting for big city sports events. Now if only we could get Atlanta's sports teams to be good...
