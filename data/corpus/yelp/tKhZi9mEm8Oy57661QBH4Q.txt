Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
I've been eyeing Milk for awhile now, and I finally convinced my friends to go there with me a couple days ago.  We were completely overwhelmed by the staggering amount of yummy looking desserts!  After much deliberation, I chose the chocolate dipped vanilla ice cream sandwich.  The "sandwich" part was made out of sugar cookies or something; absolutely fantastic.  We ended up staying there for three hours; that's how much we loved the place.  But there are so many more desserts there that I really want to try: the strawberry shortcake, the blue velvet cake, the chocolate raspberry tart... but I'll probably have to wait until my next college break before I can sample these delicious looking treats!
