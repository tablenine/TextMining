I walked out of the restaurant and had a feeling of deja vu.  It's one of those weird moment.  You felt like you had ate at this restaurant a long time ago (I think I probably had a while back).  I decided to pick the Omakase cause I was having a long day.  . . Only the live scallop stand out in my mind, cuz my eyes were fixate on the "regular special" next table to me.  I am not saying the chef serving me is not good, it just doesn't feel as good as the people sitting next to me, plus the drunk couple on the other side of me bring down the experience.  I had a hard time trying to talk to the chef cuz they are consistently busy prepping the next course.  . . I guess next time I will sit at the table and get a better value out of a set course.  =p
