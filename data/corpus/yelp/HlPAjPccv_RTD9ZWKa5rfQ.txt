Absolutely amazing! Beef dip with swiss cheese is to die for. I live an hour and a half away now and make trips with my husband just to eat here. We love this place! The hot mustard is amazing and the cute little candy stand on the way out is the perfect stop for the ride home. I highly recommend Philippe's! Especially great stop on the way to a Dodger's game! :O)
