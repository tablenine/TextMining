Category: American (New)
First off, this place is a modern pub with a ton of beer (and some wine) on tap that happens to have some really good pub food. We went during non peak hours so had no issues with space or ordering. The ordering is done at the bar where they give you a number and then you go find a place to sit.. . Ordered the Office burger and it did not disappoint. This is not your typical burger king burger, the best way to explain it is gourmet. The CPK of burgers. In saying that, my wife still likes In-in-Out better. Â And the sweet potato fries were good, but they did not blow me away like overs have reviewed.. . Overall, this is a great place to hang out with a group of friends looking for a great variety of beers and some good grub.
