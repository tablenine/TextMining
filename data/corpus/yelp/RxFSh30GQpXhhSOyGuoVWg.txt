I give Tom's props for their staff. They seem to have a low turnover rate which makes me think that Gus (the owner) treats them well. The food on the other hand has gone down hill and the prices are running parallel to neighborhood real estate. . . The music creeps me out as well. I can't help but be reminded of Dan Aykroyd's music in the movie Nothin' But Trouble.... . It's worth checking out and basking in the glory of Suzanne Vega's inspiration. What the hell was a little white girl doing in the hood long before gentrification anyway? She could have been shot when the song was written, all the more reason to enjoy some Eggs Benedict.
