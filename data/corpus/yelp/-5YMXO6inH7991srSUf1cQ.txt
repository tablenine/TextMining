This is currently my favorite restaurant. The service here is out of this world. Friendly, considerate, efficient....I love that you always feel wanted here. The food is also great! I love the moules frite and everything else I've had here (with the exception of 1 duck slider gone wrong, but really that means that they are batting 1000). Â Great wine list, nice beer selection, but seriously, the ambiance and staff make this experience.
