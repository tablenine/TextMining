Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The OG Roscoe's in my book, this spot never disappoints. Order the 1/2 chicken + 2 waffles, get it covered in gravy - you won't leave hungry. . . The interior might be lit with red fluorescent tubes and those stupid Pitbull ads might be everywhere but the food is delicious and one-of-a-kind.
