Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
My cousin realllllly wanted to try this place. I think I'm kind of over the gourmet burger joints already (because lets be real, I'm just as happy with an In N' Out burger versus these $8 ones). However, I still decided to give it a try. . . My cousin ordered the Umami Burger. It was pretty good I thought. I ordered the Turkey Confit burger. Not so good. The Umami was better. Ordered a side of fries (really 5 fries?!) and sweet potato chips. The sides were just eh. . . So why am I giving this place 4 stars when I sound less than enthused? Because its BYOB no corkage fee. How freaking awesome is that? The fact that we were able to bring a bottle of wine with no corkage fee to go with our burgers was awesome. The service was also pretty good. . . So pretty much if/when I come back, I will have a bottle of wine in hand.
