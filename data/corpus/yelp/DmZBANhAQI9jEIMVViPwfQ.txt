I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant, and one day we were in the area and the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed, so we had lunch here instead. I wanted to be more impressed, but for what you pay to eat here, the food was just okay. I didn't like the bright light over my head in the middle of the restaurant either. Meh.
