I went here on a Wednesday night and had no problems with service at all.  The pizza was thin and crisp and the crust had some fun bubbles on it.  The sauce and cheese were also perfect.   There wasn't too much of either, just the right amount.  My fiance thought that there weren't enough toppings to choose from.  I thought this was an advantage because my pizza didn't get messed up with a ton of veggies.
