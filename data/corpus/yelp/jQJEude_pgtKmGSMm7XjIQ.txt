I'm not a huge fan of this place. I've lived in this neighborhood for years and was psyched to hear it was coming but I'm still waiting for a truly positive easy experience in the place.. . No matter what I've ordered the food takes FOREVER. Why is it so slow? Even when there is no line.. And why has my order always been wrong so I've to wait all over again??. And why do people actually line up down the street?? Don't they realize it'll be an HOUR before they get that food in their bellies?? And can the people in line PLEASE stop blocking the footpath. I hate seeing children forced to walk on the street to get around the crowd. It's not safe.. . Maybe I make the mistake of going in there when I'm actually hungry, 'cause by the time I eventually get my food I'm so hungry, cranky, mad at the the place I swear never to return. . . I do LOVE their beers though. It's nice to sit outside on the corner. Screw the food. Save your $$ and eat at AyCarumba across the street and use what you save on the yummy European beers at Wurstkuche.
