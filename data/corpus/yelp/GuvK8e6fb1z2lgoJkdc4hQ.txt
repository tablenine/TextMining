I live about a block away from Mana and just recently tried it.  This food is delicious!!  My friend from out of town was visiting and she is vegan so I figured this place would be perfect.. . Our waiter was so nice...once she said she was vegan he took the menu from her and went to the back and circled every option on the menu that was strictly vegan--amazing!!  . . We went on a Monday night around 7 and we had a twenty minute wait, so keep that in mind.. . I got the tomato pumpkin squash with a sage cream sauce..it was insanely good...sweet, rich, and savory.  My friend got the sauteed mushrooms over polenta, which were also exquisite.  The mushrooms were sauteed in a lot of butter and garlic and the polenta was very creamy--Loved this and im not big on mushrooms.  My vegan friend got Bi Bim Bop without the egg, and the rep pepper miso sauce was so so good.. . All I can say is this food is delicious and reasonably priced (4 ravioli for $6).  All ingredients were extremely fresh.. . The only thing that stopped me from giving five stars is that we had to wait a long time to get our food.  Our waiter brought out the bi bim bop in five minutes but my other friend and i had to wait another fifteen minutes for our entrees.. . Eat at Mana!!
