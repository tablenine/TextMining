i've been to Versailles a few times, but we came here today for my cousin's belated b-day dinner and i have to say i forgot how yummy their garlic lemon sauce was with the chicken.  i think i could drink that stuff! haha.  the plantains and the beans are always a treat too!  we had a large group and they were quite accommodating.  i thought they hated us since we kept asking to add more chairs to our table, but our waiter Jose (aka Alfredo) was actually kind of funny.  he actually got all our orders right and brought us the many drinks we requested.  we ordered dessert and he kept insisting on the flan...which turned out to be ok.  but he was nice and entertaining, and the food was yummy...hence the four stars.
