Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
The fajitas here are good. In every other facet, Uncle Julio's is painfully mediocre -- price, noise, service, atmosphere. The faux Cantina look is horribly contrived, and makes me think this place is the official Mexican restaurant of Disney World. They even offer Disney World's inflated prices!. . With all the great Mexican food in Chicago, you're best served to skip Uncle Julio's.
