Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
PRIME RIB IS A MUST ORDER WHEN GOING TO LAWRY'S! Price ranges from $30 - $40 per cut. Includes spinning salad, mashed potatoes w/ gravy, and yorkshire pudding. You can also add lobster tails ($12 for 1, $21 for 2). Corkage is $20 per bottle. Service is great! While you wait for your table, they have meatballs and chips for you to munch on. Would recommend making reservations. Vallet parking is about $6.
