LA Mill is the only reason I go to Silverlake.  I always make the detour off the 101 on the way to school.  Even though the coffee is on the pricey side it is well worth it compared to the stuff some people call coffee at Starbucks.  I would rather pay $4 for a small cup at LA Mill rather than get a cup of crap oil at some other cafe.  Not to mention at some other places you get drinks prepared by people with little training who couldn't care less.  Oh and for the people who complain the coffee is bitter, I drink it black and the subtle variances in taste for each of the blends is amazing.  Trying a new kind of coffee at LA Mill is like trying a new fine wine.
