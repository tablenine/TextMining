Restaurant: Wurstküche
Category: Hot Dogs
The diverse selection of sausages/bratwursts is definitely an upgrade to your average joe schmoe hot dog.. . Some of my faves:. Mango Jalapeno. Hot Italian Sausage. Original Bratwurst. . Toppings:. sweet peppers and caramelized onions(though they were more like grilled onions, but still just as good). . Sides:. Belgium fries w/ Chipotle Aioli or Pesto Mayo. . Beers  - All you 1st timers must try these on your first visit!. Floris Apple Ale: I like to call this apple beer. for those who don't usually like the bitter taste of beer, this is perfect bc it tastes like apple cider . Fruli: same as above except strawberry flavored. . Atmosphere:. Pretty cool place to chill w/ friends. On Saturdays they have a DJ there. . . Wait: The lines can get pretty long. I went on a weeknight and it wasn't crowded at all. The last time I went was on a Saturday and the line was out the door. We waited at least 15-20 min. The best part is that they take your drink order when you get closer to the door and so you can drink while you wait to order. You then walk through this long hallway all the way to the back which opens up to this warehouse setting w/ long tables and a bar in the back. There's also outdoor seating. . . Overall, pretty good food, pretty good fruity beer in a happening setting.
