Update: 7/27/2007:. . Attended the Yelp event last night and little has been done to change my opinion.  The bartenders were cool, but the cocktail servers were awful!  The appetizers were decent, but I only tried the shrimp and cucumber and the melon.. . Love the interior, but I still don't know if it's enough to make me want to come back.  It wasn't enough for me to host a party there, so that says something.... . -------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------. . Can we say... OVERPRICED???. . One of my girlfriends and I went in there on a Friday night and I have to say I loved the decor.  It was wall to wall, which I was expecting.  What I was not expecting was a $44 bar tab for two drinks and two shots.  Is it just me, or is that a bit ludicrous?. . I also felt like on the night I popped in, the place had attracted a good number of the trendier DePaul kids, because I can assure you a few of them were NOT 21.  . . I want to go back when it's early enough to snag a table or do dinner.  I'm even considering doing my birthday soiree here, but we'll see.
