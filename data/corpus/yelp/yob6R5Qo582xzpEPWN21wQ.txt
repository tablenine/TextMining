Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I wouldn't describe very many places as perfect, and this place is no different, but it is FRICKEN GOOD!. . The burger doesn't require ketchup (don't even ask for it) because they understand the power of seasoning!  I'm not fond of ordering at the bar though -- I like servers at restaurants.. . P.S.  My father's office wasn't this cool!
