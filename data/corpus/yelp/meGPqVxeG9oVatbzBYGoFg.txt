I used to live across the street from this hole in the wall. The Thursty Whale and the Tiki Hut come to mind as the reason I would go to G&amp;J. I brought a friend with and I specifically told her, Do Not ask for ketchup. We get in there and she askes for 2 dogs with the K word. Rude! She didn't get served and I am now taking applications for a new hag. They have the dogs made for them with garlic in the mix. The fresh cut fries make the meal. This is the stuff legends are made of.
