Five stars for delivering piping hot food and chocolate fortune cookies in a cake box to the Portage Park area! The food is excellent, too. It's not your typical egg foo young joint; the cooking is reminiscent of modern Chinese cuisine that I've had in Hong Kong -- more sophisticated and creative. Even the presentation on their delivered food is thoughtful. For example, spicy peppercorn beef came as a Â mound of bite-sized beef slices flanked by steamed broccoli florets. A great place to get a Chinese food fix if you're looking for something different.
