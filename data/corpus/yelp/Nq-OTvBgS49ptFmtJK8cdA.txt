The service here was excellent - a really nice waiter who patiently talked us through the choices we were considering. We didn't have to wait long for a table for 2 on a Friday night. The ambience was fantastic - cozy, warmly lit, tables close but not too close. The food was good, but definitely falling into the French zone with their use of cream, butter and oil. The wine bar next door is super romantic.
