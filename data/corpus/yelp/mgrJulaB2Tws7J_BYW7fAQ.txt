This place was packed for a Tuesday night! Tis the season!  We had a girls night out tonight and chose a location that accomodated everyone.  The mojitos are yummy and not really strong, just the way I like it. . . We ordered:. Calamari - good, but I've had better previous times I've been there. fried green beans - very tasty - can't go wrong with anything fried. carne asada - delish - my fave meat dish. seared tuna - okay, i didn't like the bean mixture it came with. tomato, mozzarella, basil - can't go wrong with that. potatoes - can't go wrong with these either. spanish ribs - okay - i'm not a pork person. buffalo burger - bland with a little kick of spice. black bean humus - yummy with the pita and veggies. . I would give the food 3 stars, but I love the atmosphere so I gave it 4 stars. It is very loud when the band is playing, so don't expect to have any intimate conversations.  The food came out quickly even though it was very crowded. Our waiter was great working many different tables.
