Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
When I'm in the mood for sushi and my wallet is a little light, I like to head over to Hide Sushi. I've yet to find another sushi restaurant that can match Hide's quality and price. . . I recommend the chirashi (slices of sashimi on a bed of sushi rice) which is only $10. . . The place can get extremely crowded on the weekends so be sure to take some patience with you. And be sure to stop by an ATM because this place only accepts cash. Closed Mondays.
