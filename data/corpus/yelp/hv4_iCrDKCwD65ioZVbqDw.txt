Ate here on New Years Day, but almost left right after looking at the menu. We were looking for bar food, and the menu we looked at was not what we thought a brewery would have. It turns out we were in the RB Grill which connects to the brew house. Luckily the host sent us in the right direction or we would have missed out on this fantastic place! . . The bar was packed with football fans watching bowl games. Great atmosphere and service! The food was amazing. I highly recommend upgrading the side option to the mac and cheese or onion rings...both were wonderful. The beer selections were top notch. Try the sampler if you want a taste of the whole brewery. There's something there for everyone.
