What's left to be said but "yum"? I hadn't been in several years, but it was the first creperie that came to mind when a friend and I decided we needed some. . . It's a cozy place with a pleasant atmosphere and attentive, friendly staff. For such a busy area in the city, I was sure it would be packed on a saturday around lunch, but goody-for-us it wasn't. . . Another reason I chose this one was because of their menu and variety of different crepes. We both shared a savory and sweet crepe and were stuffed, so let that be a hint as to how big they are. My man-friend picked the seafood crepe, and I created a nutella 'n strawberry combo. Oooh la la! . . The only minus was sitting in the front area and getting a blast of wintery air when people come in. My feet were freezing the entire time. I've been to other creperies, but for some reason, this one never disappoints. Have to make it a point to go back more often for such a simple pleasantry.
