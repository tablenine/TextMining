I would largely echo the reviews of other fans, with slightly less fervor.  The sandwiches were indeed quite good; the bread in particular was very fresh and perfectly toasted.  I forgot the official names of the sandwiches I tried, but the shaved pork and onion from the Gyro spit was quite good, if a little on the light side (weight wise).  The other sandwich I preferred, which was the chile marinated pork tenderloin.  Again, could have stood for some more meat, but it was quite tasty.  It had an unusual herb on it I had never tasted before.  I asked the owner, and he gave me a name I'd not heard of, and said he grew it in the garden at his house.  It's like a blend of 3 other herbs, very interesting.  Would def buy that sandwich again.  Price wise, it was OK - I don't consider $6 for a sandwich to be super cheap, esp when there is no side.. . I would also support comments about the sauces served there - they are the best I've had in a Mexican place.
