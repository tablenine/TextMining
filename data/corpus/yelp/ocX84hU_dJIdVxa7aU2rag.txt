Logan Square needed a nice, low-key coffee place SOOOOOOOO badly.  I moved here from a mid-sized city with a university that has more independent coffee shops than all of Chicago, so I think I know coffee shops.  I am one of those people that will park at a table and squeeze a few hours out of it (I also tip well and order more than just coffee), and the coffee shops that let you do this without a hassle will always have a loyal customer base.    . . This place almost always crowded, but I've also always been able to get a seat.  I think it's just the art of getting there at a certain time of day.  I have been there at times when the noise got a little crazy.  The owner was really accommodating...could tell that I was trying to work and found me a better seat without any prompting from me whatsoever.  So nice!  I haven't really explored their menu very much.  Their dark roast required twice as much sweetener as I usually use, so maybe I'll go for the light roast next time.  . . Logan Square/Avondale needs more places like this with free wi-fi and later hours.  If a second coffee shop opened up right next door to New Wave, they would probably do just as much business.
