Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
This place is legit.  Legit Japanese chef making your meal, legit Japanese wait staff.  You tell them how well cooked you want your noodles, how much oil you want in your broth, and out it comes.  Some reviewers complain about the shouting wait staff, that's part of the authenticity of this place so don't hate and don't be ignorant.  It's better than going to a "Japanese" restaurant and having the (fill in any non-Japanese ethnicity here) waiter/waitress mangle "irashaimase" or some other Japanese greeting.. . The broth of the ramen was very good.  The noodles themselves were decent, but they were real thin, almost like somen instead of ramen. . . Finish your ramen, and they'll throw in an second serving straight into your bowl for 95 cents.
