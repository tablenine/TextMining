Mana was wonderful. . I went with a vegetarian friend and we left full and happy. . Drinks:. I had the Mana Lemonade (tart) It was super yummy and refreshing!!!. Dinner:. 1. Bulgogi- This was yummy  a little on the salty side, to taste like true Bulgogi  there should be more of a sesame and garlic flavor. . . 2.   the potato pancake- This was ok- It was not an awesome flavor explosion, but it wasn't horrible either. . . 3. The Mushrooms and Creamy Polenta- This was the best dish, the polenta was perfect and well complemented by the mushrooms on top. Both of us agreed that it was perfect!. . 4.  the Mana Slider- It was delish! the spicy mayo and the cucumber were soo good! the consistency of the burger it self was dead on perfect! . . Dessert.. Lemon tart with strawberry sauce and a cashew crust- This was the low point of a wonderful meal.. The crust tasted stale and had no flavor. The rest of the tart was ok. It was nothing spectacular..  with such a cool menu I was expecting more interesting dessert choices.. go to coco rouge down the street for a real treat. . . Over all-. Good servers . good Drinks. Great food for the most part. I will be back!
