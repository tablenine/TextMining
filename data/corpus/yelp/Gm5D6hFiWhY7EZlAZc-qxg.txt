"Hickory Burger" for the win!. Do we really need to discuss anything else?. . OK, Ok... "Tuna Sandwich" of the century!!!. That's all I really need to say, right?. . I don't even eat red meat anymore, but my friend was in the area and knew I was @home starving. I just couldn't resist. She brought me some Apple Pan take out and I made proverbial LOVE to that hickory burger like never before! Yummmmmmmm. I kissed those fries and spanked that Apple Pie like it was bad.. Needless to say I was sleep out for the count in 30 minutes! LOL. . - Mr. Shannon. . *I wish they took credit. cash only :(
