Ok, there is reason behind the 5 stars.  I've been here 5 times and on each visit I have consistently gotten GREAT food and service.. . My last visit was on a whim because I didn't want another burger from the too-many bar and grills in the area.  First, this place is always packed and reservations  ARE recommended.  We went early enough where we didn't need one, but had to wait around ten minutes - perfect.  Our host was dead on with everything.   He was a nice as pie.. . Our waiter was good, but I have to say he just seemed hurried like he had too many tables.  He listened and recommended when we asked questions and I blinked and seriously he vanished.. . They have at least 3 pages chock full of some of the best maki I've had.  I too think Sushi restaurants can be expensive, but at least here most if not all maki come with at least 8 pieces instead of the usual 6 at many others I've visited.. . One of my standards to judge a sushi restaurant is how well you make the venerable spicy tuna roll. Now if you f*ck this up, I'm outta here - no passing GO!. Well it's executed flawlessly here with just the right amount of heat and sesame seeds rolled on the outside..um, YUM!. . We also tried the ocean sundae and the lava maki.  Both again, very good.. . As an appetizer we had the firecracker shrimp, which was good, but only getting  three makes me wish it came with six...sigh.  The Tuna tartar was good, but we needed more chips to eat the rest of the tuna that was left.. . Beer was $4 and our saki was $18 for a bottle.   We had 3  maki rolls and two apps and escaped with an 80 dollar tab.  Seriously try and get that  anywhere else for the quality and service - and let me know, but until then it's Tank in the Hood (Lincoln Square)
