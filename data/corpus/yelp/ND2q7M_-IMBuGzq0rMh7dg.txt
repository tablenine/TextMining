I am all for renegade fast food, especially when it's as tasty as Oinkster. I had a cheeseburger and Belgian fries. The burger was as close to burger perfection as you can get EXCEPT that it was so overloaded that it lost Physical Burger Integrity almost immediately. It fell right apart and I needed a fork to continue. The fries were seriously good. My advice is to use the garlic mayo sparingly: it's good, but poppin' with garlic til your eyes and tongue sizzle. I also enjoyed the chipotle ketchup, which I usually hate anywhere else. The menu looks expansive and tasty!. . Limited parking, slightly uncomfortable seating, staff giving about 75% on a weekday PM shift off peak, and somewhat untidiness...this will not stop me from going back!
