This place went downhill fast.  The eat in pizza slices don't even cut it anymore.  Went in during the dinner rush and got a slice that looked like it fell on the floor and was picked up upside down.  Flimsy, greasy and runny.  Not a combination for pizza.  And is it possible for the workers to look any more disinterested and pissed off that they work there?
