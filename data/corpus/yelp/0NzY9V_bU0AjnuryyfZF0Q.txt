Every time I have been to this restaurant the menu is different and the food is always excellent. Mostly seafood, prepared with an Asian flare. Most of the dishes I have chosen have been some form of fish served in a light and extremely tasty broth. Hamachi Tartar was superb. The duck was decedent and a chocolate peanut butter concoction topped the meal off beautifully. I also had a grouper with lobster dumplings in a broth - I am still salivating over this one. I am also very fond of there imaginative martinis. Not as expensive as you would think, but not cheap. Reservations are highly recommended.
