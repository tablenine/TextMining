I like the hickoryburger. It has fresh ingredients, and I like the smokey flavor. I think it's about $6.50 / burger. . . There's a U-shaped counter where you seat yourself, and since there's no line it gets awkward while you stand and wait behind someone who looks like they're almost done eating in order to snatch a seat. Â . . Don't go in with inflated expectations. While they have good burgers and fries, it's not orgasmic or enlightening.
