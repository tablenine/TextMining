Once I stepped foot into the restaurant, I was vastly overwhelmed. The smell of seafood (read: fishy) was strong, the band was ear-achingly loud, the river-like koi aquarium under the glass floor was captivating, and the staffs were pleasant on the eyes.. . We were led through to the back of the restaurant where it turned into a 2 story tropical villa. We sat on the 2nd floor at a table that's regularly for 4 but they added a chair on the end for our party of 5. The arrangement ended up being a bad idea because we could barely fit all of our orders on the table. . . We wanted tap water, but somehow the waiter misinterpreted our water choice and brought a big bottle of Fiji water. We let it go. Our party shared 2 roasted crabs from the secret kitchen, 2 orders of the garlic noodles, the chilean sea bass, and the chicken with truffle risotto. It's hard to be on your best behavior when eating crab. I found myself licking my fingers often.. . The garlic noodles were indeed amazing. The crab, however, was mediocre. The meat of the crab was bland and the crab was not the freshest. I guess if you're not Asian, this is as good as it gets on the west side of LA. The sea bass was quite tasty. I liked the sauce it came with. The chicken was just chicken...nothing really special. . . Overall, I was disappointed. I expected much more and Crustacean couldn't deliver it. It's also incredibly overpriced. $13 for a veggie side?! I'll pass. . . Tip: Park at the 2 story metered parking structure across the street. It's free after 6 PM.
