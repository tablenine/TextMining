Good spot for a little later at night. They carry yummy Japanese white beer and serve some of the best fries ever. But what is up with the lack of a mirror in the bathroom? A few years ago they had this stupid virtual video mirror, which doesn't even seem to be working now. The bathroom is so dark that your own compact mirror won't matter a damn either.
