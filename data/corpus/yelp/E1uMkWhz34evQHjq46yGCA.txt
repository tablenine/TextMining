I used to live right near this place, and I agree that the sandwiches are really good.  The side dishes are tasty too!. . Had to take away a few stars because the flan was the nastiest I have ever tasted, and the employees are always a pain.  The cash-only policy never bothered me, but something was definitely always bothering them... maybe they ate the flan or something.
