Restaurant: Maison Akira
Category: French
If you enjoy French/Asian fusion cuisine, Chef Akira is a master. Most of the menu options reward with balanced flavors and artful preparation. The decor needs work, leaning toward silk kitsch. Depending on the staff you meet on your visit, the service is usually good and attentive.
