We received OUTSTANDING service from Sarah K. this past Saturday evening at the Marietta location.  The food was unbelievably delicious, and the martinis were especially tasty -- the Thai iced tea martini was delicious!  My only complaint was the size of the appetizers -- they were minuscule.  The atmosphere is perfect, and the overall dining experience was very, very good.
