Restaurant: The Modern
Category: French
Dinner at The Modern in the dining room was an extraordinary experience.  After frequenting other fine dining establishments in NYC, The Modern stands out from the others in its class--from the impeccable service and decor of the dining room to the beautifully executed dishes.  Each dish was executed with panache, flair, and precision.. . I had originally made the reservation at 6:30 with a special time-sensitive request for "pre-theatre dining," and was pleasantly surprised to receive a call to accommodate my party at 6:00 to honor the request.  Throughout our dinner, the wait-staff was attentive to detail and aware of our time sensitive request (even though we were not)--all this, without being overbearing or snooty.. . Recommended dishes:. Green Asparagus Soup with Gyromitre Mushrooms &amp; Soft Poached Farm Egg. Roasted Black Angus Beef Tenderloin Lightly Smoked, Sunchoke Souffle &amp; Perigourdine Sauce. Milk Chocolate Dacquoise &amp; Raspberry Sorbet
