Good experience, great food!. . Had tickets to see a musical at The Pantages Theatre.  Took the chance and parked in valet (even though you guys scared the caca outta me)...they were really NICE and let me keep my car there until the show was over at 11pm (total cost $7.50).. . We ordered shrimp cakes for an appy, and for dinner we ordered pra ka pow, pad pri king, beef &amp; broccoli, and pad thai.  Everything was good, food came out quickly but service could have come with a smile.. . All in all ~ good experience, great food!
