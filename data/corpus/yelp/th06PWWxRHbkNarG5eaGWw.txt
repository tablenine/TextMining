I really like the decor, it's relaxing without being sleepy.. . I'm vegan so I've only tried the vegan foods. The vegan french toast is great, the pancakes, not so much. I really liked the vegan benedict (I think this was the dish, it's the one with an open English muffin) though when we ordered a second one the second one had less food on it. The home fries are good, the "cheese"-covered fries were bad. I really didn't like the "cheese" but individual tastes will likely vary on this.. . The service is decent though they could use more waiters.. . Overall, it's pretty good if you are with a group of omnivores and vegans and are in the mood for breakfast-food.
