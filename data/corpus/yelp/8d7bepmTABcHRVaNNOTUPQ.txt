I love the pastries at Porto's. The Guava Cheese Roll is Excellent. Potato Balls is Awesome. Their Midnight Sandwich is awesome. Price is very reasonable.  This place is crazy busy all the time. I believe they close by 7pm or earlier every day so make sure you don't go too late.  I have to say, they make great Pastries!! Practically every pastry I get is GOOD. Some of the staff are friendly and a few not so or else I'll give them a 5 star.
