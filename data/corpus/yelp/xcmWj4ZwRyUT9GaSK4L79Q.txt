Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
(Tito's salsa recipe included) This is not good Mexican food. Too greasy, the meat is "Of the origins unknown" type and the chips are too tick. The salsa is good, but is very simple, the type you can make in a few minutes. My friend goes here just for the salsa, so I decided to let all know how to make their salsa. It is so easy, it takes 2 minutes. Take 4-5 ripe tomatoes, take the core out, put in a blender and blend to the max, add 3 raw onion circles (not slices, just 3 circles, don't put to much onions). Add one pickled jalapeo pepper and some of the juice from the pepper (or less, if you want it mild). Add salt, no black pepper. Blend again to the max. put in covered cup and let in refrigerator for about 6-8 hours or even more. You have your salsa. I guess for fast, cheap food, it is better than Mc Donald's, but for good everyday Mexican food, try Don Antonios on Pico. And for real good Mexican food, try La Serenata de Garibaldi, also on Pico or my all time favorite Casablanca on Lincoln Blvd.
