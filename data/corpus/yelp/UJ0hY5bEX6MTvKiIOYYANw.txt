Psyched about FO2 finally opening... just a slight detour on the way home making for an enjoyable way to ditch rush hour traffic. . . 72 taps mirrored with 36 types of beer. More in bottles. And they have some cocktail options although no vodka is available.. . Menu is the same, again, I'll never give this place a perfect score as long as they insist on serving their burger one way and one way only. That ain't right. . . Great, well trained staff, with excellent knowledge of the oh-so-tasty brews. Best selection of Craftsman brews in the area.
