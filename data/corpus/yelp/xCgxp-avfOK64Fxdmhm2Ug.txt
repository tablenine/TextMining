Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
The prime rib is clearly sent from Jesus.. . Please try the chocolate pudding as well; it's so dark and rich...too much whipped cream, though.   (Who am I?  What am I saying?). . Good service, but my waitress was super agressive.  I felt like if I didn't follow the Rules of Lawry's I was going to get in trouble... slight anxiety there.. . It was delicious.  I wish it wasn't so far from my house.
