One of the best eating/dining/service experiences of my life.. . My friend Shelley and I dined here a couple years back before they got famous and we did a 7 course tasting menu, took 4 hours and the service from the staff was amazing.  They weren't stuffy, had some fun with us, we had fun with them.. . Pricey, worth it.. . Good wine pairings, we did the whole shebang.. . As usual, asked for a tour of the kitchen.  Pristine.  . . The orange blossom aromatherapy pillow on my plate (and then telling me to breathe in deeply) was a bit much, but I'll forgive them.  :)
