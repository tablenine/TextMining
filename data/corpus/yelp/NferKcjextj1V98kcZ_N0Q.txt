I love Canters!. The token place to go after a drunken night out. Maybe that's why I love it so much!. I don't understand the kvetching about the bitter hosts/waiters since that's what makes this place so kitchy and lovely. . The food. The food that's what we're here for, right? The menu can be overwhelming there's hundreds of items. I usually get the avocado melt. Mmmm. They come with fat steak fries. My ex used to get the tuna melt which is also very tasty. I'm not a fan of Italian meats, but I've heard that they are very good here and he's a fan of them. . They say the upstairs bathroom is haunted. I didn't know this until a friend told me. I always attributed the moving shadows to being drunk. The bathrooms are scary though. The one upstairs because of the creepiness factor, the one downstairs in the kibitz room because it's tiny. So tiny you can't open the door all the way if someone is washing their hands.. . All in all Canter's is a classic Los Angeles Landmark and they should be forgiven for most of their flaws as long as they have an A in the window. It's definitely worth a try if you've never been here before. Just keep in mind the quirky characteristics that makes Canter's, Canter's.
