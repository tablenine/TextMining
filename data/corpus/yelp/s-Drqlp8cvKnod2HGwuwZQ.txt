Came once awhile ago for a nice dinner. Reservations are definitey recommended and the atmosphere is very cozy, but the tables are kind of set close together so there's not much privacy. We ordered the pappardelle (my favorite kind of pasta), yellow corn soup, charcuterie and oysters. The corn soup had a very spring-like taste which was fantastic and I had lardo for the first time, which was very good but I felt sooo gulity while eating it haha. However, the pappardelle accompaniments were bitter and didn't go well with the pasta. . . Totally want to go back and try the mussels off the bar menu and beef tartare. I want to give this place another try, since there are such great reviews.
