There is really no point in me reviewing FO on Helms as it is nearly identical to FO in Santa Monica, but there are a few significant differences that warrant a second shout out!. . 1.  WAY more tables and outdoor seating can't possibly hurt.  I love the heaters, and appreciate that there is a space for a private party.. . 2.  Parking is actually easier, if you can believe it!. . 3.  The sweet potato fries are cut ever so slightly thicker.. . Those things aside, I think I still prefer the original.  Though let it be said that FO2 will always hold a special place in my heart because of my first visit.  Picture out-of-town NYC friend, pushing aside another patron, diving into a seat, planting her body and purse firmly at the table and proclaiming "I'm here" loudly.  In only the way a NYC gal can do... we claimed our space.
