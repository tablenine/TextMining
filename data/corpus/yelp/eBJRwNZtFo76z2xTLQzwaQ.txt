Sausage fest at this place!!!  You can get all kind of weenies here; even exotic weenies *wink*  Italian, Mexican, even Filipino weenies.  Finally I can say I had weenies for lunch.  . . The sausage was HUGE.  I had bratwurst with spicy peppers and sauerkraut.  I don't like sausage in general and this is the second sausage place I like besides Jody Maroni.  The fries were good too.  I would probably go back there again for other exotic sausage (buffalo, duck, rabbit, alligator but not rattlesnake).  . . Outdoor seating is kinda cool but you might come homeless people asking for $ or food.  Just be cool and give them your fries and they will leave you alone.
