I love going to destination restaurants, where you have to drive far away to look for the hidden spot in dark industrialized area. From the outside, i always thought it was some sort of bar or a night club, until i realized it was a restaurant. . . There is usually a line, half the size of Pinks Hot dog, going into a loft like building where you order a plethora of exotic hot dogs. This place is far better in quality and service than Pinks. I ordered all 5 exotics: . - Rabbit . - Gator, . - Buffalo . -Duck . -Rattle Snake . . It also comes with 2 free toppings, in which you should just ask the cashier to choose for you since they know whats best. . Below are the options: . Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut . Sweet Peppers, Spicy Peppers . . You must get the fries too with the following sauces: . Sweet and Sassy BBQ . Buttermilk Ranch . Thai Peanut . Tzatziki - Greek yogurt sauce . Chipotle Ketchup . Curry Ketchup . Bleu Cheese Walnut and Bacon . Sundried Tomato Mayo . Chipotle Aioli . Pesto Mayo
