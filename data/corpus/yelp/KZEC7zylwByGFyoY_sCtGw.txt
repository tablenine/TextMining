When I think ramen, I think Helen Cheng, so when Helen Cheng says this is the 'BEST RAMEN" she's ever had, it truly must be the BEST. So, on my journey to try some of the top foods in LA, I turn to yelp and find that Daikokuya is amongst the top 4 highly reviewed places and after the confirmation from Helen, off we jet to Little Tokyo!. . Now, I've only had 1 real ramen experience before this (at Katana-Ya in SF), so I can't say I'm much of a connoisseur. . . But...WOW. The broth blew me out of the water. Out and over into the tidal waves and back. . . It's so flipping rich and delicious and warming; PERFECT for the chilly day. Additionally, this ramen was SO simple -- which makes it stand out even more. At Katana-Ya in SF, they deck the ramen out with a whole lotta things, which is great, but for a ramen to be served so simpley: just broth, noodles, chasu, beansprouts, and one boiled egg....says a gosh darn lot about the high caliber of deliciousness!. . Anyway...they also serve a handful of other yummy side dishes such as fried rice and gyoza which were also stellar.. . The place is small, and it took about 30 minutes to get seated...but totally totally worth it. Oh! And the service is so efficient and fast!. . Helen says that now that I've experienced one of the top ramen's ever...my ramen bar has been set very high. I guess a trip to Japan will be it's only competitor.
