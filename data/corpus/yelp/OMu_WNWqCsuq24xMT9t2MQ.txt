The food is excellent... the staff at the door could be a little friendlier, but I have no complains about our waiter/waitress. I booked a reservation through . http://opentable.com.  and when I mentioned it to the host and the "door guy" they both gave me a look like: "that's so lame" ... maybe it was just me feeling awkward about making a reservation through an iphone app. Regardless, the food was delicious and would recommend to anyone.
