I thought it was kind of a weird atmosphere, sort of fastfood-like when you walk in, but they serve beer and wine, plus, they have a happy hour. Crazy.. . I got the hamburger and while it was very good, my dad's pastrami looked better and I can't wait to go back and try that!. . Also, the fries come with aioli sauce, which I love and hardly any places in the US serve that, so that was a fab treat.
