How can you not like a place that serves you an entire deep fried red snapper?  The space is cheerful, small,  and crowded and its a bit of a hike but its worth it.  I had the shrimp that was smothered in buttery sauce and not only was it amazing but it was a heaping portion.  And of course one could say the whole snapper is a heaping portion as well.  This is definitely a good place to come with friends for a very filling meal.
