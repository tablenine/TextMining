Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Favorite late night hang out locale. They have firepits outside. Chill place to hang out. Mom pop pastrami place that's been around forever. Pastrami is pretty good, but why so expensive I don't know. I like their onion rings. I just mainly like coming here with group of friends and hanging out, sharing a pitcher, and being mesmerized by the fire.
