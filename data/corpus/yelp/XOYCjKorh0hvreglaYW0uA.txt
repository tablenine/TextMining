Category: Bakeries
all the years i've been growing up in los angeles, i've always heard about the glory of canter's deli...but i never seen/experience it for myself until yesterday.  . . when my friend and i were visiting the mid-wilshire area and was prompt with the question as to where to eat for dinner, i couldn't resist but suggest canter's.  both of us have never been to one of these famous delicatessens, e.g. langer's, jerry's.  i kept my fingers crossed as we drove on fairfax - i didn't have the address with me but i vaguely remember it was on fairfax.  luckily, we didn't get lost and luckily, we even found a parking spot on the street.  . . outside this place, you could immediately sense the history behind it.  it's just one of those undeniable things.  inside, the place is a completely homey diner atmosphere.  it's dimly lit in there and as i started staring at the ceiling, i couldn't help but trip out a bit - this must be how i'd feel on lsd.. . we decided to order what most people go to delis for...so canter's fairfax (pastrami and corned beef piled high together on rye bread) and matzo ball soup for the both of us to share.  it's a lot of food (and meat) for two people.  we ended up having to push some of the meat off and packed it in a doggy bag to take home.  . . at the end of the meal, while we were completely and utterly full, both my friend and i agreed that it wasn't all that.  it was definitely a place we'd come to try out but probably wouldn't come back to.. . for me, i still prefer the pastrami/roast beef sandwiches at eastside deli in chinatown.  it's still the only sandwich that makes me salivate and slobber  like my pet american bulldog!  eastside, sorry for cheating on you - nothing (not even canter's) can take you away from me!
