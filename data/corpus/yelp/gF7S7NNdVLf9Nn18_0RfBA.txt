Went in for a drink at about 10:00. Still pretty busy inside. Waited a few minutes and then scored a seat at the bar. Bartender was decent (don't know name but she had short dark hair) but you could hear her bitching about wanting to close up and having to work in the morning. Doesn't really add to the atmosphere when all you can hear is the bartender complaining. If she doesn't like her job, she should go elsewhere.
