We were in the area last Sunday to watch a Chinese Acrobat show, which turned out to be really awesome.  When we first stopped by around 2:30pm, it was completely packed.  We asked one of the people working here if there was something special going on?  Nope, it's just a regular Sunday at this place.  We decided to come back after the show. . . We came back around 5:30pm, and one of the rooms was closing.  I still don't fully understand it, because there are two separate rooms that had their own lines and seemed to have different items you could order.  We were in the café area that had a limited menu (which looked huge).  We got the fresh fruit tart and mango mousse, which came out to $5 (incredibly cheap).  They were both absolutely delicious.  I wish I was hungrier because then I would have ordered a sandwich or something, which also looked pretty great and were also really cheap. . . There are also some amazing looking cakes here that are reasonably priced at $20-$30.  But alas, we didn't get one...
