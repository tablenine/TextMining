Let's face it, you will love anything you order here.  The daily specials are very different from the regular menu, and I've loved each one I've ordered.  Normally, I tend toward the udon items, very rich broth and fresh, fresh, fresh ingredients.  The atmosphere is friendly and the staff exceptionally helpful.  Talk to your neighbor on the bench type seating -- you will have a great time and have interesting entertainment you did not expect!
