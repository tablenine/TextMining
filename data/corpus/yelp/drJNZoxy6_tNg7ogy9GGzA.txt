Best. Burger. Ever. . . This place has the best hamburger I have tried in both San Francisco and Los Angeles.  . . My brothers, who live there, have been talkng about this place for a month and when I finally found time to visit, this was the first place they took me to straight from the airport (Glad I did not fill up on Southwest's peanuts, fiesta mix or ginger ale). . Not sure if its the parmesean, the mushrooms or the bun or the meat.  The whole package just works here.  Super juicy, full of flavor, deeply satisfying.. . Another nice aspect is the size of the hamburger -- it is enough to not order a second burger (although, I would not fault you for that) , but modest enough to allow you to enjoy the killer tempura onion rings and ice cream-merengue cookie sandwiches.  Homemade ketchup and mexican coca cola in the bottle doesn't hurt either.. . You must try it.
