I went here recently to grab a slice before going out on a Saturday night. We were lucky that we were able to grab a table, although it isn't absolutely necessary, considering the type of food they offer. I only had a slice, but it was a really good one at that. Monster, New York style pizza.. They have daily slice specials with a variety of awesome topping combinations for only $4, but since I'm kind of plain, I went with the pepperoni. You can't beat the taste and size of that slice for only $3.50. If it's any indication of the quality, I was back for more in less than a week.
