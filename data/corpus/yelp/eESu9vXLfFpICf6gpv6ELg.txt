I waited in a long line to try this for the first time and ended up going with the Short Rib Burrito and a Spicy Pork Taco. Both were good, but I really enjoyed their pork sauce (being a fan of Teji Bulgogi anyway). Next time I will definitely try the Spicy Pork Burrito. Service seemed quite slow, I had about 10-12 people in front of me and it took about 50 minutes to get my food.
