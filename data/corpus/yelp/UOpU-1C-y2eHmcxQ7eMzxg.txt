Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Okay, I'll admit, I'm not a big seafood fan; I like certain types of fish, but it takes a lot for me to enjoy crab, lobster, shrimp, and crawfish. The Boiling Crab provides that "a lot" for me to like it.. . The pricing seems fairly reasonable, and among the seven other people I ate with, the bill came out to about $180 ($22.50 per person) which included 18% gratuity for the large (6+) group.. . The variety is good, as they provide shrimp, king crab, blue crab, Dungeness crab, lobster, oysters, and crawfish and charge by the pound. They also have fried versions of some of these choices, and lots of side dishes like gumbo, white rice, and Cajun fries. You get to choose between three different types of sauces in which your seafood is cooked in, or the popular "Whole Shabang" which is all three sauces combined. You can also choose on three levels of spiciness, or non-spicy for you wimps. They have beer by the bottle, and I also recall seeing a bar, but I'll have to confirm that the next time I go. For non-alcoholics, they have water and soda.. . The most fun part about this restaurant is the Cajun-style eating. The waitresses start by tying plastic bibs around you. The tables are covered with butcher paper, and your order comes in a large plastic bag filled with seafood and sauce (unless you ordered a fried dish, which comes in a basket). This is where you really get to rip it apart and get down n' dirty with your food.. . The eating was fun, especially in a large group, and the waitresses were very prompt and provided everything for us on good time. The only bad thing about this place is the horrible parking situation. Also be prepared to wait up to two hours during prime lunch/dinnertime. One last piece of advice: wear dark clothing and leave your jackets and coats in the car, because you'll probably smell like what you ate afterwards.
