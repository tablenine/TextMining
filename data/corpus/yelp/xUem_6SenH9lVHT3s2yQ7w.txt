I'm tempted to give tender greens three stars because its just salad we are looking at here but i guess i'd have to admit i like it here.  they decor is pleasant and the cleanliness is at best.  i ordered the chipotle chicken and it thought it was delicious.  tender greens is worth checking out, its a healthy meal without the struggle.
