Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
The best Greek food in town. Well worth the trip to Koreatown.. . The market is well stocked with imports, olive oil by the gallon, a variety of olives marinating behind the counter, an assortment of freshly baked Greek pastries. Mmmmmm.. . Reasonable prices. Greek charm. Papa Christo is a hoot! I walked in through the back door and they made me feel like family!
