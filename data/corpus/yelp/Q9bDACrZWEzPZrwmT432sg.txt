Tried Crust for the first time yesterday - a great day to sit on their patio outdoors.  We had reservations for lunch and were seated promptly -- the place was less than a 1/4 full at 1pm on a Saturday.  The atmosphere here is great with cool decor and a good crowd.  Our service to start was great, host and waiter staff very friendly.  We were waiting on a few friends and got wine and appetizer to start.  The wine came but the appetizer took forever!  We ordered more wine and I had to ask where the appetizer was.  Then when we were ready to order a bit later and our server was missing. Overall service was very slow.  The food was okay.  I had one of their pizzas. Granted it was a nice day, they got busy later into our visit but still there is no excuse for not checking in now and then with a table. I hate to say this because I was very excited about the organic and vegetarian options (you can swap out meat for tempeh in some cases).  I probably would not return here unless I had loads of time and wasn't too hungry.
