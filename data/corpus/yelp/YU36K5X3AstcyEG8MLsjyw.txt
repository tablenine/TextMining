Restaurant: Flash Taco
Category: Mexican
It was a rainy Sunday night (May 25th, to be exact).  I was exiting a hip Wicker Park bar when my roommate suggested we stop at Flash Taco for a quick meal.  Being not in the right mindframe to be making decisions, I quickly agreed.. . After waiting in line for what felt like an eternity (it was really only maybe five minutes), I ordered some nachos.  Chorizo nachos (I wasn't thinking right, ok?).  . . Once I got my order, I ran for dear life in the pouring rain back to my apartment, nachos in one hand, jacket in the other as to protect me from the harsh springtime downpour.  I only stopped briefly to watch a beligerently drunk female get out of a cab and punch her cab driver in the face before taking his car keys (it was a sight worth stopping for, rain be damned).. . I remember getting in to our apartment, sitting down and enjoying the nachos.  Truth be told, they tasted delicious and hit the spot.  Shortly thereafter I went to bed. . . The next morning I awoke to see my roommates playing Mario Kart.  I joined them for a minute before feeling queasy.  I won't go too far in to detail, but let's just say that Flash Taco's nachos don't taste so swell the next morning.. . Finally, after two days of laying in bed, withering in pain from food poisoning, I came to the conclusion that I will never eat Flash Taco again and that my new goal in life would be to protect as many people as I could from eating such rubbish.. . Seriously people, if you are craving food late at night of the Mexican variety, walk something like half a mile south to Picante.  It's a much smarter decision.
