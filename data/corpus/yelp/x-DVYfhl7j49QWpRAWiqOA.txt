I've been here twice.  Service is a joke, loads of attitude.  They hire people who all hate their jobs.  On my first trip I stopped to get a cup of coffee to go and the guy at the cash register / front door was annoyed that I was bothering him, he was after all doing nothing.  He did look fantastic though, great hair and glasses, kind of like this place..something to look at.  So 5 minutes and almost $5.00 later my coffee was presented.  . . I tried one more time two months later last Monday.  This time I arrived at about 9 AM and there were 3 people in front of me ordering coffee to go...I was there for 15 minutes and when I got in the car I realized they gave me a latte and I ordered a black coffee.  I drove away, I could not face that crew one more time to fix what took SOOOO long to get wrong.  It was not worth the pain.   Looking forward to something a bit funkier and friendlier to open in my hood, this place belongs in NYC or Bev Hills...not in Silverlake.  Too pretentious and phony for me.
