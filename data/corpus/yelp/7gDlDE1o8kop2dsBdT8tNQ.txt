I am pretty sure I could survive on just their Masaman curry tofu and potatoes for an entire month.  I am so addicted to this entree that I order delivery at least once and as much as four times a month.  Is that sad? . . Delivery is usually 45 minutes but well worth the wait.  . . Spring rolls are yummy.. I've also had the pineapple fried rice which is good but it doesn't hold the same spot in my heart as the tofu and potatoes.
