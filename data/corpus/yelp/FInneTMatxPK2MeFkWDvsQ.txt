I got a lot of blank stares from my waitress to simple questions like, "May I have a lemon wedge with my water?" Waitress: ::blink, blink::. . If you have Â a lot of patience, you might be okay without flipping your table over and storming out of the place. The food wasn't too bad, but nothing special either.
