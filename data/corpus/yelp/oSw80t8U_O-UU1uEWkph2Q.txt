This was the first restaurant I ate in on my very first trip to Chicago last weekend and it was a fabulous experience!. . We walked in a little on the later side on a Friday night and were seated right away.  The space was pretty cool, really open, but a little on the dark side and incredibly loud!  We started with the house margs, delish, and guac - hands down the BEST guac ever - definitely a must-order.. . Three of us split the 8 taco dinner and we tried the salmon, chicken, duck, steak and al pastor.  My fav was the duck - very flavorful.. . Overall, fun atmosphere for a night out with the girls and reasonably priced as well, I would come back on a return trip for sure.
