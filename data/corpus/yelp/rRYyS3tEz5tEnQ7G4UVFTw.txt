Restaurant: Bacchanalia
Category: American (New)
I loved Bacchanalia. I ate there twice when I lived in Atlanta and it rocked my world both times. Superlative bites include the best crab fritter in the universe, and a spring lamb entree that will inspire you to find the nearest farm and kidnap all of their baby lambs in hopes of recreating the goodness every single day for the rest of your life. Service was great, too. I'm not a huge wine drinker, but our server helped me pick a single glass to complement the entire meal. The careful help and amazing vino truly heightened the experience. Next time I visit Atlanta, I'm going to Bacchanalia as soon as I get off the plane.
