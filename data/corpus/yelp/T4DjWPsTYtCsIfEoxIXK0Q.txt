Restaurant: Bob San Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
While Bob San isn't the best sushi in Chicago (that would be Heat, easily), it's pretty damn good and only slightly overpriced. This just might explain why even on a Monday night we were packed into a bistro-like table almost bumping elbows with a group of gesticulating Spanish bankers.. . People seem to think that what Bob San does best is the fish itself, and since for me sushi restaurant == raw fish, this suits me just fine. I'd stick to sashimi and nigiri rather than sharing lots of rolls and things next visit. . . The hamachi--my favorite, so I'm fussy--was so good I disassembled the nigiri and ate the fish alone. The super-white nigiri was likewise unexpectedly "dressed" with something vinegary and some wafer-thin bits of scallion, but I overcame my bias for all things naked and decided I liked it anyway. I couldn't extend the same absolution to the citrus-marinated jalepeno salmon sashimi--the spicy, tart flavors totally overpowered the fish. Rolls were good, but not staggeringly so. I preferred the perfectly competent spider roll to the house crunch, which I thought was too sweet and sort of odd (my husband, on the other hand, loved it). Because pieces were overall on the large side, that compensated somewhat for the largeish prices.. . And it may be childish, but the perfectly popcorny gemaicha tea also made me very very happy.. . Decor is pleasantly nondescript and service was similarly, well, serviceable. Bob San's straightforward nature makes it a top bet next time workday stress makes me crave simplicity at dinner, but people looking for a fun start to a night out with friends will especially enjoy the closely-packed tables and generally relaxed, somewhat noisy atmosphere.
