My friends and I decided to try this place out after we left a previous dead zone bar.  . . Well, I totally liked this spot!  IT was definitely popping...my kind of joint! People from ALL ages, you know cute guys and girls, this was definitely causing dimple showage (haa..not a word I know).  I really liked the decor and the atmosphere...it was so cool! I really thought the bus was awesome and license plates along the ceiling all sorts of stuff hanging!!  TV's at every table, except ours didnt work...ha! But it was all good because I got to "people watch" the fun thing I like to do. Very interesting, people having fun, playing pool, laughing, listening to rocking music of different genres.  Oh and secretly laughing at the girl with ugly knee high socks showing out of her knee high boots...kinda hilarious!!! Made me bust up...anyways..... . We had drinks, appetizers and it was very entertaining! I would definitely go back!
