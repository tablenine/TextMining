the food its great. they have a great selection of sausages. so far the duck one what the business.. .  how they serve its is a gigantic pain in my ass. what the hell were they thinking i want to know if anyone else had some issue biting into it and having to death roll to get a piece off it. on top of that if you death roll their go your toppings. get the food to go and eat it there. yes i am a special eater but i know one of you has had that problem too.. . the place is okay the ambiance was a bit pretentious. the area is pretty cool .. . i am interested in trying the other topping they did not have on the menu as the time i went they did not have they i went like a week or to after they opened.
