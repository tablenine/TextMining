Restaurant: Alinea
Category: American (New)
What more can be said about Alinea.  I mean, we could go on and on about tastes (like the amazing piece of Wagyu ribeye tartar I had with a sauce made from balsamic vinegar aged in whiskey barrel and the oil was the fat rendered from the wagyu...yeah...insane) or the service (they are veritable treasure troves of information about the food, wine, and history), but why go into such detail.. . Why? I'll tell you why, because people need to understand that this ridiculously priced restaurant is...dare I say...worth every penny.  I mean, you're looking to drop close to $300/person when you go here, that's a fact, but one I am going to say you have to do. . . So the food is art. That's the first thing you need to realize. The presentation (most of the apparatuses are for sale on the website) is as important as the taste. For instance, I ate a dish of a piece of bacon which had been dipped in butterscotch and dangled from a tightrope. Yeah.  Also, if there is a "scented pillow" involved..just hold your nose. It can get a little overpowering, but remember...it's art.. . Conclusion: I'm not going to describe all 20 courses cause it's useless...yours will be different.  If you have money for an experience, do this.  You'll never forget it.
