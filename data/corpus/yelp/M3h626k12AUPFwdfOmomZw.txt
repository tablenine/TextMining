I like this place. It's a nice chill place to go kick it and have a meal. . . The food is good but not wow. The cool thing about this place HAS to be their beer selection!. . I'm not a huge fan of beer but I do enjoy it once in a while. And for the times when i'm feeling super girly, I order the raspberry beer! haha more like raspberry juice but it's still yummy!
