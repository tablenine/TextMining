Beautiful. Simple. Timeless.. . feels like Old New York. . . This was date night in recognition of Valentine's day for me and the Viking. Part of the romance for me is the very high quality of ingredients in the food matched with reasonable prices. . . We chose to share an assortment of small plates and walked out feeling very well fed.. . Vegetarian Lentil Soup $7 . Shaved Fennel &amp; sweet onions $7 . Meatballs Marinara $8. Prosciutto, mozzarella, &amp; sage crostini $8. Roasted beets with goat cheese $9. Jamon Serrano $9. Portabello fries $9. . Rodney Strong Pinot Noir for me, a Chianti for him.. . Our waitress brought out the food in two waves, thoughtfully paired.. . For dessert we shared the lemon tart. He had an americano, I had the hot chocolate. Their hot chocolate is the best I have ever had. And I know my hot chocolate. . . I would recommend every dish we had. . . Though the place was busy, our service was great. . . I will be going back....soon. Â This place is great for any and all occasion or purpose.
