My favorite Chinatown chop-shop these days, as my previous haunts have been shut down. Given the turnover we've seen in the nieghborhood, the longevity of this place should say something.  This is a cramped, borderline divey joint with surly waiters helped by bright lighting, relatively clean dark wood &amp; glass tables and chairs, and of course the food!. . They have a good selection of roast meats, though the duck is on the fatty side (if you must order it, get a leg to ensure that you get edible meat.  It costs extra but it's better than getting 6 pieces of bone and fat).  Favorite order now is roast pork with noodles and a bowl of dumplings (over the fattier wontons).  They do decent kitchen entrees, but the rice plates are not up to par.  The fried noodles are good, as are the fried seafood dishes.. . Service is provided with a grunt, but that's part of the charm.  Get in, eat, get out.  Like some of the previous reviewers, I have to recommend aggression here.  Step up and be heard, as there is no room for a line by the counter.  (Note: the little old ladies WILL cut you off)  This is not a place for lingering, but given the size and ambiance I'm not sure why you would want to stay.  They can sling very good food with fancy menu descriptions but this is not gourmet, in presentation or quality.  This is an efficient cafeteria where you can fill up on cheap comfort food available at all hours.  Unless you are getting something fried, get it to go.  4 stars as a rice/noodle shop, and beware if you're looking for more.. . Good late nite spot as well.  It's earned a fair share of my post boozing pre-dawn dollars.
