4/5 SERVICE: Great. 4/5 AMBIANCE: It's so LA.. 3/5 FOOD: Order only the specialty rolls! . 3/5 VALUE: It's not a great place, but it's a pretty cool one. . . My sister took me there for a belated birthday meal. It's a fancy place. Very LA, especially for this NorCal boy. The decor was very modern and the ambiance was so "LA," but in a very good way. . . We ordered some blacked cod. It tasted like broiled fish with Mr. Yoshida's sauce. Not impressed. We also ordered a sashimi - dry and not fresh. Yuck! Their only redemption was their specialty rolls. They were very good, but I'm sure there are just as creative places all around that are inexpensive. The molten cake though was so delicious! . . The good: Â The service, ambiance, specialty rolls, and molten cake. The bad: Everything else on the menu.
