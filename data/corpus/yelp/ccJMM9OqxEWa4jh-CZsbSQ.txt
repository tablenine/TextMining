Another downtown lunchtime favorite!!!  I absolutely love dipping my roast beef sandwiches in au jus!  Forget about what they serve and call french dips at places like Quiznos or Arby's, Philippe's is the real deal.  Gosh, reading all these reviews gets me really craving for Philippes.  Maybe I should move back to LA...???. . If you're from out-of-town and want some good eats, as Gio M says below:::. . "not to be missed"
