Perhaps some of the best sushi I've had in... recent memory, or at least the last couple years.  I'd attribute this to the freshness of the fish, the creativity of the dishes, and the presentation.  One of my faves was sashimi topped with a drop of sorbet (unusual, yes), and the wasabi panacotta.  Although a bit unusual, it doesn't fall into the realm of so-far-out-there-fusion-that-it's-crap.  On the contrary, our dinner was delightfully refreshing, and I keep trying to find an excuse to go back.
