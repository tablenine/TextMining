Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Classic traditional Chicago pizza spot. Pretty good deep dish. 3.75 stars.. . Cost to worth it ratio: 3 ($20 for small). . Highlights:. - Deep dish special: fresh tomatoes on too with hidden sausage, green peppers and onions within. Comes with mushrooms too but we skipped those. Working your way to the bottom you'll find a thick layer of cheese and a pastry base. If that's not enough dough, you still have the Ã¼ber thick crust which manages to be crispy and chewy at the same time. . - Bar area: crowded section to wait in. They have some fun cocktails like the Italian screwdriver (vodka, amaretto, grapefruit and orange juice). Bring ids to the bar, as they card everyone.. - Ordering process: put your name in, order your pizza at the counter, and wait for your name to be called. Streamlines the process a bit--when you sit down your pizza is not far behind.. . Lowlights:. - A bet there are better pies. This one was good, but didn't knock my socks off.. . Good start to our Chicago eating tour--we'll be looking around town for more pizza eats.
