I've come here a couple of times and ordered the crab cake eggs benedict both times because it's so damn good!  The cinnamon rolls are of course amazing but I recommend eating only one or sharing the second one with someone else because they fill you up so much.  I had trouble finishing my beautiful eggs benedict as a result.. . The fruit cup is great and includes blackberries, grapes, strawberries, pineapple, etc instead of typical fruit cups that are 95% honeydew melon.. . The wait staff were quick to refill waters and coffees and the food came out relatively quickly.  The tables are squished together and it seems too crowded, at least in the second room where I've sat both times I've been here.  Get here early on the weekends because there will almost definitely be a wait after 10 am or so.
