I have never had anything that I did not like here! Although this is the second location I would much rather come here than the one in Glendale. They have actually forced people to form a line cutting down a lot on the confusion factor, I know that everyone wants their pastries but there is no need for madness. I would suggest you do NOT leave this place with out trying a potato ball, one bite and you will know what your life has been missing all this time.  Other great options are  the chocolate croissant, feta and spinach croissant and fruit tart, and that's only the Bakery side!!
