I always make a point to catch this place when I get to LA. The sandwiches are awesome, they dip the bread in juices from all of the meat (lamb, beef, turkey, pork) and it make everything sing. The sides are good as well but tI think the macaroni salad is my favourite, it reminds me of my grandparents and they way they made it. One of the best things is the house made mustard, if you ahve a cold this will open you up, it has a fair amount of horseradish in it and compliments the sandwiches to a "T".. . The whole experience can be a bit daunting for the first timer sine you jsut line up pretty much anywhere and deal across the deli cases with a person who takes your order. . . This is the birthplace of the French Dip sandwich and they are certainly keeping the quality of that in mind and making one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.
