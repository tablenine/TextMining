Restaurant: Everybody&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
aaaahhhh, as the day ends I find myself writing yet about another restaurant I have been to several times in the past. . . I was out with a friend doing some drinking one night in the Virginia Highlands and got the craving for a nice a "pizza pie" (you have to use your Italian accent when saying that) so we dipped in to Everybody's Pizza. I immediately fell in love with the atmosphere as it gave me that old bar feeling the minute I walked in. I didn't make it to far past the bar so I really can't comment on the rest of the establishment. All I know, is I had fun sitting right there on my bar stool, eating a pizza and drinking with my partner in crime of the moment. . . The pizza was good as it was topped with lots of hearty toppings and the cheese! oooh MY GOSH! the cheese! to me, the cheese makes a great pizza and they hit it out of the park with that part of the pie. . . While the pizza was good and the beer was cold and I was having a great time at Everybody's. I remember the bartender pretty vividly as he as pretty cool to hang with us and chat us up. Come to think of it, every body we talked to was pretty laid back. Perhaps that could have come from the "I'm drunk as hell-(o)" look on my face. . . Either way, it's a cool place to stop by when in the neighborhood and looking for a slice (or whole pie) and a cold frost beer.
