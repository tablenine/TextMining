Late night dinners usually equate to me feeling porky, but not at Mana. It's way healthy (vegetarian) and the menu works like magic.....and any type of Saturday night magic is welcome in my world.  Although the space was TINY and crowded, we were seated within 2 minutes.  The tapas style options were moderately priced--adds up quickly if you want to give everything a shot. . . Table roster:. Jicama, Mango &amp; Cucumber Salad-  Meh. Good base ingredients, but the vinagrette had an artificial kick to it.  . . Red Quinoa-  Nicely done. The union of pine nuts and zingy dressing offset the boredom of quinoa. . . Spinach and Pear Salad-  Honey mustard dressing made this one a winner.  DIY-ing this one at home.. . Asparagus-  Grilled+roasted red peppers=can't go wrong.  I wanted seconds.. . Spinach Ravioli-  Not a fan. Cool that it was spicy, but it was heavy and almost broke the guiltless magic of the other stuff.. . Thumbs up to Mana. I was already tipsy from wine and had to convince myself out of ordering the coconut H20 and lime sake cocktail....next time.
