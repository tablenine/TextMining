Mmmmm...I know why this is a Chicago favorite!!. Great service, YUMMY Lou Malnati salad!!!  Chock full of goodness like olives, crispy cold romaine lettuce, onions, gorganzola cheese, light dressing! YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!. . I have never dined at Lou's - always only getting take-out and it's just as good fresh if not better!  THANKS LOU!
