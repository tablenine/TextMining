Here's me:. . I'm all "whatev" at this spot. It's all overpriced and the tables are all wobbly which is not cute.. . Now, I know:. . The ground shakes, a crack forms in the ground and up comes some mythical creature spitting fire into my already-balding head screaming at me for saying anything negative about such a quaint little retreat in LOS FELIZ (of all places to degrade! Pfffft!), but really, it's nice, I guess, but a bit overpriced for what you get, IMO. Iced tea and a fucking chicken salad = $20? No thanks. . . Oh, and your "quaint" sign at the register begging for a tip is lame. Not that the service isn't tip-worthy, but a sign guilting people into forking over dollars is a bit ... rude? . . Here's you:. . De-fanning me, cannot believe I just ragged on the O!-so-adorable Alcove, writing me hate mail in the form of compliment, etc. . . But it really comes down to this:. . a) Too pricey for what you get. Coffee is not that great, breakfast SUCKS, etc.  . b) Can't smoke? Why? We are O-U-T-S-I-D-E. Give me smoking section, then, fuckfaces. . c) I thought shabby-chic took a shit in 2003?
