Just tried this place for the first time yesterday and I can't wait to go back!  First I have to address some of the naysayers...complaining about parking?  It's downtown LA, what do you expect!  Presence of hipsters...even if the place was overrun with "hipsters" (which was not my experience, it was a  demographically varied crowd yesterday), what does that have to do with the food?  Lastly, I disagree with people who said it was expensive.  It wasn't cheap, but the quality of the food and drinks weren't cheap either.  Now on to the good stuff..... . They bring you your drink as you wait in line!  Very cool.  I'm not a beer fan but the cream soda I had was delicious.  My boyfriend loved the beer he got, and especially enjoyed the festive glass.  We went before the dinner rush hit, and had no problem getting a seat.  My bockwurst was tender juicy amazingness.  The boyfriend got the alligator exotic sausage, which was very flavorful but not as tender.  The fries were probably the best I've ever had.  All of the service people we encountered (cashiers, bus boy, dude who brought drinks) were very friendly.  No complaints, this place is a must try!
