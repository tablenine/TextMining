Oh my effing amazingness.. . I'd have to say that this is now my favorite restaurant in LA. Â I came here with 6 of my closest friends for my birthday dinner. The service was great and not at all snobby. They didn't even laugh at my $30 bottles of wine! lol...but it's probably because La Crema is amazing.. . But let's go down to business.. . I ordered the Beet &amp; Goat Cheese Layer Cake, which I have been dreaming about since seeing the pictures on the website. It was perfection. It was flavorful, fresh, and delicious! My other appetizer (hahah hey it's my birthday and I can eat what I want to!) was the Oyster plate. So fresh and so gooood for me. I can't wait to come back for the tasting menu!. . My entree was the seared ahi AMAZINGNESS. And that almost tarte amazingness part deux was pretty spectacular. Oh and Wolfy came out and now my life is complete!!!. . I'll be back, Wolfy. I'll be back.
