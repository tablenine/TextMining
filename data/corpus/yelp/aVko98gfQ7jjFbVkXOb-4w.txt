My husband and I come here for the happy hour (which ends early at 6PM). It's packed on Fridays so we usually come on Wednesdays or Thursdays. They have cheap appetizers and we've had almost everything on the happy hour menu. . . I love the Firecracker chicken wings, which are deep fried crispy wings tossed with sesame garlic plum sauce. The california rolls are humongous, but mediocre in taste (but then again I don't really like fake crabs that they use to fill california rolls with). Pizza is good, calamari is good. Price is good. We usually spends around $20 for two, including drinks.
