Great simple food at excellent dining-out prices!. 2 people can have dinner here for $30-35 dollars.. Excellent-tasting food in a warm, communal table and byob environment.. . Pork &amp; Cilantro Gyoza appetizer is outstanding!. Great service too, for being a take-out, BYOB, and communal table restauirant.
