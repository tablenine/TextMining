I think I finally figured it out. Do NOT order the specials at Tender Greens if you are HUNGRY.. . Every single time I've walked in hungry, and saw the special (ooo salmon?? oooo lamb cheek?? NOM NOM!)... and ordered it, and the portions have been small and I've left hungry. =(. . The food was good but leaving hungry is not acceptable, especially when you can order one of the regular dishes like a huge salad or the salt-n-pepper chicken dinner with enormous scoops of mashed potatoes for the same price and be deliciously full!. . Ah well.. . The Culver City location has much better ambiance than the Hollywood one, too.
