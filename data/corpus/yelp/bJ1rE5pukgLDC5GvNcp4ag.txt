Okay, I went back last night for the second time and it was as delicious as ever. The pan-grilled grouper in green curry was AMAZING! The wait staff is very nice and attentive. We went for my friend's bday and they brought out the most delicious little cake for her and had her hit a gong (maybe it's good luck?). Anyway, we had a great time and the waitress split 10 checks without one Â mistake (or eye-roll).
