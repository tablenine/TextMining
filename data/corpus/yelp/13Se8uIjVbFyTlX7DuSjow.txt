Restaurant: Cypress Street Pint &amp; Plate
Category: American (New)
We had a yelp happy hour here to watch the debate, so I wanted to give a shoutout to the 'reserve a table' process - I talked to someone, and she had me email in to their events email, and I got a confirmed reply. Very nice. The table was set up for us, and though the server didn't split checks for everyone, he was actually quite good at serving our group of nearly 25 people. . . i also got to add two drinks to my Cypress repertoire, that being: . . The House Ale: wow, I didn't realize I could drink beer that fast! and only three dollars! . . Red Lemonade: Um, could I have one of these with a Chik Fil A sandwich midday sometime? That would really help me get through the day. . . Though I should really expand my horizons, the portobello burger was so tasty last time, I had to get it, yet again. I could've eaten two of 'em.
