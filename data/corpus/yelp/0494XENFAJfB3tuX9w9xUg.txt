They have a variety of choices, from breakfast food, dinner items, sandwiches, salads.  I had their Burger, which was pretty good and juicy.  It was pretty big with all the typical fixings, and I loved their fries and it's the thick fries that I love.  You also have to throw in their Mac and Cheese Balls, as those are just addicting.  . . It's a diverse crowd, from ripped jeans/tshirt, goth, to your trendy dressed up folks.  It's pretty crowded even into the evening but the wait usually isn't too bad (unless its prime time) and they do have outside seating area where you can smoke but can't drink.  Their alcoholic drink selection is limited...basically beer and wine...no cocktails.  . . Like most places in LA, the parking situation is one to be desired at this location.  Mostly street parking in residential areas and or they have a couple of paid parking lots not too far.  I think it was like $5 just behind the restaurant.  . . It's a great place to go chill and eat after an evening out on the town.  And their vast array of menu items makes it a definate place for multiple visits to try out other items on their menu.. . Service was up to scale....I sat at the bar once (you get quick refills on your coke).  The bathrooms could be a little cleaner I suppose...but this isn't a bathroom review so I'll stop there.. . Fun, hip place with good grub.
