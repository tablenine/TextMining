LOVED this restaurant and would eat here everynight if I could! Andrea's review was right on from last night (since I was dining with her), although she forgot to mention the delicious mushroom pizza we had in addition to the rest of all that food for $28/person. The wait was a little annoying since I was so hungry when we got there, but the food was well worth the wait.
