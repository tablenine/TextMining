A cool place with a good size patio--good for the summer when a lot of people want to eat outside. Too bad my partner was opposed to that. Bleh. The food is good, I had the Veggie Omelette- made with egg whites. Nice because places usually charge extra to have the egg white option. Came with potatoes and a corn muffin. Not really a fan of the muffin but the potatoes were good. My partner had the Crunch French Toast--this is a MUST HAVE! Out of all the brunch places I've been to- this is a first I'd ever seen. And totally ingenious! That crunch definitely compliments the toast, and it doesn't weigh the dish down and make it heavy. But remember- they close at 3pm on the dot! I got there the next day at 3:01 and they wouldn't seat us. I'll just have to dream about it until the next time I'm in Chicago.
