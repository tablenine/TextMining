Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
I think heaven is sprinkled on these pies!  Yes, it's touristy, yes, it may be overrated but when you come from the New England area and can't get really true pizza besides the North End in Boston, Giordano's is a great opportunity not to miss in Chicago.. . It does have it's kitschy overtones of Italy and patience is needed for the pizza to be made but it's worth the wait.  The crust was light and buttery and the thick pizza topped with sauce and gooey cheese, it makes you want more but you can only eat up to 3 slices.  . . Definitely to add on your to do list in chicago.  Deep dish pizza at its finest.
