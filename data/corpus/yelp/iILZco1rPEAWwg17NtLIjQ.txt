For some reason I didn't like this place.  I see there are a lot of 4 star reviews but I guess after eating at Sanamluang for so long, I'm not convinced with this place.  I ate here once and only because my friend said it's better than Sanamluang so I gave it a try.  I ordered the basic pad thai dish--that sucked.  Then I ordered some seafood dish and whenever I took a bite, it seemed like there was bits of crab shell or something in it.  The dishes to me wheren't tasty at all and even my girlfriend and my hubby didn't like it--we ended up not finishing anything and didn't doggy bag the leftovers.  I don't even remember what else I ordered.  So obviously the food wasn't memorable to me.  The place seems like it gets crowded often and the neon palm trees on the windows makes the place look more friendly too.  Hmmm... Sorry ya'll, I'm going with Sanamluang.  I gave the place two stars because the waiters came at a timely matter whenever my glass needed a refill of water.
