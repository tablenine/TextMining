This place is hidden.  If I didn't know - it was straight out of a warehouse.  I had the rabbit, veal and pork seasoned with white wine sausage under the 'exotics' section.  not bad at all.  Very light meat, and that's exactly how it was described in the menu.  I also had reissdorf kolsch beer to go along with it.  God, I love German beer.. . Some KEY FAQs:. Should you expect this place to taste as good as Germany?  No.  . Does it feel LA?  Absolutely.  . Is the beer still fantastic?  yes.. How's the service?  Great. Cleanliness?  Ambiance?  Tables were kept clean.  The vibe was good, very chill and easy-going.
