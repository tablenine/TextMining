Service was good, I will say that. Our server was knowledgable about the wine list, the specials (how it's prepared, ingredients, etc) and the menu in general. We had the duck and scallops, and I have to say it was pretty good, and the portion size was a good size as well- not too much food, not too little food. I'm all about atmosphere as well (can you not tell from my postings?) and I really like how cozy it is despite the lofty ceiling and large space. I would definitely go back, and I definitely recommend it!
