Needed to talk with a friend who is buying a condo in this building over a couple of beers. So here I am again. Nothing has changed. Its still awful. The service was really really bad this time.. Later: my credit card bill came so I had a chance to review my charges. The server had overcharged us, which I caught, then gave us the right bill, and then when she used my card added to it. I am sure it was just an accident.
