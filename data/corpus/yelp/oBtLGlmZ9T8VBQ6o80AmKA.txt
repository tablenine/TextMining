I don't think this place deserves so many negative reviews... although it certainly doesn't deserve gushing praise either. This is a pretty decent place. I've gone twice and I'd be totally down to go back again so long as someone else was paying because yes it is definitely a bit overpriced. I orginally came here because I read somewhere that they had the best fish and chips in LA. The Brit in my was super excited to come here and try them. I don't know what other fish and chips in LA taste like... but if this is the best the city has to offer then we are in a very sad state of affairs here. The batter was almost soggy and the fish was a weird consistancy... also the "chips" were nothing to write home about. That being said, they have some pretty great appetizers - I love love love their meat and cheese platters - totally delicious. Also the second time I came back I had the roasted lamb sirloin and it was very tasty... not amazing but quite good. Their dessert are also very good too. People keep complaining about the wait here, but they take reservations, so I don't think thats something complain about. They also have a fun atmosphere (although it can get quite noisy inside), and a nice outdoor seating patio.
