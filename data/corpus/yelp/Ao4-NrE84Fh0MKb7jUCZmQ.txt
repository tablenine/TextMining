Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Wishbone is one of my favorite brunch spots.  I have never ordered anything but breakfast items.. The breakfast potatoes are divine.  I'm not a grits fan, but my friends always order the cheese grits, so they must be good.  . In addition to their consistently great brunch, they have a full bar with great specialty drinks.. Overall, a great brunch spot!
