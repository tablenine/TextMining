Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
Last night, my awesome roommate brought home some takeout from here. To say the least, I was thoroughly impressed. Not only was I surprised to know that he knew of a restaurant that I haven't yet encountered (in MY hood nonetheless), but it was the best freaking Hainan chicken I've ever had. EVER. . . Now I don't want to hurt my mom's feelings, because she makes damn good Hainan chicken, but Savoy takes the prize in this case. The chicken is fresh and succulent, and the rice is moist and perfectly cooked in savory broth. Even the ginger sauce was good, and I don't even like ginger. . . I'm sorry mommy, I still love you....maybe even more than their chicken. I keed, I keed. DEFINITELY more than their chicken (although it's still friggin' fantastic)!
