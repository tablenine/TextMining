I won't go into detail because everyone else has, but for those of you who ordered the hickory burger and were not impressed, try a tuna sandwich next time. I really think that the tuna is the best thing they have. Aside from that, yeah, the burgers are pretty good, the fries are pretty good (nice and well done), and the apple pie is great.
