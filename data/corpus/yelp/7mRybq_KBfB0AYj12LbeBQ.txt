What else is there to say about this place after 475 reviews?  Well, it is a ramen joint that offers VERY SPICY ramen if you choose to order it.  I got the miso #5 and it was the perfect amount of spiciness for me.  Not super exciting ... Daikokuya is definitely better.  This place is just a novelty and that was why I wanted to try it.  If you like really spicy food and is curious of your chili threshold then you should give this place a try and order the Special #1 or #2.
