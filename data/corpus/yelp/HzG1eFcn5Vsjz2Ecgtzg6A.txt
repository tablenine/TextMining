This place is the bomb.  My husband and I went there for the first time yesterday and had Cubana and Pork Sandwich, Potato ball and Meat Pie.  Everything was really good.  We travel a lot and has been to many different countries and Restaurants. We rarely find the ones that meets our expectations and this one certainly did.  Since everything we tried was good, I had to get a cake to go.  The cake was the bomb too. Needless to say, we for sure go back in the near future.
