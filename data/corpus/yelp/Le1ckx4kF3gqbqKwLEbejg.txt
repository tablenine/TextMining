I will keep this short and sweet:. . Mozzarella Tasting: Great, the smoked one was very overwhelming to me, but I'm not a huge smoked anything fan.. Butter Lettuce antipasti: Very light and good. Grilled Octopus with Celery, Potato: Really great and kinda felt weird about those very American ingredients but they worked!. Egg &amp; Browned Butter Pasta with wild mushrooms: wow, the mushrooms were so flavorful! I'm sure that's thanks to all the butter!. Pancetta-wrapped Quail with honey glaze: Wow. The waiter suggested it, and he was so right. Life-changing. . . Also started with a Sugar Plum cocktail from the bar which was fun, girly, and very tasty!. . The bill came out to at least $150 for two of us. Yikes, but YUM!. . But man, if only Mario Batali himself was standing next to our table, reading us our menus... what a night that would have been!
