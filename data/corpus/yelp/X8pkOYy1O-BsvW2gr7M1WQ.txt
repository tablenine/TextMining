We came here to check out the space as a possible venue for a party of 175 people--the space is really modern and the food was reasonably priced.  Everything was great until the waiter thought it would be funny to pour my friend a glass of "water"(--literally, no joke) and tried to pass it off as Riesling...terrible thing to do, especially when you never know who you will be trying to fool...perhaps someone in the wine business! The even funnier thing was, one of us had the Riesling in a glass(all of us had glasses of water) to which we could compare the "water" version--there was no question that the glass of wine was water.  Apparently, this bartender thought he was Jesus!!! I have a tolerance for unwarranted bad service, but when it is deliberate as it was in this instance, it is beyond bad service and more close to being fraud--for this, I have zero tolerance.
