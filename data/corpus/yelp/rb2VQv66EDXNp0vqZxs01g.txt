What an amazing deal...I am a girl on a budget and this place serves awesome thai at a great price. Generally two people can come here and order appetizers, entree and desert, for less than $25. . . I recommend the Kow Soy, a yummy sweet and spicy soup with choice of meat and noodles. They also do a wicked panang curry.
