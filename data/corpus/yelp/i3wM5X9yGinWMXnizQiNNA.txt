Macaron Icecream Sandwich!!!. . When Anthony N from Playa told me about these, i immediately made some changes in my schedule so i can stop by MILK! . They have quite a few options- i went with the Red Velvet Cake macaron icecream sandwich. There wasn't anything really RV tasting about it, but it tasted good! The macaron shell was hard since it's not made to order and kept in the freezer section, but it was still very enjoyable. I really liked having an icecream sandwich option where it wasn't a cookie or brownie, but a MACARON!!!YUM! They are HUGE- perfect to share! The cookies here are yummy too!
