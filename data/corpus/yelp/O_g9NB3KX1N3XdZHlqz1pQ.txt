Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Since discovering Daikokuya 3 years ago, I have never missed a visit there when I go to Los Angeles.  I love the ramen.  Never asked, but I don't think MSG is used in the food there ('cause I don't spend the rest of the evening feeling thirsty).   Ah, I have to add that I like the plum wine served.  YUM!. . I recently returned from Los Angeles.  I enjoyed a bowl of the ramen and the tempura.  My friends liked the food too.  The food is consistently good, time and time again.  Was only able to enjoy the food once during my stay, but I'll be back.. . Aloha, Noe
