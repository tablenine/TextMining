Wish I would have yelped before I came, otherwise I would have been prepared for the Cash Only policy. . . Anyhoo was so not expecting the set up in this charming little diner.  Love walking into places that feels like you've been time warped into a whole other decade.. . The menu is simple, which I like.  Only about 12 total items to choose from.  We ordered and it did not take but less than 10 minutes for our food to come up.  The burgers: Orgasmic.  The pies: Orgasmic x100. Boysenberry Cream is what I got. I wanted to marry it.. . Parking wasn't too bad at the time we arrived, but I could imagine it being a pain at other times.  The other diners seemed to know the drill as they stood off to the side waiting for an available seat at the only counter available to eat at.. . Super cute, good food, amazing staff that seemed to really enjoy their jobs.. . Well done.
