Love thoes Beehives! . I have grown up in the neighborhood so I have to plug this place. . I have always enjoyed the bakery, but the breakfasts are really good too. . Since moving out of county, I still get email updates to neato happenings which is a nice reminder that there is more than just traffic in Chicago.
