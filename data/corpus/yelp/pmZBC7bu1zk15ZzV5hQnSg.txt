Porto's. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. . . Sandwich Cubano. Media Noche. Pan con Lechon. Potato balls. Meat Pie. Plantain . Cheese Rolls. Mango Mousse. Fruit Tart. Tres Leches. Red Velvet Cake. . The red velvet cake was a little too sweet and the cake was less moist compared to Auntie Em's RVC. It was my goddaughter's 1st birthday and we got her a RVC cake from Porto's and another RVC from Auntie Em's for her birthday party (separate days). . . But everything else, I love. The food, the people, the atmosphere, the hugeness of that place, you can always find a table unless you want one outside or during lunch/dinner time, you might have to wait. The parking can also be a problem. And the smoothie, they're not perfect. Either I get the fruits not at the prime ripeness or too ripe. Nevertheless, I'll go to Porto's over and over again. They just have too many good stuff to even bother about the not so good ones.
