Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I LOVE Pink's. This is my favorite late night, after the bar place to eat - as is it everyone else's! You could wait in line for more than an hour on a busy night but it is well worth it. This small eatery started as a single hot dog cart and is now a full swing dining experience. Located at the corner of Melrose and La Brea. Pink's is famous for it's dogs and it's attraction of local celebs. The walls are adorned with autographed picas of celebs from Richard Simons to Denzel. Demi Moore and Bruce Willis became engaged at Pink's and Pink's legacy is a Hollywood classic. There are several dogs to try named after celebs and movies alike. There's the Martha Stewart dog, Lord of the Rings dog, Ozzy Osbourne dog, etc. My favorite is the Mullholland Drive dog which is a 10 inch beef dog topped with saut√©ed mushrooms and onions, strips of bacon and nacho cheese. It's messy but delicious. All dogs and cooked to order so it'll always be fresh. The chili is a little greasy but just a good and you'd expect. Try Pink's out. I HAVE to get some every time I travel to LA! Oh, and a new location has just opened in Vegas!
