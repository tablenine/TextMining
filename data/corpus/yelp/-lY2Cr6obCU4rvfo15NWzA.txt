Restaurant: The Mermaid Inn
Category: Seafood
Another hit from the owners Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abrams.  A casual seafood place with a somewhat refined feel.  Do not bring any non-seafood eaters though!  I believe there is not one chicken or beef dish on the menu.  If you love seafood, then definitely come on in.  The waitstaff is friendly and if the weather's right, there a few tables in the small back garden.  . http://www.themermaidn....
