Restaurant: Watershed
Category: American (New)
After several trips to Watershed, I decided to take my yankee transplant of a mother there.  She hates southern food, but after a mere two hours of wine, food, and southern hospitality, I might have converted her.  . . Favorites: fried chicken, shrimp &amp; grits (I don't even like grits!), and the duck.  Even though I'm usually too full to eat it there, I will always order a piece of very good chocolate cake to take home and eat late at night when I am still dreaming of Scott Peacock's food.
