I went to Highland Bakery with a few coworkers for a long lunch to escape a highly unproductive workday. The place has a cozy feeling (read: seating is tight) and I love the interior with the exposed brick wall. . . Because of my ongoing love affair with french toast, I ordered their Peanut Butter French Toast. The first thing I noticed is that their french toast is massive! I have a healthy appetite but this french toast was a beast. A delicious beast though. Probably one of the best french toasts I've ever had. The saltiness of the peanut butter really worked well with the syrup and bananas. And the challah bread was perfectly cooked. It was the highlight of my day. Â . . My description does not do the flavors justice, just go try it. But I do recommend sharing it with someone else unless your end goal is to have a massive food coma.
