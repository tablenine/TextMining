I will take the pulled pork plate with a side of sweatpants please! Â A full 24 hours later I am still licking my lips from last nights dinner at Community BBQ. The best thing is that I had leftovers from the generous portions. The cole slaw had a great crunch and just the right zip and zing, mac and cheese tasted rich and super cheesy (just the way I like it) and the greens were spot on. Banana pudding was a tasty way to end the meal but not push me over the edge. Just the right dinner on a cold winter night...and you better believe I will be eating here during the other three seasons as well.
