3.5 stars (rounded to 4) because everything was good to great, but nothing wow'ed me.. . The service is definitely on point. The waitstaff isn't overly friendly, but they're definitely attentive and are intuitive as to when you're finished your plate and when to bring the next thing. They serve great sushi. We got the lobster specialty roll - lobster, crab, cilantro, mango all in a roll, yum! My chirashi bowl would have been fantastic, but the rice had a bit too much vinegar. The appetizer was way too greasy with flavorless sauce. . . Also, I agree with everyone below. Go upstairs for a more intimate environment.
