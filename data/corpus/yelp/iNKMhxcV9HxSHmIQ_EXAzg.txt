Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I heard so much hype about this place and it sucks Sweaty Monkey Nuts. . . I ate there late Sat night with about 6 people and none of them liked their food.  The hot dogs looked disgusting (a bad case of quantity over quality) and my turkey sandwich was just okay.  I don't understand why people will wait in a long line to eat here late night.  Maybe they're just too drunk to even care.. . (Side note:  I try to avoid reviewing restaurants, but I couldn't resist this one)
