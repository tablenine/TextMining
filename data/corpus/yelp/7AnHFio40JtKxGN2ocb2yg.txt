I love that it is BYOB and the environment.  I really enjoy some of their pizzas, but as far as pizza is concerned its really pretty average.  Last time I was there for lunch as service was worse than usual despite not being busy.  I got a grilled cheese that was far too greasy.. . Its a great place to go on a nice night.  You can go sit upstairs outside.  Drink your own booze and socialize with friends.  There are not a lot of outdoor locations in Hyde Park.  Its worth taking advantage of.
