I like B Bar.  I came here back in the days when I lived up on Mercer Street, and it was always a place you could rely on to have a fun, festively lit garden, can order food, expect decent service, standard cocktails, and inoffensive music.  Years later, I can always pop over here to find exactly that and that's something you gotta appreciate -- consistency.. . The people who come in here will vary -- you can find casually dressed down folks to flirty cocktail dresses and high heels.  Even so, it doesn't matter -- sometimes it looks like a sheeshy exclusive bar, but in actuality it's not.  All is welcome!. . Biggest bummer are the prices -- I just hate bars that insist on charging that extra unnecessary dollar on bottles -- $7 for Amstel Light makes me wrinkle my nose.
