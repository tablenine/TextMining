I don't even know where to start. Everything was mediocre. We were told that the wait is 45 minutes, which is acceptable since the reviews were so good. We actually waited a little over 1.5 hours. Several groups who came after us were seated before us. (we were a party of 2) Couldn't help but notice that the groups that were let in front of us were all asian. hmmm..... The servers were rude. Didn't make sure our waters or sauces were refilled. At some point, one of the servers just grabbed the dish of garlic that was I using without asking and never brought it back. The food was ok, nothing special.
