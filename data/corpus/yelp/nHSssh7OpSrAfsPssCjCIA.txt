3.5 but i'm rounding up just because of the overall experience.. . what can i say that 390 people haven't already said?  probably nothing.  so i'll just say that philippe is a great place to go after watching SC crush the Huskies.  the place was packed.  and we left during the 3rd quarter!  when we left an hour later, there was cardinal red everywhere.  . . it's your average french dipped sandwich, except you don't get to dip it yourself.  ask for the sandwich double dipped, otherwise you'll only have one end dipped.  it's not just beef though, as they have pork, turkey and lamb too.  the lamb was actually quite good, not filmy at all.  i wish the swiss was melted on my beef.  the chili was very hearty.  they have cole slaw, macaroni salad, potato salad and chips as sides, but no fries.  and yeah, i appreciate the $0.70 lemonade or $0.60 iced tea, but i'd rather pay more for a larger glass.  . . reasonable prices (5 people ate and drank plenty for $56).  . beer on tap. . crowded but plenty of seating available.. a convenience store inside the restaurant?  never seen that before!. free parking (even with a guy pointing you to open spots).    . and trojan fans everywhere.  if i ever get to go to an SC game again, i wouldn't mind coming back here.. . CASH ONLY
