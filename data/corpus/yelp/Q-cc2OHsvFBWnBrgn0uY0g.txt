It just goes to show that people who live outside of your neighborhood will see things you have completely missed (in spite of your having lived there for quite some time).  I went with a friend, and loved the vibe of this cute bar.  We shared a couple of small plates: 1) serrano ham, manchego cheese &amp; tomato relish toasts, and 2) three cheeses (which I have forgotten).  Both were pretty good.  I would like to come here for a real dinner some time, as well as try their wine.  As others have mentioned, they have a ton of hard-to-find beers.  This was a great introduction to a new place in an old neighborhood.  I'll probably go again.
