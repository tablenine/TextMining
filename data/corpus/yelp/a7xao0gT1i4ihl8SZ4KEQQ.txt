Aside from the long waits (even if you go before it opens), Sushi Gen doesn't disappoint during lunch time.  I have tried the Chirashi and Sashimi sets.  For $15, thats relatively inexpensive for Japanese food.  And they give you sooo much food.  Just look at the photos!   I try to eat here whenever I'm in the downtown area on a weekday, which is not very often.  The fish is fresh and everything else is delightful. . . If you are around Little Tokyo and have two hours for lunch, its well worth it.  If you have less time for lunch, you'll need to show up at 11 (Sushi-Gen opens at 11:15), or you'll probably need to wait half an hour since people line up early.   Also, parking is $1.50 with validation for two hours.   I haven't been here for dinner yet, but I expect the plates to be relatively more expensive with the same portions.
