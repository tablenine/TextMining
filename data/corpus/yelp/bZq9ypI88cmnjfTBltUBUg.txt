Restaurant: Little Five Corner Tavern
Category: Bars
The Corner Tavern is a great bar, even in an area like Little 5 Points that has many great bars. The Corner sticks out, though, in that the atmosphere is consistently nice. The smoke is never too bad to sit down and enjoy a meal and a beer, and it is never too loud to enjoy a conversation.. . The beer list is great - Old Engine Oil, several great Belgians, and so on make it worthwhile.. . The food, also, is great, from the brunches to the burgers. Highly recommended.
