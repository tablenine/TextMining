Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Of all the many notable restaurants in Little Tokyo, Shabu Shabu House is prominent because of its link to history. According to . http://Wikipedia.com. ,. . "Shabu Shabu House in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, California, USA was the first Shabu Shabu specialized restaurant in North America in the early 1990s. Since then Shabu Shabu has spread out over the rest of the state.". . WE'RE EATING HISTORY FOLKS- this place is THE original shabu shabu restaurant in NORTH AMERICA! . . While Shabu Shabu House may not have all the extra bells and whistles that seem to define what eating shabu shabu is like in Southern California now, its no-frills execution is what keeps those god-awful lines going on and on and on.. . If you want to eat here, I'd say set aside AT LEAST half-an-hour to wait- don't go on a Monday (because it's closed) and try to avoid typical meal times (i.e. 11 am to 1 pm, 6 pm to 8 pm) if you don't want a long wait in line. The minute you get into the restaurant, scope out the surroundings, then FIND the clipboard and put your John Hancock on the queue line!. . When you do get seated, take a moment to praise the Good Lord for gracing you with this hard-fought seat, then set about the serious task of ordering drinks (you waited so long, get a beer!) and your meal. I say go for the large combination, always... It's like a $5 difference, and you have that psychological comfort that follows when you know you're going "all-in" for this special meal.. . From there, it's pretty self-explanatory. Shabu shabu means "swish-swish", so go ahead and swish-swish away! Remember to tip well and thank the manager- the poor old guy works so hard, he deserves a good pat on the back!. . And so do you... Congratulations, you just had a taste of history!
