Restaurant: Daddy D&#39;z BBQ Joynt
Category: Barbeque
Although I favor vinegar or mustard based bbq sauce, the fact is the smoked ribs and pork here just can't be beat.  Melt-on-yer-tongue-tender &amp; just plain good.  I get the "hot" bbq sauce on the side and then spike it up with hot sauce to add a little vinegar twang.  The iced tea is excellent and always fresh, as well as the sides, which are also made  daily...collard greens, red beans &amp; rice, mac-n-cheese, broccoli casserole, fried okra, candied yams...and the cornbread is like freaking' dessert.  I love the grunginess &amp; 'tude that comes with the place as well.  I find it amusing that several reviews comment  on the "shady" neighborhood factor.....they should have seen it 10 years ago.   The city of Atl is basically making a greenspace from the Capitol to Oakland cemetary and I can only hope Daddy D'z can hold it's sacred spot along the strip!
