Restaurant: Fado Irish Pub
Category: Pubs
this place is a great irish pub to go to when you want to sit and drink with friends because its huge and you can usually find a seat. the patio out back is small, but the inside is cozy and relaxing. this isn't what you'd think of when you think of a buckhead bar, its not super expensive and it kinda has a neighborhood feel, as though its not so much for the tourist type looking for a night out in buckhead.. . sometimes the bands are good, but they're always so loud you cant hear yourself think, so if youre looking for conversation avoid the band nights.. . i heard so many promotions about this place for st. patricks day, it sounded like fun!
