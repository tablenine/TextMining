WARNING. Don't go here and eat and drink wine and think you'll be able to make it awake at a movie across the street. It won't happen. I loved this place. I had the special crepe of the night, an asparagus and mushroom crepe with a cheese and wine sauce. So damn good. Had 2 glasses of wine and split a dessert crepe with my sweetie and then we went to a movie at Century. OK, the movie was pretty slow, but I have NEVER fallen asleep at the movies...b/c it's one of my favorite things to do and you bet, there I was snoozing away. So, next trip...I'll indulge in more wine and forget about a movie after.
