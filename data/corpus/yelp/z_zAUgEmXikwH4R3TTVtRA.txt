After years of wanting to go to this place, I finally did!  It's been on my list of places to go, but I often forget about it.  I ordered a hamburger with sweet potato fries (!).  Both were delicious.  My friends all ordered dessert and drinks.  The cobbler was a bit of a disappointment, but the chocolate cake stole the show.  Yum.  . . Our server was great.  She was attentive and familiar with the menu selections.  It's a very low key atmosphere.  Several people there were on what appeared to be date night.  The candles and wine list must be a big draw!  . . Tip: check out the bathroom.  Weird, I know.  The artwork is beautiful and probably the best out of the entire restaurant.  Just do it.
