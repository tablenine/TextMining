Went for the Yelp Veggie Meetup and it was my first time there.  I liked it!. . I am sure that being here in the summer with a large group is much easier than the winter since their sidewalk patio on Division, like all patios on Division, is freakin huge!  The interior is kind of small yet would be great for a date.  Dark, dimly lit and I could envision as really romantic.  The food is like Wicker Park's version of Green Zebra yet not priced like Green Zebra.  . . I had a Mana Slider - awesome due to the killer spicy mayo; a cup of polenta - great and very filling for just $2; a glass riesling - refreshing; sweet potato pancakes - wonderful due to the crema (what ever the heck it is supposed to be, reminds me of sour creme); sesame peanut noodles - served cold yet great; and my bill was less than 30 (we were sharing though - shhhhh). . The food here is really fresh, high-quality, and sapid.. . If you are a vegetarian and want another Green Zebra~esque option go here.  You won't regret it.
