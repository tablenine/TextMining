let me tell you, so much better and cheaper than cole's... . i always get the beef sandwich with swiss.. . my favorite part is the mustard. i get excited about that feeling in my nose... . . and the iced tea is only 65 cents!. . just make sure not to go during lunch time, it can get really crowded. i went on saturday night last time and there were barely any people in there and the crowd was quite interesting.
