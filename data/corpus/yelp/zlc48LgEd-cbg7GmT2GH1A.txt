Up until last night, I had been dreaming of a special Ramen I had only found in a dive in San Francisco.  Thankfully, that dream is now a sweet reality, and almost in my 'hood, no less.  . . My cousin and I split an order of dumplings, the chicken mango rice ball and the pork belly ramen.  It wasn't long after we ordered that we were giggling and slurping down the contents of the bowls.  The chicken was crispy, resting atop plump pieces of mango.  The ramen was divine porcine, in a rather dark mushroomy broth.  The long, chewy noodles were perfectly cooked.   A little hot sauce on the top, and I was almost singing. . . Yvonne was very lovely, stopping by our table for a brief chat while her husband's red bandana bobbed and weaved in the kitchen.    We promised her that we would be back, now that we're hooked.. . The BYOBness works well too.  As there was a wait, we walked down to the Orbit Room for a quick beer, but there's a bodega nearby that sells cold ones too.  Yvonne mentioned their desire to open a wine shop next door, but that might be a while.
