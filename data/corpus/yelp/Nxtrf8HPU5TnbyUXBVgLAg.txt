We had patio brunch here today.  It wasn't super busy and the food is excellent.  I had the skirt steak &amp; eggs.  The steak comes already sliced and it's so flavorful that I didn't need any steak sauce.  The brioche french toast and applewood smoked bacon is to die for.  The best I've ever had.  Price is also pretty reasonable...and my tummy &amp; wallet are just happy all around.
