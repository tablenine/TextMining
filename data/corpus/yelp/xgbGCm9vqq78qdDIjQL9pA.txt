Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
Every dish that we got made us say "mmmm" but some dishes needed a little extra sauce. Â Prices were reasonable, especially for the noodle bowls which are a decent portion of veggies, carbs, and protein. This review is sounding so technical! Anyway, the ambiance was nice, the service was very attentive, and the people-watching was great, as it always is in Silverlake. Overall Gingergrass is a solid establishment that seems to mix it up just enough to keep the place a-buzzing.
