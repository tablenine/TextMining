Restaurant: The Shed at Glenwood
Category: American (New)
No. No. No. I went on a whim and it was, such a cute space! And the service had such personality! But, Eggs Benedict (fried green tomato, hollindaise, poached egg and biscuit with a side of potatoes w/ sun-chokes) was lack luster at best. the whole plate is about the same beige color. The other dish at the table was the quiche, which is served room temp. In fairness our server told us, prior to ordering, but that still made the dish lacking. I eat only one part of my Benedict. It just lacks flavor.....my waiter asked if I wanted to order something else ( this is how service saves a restaurant , and a nice touch) I did not order anything else. But it made me sad, the food was not better. and while others talk about the sliders this place is not cheap, so I cant imagine paying $5.00 a slider, just to give them another chance.
