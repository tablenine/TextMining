Simply put the food and service are bad . . .still bad. The person working behind the silver counter doesn't even ask how you are doing, not even a hello. Before I could even finish saying &amp;quot;Hi,&amp;quot; I was interrupted with, &amp;quot;For here or to go.&amp;quot; Â Like I have written before I have had colleagues report getting sick after eating here . . .. . I ate there as a last resort the other day.. . Why is this place opening up other locations around the city? God help us.
