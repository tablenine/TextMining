***Disclaimer: I've never been here sober, so take from this what you will...***. . I love Taco Cabana!  A great late-night/after hours spot where you can really satisfy your post-alcohol cravings.  The food is delish.  I always eat inside (I never even knew there was a drive-thru, Ric T??) and it's good times.  Too bad I do not live super close by but a couple of my friends do so I think it's time to pay another visit... seriously though, you should at least try it once :)
