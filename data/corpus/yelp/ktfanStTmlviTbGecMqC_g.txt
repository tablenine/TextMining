Yum! I can't wait to come back here again! After going to Louise's AND Crumbs last night, my friends and I still wanted to try MILK. . . I tried not to be too much of a glutton and got two milkies, one mint chocolate and one berry vanilla. Berry vanilla was the best. I also got an ooey gooey chocolate cookie and OH MY it was yummy! I'm usually not a chocolate cookie person because they usually aren't that good. I usually go for chocolate chip and things like that, but this was the most ultimate chocolate cookie I've ever eaten. It was so rich that I even had to share with my friends. My friends pretended that they were eating light that night and shared a banana butterscotch icecream bar. It was banana icecream with a butterscotch coating. Two of my most favorite things put together into one delicious bar. I had a bite and it was so good. I wanted to order more, but I didn't want to look like a pig. The tables around us were already staring at me while I ate multiple bites from my three Crumbs cupcakes. I'll have to come back here with my mom or boyfriend...very very soon... :D
