I am kind of head over heels for Big Star. . . Four of my coworkers and I were able to get to Big Star at 4:30 on a weekday and score a booth (which seat 5 easily). Although service was a little slow to start, once it got rolling, it was decent. . . Our table ordered guac, chips and salsa, and cocktails to start. Ooh, yummy lime-y salty warm chips. Holy shit. We liked them so much we needed another order. I had the pork belly and al pastor tacos, and the frijoles charros. Pork belly = amazing (as it always does), al pastor was very good too, but I wish I had a few extra pineapple chunks to adorn my taco, and the frijoles charros...so so good. Like the soupy beans you get in Mexico for breakfast: pintos, queso, onion, cilantro, and bacon with a few delicious tortillas for the sopping. All of this was enough to fill me up and then some (2 tacos, frijoles, and chips). . . Coworker #1 got the taco de lengua, which he thought was the best. (lengua from what, who knows). Coworker #2 got the fish tostada, which she really loved - it looked amazing. . . As far as cocktails go, the Hud (whiskey, bitters, and tangerine) was very smooth, but not as citrus-y as I would have liked; the whiskey and ginger cocktail was definitely my favorite...though it was called "too intense" by someone else, I loved ti. I sampled the rootbeer and whiskey drink which was as thick and creamy as a Guinness, but with whiskey - somehow it worked. . . On a final note, the sweet tooth kicked in and an order of the dulce de leche milkshake was passed around. If you take home on thing from this review, it should be "Must order MILKSHAKE." Maybe not the best idea after a belly full of whiskey, but for $4, it is oh so necessary. Super effing delicious.
