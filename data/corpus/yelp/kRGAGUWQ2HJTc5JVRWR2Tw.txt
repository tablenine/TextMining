SO....first time to Toast and here are my thoughts..... . I went to Toast with my family (2 adults, 2 kids) on a mid week early afternoon.....there was seating outdoors available upon arrival so we were off to a good start....one step forward.... . Two steps back....noticed that the ketchup bottle was covered in ketchup and so was the table....this encouraged me to inspect the caps of both the ketchup and the hot sauce (I did not have to look too hard)....and I found grossness....I have been in the business for many years, so sometimes it is the small things that I get stuck on....this is one of them.  It takes each server no more than 4 or 5 minutes  and some hot water to maintain the condiments presented on the table....it makes me wonder what the back of the storage cabinets and the hard to reach corners look like when I see negligence front and center...... . On to the food.....two omelets, one coffee cake French toast, and one waffle with caramel and bananas.  The omelets left quite a bit to be desired....the eggs were rubbery and the ingredients in the omelets seemed to be randomly tossed in rather than evenly spread out....again a lack of attention to detail that compromised my guest experience.....the other two dishes were fantastic though....can't wait to attempt the coffee cake French toast at home!. . The service staff was all very friendly and fairly attentive (though I could have used one more cup of coffee), so that wins points too.  Maybe they are all in a good mood because they don't have to do side work?. . Overall, I would go back if in the area and wanting outdoor seating and a decent breakfast at a fair price, but can't really see myself raving about it to friends....
