I just had to write a review for a lovely, week night dinner we had! This place is awesome! .     Hubby and I went here for our anniversary. We split the crab cake appetizer. Delicious! then we split the strawberry/mixed greens salad, it was excellent. The parmesan cheese added a interesting twist I wouldn't think to pair with strawberries, but yum! .     Meanwhile, our server was excellent. I forget his name but he was around to make sure things were delicious but not too much that he might as well have sat with us! I hate when they're like that. Tastefully bussed the table as well and didn't try to drown me with water!! Thank you..     For dinner I had the Butterfish with the seasonal preparation-an asian flare! Bok Choy, Daikon radishes, edamame, noodles. It was perfectly citrus in flavor and not too salty! Hubby had the filet/Lobster tail combo. The steak was excellent, perfectly medium rare and nicely seasoned. The lobster was out of this world. I felt like I was in Maine having just boiled a fresh lobster. The flavor was sweet and buttery and was awesome.. For our anniversary they brought us a complimentary dessert. We chose the carrot cake and it was just as good. It's not my favorite dessert but it's hubby's favorite and he was pleased!.     Excellent meal with 3 glasses of wine $150! That's a lot but we ate a lot too! $20-some for a wonderful piece of fish is worth it to me! . Only grip, it's loud downstairs in the dining room because of the kitchen. So consider when taking elderly guests here. . WE WILL BE BACK FOR SURE!
