I have never been to a place where everything on the menu sounded delicious and actually was delicious. From the burger to meatloaf to the chicken and all the appetizers I have never been disappointed. The portions are generous and the food has plenty of flavor. The wait is usually long on the weekend so its best to make reservations. The only down side is that like most businesses in the area the square footage leaves something to be desired so there isn't a place to stand when you're waiting. There is free valet parking which really helps because the highlands parking situation is less than ideal at best.. . I highly recommend this place and I take all my visiting family here and they love it too.
