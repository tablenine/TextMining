Restaurant: Luckie Food Lounge
Category: Lounges
I just visited Luckie Lounge last Friday (Jul 20, 07).  When I first walked in I was sort of confused...I simply wanted a glass of wine and some sushi and there was so  much going on in there.  . . The sushi was pretty good (I had something they called the Charm). The service was sort of sad, although I got the impression that they WANTED to provide good service BUT they sort of fell short in that area to me.  How hard is it to get a girl ONE sushi roll and ONE glass of wine.  I will go back because the food was good and the price was reasonable. I just hope the service will improve overtime.
