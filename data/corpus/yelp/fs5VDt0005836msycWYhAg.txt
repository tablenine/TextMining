after almost 2 car accidents following desert friend to this most talked about cuban indulgence, we finally got the chance to stop by on an early sunday afternoon. it was quite an adventure coming up here avoiding the traffic on the 5 to the 91 to the 110.. oh wait, detour to the 134 and oh yay, we're here. in one piece!. . so once we got in, all we see are lines.. line at the take out counter, oh-forget-about-it line in the dessert section and a shorter, bearable line for sandwiches. we were hungry and need more than just sweets. oh yes, ma'am. the menus were not all about satisfying ur sweet tooth. we made our decision in a quick second. we read lechon and we're sold! pan con lechon please and don't forget those famous potato balls on the side. yes, potato balls. mashed potatoes with seasoned beef baked into perfect round shaped yumminess. we topped it off with a fruit tart, fresh with a flaky crust and just light to the taste and the parisian, a slice of chocolate heaven, enough sweetness that just melts in ur mouth.. . despite the look of frustration at the look of those lines, service was great. the very helpful gentleman behind the counter took our orders right and had some very tasty recommendations. we didn't have a long wait for our order at all, definitely a good thing! they sure keep the place clean with tons of servers picking up right after when someone leaves and there's ample space both inside and out. maybe on our next visit, we'll try to score a table outside enjoying both delectable goodies and the CA weather... . a comeback is a must!
