I guess I expected too much... This is a nice restaurant, not spectacular. The view is pretty good, not the best. The food was better than I had read in these reviews. I had the Wagyu and it's hard to mess it up and I liked the sauce that it came with. The dinner bill for 2 with 2 glasses of wine and some appetizers and dessert was about $150. Service was decent, not the best and I don't think they were deserving of the percentage scaled tip I gave them of 20% (I feel bad if I give them anything less).. . I won't be coming back here, even on a special occasion because I simply don't think it's worth it. I expected a nicer restaurant with better decor and was disappointed. I honestly would rather go to Orange Hill 10x over this place. The view is better and it has a better ambience. That's what this restaurant is missing, the right ambience...
