Being from New York and having never been further south along the east coast than Virginia, I just wanted two things from my trip to Atlanta: to visit the World of Coca-Cola and to enjoy good southern eats.  Being a Coke-head, the former was like getting a golden ticket to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory except I didn't have to guzzle down 100 cases of Coke to get inside.  To fulfil my latter wish, I went to Watershed.. . I must confess that I walked in with preconceptions of how a restaurant serving southern food should look and feel, and well Watershed did not meet my expectations.  I imagined a southern colonial style home complete with a columned entry, cozy fireplace, and a large willow in the front.  Instead, I was greeted by nouveau southern to the point where I almost thought I was going to a southern food restaurant in Manhattan with double the floor space.  Even their smaller menu was reminiscent of New York.. . However, as soon as our waiter greeted us with some southern hospitality which cannot be recreated up north, I gradually set my biases aside, and actually appreciated the Watershed for being the Watershed.  They have a relatively small menu, but I had the roast duck with glazed sweet potatoes and local greens.  Superb.  The duck was really juicy and flavorful.  They also have an extensive wine list.  The atmosphere was nice, although the larger space made it more open and conversation gets lost in larger groups that are on distant antipodes of the table.. . So, unfortunately, I did not quite have the "southern experience" I was looking for at Watershed.  Instead, I had an excellent meal.
