So, the woman and I drove up to P-dena for the day from San Diego to check out the Norton Simon.  We were looking to kill some time before driving back and decided to get a bite to eat.  We were driving down Colorado and saw Bar Celona, looked pretty decent and there was an open spot on the street in the next block so we stopped.  Nice decor, good tunes, looks good so far.  It was before dinner rush so we decide to eat at the bar, 'cuz nobody was sitting there.  Nice bartender, very personable, knows how to pour a beer and make lychee Cosmos, threw us some free olives.  The food?  Another story.  Good shrimp appetizer, the endive salad was decent but I f*cked up by ordering the most expensive paella dish ($24), because I grew up eating the stuff.  Why was it lousy?  Because saffron, garlic and other fresh spices costs money.  The rice tasted like it came out of a Zatarain's box, and the shellfish was overcooked.  Why didn't I send it back?  See previous description of bartender, 'knows how to pour a beer'.  I'm still pissed that I didn't send it back, which is why I'm writing this review.  I've read that this is a great trolling spot, but be warned - stop by In 'n' Out before you walk in.
