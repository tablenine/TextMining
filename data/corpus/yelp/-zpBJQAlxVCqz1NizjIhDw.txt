Restaurant: Overland Café
Category: American (New)
Really good food, so-so on the priceyness, but in a pleasant atmosphere (if you can ignore the constant drone of traffic on Overland).. . I've been to the Overland Cafe twice, and both times I've had tasty food. I can't remember what I ordered last time around, but this time I had the cheese quesadilla and fish taco appetizers. Both were excellent (too many peppers in the quesadilla for my taste, but I don't really like peppers at all).  Add in two good beers (the hefeweizen was excellent), and all in all, a great meal.. . Not generally too busy, but always has customers. (The only exception is during the all-you-can-drink champagne for $5 breakfasts on the weekends, which pack the place. I haven't made it to one of those yet, mainly because I haven't wanted to stand in line.). . Another tip: Happy hour specials from 4-7 *every* day... $2.50 beers and house wine and $5 appetizers (quite a discount).
