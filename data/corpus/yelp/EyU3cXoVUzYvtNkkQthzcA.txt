Went here for take out last night.. Hopped on the board and rolled over.. . Sat out front and smoked a cigarette while I scoped out the menu. It was around 9 pm and I'm pretty sure they close at 10 pm and the place was still hopping. Always a good sign at a sushi bar, you know there is a better chance they are always receiving new product due to quality business.. . I decided on my favorite roll of all time (boston roll). I figured hey, I have had it at countless other sushi places all over.. Let's see how this one stacks up. Well, it stacked up... Boston roll was great.. . I also got some nigiri- Flounder (hirame), yellow tail (hamachi), red snapper (tai), and sea bass (suzuki).. Tai, and Suzuki are two of my favorite pieces of fish. They did not disappoint, neither did the other pieces. The smell, taste, texture.. Everything was on point.. . This place is really worth all the good reviews it's receiving. The prices are just right, and my take-out took FIVE MINUTES!! Are you serious?!? I could barely finish my cigarette and my food was ready. THAT'S WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. This place rules.
