The hostess to the server to the busser were all helpful, friendly and quick.  The interior was pleasant, but I have to agree with Viona Y--acoustics sucked. . . The food was just okay; the ratio of size:taste:cost does not make this place a standout (and i went in expecting gourmet portions). . . While the fish was very fresh and selection fair, I would rather go for sushi at Sai Cafe and not worry about being hungry an hour later. . . However, I would go back for a drink at the bar.  Wine was expensive, but very good--the Maderia was superb.  Also a must: Ahi Tuna Steak Tartare.
