Love Shack tune, begin. . . The Belly Shack is a little new place . where we can get together . Belly Shack baby, Belly Shack bay-bee. . Love baby, that's where it's at, . Ooo love baby, that's where it's at.. . Korean + Puerto Rican = Korican Cuisine!. . I'm a fan. Bill Kim strikes again...and I like this one BETTER than Urban Belly. Yeah, I so said it. Better!. . "Hot &amp; Sour" Soup w/ hominy + chicken + cilantro (this is a MUST, must...especially on a rainy day). Korean BBQ Kogi w/ Ssam Paste (very filling, bread comes separate = no drippy/soggy sammies! KBBQ perfection). Tostones w/ chimmichurri sauce (whoa, garlic). Seasonal Kimchi (standard). Cute Alumican of Diet Coke. . About on par with prices at Urban Belly...lunch for 4 (obviously we ordered a lot) was probably around $60 or so. . . Counter service, though they are quick to deliver and bus, refill waters, etc. Very friendly...parking is spotty, but public trans options are quite plentiful. . . I do miss Vella (oh, our relationship was so brief, veggie goddess), but this is a great addition to the 'hood. And, if you are a blue line rider...you have no excuse. Its spittin' distance from the train...GET off. Order. GET back on. Voila, Korican food! . . BK, FTW.
