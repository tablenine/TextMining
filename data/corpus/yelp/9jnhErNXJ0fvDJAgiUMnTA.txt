I love this place because it's a late night diner, a great place to go after partying. I always get their mac daddy cheese balls and tuna melt. It's soooooo good. Everything else is pretty good, their juicy lucy burger and their salmon stack are amazing.. It's like a take your buddy for a quick bite kinda place, nothing fancy.
