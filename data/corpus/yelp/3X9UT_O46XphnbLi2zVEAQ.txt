This place does not take reservations, so when I decided to go with a friend on a Saturday night at 7pm, I was a little scared we wouldn't be able to find seating.  However, it was perfectly fine, and I was told Ping Pong doesn't get busy until around 8pm.  I've walked by this place numerous times and each time I think "ooh, I need to go there".  Well, I'm glad I did!  I'm assuming the minimalist wall decor is meant to enhance one's dinner conversation, but I bet it can also enhance the silence and awkwardness of a first date.  However, if you're going with old friends or people you really 'click' with, it shouldn't be a problem. . . Ping Pong is BYOB ($5 corkage fee for wine, but I was also charged for brining in a six pack of mike's hard lemonade) but also boasts a full bar with signature martinis.  The staff are friendly and cool and contribute to the very chic hip atmosphere of Ping Pong.  But don't think this place is all about the scene!  The food here was AMAZING!  Here's a list of what we had:. -lettuce cups. -fish tacos. -garlic mussels. -red snapper. . The fish tacos was the only so-so dish of the evening.  But that doesn't mean it wasn't a good dish.  It just means, I'm Mexican and I should've known better.  We were so stuffed by the end of our meal, we couldn't even consider getting desert.  Next time, however, its on....
