It's no lie -- this place is pricey! But you know what, there are some serious things here that are well worth the money. The decor is a no-brainer. Beautiful and serene blue tile wall with water sliding downward against those posed divers... great stuff. The wait staff, in my several times here, were very attentive and pleasant. They are known for several things -- the guacamole is one. I come here for the guacamole. Never mind that it's $14. It's frickin AWESOME. Secondly, they love touting their pomegranite margarita, but a caution with this one: PASS on the drink. The margarita's are overpriced and WAY too sweet (even for people I know with a serious sweet tooth). The pomegranite flavor gets lost along the way and it makes you wonder why you spent that much cash on it. Stick with either some wine or a beer. It's Mexican, after all -- beer is so appropriate.. . Dish-wise, in my last outing, the enchiladas de jaiba were excellent. Loved the sauce, with just the right amount of kick, and the crab was had a lovely taste. The real dish of the day was the filete con hongos. The mushroom-tequila sauce was just unbelievable. I wanted to steal my BF's dish and eat that sauce! Both dishes are $23 and $26 respectively, to give you an idea of the cost. . . It's not an everyday thing, certainly. But every once in a while isn't bad. :) Remember... GUACAMOLE!!
