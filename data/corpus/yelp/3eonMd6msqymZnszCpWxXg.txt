This is my 2nd time here and the food is good.  My first time was during restaurant week, so we got some extra food, which was a plus!  This time we went on a week night and it wasn't busy.. . FOOD: I had the massamun curry with chicken($13) which was good.  It contained potatoes and carrots with the chicken and curry.  I don't know if it was intentional, but there was a splash of coconut milk in the middle of it.  It didn't alter the taste in any way.. . TIP:  Parking may be limited if it's crowded.
