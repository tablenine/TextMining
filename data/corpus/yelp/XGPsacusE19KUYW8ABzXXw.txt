I give this place 6 stars, i LOVE it!! it's so delicious, the service is fast and they're very nice and you gotta give them credit for that 'cause the place is always packed!! Â my favorite thing horchata smoothie, i normally dont like super sweet drinks but for this i make an exception, i love you PORTOS!!
