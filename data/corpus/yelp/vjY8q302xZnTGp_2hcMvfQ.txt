Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Upon first glance, Shinsengumi has an uncanny resemblance to a ramen joint that one can find in the bustling cities of Japan (the only primary difference lies in the fact that this place is located in an actual plaza surrounded by other businesses and residential areas). Inside of the restaurant, there are plenty of culturally Japanese paraphernalia that give the decor a more personalized, homey ambiance. Though be warned: the noise levels can become intolerable--definitely not a place for a romantic date or business casual lunch. . . The restaurant itself is part of a larger chain that is privately operated by Japanese people, which contributes to the authenticity and quality of their ramen. Having ramen at Shinsengumi is a joyous experience; customers are involved in every step of the process in making their ideal bowl of ramen. Not to mention, the seemingly endless combinations and variety of ramen will keep even the most stubborn foodie pleased. . . After trying the ramen at Shinsengumi, I have been reluctant to go back to other local places, namely Ajisen Ramen. Shinsengumi's ramen has it all: the right balance of texture, density, and elasticity. When simmered in a bath of that hot, wondrous broth, the ramen becomes a culinary delight. . . So why 4 stars? With affordable prices and quality ramen, Shinsengumi is a tiny piece of Japanese culture that one should want take a bite (or two) into.
