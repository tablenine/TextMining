NEW BEST STEAK EVER!!!. . As a bday/xmas present a friend treated me to dinner.  After a couple champagne cocktails while catching up, and snacking on the freshly fried greasy potato chips on the bar we were finally seated.  . . Skipping the appetizer, we both decided for the Japanese Waygu and the sweet potato casserole.  When our steaks came out, I was a bit disappointed just by the size.  I think it was 8oz which I had no idea what that looked like.  It came out as 2 little pieces which I totally thought was gonna be a rip off.  '. . When I took the first bite into my steak, I was in sheer bliss!!  The steak melted like butter in my mouth.  It was simply seasoned by salt, not overpowering the meat.  So simple, yet so amazing!!  The sweet potato casserole was also surprisingly good.  It was crusty, savory, with just the right amount of sweetness.  . . For desert we ordered the dark chocolate souffle.  I've had regular chocolate souffles before, but never a dark chocolate one.  It was worth the wait.  It was rich and moist, with just the right amount of sweetness.  I don't think I will go back to the regular chocolate souffle.  . . Again, this is one of those places where you need to save up some money for.  For me, for the price of the meal, I'd rather have a new pair of sexy heels.  But how much can you charge for experience and memories with good friends.
