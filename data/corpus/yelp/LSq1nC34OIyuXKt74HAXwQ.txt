Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Had dinner there tonight.  Had the roasted chicken dinner, with corn, mashed potatoes, salad, and chocolate ice cream.. . The chicken was dry.  Potatoes came without butter or gravy.  When I asked for gravy, they only had a beef gravy.  Sorry, mashed potatoes require the correct gravy.  Salad was okay.  No choice of dinner rolls, so got stuck w/ 2 pieces of wheat bread.  They served a tiny scoop of ice cream.  Corn seemed to be fresh off the cob.. . I've been to similar restaurants as CANTER'S and have had better.  It's good in a historical sense, but you're better off going to JERRY'S DELI instead.
