Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
It's a cute little place with a nice patio. They even put up lights to make it look a bit nicer since the view itself is ok. The sandwiches are delicious. The pork belly is fatty, yummy. The original Umami burger is also worth a shot. $3 for a small basket of triple fried fries isn't worth it. When I first went there when Umami first opened, I only got 9 fries, I wasn't happy. Now though, they do give you more than that, but it still isn't worth it. They also have real soda made of sugar cane and Scoops ice cream. I only go back for the burgers, because those are yummy. Oh yea, if you go late, keep in mind that they stop seating at 945pm (although it closes at 10pm). But, if they already have a line, seating might end earlier.
