Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
This has officially taken the top spot on my list of favorite sushi spots (a list which is only available in my head). I've eaten here several times and only had phenomenal experiences. . . Here's why Butterfly is awesome: 1) the fish is crazy fresh; 2) they are BYOB; 3) there prices are incredibly reasonable; 4) they generally give you freebies--either dessert or a couple of pieces of a roll that they are trying out; 5) did I mention that the fish is crazy fresh, the prices are incredibly reasonable, and it's BYOB? Oh, I did. . . So why did it take me so long to unceremoniously crown Butterfly the top sushi place in Chicago in my head? I cannot answer that question. But trust me, go where you will to get your "favorite" sushi, then come to Butterfly. It will be just as good, if not better, and about half the price.
