Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
I've been coming to Glenn's Diner for several years now and the quality has only grown. Glenn's has quickly become a welcome heart to the Ravenswood. I try and eat there at least once a week.. . My last meal was a departure from the usual Biscuits and Gravy I usually get there and instead my girlfriend and I chose the weekend only Â Blue Star Crab Cakes Eggs Benedict. It was absolutely phenomenal. That along with a freshly squeezed tall glass of OJ made for a terrific brunch.. . The wait staff is fun, friendly and very attentive. I've yet to have a bad meal at Glenn's.
