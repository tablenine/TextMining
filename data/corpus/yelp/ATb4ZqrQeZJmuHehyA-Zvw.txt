Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
the menu at friendship is unexpectedly creative. i wouldn't call it "authentic" chinese, but i wouldn't call it fusion, either...more like chinese with western gourmet touches. whatever you want to call it, it's real good. i had the peppercorn beef which was delicious, and the staff even took pity on my broken hand and gave me a free dessert.. . it is a little bit more expensive than an ordinary chinese place, but it's also byob. also, on tuesday nights all the entrees are only 8.95...
