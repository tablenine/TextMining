A Step Up From Lawry's.... . My usual beef house (prime rib/steak) is Lawry's so you can base my review from that.. . The first time I went to Mastro's, we were seated at the "chef's table" -- a little private room with a window view of the kitchen.  It was cozy, quaint, and quiet.  I ordered the Filet MIgnon: it was VERY good.  The steak almost melts in your mouth.  (I don't remember what else we ordered.....but I don't think I was disappointed by anything). . The staff is very friendly and helpful (not snooty at all), and the decor is beautiful~  Upstairs is a piano bar and can get quite noisy.  If making reservations, I would request being seated downstairs.. . 6 of us ate for around $500...I don't remember if that included tip.. . Pros:  . - Food is delicious.  Filet Mignon, Butter cake, Chocolate covered strawberries.... - Side dishes are ordered "family style". . - Friendly staff -- servers, busboys, hosts, managers, etc.. - Decor is nice/classy. . Expected:. - $$$$. - Valet Parking. . Tips:. - Request to be seated downstairs unless you are looking for the noisy, can't hear your friends talk kind of atmosphere. - I thik it's called "butter cake" or something like that...it was VERY good.. - Steaks come out on a 400F plate, so order one down from your usual -- since the steaks continue to cook while you eat.  I usually get my steaks medium, but when I went, I ordered it medium rare+ (which is between medium rare and medium) and it was cooked PERFECTLY.
