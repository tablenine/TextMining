Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This past Saturday I arrived in Chicago at 7am from Boston. I was on a mission to visit as many art galleries as possible, but before I could get started, I had to eat and wait for them to open. Luckily, we happened into Wishbone. Now, on a normal day this would not be my breakfast of choice. There are NO healthy options. Egg white omelettes are still cooked in butter, and there are maybe two options on the brunch menu that are meat free. But, this Saturday was a different kind of morning, I was starving, health be damned, I wanted gravy and eggs and Wishbone obliged. The food was pretty average, not as good as the biscuits and gravy made by my grandmother or mother, but I have yet to find comfort food that good anywhere outside of their kitchens. As a bonus, we never felt rushed, and our waitress was friendly, attentive and on the ball with the coffee. I will definitely keep it in mind the next time I am in Chicago and craving a serious breakfast.
