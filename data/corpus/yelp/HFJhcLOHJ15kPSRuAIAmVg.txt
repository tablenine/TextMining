yulk!!! The bartender wouldn't let us order drinks because he said the waitdress would get pissed at him and the waitdress took her time taking our drink orders....boring Los Angeles attitudes....too many wannabe actors being bartenders and waitdresses............give me an awesome real dive bar or Honky Tonk with bartenders named Norma and a great old Jukebox or some local sad sack singing the blues
