We went on a Saturday night and had no wait for a table, which I found amazing. Service was prompt and reliable.. . My chicken was groan-out-loud amazing. It was ruined by my terribly mixed drink - it was so bad I couldn't drink it, and I'm pretty game when it comes to booze.. . I stopped eating to take a breath and engage in conversation and the waitress was on top of me grabbing my plate. I just let her take the rest of my food because I wanted to save room for dessert.. . They only have about 5 or 6 desserts. The two chocolate creations -- the creme brulee and the mousse -- were both "out." We were informed it would be several hours before they had any more. It was only 8pm or so, and all we had left was crap like Peach Surprise.. . I love spending 40 bucks on awesome food taken away before I'm finished, poorly made drinks I cannot stand, and dessert that sounds good...if they had any. It only gets two stars because the chicken was That Good.
