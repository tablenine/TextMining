Restaurant: Mr. Pizza
Category: Pizza
update:  the breadsticks are hot and fresh (this was my prior gripe, but is no longer applicable. :)  their thin crust margherite is also yummy.. . *** *** *** *** ***. . im a little biased cuz i know the owner and i live next to it.. but heres what i would suggest:. . potato gold pizza + pitcher of stella artois. . thats about it.  everything else on the menu is a bit overpriced.. the potato gold pizza is worth the money cuz of the special crust.  but everything else.. u can find better variations of it for half the price.  im also not a fan of their breadsticks.. they taste like theyve been re-heated in the oven.. thus, not made from scratch =l. . however, the owner is super cool.. he loves engaging with the customers and constantly walks the floor.  the decor is cute, so bring ur first-time friends and request a window seat.  the restaurant also has a nice bar counter with flatscreen(s?)... id love to come here and have a beer, catch a game.. . im hoping that the owner considers selling the special pizza crust as its own side dish-- thus, sweet potato pizza crust breadsticks.  i would definitely order BOTH the pizza AND breadsticks if he did.. cuz theres never enough sweet potato crust to satisfy :]. . also.. it would be bomb if he sold pizza by the slice.  that would definitely create more restaurant traffic in this sprawling area.. concert go-ers at the Wiltern could then just grab n go instead of carrying leftover pizza boxes.. . but... in case he's reading this.. I LUV U MAN!  the owner is super cool and mr pizza still rocks my socks. :]
