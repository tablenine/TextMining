Nothing wowed me.. . I went on a Sunday night not realizing they have a separate tapas menu and don't serve from their regular menu.. . The place was dead and this was reflected in the food. We tried several items and nothing was good enough to earn a trip back.. . salt cod fritters: the best thing we tried. goat cheese fritters: served to us cold. wild mushroom empanada: meh. white gazpacho soup:  pretty good, but a bit too sweet for me. sauteed clams and muscles: came with hardly any shellfish for $13. grilled bread: tasted like supermarket white bread . mahi mahi ceviche: would have worked better with tortilla chips rather.     than plantain chips.. . red sangria: average at best; seemed like it was mixed with lemonade. vodka mo-tini: very good; smooth with the perfect level of tartness
