Category: American (Traditional)
Quality pastrami up in this place. Its a huge sandwich with about an arms length of meat  served up on a hot and delicious roll. Add spicy mustard or regular, and eat the shit out of it. We got fries, which seemed to be generic crinkle cut style, but they were so fried that I couldn't stop eating them. The extra oil really adds to that homemade taste.  . . Cute, dinery ambiance. Extremely fast service. Check it out.
