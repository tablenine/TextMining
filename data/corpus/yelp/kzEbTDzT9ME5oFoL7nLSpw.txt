Love it just as much as the Edgewood location! Same great food, staff is on their game. trivia was fun to watch and hear the groans when no one could name two types of cats officially recognized by the American Cat Fanciers' Association beginning with the letter M. Good times.. . One of the good things about the staff is they are just perfectly abrasive - I mean that in the best way possible. They don't take any crap from anybody, but they take care of their locals and they don't let your glass get empty.. . Great selection of beers on tap - the Atlanta staple 420, Dogfish Head, Magic Hat, Blue Moon, to name a few. Can't go wrong food wise either. Their homemade fries are great, and if you're up for it, get the platter of fries with 4 sauces. The Curried Ketchup is AWESOME, same with the Wasabi Mayo and the BBQ dip.. . Parking is tricky (it is L5P after all) but try the side streets off McLendon and the EAST part of Euclid (behind the Libertine and the Brewhouse)
