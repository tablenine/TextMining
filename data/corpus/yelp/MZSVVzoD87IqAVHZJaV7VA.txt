Not much of a rattlesnake or alligator fan but it was cool to see the different types of meat they offered. I had the amazing fries with the blue cheese bacon dip. It was very good! Nice place to sit and talk. Loved the cucumber water they had it was very tasty. I would visit again, only down side is that I waited in line outside for a good 20 minutes. Worst coochie!! Lol
