Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I don't care how long you have lived in Los Angeles, if you have not had Tito's Taco's, then you are still a tourist in my eyes. This West Side cult restaurant has changed mexican food for me. . . First and foremost, it's cheap! I don't think there is a thing over $2 on the menu so no matter what your budget is Tito's is always an option. . . My personal favorites:. *Tacos: made with shredded beef and lettuce (cheese optional) these tacos are everything I could ever ask for. . *Salsa: Tito's salsa is fresh, not too spicy, and flowing like the salmon of Capistrano.. *Beans: Refried, hot and soooo good. I usually add salsa to them and add that to my Taco, it really takes the meal to the next level. . They also offer, burritos, tamales, tostadas and enchiladas. Everything is simple and delicious. The lines can get long, but they move fast, and (unlike Pinks Hot Dogs) it's well worth the wait. Insider tip, they put a ton of cheese on your taco so if you are getting more then one taco, ask for cheese on one and then spread it on the others to save a buck or two. Speaking of.....it's cash only so be sure to raid your piggy bank before you head down. . . The only thing better then a Tito's Taco.....is TWO!!
