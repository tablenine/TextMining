Definitely nothing special! . . THE BAD: Long wait (at freaking 10 PM), cramped space, cash only. THE GOOD: cozy atmosphere, kind of historical if you get off on that sort of thing. . The food was just OK. A strong OK. I had the pizza pot pie. Would have liked to try the Famous bread, but no dice.. they didn't bring it. Pizza pot pie is strange.. .like a soupy italian thing in a bread bowl. I would eat it again, but would never fight the hour wait to eat it again... just not THAT good. Everyone should try it once, but once is probably enough for most ppl.
