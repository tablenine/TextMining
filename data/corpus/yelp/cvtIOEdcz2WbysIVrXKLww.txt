We had breakfast/brunch here on 3 occasions, and the hearty food was tasty each time. The atmosphere is quaint: pictures of chickens fill the walls, and and patrons receive a free meal (and have their picture posted in the john) if they win a golden egg from an old vending machine. The banana pudding and a hash dish are notable. Get there in the morning if you wish to choose from all specials on the chalkboard, as the best selections often sell out.
