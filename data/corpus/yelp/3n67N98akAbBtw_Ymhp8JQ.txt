Brazillian Churassco have a difficult job to satisfy foodies. Why do I say that? Good churassco have to carefully balance the quality of meat and the amount of salt to put on before serving to their customers. This place gets it right. . . I felt the quality of meat was good enough to warrant the $58 per person price tag and the salt was enough to enhance the flavor but not too much where I felt I was going to have a migraine headache.. . Plus it's interesting to look at the personalities that come to this place. BMWs, lambos, men with botox, and women with fake breasts.
