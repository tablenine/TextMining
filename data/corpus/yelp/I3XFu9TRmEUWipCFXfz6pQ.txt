Expect a wait b/c they don't take rezzos and it's jammed packed b/c it's soooo good.. . Don't bother with any sort of roll.  Get sashimi.  The fish is so fresh that rice just seems to take away from the amazingness (yes, I made up that word) of the fish.  It's so good that I'll even order uni...it's the first and only place I've ordered it from.. . If you don't like sashimi, order the albacore sushi or the scallop special roll.  Fantastic! . . I like to get a piece of eel for dessert.  So yummy.  I wish I never moved to the Marina b/c otherwise I'd be at Hide every day.  Just an FYI, as said before, they do not take rezzos...and it's all cash only (so worth every bit of pain in the butt of it).
