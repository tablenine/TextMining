I suggested to Andrea W that we have brunch here today because it's become one of my new favorite spots. My boyfriend just moved right around the corner and we've been eating here almost every week. I had an amazing goat cheese omlette last weekend, which I was sad to see wasn't on the menu this morning...I guess it was a special? However, the montana omlette hit the spot even though it was a little undercooked like Andrea said in her review. I also had dinner here last week- the burgers and fries are very good.
