Cute bar, lots of wood, lots of beer and great food.. . Went here on Saturday afternoon after doing some shopping at HDButtercup.  I had been wanting to check this place out, but living on the East side that hadn't happened.. . We walked right in and grabbed a seat at the bar with a view of the basketball game on the TV.  We ordered 2 beers that we had never tried before...I didn't like mine so I switched with my hubby.  The bartender saw what was happening and said that if we didn't like our beer, that he was more than happy to pour us a different one...how awesome is that?. . The food was really good. We ordered the olives, the burger and the bistro fries.  It was all very tasty and my husband declared the burger to be the best in L.A.  The burger was really good with the 2 cheeses and the carmelized onions, but I am a traditionalist when it comes to my burgers, so as delicious as it was I am not ready to declare it "the Best Burger in L.A.". . If you are in the neighborhood, go check this place it out.
