Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
In the world of diners, there is good, and there is bad.  That's it.  Unfortunately, there are far more bad diners than good ones.  Luckily, Fred 62 is one of the latter ones.  It's open 24 hours, which is great, but the food being delicious and fast is vastly more important to me.  I've tried the tuna melt (one of the best I've ever had), a burger (I unfortunately forget which one, but it was amazing), and the Noo-Deli Noodles (just OK-stick to more traditional fare).  The shakes aren't bad either.  It gets pretty crowded late at night, but the crowd is a friendly one and just adds to the diner atmosphere.
