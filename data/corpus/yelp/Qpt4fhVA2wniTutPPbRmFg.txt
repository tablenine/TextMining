If you are planning a trip anywhere near Glendale, CA be sure to plan a stop at Porto's bakery.  Porto's is amazing!  The smell of deliciousness will hit you as soon as you walk in the door!  I ate both food and pastries and was so impressed that my friends and I went to the second location the following day!  The prices at Porto's are amazing!  i got an amazing piece of carrot cake for $1 and change.  Talk about a deal!. . Don't be afraid of the long lines.  They move quickly and the frenzy is part of the fun!  Just ask every person you see leaving the building with an enormous box filled with goodies!  Go to Porto's!
