Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
LA has this reputation as being a place where everything is new and hip. Au contraire. Honestly, there are lots of dinery kinds of places w/ tons of character. This is one of them. I believe the owner dude - is the server - he's salty and funny and mean-ish, but in a good spirited way (and legit, as opposed to Ed Debevic's, my old standby rude waiter establishment proxy). Anyway, the apple pie was stellar. Really good. But, it was pricey. Very. Like $7.50 a slice (a la mode). And, they sort of rushed us out.. . PS: Apparently this is the place the Peach Pit is based on on 90210.
