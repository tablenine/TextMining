Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
Food was decent. We had a variety from the menu. I ordered three pupusas; my friends had the Salvadorian steak, skirt steak, burrito, and tamales. I have to admit, La Caravana Restaurante Salvadoreno makes better pupusas for less, and (at least to me) is a lot closer to home =). . . For dessert, I tried the custard stuffed plantain. I thought maybe the custard would fly out like cheese from a jalapeno popper...but it was just custard in a plantain. How plain! I left feeling I could have been a little more satisfied (like after that massage last week). All in all, I would recommend Gloria's Cafe to any locals or if you're in town for the day.
