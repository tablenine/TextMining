I've gone to The Boiling Crab for four Sundays straight back-to-back.  A little obsession, perhaps?  I must exercise a bit of discipline and stop going for a while or else my waist might grow a few inches.  :[. . A friend taught me a method to eating these crawfish.  You remove one of the plastic bags(they're double bagged) and tie it into a knot at the opening.  Doing this keeps the contents in tact.  After you have done that flip the bag over and tear open a slit from the underside.  All the seasoning is now actually on top and oh-so-yummy!  :). . The fried catfish here is pretty much the bomb.  It is lightly battered and really moist.  :D. . Oysters aren't shabby, either.  I think the sauce that comes with it is a blend of sriracha, ketchup, lime, and pepper.. . Having bottled domestic beers at $2.50/each is a huge plus while you wait over an hour to get seated.
