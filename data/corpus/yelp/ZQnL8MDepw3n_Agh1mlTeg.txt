Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm extremely disappointed. The bacon wrapped hot dogs outside the hwood clubs are 10x more delicious.. . I had the LotR and Ozzy dog which were mediocre at BEST -- I honestly enjoy costco dogs a lot more no joke.. . I'm giving Pinks the benefit of the doubt because I might've ordered wrong and it's gotta be famous for a reason... right?. . The first time I tried Father's Office and Roscoe's I was like, yeah I can see how this place is special. But Pink's falls way short of even realistic expectations.
