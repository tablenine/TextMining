Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
Soooooo maybe we just grabbed the wrong thing at this place.. . Veggie Grill looked like it'd be a really good idea.  All vegetarian items (and if you know me, you know i am a meat eater---that will try pretty much anything).. . Took a look at the menu and set my tastebuds to try: a)  the "chix wings" and b) a veggie burger.. . I figured if any place might be able to get this damn thing right, a place called Veggie Grill would.. . I came to the counter and ordered my meal with a "diet coke"----response---"uhhh we dont actually sell any sodas---but we do have this all natural root beer....I think, "WTH???". . So I ended up opting for the Lemonade, which was absolutely fantastic!  And even better when you couple it with the berry flavored teas that they make!. . The food came out about 10 minutes later, and actually looked decent.  I was so damn hungry that I could have eaten a cardboard box...when I bit into my burger thats what I realized I had eaten...a card board box.. . GROSS!  The chix wings, although they gave it a hell of a shot were equally disgusting.. . I dont judge vegetarian by saying, well this tastes good for vegetarian food...i judge it based on could i eat this crap everyday....and no, I cant eat the crap at Veggie Grill everyday!. . The salads that they brought out to other folks looked delicious, and I wish we woulda ordered one of em!. . FYI-- the sweet potato fries are scrumptious...
