THE HOUSE. . everyone has been saying the man who owns the place is a asshole but i found him very nice . the food was excellent but i have to agree with the wait but if you think about it while you are waiting you can check out the stores and if you go with friends you can lounge on the fountain that is there not as bad as everyone says it is and again the food is glorious and if your not in the mood to wait you can eat at the curry house which is in walking distance and is pretty good aswell
