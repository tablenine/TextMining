My boyfriend has always kind of made a face every time I suggest we go Little Bangkok. Don't let the outside fool you. I finally convinced him to go over the weekend, and he wasn't disappointed. We must have been hungry on Saturday night, so we ordered quite a bit... Basil Rolls (not fried), a hot pot of Tom-yum soup, masaman chicken (avocados, cashews - really good) and chicken panang (peppers, coconut curry, spicy). My mouth is watering all over again. Everything was dee-lish! It's not a romantic place by any stretch of the imagination (there were a couple of kids playing on the floor when we walked in - I don't think I would let my kids play on the floor here), but the food is well worth it. . . Price-wise it's very reasonable and the service is efficient and friendly. We will definitely go back, or at least get take out.
