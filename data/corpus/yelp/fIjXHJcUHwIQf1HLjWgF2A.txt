Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Girl boner #2 definitely comes from specialty food shops - especially ones with restaurants attached. . . Between the ready made foods station, cheese and charcuterie, sandwiches, breakfast goods, bakery, and God-given amazingness that is churro kettle corn, whoever Joan is, she's a gift from Heaven. However she's Satan to my waistline. . . We couldn't help peeking in and partaking in a few sweets tonight - including the marshmallow-stuffed cupcakes dipped in chocolate ganache, bread pudding (I got it to go, but I couldn't help it!), and the bakery girl's recommendation, the hazelnut merengue. I could have sworn she recommended the merengue because it was the obviously the most expensive item in the case ($7!) - but after a few bites, I realized I was wrong - whatever magic dust was sprinkled on that goodness was better than puppies, rainbows, and unicorns alike. In fact, it was far superior to the average-at-best bread pudding (then again, this is coming from a Â bread pudding snob). The cupcakes were also a bit cold which caused the ganache to be a bit too stiff - so next time I'll request them at room temperature and hopefully ooey gooey. . . They might have some competition in Monsieur Marcel, but I guess if my tastebuds are staying on this side of the pond, Joan's definitely my girl.
