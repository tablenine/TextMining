Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Believe the hype.  Yes, Pink's sells a damn good hot dog.   But, don't ruin your experience by standing in line for an hour in the blazing hot sun.  If you do this, nothing you order there will make you happy.  Be smart about it and go during dinner time, people.. . The dogs have that delicious snap when you bite in to them.   Top 'em off with chili, cheese, and onion.  Awesome.  . . If spicy is what you want, order the spicy polish sausage.  You're going to need extra napkins for the sweat off your brow and runny nose.  . . And in the "You Gotta Try It Once" category... order the bacon burrito dog.  Two hot dogs, slices of bacon, chili, cheese, and onions all neatly tucked away inside of a flour tortilla.  I lovingly call this the "Heart Attack in Your Hand.". . The wait in line is long, yes.  But this means you will have more time perusing their menu featuring special dogs like The Lord of the Rings Dog (w/ onion rings.. duh).  Or the Martha Stewart Dog (Paw Paw, no!).  . . Be prepared to stand in line with tourists and the local crazies (you'll be okay don't look them in the eye).  Parking is scarce, but not impossible.
