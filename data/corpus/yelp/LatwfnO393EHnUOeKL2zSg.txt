We had breakfast for two at 11am on a Saturday. No problems getting seated, no problems with the very attentive staff and the food (as mentioned here) is stellar.. . Highly recommended.. . Just be on the watch for it while driving, since the signage is very muted.. . You'll want to be on the southern side of the tracks (which is Collage Ave), even though the maps show the pin on Dekalb Ave unless you zoom in very close.
