I went for Friday dinner.  I ordered the Seabass on mushroom orzo ($19) with a side of brussels sprouts which came quartered with bacon and pine nuts.  . . The fish was well prepared, had a nice crisp sauteed skin, fresh, flaky and moist.  It was perhaps a little too buttery and salty in the seasoning, but it was delicious.  Sprouts were tasty too.  . . Restaurant decor was pleasant with one brick wall facade, high hangar ceilings with criss cross wood slats, exposed air conditioning vents, earth tone paint colors and cement floor with some stain.  I would call it "modern rustic"... it was a blend.  . . The clientele was hip and semi-dressy.  There is no booze served here so make sure you bring a bottle.
