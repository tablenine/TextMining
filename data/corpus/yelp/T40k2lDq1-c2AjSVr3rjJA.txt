Whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, wanna-be vegan/vegetarian, meat eater or a confused hungry-jack just wanting to stuff your face with some good eats, I think it's not too farfetched to say you'll like this place. Hard core meat eaters: while you will definitely know the difference right off the top you won't immediately write this place off. I should know; I experimented on my husband and 17 month old son- both who have meat favored discriminate tongues. They actually ate it! Ok, well my husband ate and enjoyed his food. My son kind of whapped the "chixin" strip around and used it as stabbing apparatus on the table. Nonetheless, my husband ate a Bayou Chixin sandwich, which I must say was actually spicy (Unlike Chili's - the supposed makers of "spicy" foods. Come on Chili's! I think you should pay all your consumers back-falsely implicating that you have both spice and flavor in your food. (note the inhuman sized chili pepper on your building)). Ok, Back to VG. To sum things up I'd say you've found the perfect medium between the vegans ultimate burger paradise and the carnivores compromise for the sake of partaking in a healthier option. . . Oh yah...try the Sweet potato fries. Strangely so, even though they are fried you feel skinnier after eating them. I promise. It's strange, but it happens to me all the time. Then again, I have yet to weight myself since I started eating here.... . Love, peace, and soooooooooooul!
