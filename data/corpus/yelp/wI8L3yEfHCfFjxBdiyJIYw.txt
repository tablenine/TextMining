It wasn't too hot out, and middle of the afternoon on Friday, hubby off work, we were running errands and decided to stop in and see if the sign was right "Best Patio in Atlanta". . I don't know about Best, and it sure is a great patio.. Terrific view of the park, umbrellas offer shade from the sun and a fabulous beer selection, which the wait staff knew well and had knowledgeable recommendations to make.. . Did not have food. A little on the pricey side for just a couple of beers, after the valet &amp; all, but very enjoyable atmosphere. . The seat cushions brought out by our server a very nice touch.. . Felt very very good to take time in the middle of the day and linger over drinks on a terrific patio with a gorgeous view of the beautiful park.
