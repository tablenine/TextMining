3.5 stars.  I came here with a couple coworkers and one of our clients as she was in the mood for some margaritas.  I really enjoyed it, even with me not being a big drinker.  I thought the look of the place was okay, nothing too special and it was a little too cold for my liking.  We started off with the guacamole and it was delicious but I couldn't differentiate that between other good guacs that I've had.  I had the skirt steak which was really great!  However, I do wish the portion was bigger and that it had a little bit more of a kick to it.  My other coworkers and client seemed to be enjoying their dishes as well.  I would say the food is a solid 4 but it's hard to justify the prices.
