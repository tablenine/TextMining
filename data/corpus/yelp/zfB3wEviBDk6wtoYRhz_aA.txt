i had the $8.50 hollenbeck burrito because i thought that was for one.  i was wrong and was stuffed by the time i got thru half of it.  the lines are always long, and i guess there's quite a following so unlike other places in the 90033, all you hear is english in this joint.  nonetheless, kick ass spot.  you'd have to add hot sauce cause its not that hot, but maybe if you order the emmanuelle like Susy H. did you'd get the same orgasmic response. hi Susy! ;)
