Uptown baby! I find myself visiting Fat Cat's more often now that I moved into the area. So, it's time for me to Yelp it. . . Fat Cat's is this spacious bar that I enjoy stopping by for an after work drink or an after game drink. Straight, gay, young or old the crowd is always extremely diverse. I usually go on Fridays after my team plays beach volleyball at Montrose Beach. On Fridays they have an all you can eat Fish Fry, which I ordered this past Friday and loved it. It comes with a side of cole slaw and either a baked potato or french fries and tarter sauce for just a little under $9. I also recommend their Sloppy Joe sandwich which is one of my favorite sandwiches to order with one of their seasonal beers, which they have often. . . The servers are extremely friendly and the bar always has a festive environment. . . So, stop by and enjoy the Fish Fry and a seasonal beer.
