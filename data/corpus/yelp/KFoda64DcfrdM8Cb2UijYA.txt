Am I missing something-yes the decor and crowd are first class...service soso-ordered the burger and wanted to sub veggies for fries-they charged us $4 for this substitution...come on!!! Â $5 for Miso Soup-average at best...again, a tad priced for 6 ounces....not an entree on lunch menu for under $10-yes you read that correctly so impossible to leave here for under $30 for two for lunch...the food was really just average...not amazing...salmon was good-not great...i will come back but not running back
