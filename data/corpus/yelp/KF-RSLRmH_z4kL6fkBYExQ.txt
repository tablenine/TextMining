Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
As long as you don't try to get "fancy" or "complicated", you will love this place!  Sometimes the line wraps around the place outside, but the service is incredibly fast (again, don't try to mess up the system, just order verbatim off the menu).  The tacos are tasty in a simple way, and hit the spot after a long day at the beach.  I love the HUGE shreds of cheddar cheese and the chips and salsa.  If you're lucky, u might stumble upon a celeb sighting!  (once I saw Raven, from "That's so Raven").
