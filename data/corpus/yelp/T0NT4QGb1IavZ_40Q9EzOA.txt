My Taiwanese sista from another mista was in town for a weekend binge-fest with her domestic partner, and Gloria's was one of the many (many, many) places that we hit up. It was my first visit and I wasn't disappointed. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that all I had was a salad, which-- in retrospect-- was a lame decision because everything on the menu looked so awesome. It was an excellent salad though (avocado w/grilled chicken). I guess they're known for their pupusa plate because that's what the majority of our party ordered. Chips were piping hot and fresh and readily replenished. Service is really, really great-- our server was friendly and helpful and all smiles. I also love the decor, it is really quaint and adorable. I felt like I was invading someone's personal kitchen or something.. . But the best part about this place is the SANGRIA! Cheap-esque and delicious, especially at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. Ha ha. Ain't no shame. I downed that shit like it was lemonade. Best $4 I've ever spent.
