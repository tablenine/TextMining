Even after all the hype, I still loved my visit to Wurstküche. If I just based my rating on taste, I might go for a 4 because I'm not much of a sausage person and I don't drink... but overall as an experience, there's no doubt in my mind that this place is a 5, for all the reasons below:. . *Freshly grilled, satisfyingly-sized sausages, with creative and delicious combinations of ingredients. *A good selection of vegetarian options (for a sausage place). *Simple but tasty selection of toppings. *Great frites, dipping sauces, and mustards. *A fantastic selection of non-name-brand sodas. *Friendly, knowledgeable, welcoming, attitude-free staff. *Chill, non-douchey atmosphere. *Overhearing customers mangle the name of the restaurant. *Clean, simply but nicely decorated. *Easy bike ride from Pershing Square and Union Station. *Bike parking outside. *Open late (by Downtown LA standards). . Okay I admit it; I loved everything. I'm going to try all the vegetarian options with all the different topping combinations possible... and a Mr. Q Cumber to wash it all down!
