as public enemy said, don't believe the hype!. this place first attracted me by the foot traffic infront of the place and exclusiveness which is reservation only.  i finally mustard up and dined there a week ago.  . . these are the items i devoured there.. fennel sausage with rapini and potatoes - aka johnsonville brats with fancy spinich. coach farm goat cheese, leeks, scallions &amp; bacon - equivalent to california pizza kitchen - fairly decent but nothing special. . as i was losing all hope, i ordered an antipasta which contained mussels which was pretty tasty in its white wine sauce.  also took part in some wine tasting which was decent.  if your a big wine buff, this place is recommended.  they have plenty of wines you can order by the bottle.. . overall, its worth trying checking out once to see what all the hype is about.  your call on returning, but i am not.
