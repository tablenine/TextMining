This place is not the greatest place for very few reasons.  First and foremost, it is much too expensive for a simple sandwich or wrap.  You'll spend roughly $12 for sandwich or wrap, side, and drink.  The sandwich is on the bland side, and leaves you craving for some more flavor.  The outdoor seating is plentiful, but you'll realize the scenery is eagle rock/glendale.  so why the hell does this place get 3 stars and not 2?. . THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON WHY YOU COME HERE:. . SWEET POTATO FRIES.  They have this amazingly sweet after-taste.  Without the fries, I wouldn't hesitate to say this place sucks!
