Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
The energy in this place is awesome! Everyone seemed to be having a great time eating. It was like one of those scenes from a Fridays commercial where everyone is smiling and eating and music is playing and you're like "no one is that darn happy to be at Fridays". Well I guess you can be THAT happy. We only waited a couple of minutes to get seated, our server was quick in taking out order and getting our drinks to us. . . Now...the food. . . We opted for burgers since the place is called HAMBURGER Mary's. I had a Turkey Mary Burger with all the fixins. It was pretty good, but not awesome. It tasted like the turkey was mixed with bread crumbs to add volume to the meat (which changes taste and texture). My boyfriend had the regular Mary and he said it was good but not unlike a burger you can get anywhere. We both had the seasoned fries and they were really good (I would stop in just for those and a few of those specialty martinis I saw advertised). I love that the check comes in a women's high heeled shoe...makes paying your bill fun!!! (no, not really).. . Overall, cool atmosphere and quick seating on a Saturday afternoon. A bit over rated but worth checking out if you're in the hood.
