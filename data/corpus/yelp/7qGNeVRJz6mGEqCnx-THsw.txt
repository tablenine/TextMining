I've only been here once and I typically don't review a place based on one experience, But! I must say that my first impression was a good one. All the food was excellent, the staff was friendly, the service was pretty steady (with the exception of a soup mix up), and the atmosphere is clean and well maintained. It's less than a 2 minute walk from the red line Thorndale stop so it's easy to reach, friends that have ordered from here say their delivery is always fast and fresh, what's not to like?
