Isn't it great living in one of the biggest metropolises in the world? All the great dives. I love it. Once again, this is a place I should have been coming to since I was a kid, but unfortunately my parents weren't into places like this. Fortunately a friend introduced me to Philippe's about 8 or 9 years ago, and I fell head over heels. The food is one thing, but the ambiance is something else entirely. Not your typical Los Angeles dining experience, to be sure. Pick a line and be patient. Once you get to the counter, let the carver know exactly what you want and how you want it. If you like coffee, order two for yourself (only .09 but no refills), and for God's sake do not try to hand cash to the carver, that's what that tray is for. There's nothing quite like the weekday lunchtime crowd at Philippe's. Blue collar, white collar, cops, tourists and everything in between. One thing for sure, you gotta sit among 'em, so pull up an open stool and dig in. Last time I was in they traded the mustard jar with the little spoons for squeeze bottles. What? Anyway, the mustard hasn't changed nor has your reaction to too much of it. Yikes! The sandwiches are the sandwiches. What else can you say? I dig the turkey and the pork, double dipped with Swiss cheese and macaroni salad on the side. I can't describe what it is about the sandwich that keeps me coming back, but it's there. I have friends who just don't get it, and that's fine, but I do get it, as often as I can. The sandwich is comforting and satisfying, and the atmosphere transports me to another time and place. Grab a U-NO bar on the way out.
