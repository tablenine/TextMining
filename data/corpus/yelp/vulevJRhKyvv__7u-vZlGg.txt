Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Yknow, at first I didnt understand the appeal.. . "It's just a hotdog" I pouted, as I was forced to stand in line with my boyfriend and our other friends. We waited about 45 mins until we reached the counter to place our order. Yes, this is very standard for this hot dog stand.. . But hey, it was pretty delicious. . . I think it's just "one of those things" you have to experience in LA.. . And yes, they're basically hot dogs with random crap and funny names, but that's why people are going.. . It's hard to mess up a hot dog. It tasted, well, like a big hot dog with all the fixins. . . This certainly wont replace buying packs of Ballpark's at Von's, but if you're in the area, and have never been, give it a try.
