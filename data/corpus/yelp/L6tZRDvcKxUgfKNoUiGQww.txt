I am writing this with the heart burn that I "carried out" from Alcove. I've been wanting to try this spot of a long, long time. Finally did today. Took a book and got ready to sit in the adorable garden. Ordered my 11-dollar fried chicken wrap. It wasn't too bad, but it was covered in LOTS of sauce. There may have been onions and roasted red pepper in there somewhere, but I could only taste sauce. Oh yeah - there was diced chicken in there too. The highlight? The apple/pear slaw. Thank goodness I ordered it as a side because it balanced out the wrap. Perhaps I'll go back for desert? Or a coffee? . . All I gotta say is that the last place I ate a sandwich for $4.50 (also with the take a number/carry to table service). Alcove wrap? Even with side? Not worth the cash. People watching? Atmosphere: Very good. (Five stars on that one!).  Perhaps it would have been a better culinary experience if they got me drunk first.
