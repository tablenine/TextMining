First of all, this is in the heart of Downtown LA so you know what that means?? parking sucks, one way streets, no left turns &amp; it's busy! Although it is on a very busy part of DT and they get a lot of foot traffic which means better for their business, I still will not consider going back unless I was dropped off.  There is parking around but I chose to valet instead : $7:50.  This place is really nice, big and their bakery items look soooo good....looks, I said.  I had a chocolate mint and chocolate caramel macaroon: $1.75 each....minus another point for being overpriced and not worth it.   I guess this is a cool place to hang out after work (which is what my friends and I did), have some appetizers and then head over to the bar across the street (7) or Seven Grand.  I see other Yelpers complain about the wait time....I did not experience that.
