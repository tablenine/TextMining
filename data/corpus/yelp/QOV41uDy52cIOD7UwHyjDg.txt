What could anyone possibly have against this place? Is it fine dining? Thank heavens, NO! Just a pretty damn good burger is what you get here. This place, Casa Bianca's, and Colombo's are the only three eating establishments worthy of my patronage among the pretentious, artsy, inferior, flophouses of restaurants that degrade the Colorado corridor. . . The burgers are just splendid - the meat is of exceptional quality; very flavorful. Their fries, while a little different in texture than what I am usually accutomed to, are marvellous. Do not forget to try their chipotle ketchup. For those of you who want to pretend how much more sophistacated you are than the rest of us by adopting European manners, they give you a side of mayonnaise to dip your fries in. Disgusting but interesting.. . If you consider yourself at all an ardent enthusiast of hamburgers and other such foods, you will do well to visit The Oinkster. It is an establishment like The Oinkster that reassures you that the valiant efforts put forth by millions of cows and chickens to stay tasty and delicious has not been in vain.
