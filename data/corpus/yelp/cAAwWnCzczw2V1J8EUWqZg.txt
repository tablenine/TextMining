I'll do my best to not make any jokes about the scientology center across the street or the ex-hooker infested area that houses that center in this review....wow, this is going to be tough!. . Well, in regards to the establishment that is known as Square One, it sure is  one hip square.  Okay...I just offended myself with that lameness.... . The point is, it's great!  Its one of the few places that claims to use fresh local products and I can actually taste it!  Everything I have had there from the Mushroom Omelet with Shitake &amp; Oyster Mushrooms and Feta to the regular Two-Egg Dish which comes with some of the thickest cuts bacon with an amazingly Smokey flavor, is great.  The potatoes that come with these dishes are among my favorite home fries in Los Angeles.  They are so grub, I could go back for just those!  I've tried the grits as well and they were good too.  Like most times I have had grits, they aren't good unless you pile on the butter and salt and I feel the same here but they do come with cheese and bacon if you want and that bacon is even smokier then when it comes by itself.  I honestly felt like it was stolen right from the fire at a campground, chopped up and place in my grits....those campers are going to be bummed when they notice that their bacon is gone...suckers!
