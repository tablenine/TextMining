Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
Oh, the happy hour!  My co-worker Dee and I sometimes end our shifts in desperate need of a stiff cocktail and some serious venting. The happy hour at Lola's is there perfect place for such unwinding. . . As soon as you walk into this swanky little place, you can just feel Friday melting right off your body. The beautiful decor and the beautiful people certainly help (there was this one tall, blue-eyed drink of water sitting there with his buddies....EHEM. SO sorry. Carrying on).  Flattering lighting, leopard print couches, martini posters and signs, and a pool table with clawed feet, Lola's is definitely a a cocktail haven.  . . So right, the happy hour.  Five dollar cocktails in fairly generous glasses and $5.50 appetizers? Yeah, buddy!  My friend was lit after only two cocktails by seven and I was suddenly wondering, "What the hell was I all stressed about again?" The happy hour menu changes every first of the month and it is always spectacular.  I also heard tales told about specials on Sunday nights for folks in the restaurant business when you bring in a pay stub. Niiiiice. . . Lola, you're a doll.
