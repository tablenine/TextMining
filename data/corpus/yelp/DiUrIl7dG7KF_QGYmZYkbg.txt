Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Juicy.. . Pork.. . Dumplings.. . That's really the only reason to come to this place, but it's so bomb that you won't want to eat anything else.. . I went with my brother to check this place out on a Sunday night at dinner time. Not the best time to hit up a popular restaurant, so that's on us. We waited for about an hour before being seated.. . The decor's interesting, in that it's traditional Chinese food in a postmodern "Design Within Reach" setting. Not that you'll be sitting and minding the surroundings, per se: you should be busily munching on juicy pork dumplings.. . Budget-wise you'll probably spend around $18-20 a head. It's not the cheapest Chinese food in the world, but it's worth it.
