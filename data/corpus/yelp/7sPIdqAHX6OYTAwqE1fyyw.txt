Don't go for the "Hipster Pho" hype or the minimalist design or the nice looking patrons, and don't not go due to 'authenticity issues' (authenticity in Los Angeles? Â I could write a dissertation but I'd rather just forward you on to Baudrillard...) - go if you want a nice hot bowl of pho with tasty fresh herbs.
