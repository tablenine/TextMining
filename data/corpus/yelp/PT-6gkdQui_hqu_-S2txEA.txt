devon is not the best fish place in the city by any means..but it does have a lot of offerings...so the fresh fish is pretty good..i had the halibut the day i was there, the clam chowder, and the oysters...actually the oysters were really good...i tried someones pasta with scallops it was ok..i tried someones ahi tuna..it wasnt the best by any means very average..and i tried the tilapia...which was good.... . the best part of the meal was the biscuits..and they were being cheap with them only giving 1 per person making you feel like a schmuck asking for more...but the location is tough to beat and the the bar is nice..so try this place out sometime
