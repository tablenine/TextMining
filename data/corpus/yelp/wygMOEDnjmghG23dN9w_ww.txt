I realize Tank does not need my review but I felt the need to share.  . . WE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!.  My boyfriend and I tell everyone about it...everyone!  The half price maki on the weekends is awesome but when they started doing it during the week for lunch I was floored with excitement!  My friends and I started going at least 2 times a week!. . The Ika Maki is by far my favorite along with the Veggie . Tempura.  Both are half off and together they make a meal.  . . Reasonably priced and beautiful atmosphere...I love the bathrooms too!  . . Check this place out if you haven't already!
