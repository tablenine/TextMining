Restaurant: The Porter Beer Bar
Category: American (New)
When you walk into a place called The Porter Beer Bar your expectation should be that you will be getting beer.  If you want cheap High Life don't come to a beer bar and don't complain when a real beer costs 4 or 5 dollars.  You don't walk into a steak house and complain that you can't get a dollar double cheese burger.  McDonalds are all over the place!  You can stumble into the gutter and you may hit your face on a bottle of High Life.  What you get here is beer, and the selection is even bigger and better than Brick Store Pub.  Of the beers that they both have on tap now that I compared prices of, TPBB averaged out cheaper (they have a few beers much cheaper like Brooklyn Black to a few beers slightly more than BSP like Aventitus).  TPBB has 30 taps, and none seem wasted on lame beers, while I think BSP has 27 taps, and a few are always pretty uninspired.  BSP seems a little more serious in the presentation of the beers though so I don't want to call one better than the other.. . The one time I ate here the burger was fine, while my girlfriend much prefered the vegetarian burger at The Vortex.  Fries were good.  I don't really care though.  Don't get me wrong, I love good food and even have 2 food review websites, but this is a beer bar.  I don't care that the owners are from Seeger's.  It's certainly a bonus if I want to eat here if the food is interesting, but it's all about the beer!  And seriously, $4.00 for a pint of Brooklyn Brewery Black Chocolate Stout?!  That will keep me coming all winter.
