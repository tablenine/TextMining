Crowded on a a Sunday morning, but service was tip-top. Food was also good, although my plate was little light on eggs -- I got the Crawfish Cakes ($11) and eggs (scrambled), but what was supposed to be two eggs looked liek bareyl one to me. But saying that, I was plenty full and left half of one delicious(!) crawfish cake behind. Good corn muffin, too. Other folks enjoyed their breakfasts and the home fries were a hit. I should have gotten the grits. I love good grits!. . TIP -- Avoid the $8 valet parking and find a spot close by on the street. Plenty of spaces from what I could see. Valet service is pretty bad anyway.
