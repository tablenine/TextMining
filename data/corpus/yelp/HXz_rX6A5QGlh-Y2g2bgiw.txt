Well I finally went last night and was very happy about the Valet Parking because you cant find parking nearby.  I almost passed it up but it was the Valet I noticed first.  . . Loved the Crab Backed Sushi Roll the best but Also Mom had the Shrimp Tempura roll which was also very good.  We tried the Fried Crab Mozzerella and it was weird but I guess if you have children you want to introduce slowly to Sushi it would be a good way to start.  For me it was way to fried Cheesy.. . I will go back for sure it was crowded and you do have to wait but we did not wait very long.. . I liked sitting at the bar because the chairs where not tall they were normal and I loved watching the artful sushi rolls being made.
