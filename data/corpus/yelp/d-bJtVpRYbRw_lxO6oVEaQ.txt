Restaurant: Bone&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Steakhouses
Love Bone's. You can count on having a fabulous meal and receiving impeccable service. We have an annual dinner at Bone's to celebrate our anniversary or birthdays. It's almost comical at this point. I use OpenTable to secure a table. The staff at Bone's place little decorations on the table to denote birthday/anniversary, etc and our celebration is in high-gear. Â We each the petite fillet and the outstanding Bone's salad (butter lettuce, apples, pistachios) and DH selects several side dishes (don't miss the corn pudding) - my selection is the wine.. . Yes, this restaurant is a landmark - and deservedly so. They do things right and keep doing things right.
