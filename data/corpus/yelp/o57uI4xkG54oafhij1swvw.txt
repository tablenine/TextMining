Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
I've landed at The Brick Store Pub many times and the thing that always strikes me is they never fail to be packed and busy. The ambiance is awesome and if you're lucky I suggest pulling up a stool at the downstairs bar. . . The beer selection is likely the longest in Atlanta and probably what continues to draw the crowd. The food is above par for pub grub and the I suggest getting the cheese plate or pretzels. . . Many people don't explore the upstairs is where the Belgium beer bar is. I highly recommend walking up there and often times this is where you can find a spot when the place gets crowded. . . Overall a good experience. I wish it wasn't so crowded, but I guess that means its good.
