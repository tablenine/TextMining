Category: Mexican
normally, one of my favorite places... . unfortunately, after standing in a 20 minute line last week we were asked to leave because the health department was shutting the place down in the middle of service. the hostess/waitress told us they had "several health code violations.". i will consider the bullet dodged. however, i'm not sure i can heartily recommend any establishment that has been closed in the middle of service for MULTIPLE health code violations.. ick.. i'm splitting the difference and giving 3 stars because i really did love their food before i knew about the nastiness going on behind the scenes...
