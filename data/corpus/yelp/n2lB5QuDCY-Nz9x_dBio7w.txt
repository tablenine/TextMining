Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
this is the first restaurant i went out to when i came to visit LA just before i moved here and since then i visit pretty regularly. you might think it because of some kind of nostalgia, but truth is we got nothin like this back in NC. the food is at once exotic and familiar, which means if you feel like taking a quick trip to brazil: be our guest. if you'd like to enjoy the super relaxed atmosphere, tasty beer (big ol' bottle of boont amber ale) and/or wine and not wonder what exactly that sauce is made of, then get a delicious pizza and maybe some plaintans on the side. we won't judge.. . and just when you thought you couldn't bring the party home with you...they deliver. that's right, bitches. carnival!
