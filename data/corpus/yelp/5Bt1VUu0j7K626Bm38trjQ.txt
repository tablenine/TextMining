Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
After hearing raving reviews from several people, my friends &amp; I decided to check it out. I found that this is why it's better to tell your friends to "check it out" rather than gushing "oh my God you just have to go it's to die for" because the chicken-waffle duet might not sustain such high expectations.. . The chicken was good, though I thought KFC was also as nice. As a chicken-waffle combo, it's a bit unusual for me, but after a few bites I can see why some people swear by this dish. . . I wish the owner would do something about the place to minimize the noise. It's so loud that I got a headache when I left the restaurant.
