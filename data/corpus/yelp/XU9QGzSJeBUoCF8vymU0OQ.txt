Talk about alot going on in one place!  Holy crap!  This place has it all... fine dining in the main dining room, a market where you can buy deli stuff, wines, cheeses, etc.; a full bar; and a patiserie.  Then on the opposite side of this huge place, you have the pizza ovens where you can find the cooks hand tossing the dough way high, almost touching the 30' ceiling!  It's an incredible place, just really busy.  . . Been here for lunch a few times and the food is great.  Just one of those trendy spots that seems to be the hot spot in DTLA right now.  I can say that because, I spent the evening out with some visitors from corporate one night.  When the limo driver asked where to go, we asked him to surprise us... I have to admit I was alittle surprised when we pulled up to Bottega Luie's for a nightcap, of all places.  It's just too busy of a place when you're trying to wind down.  Fortunately, 7 Grand is across the street.. . I still need to do dinner here.  More to come on that. . . .
