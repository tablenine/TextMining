I went here yesterday for lunch and had a great time. The restaurant itself is very clean, in fact there was a lady cleaning the doorstep with a toothbrush. We ordered a pizza and salad. The Italian Chop salad was great and at a good price, $9 and we spilt the salad. The pizza was divine, thin crust and perfect amount of sauce and cheese. . . My favorite part of the restaurant was the beautiful french macaroons. They are a little pricey at $1.75 each, but they were worth every penny. They made up for the cost of the macaroons with one dollar coffee.. . Parking was easy. There is a lot next to the restaurant for six dollars.. . Overall, a great experience.
