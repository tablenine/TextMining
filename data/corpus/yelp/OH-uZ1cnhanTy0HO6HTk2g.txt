Good place for drinks with friends, or for meeting new ones. Good vibe inside and very warm cool people usually. Every now and again you will "stumble" across a idiot or two. But usually a great hang. . . - Service is usually great and very creative drinks. Very accommodating drink menu. . - Plenty of seating, classy pool table area, big screen bar area, or more upscale bar area as well as dining room. . - Food is above par and well priced. . - Drinks are big and strong, you wont be disappointed. . . This is a bar / lounge more than anything in my opinion. Dinner is good and worth going, but more reviewing the bar crowd. . . Lots of girls usually hangin out here, so great chance to mingle with some possibles. . . Never an issue getting in, and decent parking on street and valet. . Do it.
