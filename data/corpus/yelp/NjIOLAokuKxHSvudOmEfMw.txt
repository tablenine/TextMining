Food:  not bad.  fries are good.  regular fries are the really skinny  type and the sweet potato ones are thicker... the burger is good but different... some people may not like the taste so you either love it or you hate it i guess... the steak isn't bad.maybe 7.5/10 ... dark in there so may be hard to see the menu. . Service:  you come in and find your own table and seat yourself.  you have to go up to the register at the bar to order your food/drinks (this can be kinda slow)  food is brought out to you somewhat efficiently. . Parking:  there are some parking lots nearby. not bad
