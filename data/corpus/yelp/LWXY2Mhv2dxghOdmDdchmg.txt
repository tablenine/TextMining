So today I got a tweet from twitter saying that one of the kogi truck's was going to be in southgate...I was ridiciously excited that it was so close, and knew that I was not gonna let anything get in my way from checking it out! So I picked up a friend and headed down. I didn't know what to expect???Would I even find the truck? Would their be a huge line? Would it be worth the wait?. . I can say...it totally was!!! Forgive me "Kogi" for ever doubting you! We got their 20 mins early and we were the 2nd in line. We waited about 10 mins before our order was taken. It was really cool that they started serving early..:) . . We tried to refrain ourselves from ordering everything on the menu....so we ordered short rib tacos, short rib sliders, blackjack quesadilla, and a chocolate tres leche cake.....I know it was alot, but I wanted to try a little bit of everything, and we shared!!! . . The short rib tacos were.not as great as I expected but still good.... after trying the tacos, in my mind I knew how everything else would taste...boy was I WRONG! So next the blackjack quesadilla....OMG...sooooooo good!!! It was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. A little sweet with just the right amount of spice. I was in love.....:) I was then excited to try the sliders....another amazing dish! It was so filling, I took leftovers home, and was wishing I wasn't soo full so that I could eat the rest. lol Â Even later that evening, I asked my friend, "so are you down for another round?" lol it was that good! Definately worth trying!!!
