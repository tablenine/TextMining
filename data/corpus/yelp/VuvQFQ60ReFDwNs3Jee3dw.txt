Went on a Sunday for a low key dinner.  I read the other reviews and decided to give H51 a chance.  For starters, my table had the Potato Debri (?).  It was okay (they serve three sauces and the potatoes are prepared homestyle).  For entrees, we had the pulled pork tacos, open-faced blt, and meatloaf sandwich.  Overall (and at best), it was okay.  The menu is a hodge podge of items with no central theme.  I really felt that the restaurant was a nicer version of a Chili's or TGI Fridays.  The decor was nice, but the food was so lackluster that you wonder if you're better off going nearby to Rock Bottom or something.  The only other saving grace would maybe be the service, but our waiter was terrible.  Held off on dessert just to finish the experience.  I would not recommend this restaurant to others.
