Restaurant: Osteria 832
Category: Pizza
Osteria 832 has a ton of meaning to me. This is where my bf and I first started hanging out as friends and across the street in front of my car he confessed his love for me. We used to eat here all the time and I always got the gorgonzola pasta or a veggie pizza. So as you see, this place has a special place in my heart.. . We haven't visited Osteria 832 in awhile, considering we live half-a-mile from the Highlands and we run by every weekend, it's not the location.. . We came here one night after seeing a show at The Fox. We have a rule, developed from common courtesy as well as his experience as a server, that we do not go into a restaurant unless there are 30+ minutes until closing. And even then we know our order by the time the server asks for drinks. It's rude, we don't do it! So, on this particular evening we were sat on the patio in the corner with both tables next to ours taken by other customers. Several servers walked by us filling drinks, taking orders, and checking on their tables. Never once did anyone take our drink order. We waited for 20 minutes without anyone saying a single thing to us. At this point, we got up and went inside I layed the menu's on the bar (quiet dramatically) and walked out the door. . . We haven't returned since and maybe eventually we'll return, but ya know what? Figo is yummy and cheaper and satisfies me all the same.
