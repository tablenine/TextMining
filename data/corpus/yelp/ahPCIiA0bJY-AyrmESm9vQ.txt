The first time I went to this place I fell in love with their ramen and for some reason it wasn't too crowded.  The second time the line was pretty long but I know it's worth the wait.  It all changed when I had to use the restroom. Yikes!!! That's when I lost my appetite. I value a clean restroom. If the toilet bowl doesn't flush then you're in trouble.  It was really dirty.  I started noticing everything from the table, the floor, etc. It is good but u question if what you're eating is clean. I'm sorry I was really turned off after I used their restroom.  My husband still likes this place though. I prefer Orochan.
