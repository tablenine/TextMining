I've been here a few times this past summer and I am in LOVE. The tiramisu is seriously as good as it gets. Really. Try it for yourself.. . The paninis are great, as are the Italian sodas. Very good cappuccino too!. . This place has convinced me its the best tiramisu in the city. Oops ,did I mention the tiramisu already? ;)
