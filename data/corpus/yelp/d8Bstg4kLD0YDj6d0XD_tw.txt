Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
Ok.  So I'd like to think Lola's read my previous Yelp!  Review and decided to change their ways.  But I think the reality is that they probably were just super happy that I chose their venue to host a professional Holiday party of 25+ people.. . Whatever the case may be, I am FLOORED by how good my Lola's experience was on party night.  Oh my.  Could NOT have asked for a better party.  Service was EXCEPTIONAL, so attentive without being overbearing, and the manager for the night was very responsive and approachable (I think his name is Russ but his partner Sara also helped me quite a bit with arranging the party... kudos to you BOTH!).  Our party, large as it was, was able to sit in the indoor patio area that closes off from the rest of the restaurant with the curtain... so nice and private!  And the food... was delicious (lots of variety on the menu for every appetite), was plentiful (three courses, dessert and one drink included) and was REASONABLE ($25 per person!  HOLY MOTHER COW!!!!).  I'm still taken aback with what an impressive job Lola's did that night.  Absolutely recommended for a holiday party of any size.. . Only one problem... and it's not really the restaurants fault... some of my guests were claiming that the restaurant was hard to find.  Maybe better lighting for the sign?
