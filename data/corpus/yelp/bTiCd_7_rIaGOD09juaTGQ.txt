Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
4 stars for unique combo of name and flavors this once tiny stand serves up.  The hotdogs come in celebrity themed combinations.  You'll find a good variety to choose from.  . . Pink's is a hollywood icon more than anything.  Servings are large and greasy, but it's pretty damn good.  Seems everyone's been here at least once...overrated?..perhaps-- you be the judge.
