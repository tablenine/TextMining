My friend is going to hate me for giving Canter's a two-star rating but I had high expectations since a MSN article stated that Canter's deli had some hot pastrami sandwiches and bread. My friend and I tried the chicken breast and pastrami sandwich and both were bleh. The bread was hard, dry and nothing special. The place looks like something out of the 60s and the worst part was you have to pay for parking! But I think parking is free if you do eat at Canter's if you show the receipt I believe.. . The biggest complaint has to be the prices. The prices are crazy and I cannot believe we paid 35 bucks for two sandwiches. I rather go to a fancy restaurant and pay that price for a higher quality with superb ingredients and bread. Nothing special here other than a stained glass ceiling which looks like it lights up at night making the restaurant look like a disco club.
