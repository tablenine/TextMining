WORST SERVICE IN MY LIFE!!!  I was so excited to take my dad to a new place for these amazing burgers and garlic fries and I took him here. First of all let me list all the bad qualities about this palce!!!. 1.  YOU WALK IN AND HAVE TO FIND A SEAT YOURSELF . 2. THERE ARE NO WAITERS ONLY TABLE CLEANER GUYS.. 3 YOU HAVE TO ORDER AT THE BAR ( THATS WAS A PROBLEM WITH MY SPOILED FATHER). 4. THE ONE THING WE WANTED WAS A REGULAR HAMBURGER WITH THE GARLIC FRIES!!!!  AND MY DAD WAS ALLERGIC TO BLUE CHEESE AND HE DIDNT WANT ARUGELA  LETTUCE !!!!. . THEY WILL NOT SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO ORDER THE BURGER AS IS!! THEY TOLD ME I CAN SCRAPE IT OFF MYSELF AND THAT THEY CANT TAKE OUT OR ADD ANYTHING TO IT !! WTF!!! I THOUGHT THIS PLACE WAS GOING TOBE AMAZING!!. . JUST A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! . . if you want to have a 20min debate with the manager about a hamburger go ahead and eat here, But it was such a horrible experience.
