Oh, Fresh2Order. I've been to this location in Midtown several times, and even though I'm not one to try out new things, I have loved everything I've eaten here. The people that work there are nice, and it's laid back but not your typical sandwich shop. Jimmy Johns? "pish posh" . . About the food...Today I had the almond crusted chicken sandwich. Super tender with a great, light sauce, They also serve beer and wine, and currently have citrus mint sweet tea. I've never had a better salad. You can get your green on and get full, too. With that said- you can order any salad with additional protein. . . I filled out a comment card today. Call me obsessed, I don't care, I drew clouds with thunderbolts exploding little hearts. You get the idea.
