Restaurant: Terroni
Category: Italian
The first thing we saw when approaching Terroni was a woman sitting outside with a kangaroo strapped to her chest.  Yes, a kangaroo.  This night is starting out pretty interesting so far.. . Terroni is definitely trendy, but it was a friendly (read: loud) atmostphere.  We got the pappardelle with sausage, mushrooms and peas--it was one of those pasta dishes were you can taste that the pasta is homemade.  We also got the mezze-meshugana (or something like that), a rigatoni and eggplant dish that was decent.  . . But the real winner was the molten chocolate cake.  I don't really understand, or care for, foodies and/or foodie poseurs who like to label dishes as "so last year" or "so passe."  Is food not good then, now and forever if it tastes good?  Is pizza "so passe" because it's been around for hundreds of years?  ANYWAY my point is, their flourless chocolate cake was spine-chillingly delicious.  It was warm, just the perfect amount of richness, and who doesn't love a dessert that oozes chocolate out of it?. . I could've eaten five or six of these cakes and it would've been worth the ensuing food coma.  Now I only have the delicious memory of it until I go back...
