This is a great place for some good southern cooking. I had the fried chicken. it came with a side of mashed potatos and some vegetables.  The chicken was really tasty and not greasy at all.  The service was excellent.  I was with a large group, and they had no problem splitting the bill according to what we ordered. . . I will return, and I think most people would like this restaurant.
