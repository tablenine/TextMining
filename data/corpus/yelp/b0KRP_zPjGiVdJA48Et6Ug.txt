Always, always, always crazy busy.  . . Definitely worth it.  The food is always excellent, the people are always friendly, and the line goes...relatively fast for a place so full to the brim with people.  If you can get away with an hour and a half for lunch - check it out.  The sandwiches are good, the potato balls are good, and the pastries are the best in town.  . . Treat yourself.  You'll love it.  I know I do!
