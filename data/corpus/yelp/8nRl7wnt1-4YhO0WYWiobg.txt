Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
Langer's has been open since 400BC, but I haven't managed to get there due to the limited operating hours. They have an extension menu highlighted by several pastrami sandwiches. On my visit, I also wanted to get the liver &amp; onions, just to understand how that dish even makes restaurant menus. But I've heard the chickens are actually raised with humane methods and I won't support that. . . The food arrived 3 minutes after we ordered it and they will serve you as long as you get in the door before 4PM.. . Dishes rated (1 - 10), 10 being amazing:. . #19 PASTRAMI, SWISS CHEESE, and COLE SLAW. Russian Style Dressing (9) $12.25. This is the best pastrami sandwich I have had. The only relative comparison I have is Schwartz's smoked meat sandwich in Montreal and Langer's was better. The meat was amazingly tender and went great with the rye, coleslaw, and dressing.. . HOT PASTRAMI and SWISS CHEESE  (7)  $11.60. We got this one with on a French roll. The pastrami was just as good. I just gave it a lower rating because it's best served on rye and it was better with coleslaw and the dressing.. . I gave it a 5 star because they are clearly known for their pastrami and it was great. I'll have to try the other dishes to see if they are just as good.. . I would agree with the other reviews that the prices are on the high end and the hours are also bad. There is, however, free parking a block east of the restaurant.
