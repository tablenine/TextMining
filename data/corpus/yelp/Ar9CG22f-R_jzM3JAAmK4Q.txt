Beer! Yummy Belgium Waffles! Beer! Sausage! Rattlesnake Sausage (whaa?)! Beer! Hipsters!... love it here. . Beer selection is great! Bartenders are pleasant &amp; helpful - they even let you try some beer before ordering. If you're going for lunch, get there early to avoid the line around the block. I'd recommend going there at night. There's a DJ and just an overall pleasant relaxed atmosphere. Great spot to hang out with friends and meet people.. . The neighborhood is a tad dodgy- but worry not, fellow yelper! It's worth it.
