I would have to say that this is one of my favorite restaurants in NY.  Its probably best to pick a few meat dishes and share rather than to order individual entres.  The lamb and chicken are absolutely amazing.  They are marinated for 24 hours in a special, family-secret kind of sauce and that gives it an amazing flavor.. Its also got a pretty cool, hip vibe so for me its became a kind of "impress your date" spot  LOL  Really really good!
