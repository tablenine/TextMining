Restaurant: Porchetta
Category: Sandwiches
The porchetta sandwich wasn't too bad-- porky fatty goodness on a toasted ciabatta roll. However, the crispy potatoes and burnt ends were a bit too crispy, bordering on rock hard. I was able to pick through and maybe eat half of them. Â I honestly don't think I'll be coming back here, I mean the sandwich was alright, but not for ten bucks.
