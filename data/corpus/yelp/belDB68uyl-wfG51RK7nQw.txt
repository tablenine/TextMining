Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
i am sorry..but the line you wait for at Pink's is not worth it.. I believe i can make a better hot dog at home or maybe even the guy that cooks and sell bacon wrapped hot dogs outside of clubs on the corner of the street must be better than pinks.  I mean it is good, but NOT THAT good.  I don't know how it became soo well known, maybe because of all the movie stars that has been there.. but I even bet you the movie stars only went there once and never again. They probably went because there is nothing else open around that time esp. in the middle of the night in hollywood (you will not find them at McDonalds that's for sure).  So yea.. i don't know what to say.. but if you like waiting in long lines you should come here and try the Pink Panther.  But if you don't like lines and would like a hot dog, just make it at home or go to Weinershnitzel or however you spell it. It is cheaper yet satisfying.  :D
