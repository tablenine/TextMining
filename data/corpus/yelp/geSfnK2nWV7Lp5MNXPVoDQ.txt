Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Brazilian
I ate at Fogo de Chao several years ago with my sister and the jerk I was dating at the time. After one melt-in-your-mouth sausage link, a chunk of tender sirloin and a piece of bacon-wrapped lamb, I was stuffed, resorting to the salad bar's lighter fare: smoked salmon, fresh veggies and an assortment of interesting cheeses. . . When a gaucho rushed over to my table, eager to please me with another slab of beef, I realized my card still was turned to green, quickly flipping it over. . . We split a light, tasty dessert: some sort of fruity ice cream drizzled in a brandy sauce. . . The service truly was great and the food, delicious. But I can't cram $50 worth of endless meat into my belly. My sister threw up after we got home.. . Although Fogo de Chao is high-class and high-quality, it's the kind of place that makes the faint-at-stomach consider becoming a vegetarian.
