The bar area was a scene, but in a good way. The service was incredible and incredibly helpful, friendly and gorgeous (both men and women). People there ranged from Lincoln Park Trixie to Gold Coast fab and everything in between. Ages 21-60. The food my friend and I shared was dee-lish - the thrice reviewed chicken nachos (AMAZING and they make their corn chips and tortillas Â in-house) and smokey-flavored salsa were enough for us to get full on. Buuuut, we had to share something else and were thrilled with the short ribs entree. Leftovers made for a great lunch next day. The decor was cool and the ceilings were super high so no matter how many people packed in, it never felt overwhelming. I will most definitely go back there as it exceeded my expectations. There was nothing average about it.
