Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
One of the best reasons to go to LA other than the hookers.. . This is how a taco was supposed to be. Not greasy, the shell is crunchy, loads of thick grated cheese, crispy lettuce and succulent shredded beef. The salsa is fresh and tasty. I'm surprised to see it only has 3 stars. I don't see how anyone who likes mexican food could dislike this place, based on my experience it's 5 stars all the way.
