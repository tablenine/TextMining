Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
RECOMMENDATION:  Hainam Chicken (for those who don't know it is steam chicken (salted) over white rice along with dipping sauce.. . Savoy is only good when you go for the hainam chicken.  the thing is that my grandma makes the best hainam chicken so i guess you can't really compare, but this place is known for the hainam chicken.  so i suggest you go there for that.  Other than that they have other things like pasta, fried egg rolls, and some lemon tea, thai tea, and etc... . it is a very small place so again, parking is hard to find and it gets pretty crowded.. so if you are hungry arrive early.
