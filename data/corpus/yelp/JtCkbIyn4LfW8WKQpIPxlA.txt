My friend chose this place to celebrate her bday.  It was a great place to have her birthdya.  I absolutely LOVED the interior.  The high ceiling, large venue, the open kitchen, the whiteness.  Its very beautiful.  The portions were okay.  The pizza was a good deal but the pasta was itttyyy biitttyyy.  It was hard to get our waiters attention but other then that it was a good overall experience
