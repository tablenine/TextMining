Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
The wait staff here was just fine and I get where they're going with the almost cheesy decor, but the sushi just wasn't good. I am admittedly Â a california snob when it comes to my sushi, but at their prices, even in the midwest the rolls should be much better. Won't be going back.
