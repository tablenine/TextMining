My dad first brought me here in the 70's and I'm hooked for life.  Some say the pastrami place next door has better food but I've never tried it.  That would be like flying to California for one day and bypassing Disneyland for California Adventure.  Life's too short.  Tito's rocks!!  I dare you to eat their burrito in your car.  Way too messy, but simply delicious.  When I see the familiar line, I know I'm in for a treat.
