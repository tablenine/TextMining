I have to say I used to LOVE this place but it has really gone downhill.  I have gone here many many times and lately it just has not been what it used to be :(.  Maybe my last experience here was a fluke,  but it was not good.  I ordered a bowl of soup with a side of bread (you have to order it separately).  I was just having a snack while my friend was eating lunch.  My soup came out before my friend even ordered her meal.  My bowl was literally less than a 1/4 of the way full!  I finished it in about 4 spoons and my bread never came.  Then my friend ordered some kind of a vegetable combination.  Let's just say her vegetables were not the freshest.  We were both VERY disappointed in this experience.  This restaurant is pretty expensive so we expected great quality and service.  RFD used to be amazing!  What happened?   Why is it becoming so hard to find a good reasonably priced vegetarian restaurant in Los Angeles?
