I guess the rain kept everyone else inside because we parked close and the place was half full which meant quick service!  GREAT.. . We ordered miso soup (DELICIOUS), the baked lobster tail tempura(AWESOME - the best thing we ate), and I ordered the Tony rolls (shrimp tempura with shrimp, real crab and avocado).  It was good but way too much sauce on it.  My bf ordered the Special Crunchy rolls (Tempura, Crab, and Mayo topped w/Smoke Salmon).  His was ok.  . . The dinner took exactly one hour.  I didn't mind that.  I think everything was great and would definitely come back again.  I'm glad it wasn't crowded.  . . The waitress was very nice.
