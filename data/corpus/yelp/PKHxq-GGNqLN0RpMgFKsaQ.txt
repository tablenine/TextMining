Granted, I was starving by the time I got my food, but I liked it!  I got two tacos: short rib and pork.  I should have gotten three!  They're pretty damn small...yes, I know they only cost $2.  The meat was flavorful, just wish there was a little bit more of it in my taco.  The line moves sloooow.  Correction, the line to order isn't too bad, it's the wait to get your food.  I don't know why it takes so long to just shove the meat into some tortillas.  Next time I'll try the burrito.
