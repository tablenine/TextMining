Came here for a birthday party this past weekend.  Upon entering you are greeted by sausage display case.  There is a lot to choose from.  Not only is there an abundance of sausages to choose from but they also have a beer garden.  I picked the the duck, bacon, jalapeno sausage cause I love a little spice in my life.  So I proceeded to the eating area where they have long tables, a dj, and an additional bar.  So its great for large gatherings if you get there early enough to snag a table.  Shortly after ordering I received my sausage and started to have my way with it.  It wasn't bad but I wasn't blown away.  I don't think I am that big of a sausage fan.  Now if they served the bacon wrapped hot dogs, I would be be all over this place and then some.  Overall, this place is great for some sausage and beer enjoyment with friends.  Oh and make sure to bring a writing implement to draw or write on the tables.
