This place is really good...but not the best steak I've ever had. Service was great though and they were able to move my reservation around due to some last minute delays on my end.. . As for food:. Appetizers--. - Lobster bisque - yum, big bowl of bisque with big chunks of lobster topped with a giant lobster spring roll. - Caesar salad, prepared table-side - This was reallllly good. I kept stealing bites from my bf's plate. . Entrees--. - 40 day dry aged rib-eye - medium-rare, nice and marbled. It's about 1 inch thick, seasoned all-around. I had a few bites of this and both my bf and I preferred the NY sirloin over this. This seemed to lack flavor so we added a bit more sea salt and pepper to it to make it a bit more interesting.. - NY sirloin - This was yummy and freaking ginormous. Probably 3 inches thick! Done medium-rare and decently seasoned. Nice and juicy but I also had to add some more sea salt and pepper to it since it was somewhat lacking in flavor.. . Sides--. - Asparagus w/ shallots - delicious, I recommend. - Creamed spinach - I'm not normally a fan but my bf loved it since it was just the right balance of cream and spinach goodness.. . No dessert because we were already in a food coma by that point.. . Overall, really good experience but not an "OMG-best-steak-ever" kinda place for me.
