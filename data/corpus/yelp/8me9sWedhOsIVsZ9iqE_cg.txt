This is the perfect place to go for lunch on a sunny sunday with a bunch of friends.  Great beer, Mexican Coke (!!), delicious guac and chips, and AMAZING tacos.  Mmmm. Oh and queso fundido, which means melted cheese, just in case anyone else was wondering (now i've saved you from pulling out your blackberry to look it up during lunch.)  The service was great and friendly, and since we were there pretty early on a Sunday I think we avoided the infamous wait.  . . My only gripe is that the food comes out piece meal, and it took a long time to get everything. Not a big deal for a smaller group, but with 10 people, some people had eaten all their food before others had gotten any. Otherwise, delicious!
