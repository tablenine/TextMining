Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Semi fancy place. Reminds me of the restaurants you see on TV with the fancy dining. The food apparently is amazing (I can't tell since I don't like prime rib). Service is excellent. Great environment. Price is high but worth the price. . . You might bump into a few celebrities here too!. . Food: 4. Service: 5. Environment: 5. Price: 4
