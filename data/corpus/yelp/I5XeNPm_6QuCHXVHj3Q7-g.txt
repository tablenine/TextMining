Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: Bars
I am a vegetarian...which sometimes makes going to dinner at a nice restaurant a hard thing to happen.  You've seen Top Chef.  It is always the vegetarian/vegan challenge that makes the contestants groan...really?  No protein?  No meat?  . . Uncommon ground offered two vegetarian options on their menu, pumpkin ravioli and well the other I can't remember.  But for $18 I felt as though I needed to pass.  What really brought us (my best friend and I) here was their drink menu.  Can anyone say ROSEMARY INFUSED VODKA????  AMAZING!!!!!!!!  . . But drinking on an empty stomach is usually not a good idea, and I am pretty sure Uncommon Ground would frown upon me getting on the bar and dancing.  So we ordered food...off the small plates (fancy word for appetizers).  They were so so so so good.  Squash, sweet potatoes and chili.  All vegetarian and all perfect for the cold weather night.  One weird thing was that all tables were reserved.  ALL TABLES RESERVED!  Also we had to go through Wrigleyville and their pub crawls to get here.  . . Oh and one of the waiters...so dreamy.
