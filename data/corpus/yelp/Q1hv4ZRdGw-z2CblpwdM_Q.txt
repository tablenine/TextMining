Been here a few times and have always had a good meal. Service is always a little slow, so be prepared to wait when you first sit down or for the check. I have only had there hamburgers and they are good. I heard the Bleu cheese burger is great too ( I am not a fan of it!) Also, there are no free refills on pop, iced tea, etc and they take CASH only! Though they do have an ATM when you walk inside. I would go back b/c they have a great outside patio, but will go when I am not in a hurry!
