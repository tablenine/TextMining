They get 3 stars mainly because of the decor and the ambiance of the restaurant. It was colorful and very artistic! The food was good but not great. I had the Alfredo Ravioli and it was so rich and yummy! My friends got some seafood and they seem to have loved it. . You do have to valet your car for $4.50 and they have a cute bar as a waiting room before getting seated. . I came here for my friend's birthday and I brought my own cake just in case she didn't like the garlic ice cream (eww). They were supposed to charge $10 for the cake fee but I didn't see it on our bill maybe because we had a $370 bill :). It always always gets on my nerves when restaurants do not offer the service of splitting checks because it's a pain to go through the math with so many people. . If you love garlic this is the place to be... mannn they have everything in garlic including ice cream (like I said eww). :)
