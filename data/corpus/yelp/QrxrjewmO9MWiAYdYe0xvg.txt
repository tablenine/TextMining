Restaurant: Desta Ethiopian Kitchen
Category: Ethiopian
I had not eaten Ethiopian food until I came to Atlanta.  And, happily, my first foray into this new food world was all homemade by the true blue's.  However, since everyone is so busy these days, it's nice to find a great restaurant that makes the food just like home.. . We had the Vegetarian Combo and the Tibs FirFir.  These were on a community plate for our table.  The injera was regularly replenished.  We were able to taste two types of wine.  One was a little dry and the other was a little sweet.  We shared a bottle of the sweeter wine.  Then, I had the Green Tea with Ginger and Honey.  The service was very attentive and pleasant.. . The Tibs FirFir had some meat in it as well as injera cooked along with it. The Veggie Combo had 6 different varieties of yummy goodness.  I loved the Shiro.  It's like the Ethiopian version of 'refried beans', sort of.  It was so delicious!  The injera was mild on the 'sour' note.  I tend to like a tiny bit of the sour note.  But, it didn't matter.. . The seating inside is limited with some booths and small tables.  There is some patio seating as well.  The ladies bathroom was nice and clean.. . To truly enjoy your experience, you must not be in a rush.  Enjoy the meal with your friends and have tea afterward.. . I saw a lot of yummy plates come out of the kitchen.  The varieties are endless since I learned that you can customize what you want on your plate!. . I look forward to returning to Desta very soon!
