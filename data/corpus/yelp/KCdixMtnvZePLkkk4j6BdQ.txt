I wanted to check out LA Live and it was about 3pm.  So I thought, happy hour and take a quick gander at the 54 ft tall LED Christmas tree, walk around LA Live, kill two birds with one stone.  The light show wasn't showing, so I'll have to return for the entertainment next time.  I like the set up of this Yard House.  It's very big and I can see it going places!  I gave it 3 stars because it was just my coworker and I sitting at the bar.  About 5% of the seats were filled (almost about the same amount of patrons  as there were bartenders), and it still took us a good 10 minutes before we got our drink order in.  I have faith in this Yard House since it's probably one of the best deals around in Downtown LA (food and drinks on tap).  I forecast a 4 or 5 star in my next review upon returning to this particular Yard House and receiving better service.
