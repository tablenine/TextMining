Recommended by our tattoo artist, we ventured to Logan Square. I haven't been in this area for a while and was amazed at the great restaurants that popped up in the area. The calamari was fresh and homemade with the perfect breading (we had it fried, but you could have ordered it grilled). I had the veal medallions with prosciutto, my friends had the chicken special and veal medallions with mushrooms and pine nuts. Everything was tasty and the portions were right on. We ordered the cheesecake and cannoli for dessert... and I would say the dessert was by far the best. . . Wine by the glass is very reasonable, but some of the bottles were way overpriced. My friends had the $5 chardonnay and really liked it.
