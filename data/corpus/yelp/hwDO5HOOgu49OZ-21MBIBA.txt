Are you a tourist?. . Then don't go..screaming kids will scream no more! Its always packed with 300 pounds of tourists and for what? The payoff is comparable or lower then most Chicago joints off the Mile. . . I got the hamburger.. cant remember the name, the waiter didnt warn me at all that the whole cow is included. Normally that wouldn't phase me one bit. But they put all kinds of junk on it. Tasty no...
