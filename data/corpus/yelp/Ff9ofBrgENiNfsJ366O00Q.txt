Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I don't get this place. It's not that good. The people are nice, but the dogs are just regular dogs. I'm not into waiting for stuff, but I'm OK with waiting for stuff if the stuff I'm waiting for is special. And Pink's is more of an institution than anything else. Nothing special, nothing super tasty.
