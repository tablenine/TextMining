i came to this restaurant a few years ago after hearing ppl talk about how they have the best french dip, and how this place is a los angeles classic, so of course i wanted to try this place out!!! =). . boy did i come out extremely disappointed, this place is ALL HYPE. . the portions were ridiculously TINY, expensive, and not all that great, i'm glad i was able to come here just to say that i've eaten here, but i don't plan on ever coming back. . there are TONS of other better sandwich places around, this place is completely overrated
