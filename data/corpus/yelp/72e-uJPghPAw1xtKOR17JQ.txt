I'm not a breakfast person but I liked it here! I got the coffeecake toast and it wasn't too greasy or wet or anything! They have really cute fruit cups that come with some of the other orders and all of their orders are presented very nicely. I also got an AMAZING red velvet cupcake to go. The waiters were attentive but not chatty--which is good when you just want to have a good conversation with a few friends. Some of my friend's from out of town complained that it was a little bit pricey, but that's what you get in LA. Difficult street parking is also what you get in LA... Nevertheless, a good breakfast meal!
