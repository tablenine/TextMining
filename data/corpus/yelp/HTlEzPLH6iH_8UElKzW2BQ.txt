The food here is amazing every time. Portions are giant enough to share. And service is top notch. . . My last visit was on an all too familiar date night, and I was not on a date. However I think we got our food faster than most of the two-tops around us. . . I highly recommend the dirty martinis. Top notch. . . And, the guacamole. Rivals Adobe's.
