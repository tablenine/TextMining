I went here the other night before catching a movie upstairs.  The staff was extremely attentive and friendly.  I ordered the cajun shrimp salad which was great.  My friend got the oyster plate which she loved.  We ordered the sweet potato moss as a starter which looked more like a bird's nest.  Stay away from the moss and you should have a nice casual cajun meal.
