Feast of flavors. My hubby surprised me and took me for my b-day. I loved it! I had spaghetti squash noodle that was so good, then eggplant dumpling half fried, so moist and rich, and a gnocchi- with mini tomatoes, sour that exploded in my mouth. It's a very sophisticated menu. The game of flavors is so voluptuous. The only thing I liked least was the coconut chocolate ice cream. It was semi sweet for me, when I was expecting to a sweet chocolate. I will come back, it's p icy ($128 for 6 courses, 3 glasses of wine) but definitely challenging. Very smart and innovative kitchen.
