This was a very good restaurant.  We showed up when they were closing but they took us anyway.  Their brownie dessert is to die for and their prime rib is the biggest and juciest I've ever had.  Service was very friendly and fast. Gave it three stars because they don't allow cell phones in the restaurant.
