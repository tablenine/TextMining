Hahaha, what an experience.. The food was good... but me going there was a joke someone played on me when I was first an LA resident...  . Not exactly what I was expecting, but I can't say it wasn't good...  . The joke was basically "you gotta check this place out, it's one of the nicest spots around and everything about it is amazing", my friend called it Roscoe's Lounge...  it was when I returned to work after the lunch break that they told me it was a joke.. I almost went back last week actually, but I need to chill out on the fried foods and go on a diet, I've been eating too much fat and drinking too much beer the past couple months.
