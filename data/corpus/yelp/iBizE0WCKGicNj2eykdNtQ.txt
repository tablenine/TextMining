My burger was far from terrible, but this place doesn't live up to the hype of "best burger in LA/the universe."  I think my rating is probably deflated by the fact that everyone I met in Los Angeles tried to convince me that this was God's gift to burgerdom.. . The meat was good and well-prepared, but some part of my carmelized onion bacon sauce tasted burnt.  That, combined with the fact that I don't really WANT carmelized onion bacon sauce on my burger, made the experience pretty average.. . I won't go back, but it is worth giving a shot just to see for yourself.
