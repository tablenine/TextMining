Came here before watching Wall-e at the El Capitan.  I had the address in hand but what a pain in the ass to find.  It's hidden behind another business establishment, so you can't see it from the street.  Just park in the Borders parking lot and you can get validated.. . When we get their we see our friends already at the bar so we just walk up and sit down.  It was kind of cool sitting there as you can see the chef preparing some of the food items, and we were able to ask questions and the such.  . . Food was ok as I'm not a huge seafood/veggie type of guy (i like shrimp/crabs).  I ordered the Black Cod and I tasted some of the Sea Bass.  I preferred the Sea Bass and the person I was with enjoyed the the Black Cod better.  (initially I was going to order the Sea Bass, but she wanted to have the Sea Bass, so we switched...how ironic).  The food was pretty good overall.  We shared a lemon Parfait...which was pretty good but a bit too much.. . Ambiance was a cool mix of your Hollywood hustle and bustle atmosphere.  In regards to value....it seemed a bit overpriced, but hey its Hollywood.  . . I paid with cash, but we were leaving for the movie soon and needed to get out.  It seemed as if they were taking forever with the change.  So I just left...since it was just a few bucks more then necessary for the tip...but whatever.  I just chalked it up to your typical LA experience
