Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I've never been to a place that's gotten so much buzz, but have absolutely nothing in terms of a saving grace that i'd call edible.. . The tacos and burritos are terrible.  I don't even know what else to say about them.  They would have tasted better if they Tito's didn't try to flavor them.. . The guacamole has the consistency of snot and looks like it too.  . . I hope no one ever goes to this place.  There are far better places to eat.  . . TIP: If you go to costco and buy the frozen taquitos.  It tastes better.  I promise.
