Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
New rule: I don't think I'm allowed to engage in all-you-can-eat korean bbq ever again.  But if I do it'll probably be at Manna.. . I almost didn't go here because of all the not-so-excited reviews.  People were really critical of the service, but I went around 7 p.m. on a Thursday night and there weren't a lot of people there when we showed up, so we might have lucked out.  the service was great. . . The brisket and the pork short ribs were the best meats, and the sides were all really nice -- I really like the kimchi here, and that's not always true for me.  I also thought the side dishes were all very tasty _ I kept digging at the noodles long after I felt full. And the cucumber pickles have a miraculous ability to be crunchy and soggy at the exact same time.
