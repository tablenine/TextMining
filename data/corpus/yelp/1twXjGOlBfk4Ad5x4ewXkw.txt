I gave this place a second try, after a poor takeout experience the first time and I was pleasantly surprised.  The crab rangoon is great, the panang curry was above average and the thai fried rice was unique and satisfying.  . . Its cheap and quick, a good thai takeout meal on the weekend.  I still have to try the pad thai before I will make my final judgement.
