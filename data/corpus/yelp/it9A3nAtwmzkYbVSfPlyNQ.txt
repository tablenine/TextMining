To be honest, I am totally going middle of the road here, because, um, I can't remember what the food tastes like; I have only been there once when I wasn't drunk, and while I know that what I got was okay, it was only like french fries. The other times I have gone there, I have gotten full course meals it seems (according to my receipts), and I honestly don't remember a thing about what I ate. Perhaps it was good? I mean, at 3 in the morning, anything is, right? One cool thing about this place, is that I have met several cool people there, and even shared a booth with a few; it is less about the food, and more about the sobering up and experiencing something new. If you have never been, get drunk and go!
