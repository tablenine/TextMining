Hey, yummy.  Sushi Sunday is my version of Sunday Funday. I do love sushi.  I have been to Tank before but haven't been in a while.  We went on Sunday evening to take advantage of the half off maki deal. I really recommend this deal, because it makes the food more reasonably priced...without, it is a little overpriced for what you get. . . We were first seated near the front, in a tiny table between two other parties. I asked the waiter if instead we could sit near the back, for more privacy and breathing room really and he was really nice about it and accommodating. . . We got the miso soup which was hot and good except I tend to like more tofu and green onion in mine.  Our waitress reminded us that when we ordered, it was still before 6pm, so we could get the half off deal. I don't understand why you cant order more for that deal after 6pm, if you are already sitting down, but since they warn you, I guess that is their policy (if they didn't warn you, that would be annoying) . . We got the spicy tuna (yummy) the yellow fin (which was plain but really tasty) the Latin Heat (a little too much mayo for my taste but the chili sauce was awesome!) and the Samurai (lots of fish but huge bites!!). . The waitress was really nice but the service was slowww getting our food. I was so hungry.  Maybe it wasn't that slow and I was just starving, it just seemed to take a long time.  The fish was fresh and the rolls were tightly rolled and oh so yummy.. . The place is cute too- the music is not that loud and if you are in the back, it is pretty quiet and great for a date.  They also have two larger rooms in the back for bigger parties, which is nice, because they have doors and are a little more isolated. . . I would definitely go back for the half off deal!
