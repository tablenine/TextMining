Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
The Majestic is such an Atlanta landmark that I scolded myself for not having eaten here sooner.  I was very disappointed with the food.  The pork chops were dry and tough, the black eye peas and mac and cheese sides were both watery and too salty.  This place is also overpriced considering the quality.  . . I was originally going to get the fried chicken plate.  The waiter asked me if I wanted white or dark meat and I asked if I could get it mixed.  He replied, "Sorry, it's only one piece.  White or dark?"  Seriously?  At $9.50, their fried chicken plate contains only 1 piece of chicken?  One could starve eating that for dinner.
