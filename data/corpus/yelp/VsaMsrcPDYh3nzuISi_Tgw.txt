My fiance comes here once a week for lunch for good reason- the sub sandwiches are excellent.  Both the meatball and the Italian subs are the best.  I have never had better.  The bread is fresh and flaky.  The sandwiches have the perfect proportions of meat to cheese and vegetables.  I always get my italian sub made "spicy".  They put their homemade giardiniera on it, which is so tasty (I bought a jar of it for the house).  You have to take it to go but we usually just eat it in the car.  Yum.
