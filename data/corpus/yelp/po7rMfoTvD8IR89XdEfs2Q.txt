As a friend said, "It's just sketchy enough to be really great.". This place might remind you of the popular Nuevo Laredo when you walk in, but rest assured it is much much better.. In addition to the great salsa, they give you a bowl of authentic chutney-like vegetables that go well with the good tortilla chips. Get the cheese dip, fine cheese dip connoisseurs will NOT be disappointed! . The menu has all the regular burritos and such, as well as a menu of pressed sandwiches. They have a few interesting meats, and so they get away with having slightly bland ground beef. Skip the beef, and go for the spicy pork or the Mexican style chicken in your tacos.
