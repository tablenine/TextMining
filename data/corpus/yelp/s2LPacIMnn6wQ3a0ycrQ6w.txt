So this was the first time I had Pho, and I really enjoyed it. I got the vegetarian rice noodle soup. I was a little bit sick and it actually made me feel better, which was nice. Plus it tasted really good, lots of noodles.. I love me some carbs. I didn't really like the tofu that they put in it, but thats mostly because they cooked it correctly and it had sort of a meaty texture. Which I think would be a plus for most people, for example my carnivore boyfriend really liked it.... but i'm mostly a vegetarian because I don't like meat... meh.. go figure. But I will definitly be back!. . Parking sucks in the tiny lot, but street parking on Sunset didn't seem to be a problem. Woo pho!
