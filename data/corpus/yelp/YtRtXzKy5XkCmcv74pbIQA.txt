Just went here last weekend and beat the crowd! Yeah baby! But considering how quickly they serve you, your wait time won't be that bad unless you have a large party. . . There were 4 adults and a toddler in our group. The waiter was friendly and already knew what we wanted. We ordered:. . 1) House special lobster. I loved the Lobster, but my wife didn't. She thought it was over salted. I didn't notice it much. I was probably on my 4th piece by the time she was done with her first. Ask the waiter on what size of the lobster you should get if you're unsure. . . 2) Peppered Beef. Very tender and delicious. A must order dish. . . 3) Catfish (3 style) Â - very unnessary. Waiter convinced us to get this. . Our catfish was made into 3 different dishes - First some of it was for the soup base. Very good with added clams and veges. Next came half of the fish fried in the popular tangy sauce. I didn't care for this one as much. Then the last part was the other half that was boiled. The meat was a little tough and the fish seemed slightly undercooked. Catfish meat should be much softer. I think it was rushed. . . 4) Chicken Chow Mein. . We got this for my toddler but she didn't like it at all. You won't be ordering this here unless you have older kids. This place is definitely not for toddlers who are just starting to eat adult food. I guess we'll have to look over the menu a little more carefully next time. I was happy, but my kid left pissed. . . Overall good stuff. Take CASH. NO CREDIT CARDS. Our bill ran up to $250. It would have been lower if we weren't tricked into ordering that fish.....oh well.
