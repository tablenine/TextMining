Restaurant: Hatfield&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
Get your PRETTY ON, and take your date to Hatfield's!. . It is one of THE BEST locations for a romantic evening with that special someone.  Why would I say that?  First and foremost; the setting is minimal and modest, comfortable wooden chairs and tables draped with white crisp linen surrounded by ample ambient lighting (perfect setup to make "googly" eyes with your date!).  If you are seated outdoors, which I recommend during warm summer nights, the atmosphere is much more relaxing.  Now for the best part...the food...wow!...the FOOD!!!  Karen and Quinn Hatfield have truly perfected their culinary techniques into creating such beautiful dishes.  . . Prior to coming to the restaurant, my date and I have studied the menu extensively and actually asked people who have dined here before on what they recommend.  All had the unifying edict...THE TASTING MENU!  And tasting menu bound we were, to which we were gloriously satisfied with the decision.  It is comprised of 7 courses prepared by the chef for each person, depending on his mood for the evening.  Aaaaah!  He must've been in a wonderful mood because it truly resonated thru his dishes.  . . First Course . (mine):  BOBO FARMS SAUTEED FOIE GRAS, GOLDEN LENTIL PUREE, ROYAL TRUMPET MUSHROOMS, &amp; PETIT GRAPES; . (my date):  WARM SUMMER BEAN SALAD, CHARRED BABY SQUID, PRESERVED LEMON, &amp; GINGER CHERMOULA.  . . Second Course . (mine):  "CROQUE MADAME" GRILLED BRIOCHE, HAMACHI, PROSCUITTO, &amp; QUAIL EGG; . (my date):  HOUSE MADE RICOTTA RAVIOLI, ENGLISH PEAS, BROWN BUTTER, CANDIED GRAPEFRUIT RIND &amp; MINT.  . . Third Course . (mine):  PAN ROASTED BLACK BASS, APPLE CELERAIC PUREE, BUTTERED MUSTARD GREENS, &amp; MUDDLED CITRUS VINAIGRETTE;. (my date):  FRISEE &amp; SMOKED TROUT SALAD, APPLE, AVOCADO, WARM FINGERLING POTATOES IN GRAINY MUSTARD BUTTER.. . Fourth Course. (mine):  OLIVE OIL POACHED HALIBUT, HERBED ASPARAGUS, HEDGEHOG MUSHROOMS, &amp; PICKLED RAMP VINAIGRETTE;. (my date):  DATE &amp; MINT CRUSTED COLORADO RACK OF LAMB, POTATO CHIVE PUREE, SAUTE OF HEIRLOOM CARROT, TURNIP &amp; FRESH CHICKPEAS.. . Fifth Course. (mine):  PAN ROASTED HANGER STEAK &amp; PUFFED MILLET DUSTED SHORT RIBS, SPRING ONION CONFIT, &amp; SMOKED POTATO PUREE;. (my date):  BUTTERMILK STEAMED CHICKEN BREAST, CREAMED FARO, FAVA BEANS, WHITE ASPARAGUS, &amp; MOREL MUSHROOMS.. . Sixth Course. (mine):  BAKED LEMON CUSTARD TARTLET, BLUEBERRY COMPOTE, GINGER ICE CREAM, &amp; MERINGUE CHIP;. (my date):  CHOCOLATE &amp; PEANUT BUTTER TRUFFLE CAKE, SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM, &amp; ROASTED PEANUT TOFFEE.. . Seventh Course. (mine):  ROASTED WALNUT PRALINE TART, CHOCOLATE SHORTBREAD CRUST, &amp; ESPRESSO ICE CREAM;. (my date):  SUGAR &amp; SPICE DUSTED BEIGNETS, VENEZUELAN CHOCOLATE FONDUE.. . Fyi, my date and I exchanged plates every course.  So we both had a total of 14 courses.  Choke not, the dishes are small and are manageable portions...they are more like bite-size pieces.. . My date and I wrapped up the last course with a DOPPIO ESPRESSO and languidly chatted about the goodness of our meal...how each dish wonderfully accommodate the interplay of each ingredient; tasting each and every spice, the texture of every meat, the freshness of every single produce, culminating into a perfect masterpiece!
