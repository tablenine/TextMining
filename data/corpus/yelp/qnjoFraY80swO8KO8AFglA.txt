Yes, you'll have to wait depending on the night of the week and don't even consider going in a party larger than four.  You might be unnecessarily subjected to your neighbor's conversations.  That said, the pho ga (chicken pho) is worth it.  I do my research in Central Vietnam and inevitably spend plenty of time in transit and eating in Saigon.  My favorite street and alleyway pho joints *NEVER* carry pho ga (Pho 24 has the best pho ga I've tasted in Vietnam) so it's a treat to enjoy it back in the US.  Pho Cafe has the broth down -- perfectly salted, the right amount of oil, and a delicious nuoc mam and ginger sauce to throw in.  The chicken is also free range and super flavorful.  The accompaniments are always fresh -- crispy bean sprouts, sawtooth (on one occasion but not my most recent visit), Thai basil, and juicy lime.  I love it!  I always wash it down with their homemade lemonade which carries a slight saltiness reminiscent of fermented lemon juice that I usually enjoy in Vietnam.  I also want to throw in some praise for the banh xeo which is hot, greasy, and delicious though a little slim on the shrimp!  As for the pho tai -- I've *definitely* heard mixed reviews of the beef pho broth at Pho Cafe but I'm okay with it!  If I'm in the neighborhood, it's nearing 10pm, and I'm craving pho, the pho tai is tasty enough though not my favorite place for beef pho.  As one more added bonus, they carry some of my favorite Southeast Asian beers!
