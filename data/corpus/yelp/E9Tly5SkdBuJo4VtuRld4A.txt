Oh how I love Porto's... let me count the ways.  I love the way your cheese rolls softly flake onto my plate as the sweet goo oozes onto my fingers.  I love that when I split open your potato balls, steam filters out to reveal your meaty goodness perfectly surrounded by a thick potato filling. I love the way your fruit tart is filled with the most beautiful, fresh fruit that's just perfectly sweet.  And sometimes right after payment, nothing can beat your warm, perfectly spiced chicken empanadas.  What I love about you the most is how all of these benefits comes for such a great value. Ahh how I love thee.
