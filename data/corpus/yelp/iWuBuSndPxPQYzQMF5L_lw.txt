This place was wonderful and we will have fond memories, it is every bit worth the price to get in, and the food exceeded my expectations.  I had the Scottish Salmon, it was cooked to perfection and the portion was generous.  The magicians were friendly and supportive of each other.  They go out of their way to enlighten the guests.  I cannot wait to come back!
