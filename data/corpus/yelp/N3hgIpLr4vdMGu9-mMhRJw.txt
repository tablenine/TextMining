It must be love.. . I discovered this place years ago; I liked it then and I still like it now. Hands down one of the best Thai experiences you can have in the city. The food is very good, sizes are generous, and it's cheap! I wonder how they can stay in business but, hey! I'm not complaining!. . The restaurant has exposed bricks and large pictures, and a full view on the open kitchen, which is something I always like in a restaurant. The main dining area can get noisy, but if you can score a table in the outdoor area, you will have a much quieter atmosphere, perfect for a summer date.. . The last time I came here I had the spicy squid salad, which was very refreshing and really delicious! My only complain is that it wasn't much spicy at all, but I like my food rather spicy. The spicy noodles (sauteed fresh flat noodles, with mixed vegetables and egg in a chili basil sauce) were also a winner. Finally, VH (god bless her) convinced me to try the mango with sticky rice as dessert, which was fantastic! The mango was delicious, but the rice was amazing: I loved the combination of sweet and slightly salted flavors.. . Overall for a shared salad, two entrees, and a dessert, our check came to less than $30. That's amazing value for the kind of food you get.. . I also like to come here just for for drinks at the bar: a modern design that doesn't feel cold, tall glass vases with nice plant arrangements, and $8 pint-size mean mojitos.. . So, yes, Joya: you get 5 well deserved stars!
