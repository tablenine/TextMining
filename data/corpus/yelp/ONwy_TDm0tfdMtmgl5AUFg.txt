Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I followed Yelp reviews and visited this Korean BBQ Restaurant. For a family party, we ordered the combo A on the menu. It comes with all kinds of meat. . . As with traditional Korean food, there are many different little side dishes that come out first. The sides at Soowon Galbi is not that impressive. The Kim chi was bland. I prefer buying them at the Korean market. The broccoli was tasteless. However I do savor the avocado salad and bean sprouts. There are better sides at other Korean places (I'll mention those restaurants in my future reviews). If you come for the meat, here is the right place to eat.. . All the meat comes with a big tray and what we ordered includes beef briskets, short ribs, pork bellies, pork necks, two different kinds of rib eyes and that's all I can remember. Marbled rib eye was the most juicy and tender piece of meat overall. You barely even have to chew. It disintegrates in your mouth. Dipping in the sauce, adding a piece of garlic, combining with rice and WALA, a complete traditional Korean experience. . . Ending with their own refreshing dessert, a acorn seeded sweet tea that helps you digest what you have consumed and now you are ready again for another round!!
