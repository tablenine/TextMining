Restaurant: 123 Burger Shot Beer
Category: Burgers
I'm not entirely sure how this was possible, but after 8 beers and 16 multi-colored shots, I was completely sober - though very uncomfortable. Now, I'm betting those shots were basically sugar water and food coloring, but it was still rather surprising come 2am when I should have been dancing alongside the chubby ladies at the booth next to us to Beyonce that I wasn't. Instead I was thinking far too much about the fact that my jeans were not sweatpants and the burning Q of the night: was this really where all the ugly people went on Saturday night (Sorry, I went there. Pickings were pretty dismal). . Anyhoo, for $3 beers from a great selection, $2 shots with some crazy-ass names (Panty Raid, Do Me Again, etc) and the creme de la creme, $1 sliders, it wasn't all bad. The sliders are definitely what you should come for: warm little morsels cooked to perfection with a spot of cheese and pickles on a buttery bun. We ordered 40. Seriously. We also ordered the buffalo wings, waffle fries and sweet potato fries (and I'm starting to see why I wasn't drunk...). . It was a fun night for novelty sake, but given the location (no-man's land), the clientele (let's just say that there is a sign reminding people that the wall is NOT a toilet), the spotty service (among other things, after putting in our massive food order, our waitress came back 15 minutes later and asked with a blank look if we wanted anything to eat... Uh, yeah, we do) and finally, the fact that I was not on a table pretending I was Shakira by the end of the night, I think I'll give it a pass next time around. Though I bet Ladies Night would be a hoot.
