There are so many reviews that I can't add that much value here.  I am not a huge fan of their ribs, as I've certainly had better in many places.  Go for the history, the good service, the location, and the experience.  I recommend visiting during a busy meal time, as it's been my experience that the ribs are fresher and hotter when they're busy than when the place is slow.
