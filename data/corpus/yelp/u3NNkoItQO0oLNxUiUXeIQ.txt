Hey, I like this place and its potential.  I'll start with four stars and if subsequent visits are consistently as good, upgrade to five.  Situated in one of the recent upscale developments in Smyrna/Vinings (near South City Kitchen Vinings), beware that many maps get the address wrong.  . . The menu has lots of variety and an upscale/gourmet twist.  This is a sophisticated sandwich and salad shop, like if Whole Foods entered the deli segment.  M&amp;T's philosophy is "foie gras in your flip flops', and the no pretense atmosphere is comfortable.  I had the fried tilapia sandwich and the pickled tomato, one of their four varieties of picked goodies.  Everything was quite solid and cost $9.25.  The fish was fresh and the house-made remoulade, baby arugula and red onions were tasty compliments.. . My top takeaway is that this is a solid casual business lunch spot for the OTP crowd.  Private parking, accessible location, indoor seating, and outdoor seating.  Prices seemed reasonable to me (it's not cheap to run a business focused on quality local ingredients). . . My next stop here will probably be for one of their special events.  They have Thursday night beer tastings and Sunday night local live music/ artisan/dining spotlights.  It will also be interest to see what this team comes up with for their new concept going into the former Joel Brasserie location (on Northside Drive).
