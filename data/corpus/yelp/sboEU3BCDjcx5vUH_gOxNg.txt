Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
Gloria's is my favorite "hole in the wall" of all times. =D I'm the kind of person who sticks to what she likes. If it's not broke, why fix it? So everytime I go to Gloria's, I order the same thing - Carne adobada. YUM! The food at Gloria's is so tasty - everything from the chips and salsa, to the rice and tortillas, and of course, their carde adobada. Their sangria is also very yummy. The staff is very friendly and Gloria herself or her son (?) will often stop by your table to make sure that you're enjoying your meal. My only complaint is the location and crappy parking lot, but the food definitely makes it worth it.
