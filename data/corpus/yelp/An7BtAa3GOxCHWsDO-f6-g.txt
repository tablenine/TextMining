My, My, My!  I love tapas and was extremely happy with the red sangria they served.  It didn't have too much ice and had the right amount of sweetness and alcohol that satisfied my thirst.. . I also had a hard time deciding what plates to get since I was torn between the patatas bravas (potatoes with spicy aioli), tortilla espanola (potato, egg and onion omelet), or embutidos ibericos: jamon, chorizo palacios, and lomo embuchado (assorted Spanish meats).. . I ended taking the meat plate along with the plate of cheese and the pan tomacat.  The pan tomacat was definitely salty but it reminded me of the same dish my Spanish friend made five years ago.. . Our hostess was especially gracious despite the heavy volume of people but luckily we came in at 7pm and our wait was ONLY 45 minutes.  Around the time that we left (9:30ish) the wait had turned into  . 1.5 hours.  . . It's an intimate space with exposed bricks and low lights.  It definitely became louder as dinner wore on and my friend and I were shouting at each other during our conversation.. . However, it's worth coming back for this little slice of paradise and it doesn't hurt there's some eye candy to keep you entertained as you wait.. . Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.  Our service was excellent, food came out right away, and the sangria was DELICIOUS!
