Fresh Ricotta &amp; Egg Raviolo with browned butter  &amp; Crisp Duck al Mattone with pear mostarda &amp; Brussels sprouts are awesome.. . the duck is so moist.... never ever thought duck would taste sooo delicious.. the raviolo is very fun to eat bc u get to play with your food!! u can mix the egg in the browned butter with your raviolo.  the combination is delicious!!
