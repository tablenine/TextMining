I laugh every time someone says Zocalo has "the best margaritas."  Um, maybe if you liked rancid Country Time lemonade powder mix?  . . Margaritas aside, the food is actually okay (skip the Sunday brunch, though).  My favorite dish there is the mocajete carmalita.  It's beef, cactus, tomatillos, and peppers in a zesty sauce served in a sizzing lava rock bowl.  The beef was really tender, and I loved the peppers and cactus with the tangy taste of the tomatilloes.  Their enchilada verdes are good, as well.. . Stick with the beer and get either of those entrees.  Parking is valet, and this place is packed on weekends and at happy hour.
