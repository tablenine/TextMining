Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
There were about 10,000 cars in between me and Pizzeria Mozza when I got off of work last Wednesday - the 101 was the usual pre-rush hour parking lot at 4 pm, but that wasn't going to stop me from getting another taste of the best pizza I've had outside of Italy for dinner with friend M, who braved equally horrendous traffic to join me from Pasadena.. . We were late so we lost our reservation but there was plenty of bar space since we were there relatively early (5:30).  I have to say the man who works behind the bar has been there both times I've gone to Mozza and he clearly loves his job.  M and I had the squash blossom and burrata and margarhita pizzas.  Both are superb, but I might just like the margarhita pizza better.  The crust as per reputation is delicate and the sauce is spot on.  The burrata pizza is a hefty $28 and it's about the size of a small Pizza Hut pizza.  Is it worth the difference in price?  To me, absolutely.  There is clearly a lot of skill involved in putting that pizza together - everything from managing the supply chain to keep fresh burrata on hand (that stuff goes bad if you just look at it funny - probably as perishable as good sushi fish) to spinning out consistently amazing dough every single time.  . . We had room for a huge strawberry gelato pie and caramel ice cream sundae with salted peanuts on top.  The gelato pie was our server's recommendation, and I liked it better than the buttersotch budino that is currently the Yelp highlights algorithm's darling.  . . The men's bathroom was inexplicably out of order, so sorry ladies, I had to use yours.  But I did remember to put the lid down so you wouldn't fall in :)
