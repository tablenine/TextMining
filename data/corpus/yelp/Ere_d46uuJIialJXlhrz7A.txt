Restaurant: Two Urban Licks
Category: Bars
Forty foot high ceilings don't instantly make a restaurant cool....frequently it just serves to make you feel small and drown you in the echoes of everyone's conversations. Two Urban Licks tries very, very hard to deliver a unique dining experience, but fell short with me. The food was just like the space...big and colorful, lots of style but little substance.. . I gave the lamb lollipops a try, and my first impression of them was great. But as I kept eating them I kept shaking my head, there was an odd, distinctively non-lamb taste going on that I couldn't ignore. They tasted like lamb mixed with hot dogs...I enjoyed it less the more I had.. . The baked mac and cheese with the pork shoulder was great. I could have eaten that for my entire meal and probably would have enjoyed it more. The pork shoulder that came with it was huge, too much for me in fact. About halfway through it I was losing interest.. . Dessert turned out to be the best part of our meal. We had a white chocolate cheesecake slice with blackberries and a uber tart sorbet on the side. So at least the food ended on a positive note.. . I'll probably give Two Urban Licks another try in the Spring when the weather's nice and they can open up the seating that looks out over the skyline.
