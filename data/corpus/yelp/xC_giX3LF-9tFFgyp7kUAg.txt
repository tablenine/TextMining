Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I came here 4 days after groupon sold their half price coupons (sunday evening).  The place was jam packed, so I can understand if service is a little slow.. . Ordered green tea.  When I go to a Japanese restaurant and order green tea, I expect something better than liptons.  I got a rusted little metal pot and (possibly due to all the rust inside) the water tasted like the pot was taken out of the dishwasher halfway through.. . Prices are insane. Way overpriced.  . . Sushi: I did like it, but it wasn't worth nearly what it cost.  The sushi gets a C+ or maybe a B- if I'm being generous.. . took 40 mins for 3 rolls of sushi to arrive at our table.. . Cafe Sushi on wells is going to continue to be my Sushi place - mmmm Honeybee Maki.
