This review is applicable to their deli only.. . WOWSERS.  Bari's deli represents what an authentic Italian deli should be: a simple menu, fresh ingredients, crusty bread, white paper wrap, and fast service.  I got the proscuitto with mozzarella sub (9" for only $5.75) and it was incredible... as if I was suddenly teleported to my favorite mom-and-pop Italian deli in Brooklyn, NYC.  . . It is located in the back of an Italian grocery store, which means no seating.  But, hey, just grab a slamming sub and go somewhere conducive to savoring each bite.  No fussin' allowed here.
