I don't give five-star reviews often, but I think this place warrants it.. . First of all the decor was nice and understated, with a nice buddha statuary montage in the entry way, and wood everywhere. Kinda reminded me more of a Japanese noodle house, not a Chinese place.. . The food: Had the crab rangoon, which was excellent, but not life-changing as everyone says. The curry tofu tofu, however, was excellent. It might be the best tofu I've ever had...they even put yuba in it! It was obvious that if they didn't make the tofu themselves, it was not the store bought stuff. The sauce was kind of a hot/sour curry sauce. My wife had the noodle salad with peanut dressing, which had perfectly cooked noodles, and great consistentcy. Plus the waitstaff was nice, and the owner checked in on us. Â Also: Free tea, and a nicely dressed plate of fortune cookies and a small brownie (also free). All this for under $25.. . If you live in Logan Sq/Avondale: You have no excuse not to patronize this place. All other NW side: Make the drive. Southside: Well, Chinatown might be better.
