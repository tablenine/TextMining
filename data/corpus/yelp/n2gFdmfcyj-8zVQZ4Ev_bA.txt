The service can get SO BAD. Â I was seated outdoors and my friend had time to move the car from across the street from Daikokuya and into the parking garage under Weller Court and the server STILL hadn't come back to take our order. I timed it. It took TWENTY MINUTES until someone came to take our order, and only because the couple sitting next to me was as irritated as I was &amp; had yelled out for someone to take our order.. And then, we didn't have any eating utensils. Rather than wait for someone to come by (which could've possibly taken another 20 mins) I ran over to nearest waiter and asked him for chopsticks. . Food came... I had a #5 miso ramen w/ green onions, bamboo shoots and corn. Although it was miso ramen, it tasted like it had WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much GARLIC. But not even fresh garlic, it tasted like the minced garlic you get in a big plastic jar from Costco.
