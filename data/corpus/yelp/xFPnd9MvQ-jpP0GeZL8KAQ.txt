Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
After moving to the Wicker Park neighborhood about a year ago, I was in search of many neighborhood staples one likes to establish after moving - sushi restaurant, Mexican restaurant, Thai restaurant, a burger joint etc.  Being a huge fan of anything BBQ, I was very excited that Smoke Daddy was only a couple of blocks away. After walking my dog by the delicious smell day after day (which would often cause an unconscious Pavlovian response by both me, and my dog) - I decided it was time to give it a try.  . . The food was absolutely phenomenal - we started out with Pulled Pork Nachos (drooling once again just thinking about them), then split the Baby Back Ribs and some mac &amp; cheese.  The pulled pork in the nachos was extremely smoky tasting (which I love) and the ribs were perfect.  Not to mention I loved having the option of many different sauce varieties (I'm the person that orders BBQ sauce as a salad dressing in restaurants, and slathers it on more food groups than most humans I'm sure).  Finally - the mac &amp; cheese topped it all of nicely...creamy deliciousness.  . . As for the service - our waitress was polite and friendly...and we ended up having a casual conversation with the manager about the neighborhood.  While I know Chicago has a selection of really great BBQ places and people tend to have varying tastes as far as how they prefer it to be prepared - I would feel comfortable recommending Smoke Daddy to any BBQ connoisseur.
