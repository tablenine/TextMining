Yes the view is amazing, and yes, you're probably going to get some if you take your gf there for a super romantic candle light dinner. But man, their food is absolutely horrible.  Their fish does not taste fresh at all, and the only decent dish I had was their stead appetizer but it was warm at best.  Go there once for the romantic view and don't ever go back again
