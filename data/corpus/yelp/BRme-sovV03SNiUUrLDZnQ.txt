2 stars because this place is totally cheezy, but I have to admit I had a 5 star night on Friday, so we'll go with 3.  Goes to show that it doesn't matter where you are, if you're with the right people, you'll have a blast.  . . On to the review...  my 3 girls and I ended up here because we had dinner at Element and wanted to go out within walking distance.  We refused to pay a cover at Cosmo-Lava (we're too old for that), so the Taco it was.  After standing in line and watching what appeared to be a bachelorette party of 45 year olds get pushed to the front of the line right out of their white hummer limo (no, really), I got inside only to think, oh god, where am I and how did I get to this awful place.  The people downstairs clearly go there A LOT and it is a total meat market.  Some guy slammed into my friend, spilling a drink on her, and when I gave him a dirty look his response was to tweak my chin.  Yes, he actually touched my face!!!  Fortunately, my friend handed me a shot  to keep my hands busy before I had the chance to punch the guy.  . . Being on the verge of leaving, we decided to check out upstairs, which to my delight was not nearly as crowded and had a table available so we could sit down.  I guess upstairs is karaoke night on Fridays (every night?) and it was hilarious to listen to people sing.  Also, the background music is loud enough that you can drunkenly enjoy the Billy Joel and Def Leopard without even realizing that people are singing into microphones up there.  I get the idea that upstairs is where the dorks hang out or something, but I enjoyed it much more so than downstairs.. . So, go, but only with a group of girlfriends for a silly night of shots and late night dancing.  I guess the same would go for guys???
