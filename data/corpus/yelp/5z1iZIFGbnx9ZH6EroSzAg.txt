I've been coming here ever since I can remember.  I love their empanadas, the little fried potato balls stuffed with spiced groud beef, and their pastries...more specifically, their fruit tarts!. . I cannot believe they are still cheap too.  Get in early on the weekends, or be prepared to take a number and stand around for a while.
