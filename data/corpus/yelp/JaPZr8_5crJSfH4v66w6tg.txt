Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
This is the second time that I've been to a Boiling Crab restaurant. I'm kind of over it already. The taste is blah the more I ate it. This time we ordered 3 lbs. of shrimp, crawfish, one dungess crab, 36 pieces of sausage, cajun fries, and potatoes. I would have preferred eating all of the seafood without any seasoning, just steamed or boiled nice and fresh than eat here again.... . Not worth the long wait for me....
