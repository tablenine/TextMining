This place has a really good menu with interesting choices.  They also give you different kinds of bread with puree sweet potato instead of butter.  That said, the scallion pancakes WERE bland.  Needed way more soy sauce or even scallions.  On the otherhand, the sizziling soy cutlet platter WAS sizzling and full of flavor.  The sesame soy protein was also tasty and like a healthier version of sweet and sour chicken.. Drinks (sake mojito and lychee sake martini) were nice and fresh but not very strong for $9.  The dessert was a little too much, $7 for 3 scoops of ice cream over a thin peice of gingerbread with fruit sauce, but it wasn't bad.  Overall, not a cheap place but I'd come back for the large menu to try other things.
