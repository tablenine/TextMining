i havent been here in a long ass time, actually probably 6 valentine's days ago... it was definitely a pain to get up the daym hill but the drive was worth the view. it was wonderful! they have a small pathway in front of the entrance/past the valet where you can just look out towards LA.... it looks sooo much better at night. the thick ass smog coating is masked in the dark Â =).... yes it is a good date place, but i went with a bunch of people to and it was a good atmosphere for groups as well. . the menu was set for the occasion and it was good, although i cant remember exatly what it was... what i know for a fact is that the dessert was HELLA GOOD, that the people who were too full for dessert passed it over to me!!! YAY!!! hahaha... it was a cheesecake with berries and some sort of thin waffle thing.... OMG it was good... =)
