Solid, reliable, NY Style Pizza.. Big floppy slices that won't let you down.. If you're down for some grease (which I totally am) then this is your place.. . If you're not alone, or training for an eating championship, then you can get a 20" monster of gooey cheesy heaven, But the box is so big that you might knock over a gaggle of hipsters' bikes parked out front. Â Be graceful with your pie.
