Dear God! Are those my teeth or is it my tongue? It's all numb!  I've eaten most of a bhindi masala (an okra dish), and even a yogurt from my refrigerator and a mug of milk hasn't entirely cooled my mouth.  (My cat is demurely dipping her paw into the milk and licking it off, then repeating it.). . I've got to say, though, if you've got the kishkes to handle genuinely spicy fare, Zyka is a damn good place to get it.  It's not just spicy, it's flavorful too.  And did anyone mention cheap?  Hell yes!
