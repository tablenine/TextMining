The best pub/bar in town with the best burger I've ever had.  The sweet potato fries and regular fries are simply amazing with the sauce the serve.  Beware, they do not serve ketchup so don't ask for any because they will give you dirty looks!. . A great place to chill with friends over drinks and food and the best part is that people can show up whenever because you grab the table as they are available.  No one is inclined to order because you order at the bar.  Great for weeknights and weekends.  . . I drive 20 miles across town to meet up with friends here and stay until closing.  I've even become friends with one of the bartenders who make great recommendations for beer.  Not a fan of beer so I stick the wine and/or Cider.  . . FYI burger is $12 and fries are $7.  Kinda pricey but well worth is especially if in good company (and great music).  Nice bathrooms too!. . Note:  This location is WAY BETTER than the Santa Monica location.  You actually have room to breath!  Yea, that good!
