Okay, so this place certainly does not need another vote, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE Alcove, so I wanted it to be my first review.. . I lived literally around the corner from this place for a summer, and I'd say I ate there on average once a week.  Even though I live further west now, I still try to make it out to Los Feliz as often as I can...mostly to eat here.  I'll admit, I'm a total sucker for the brick patio, cozy tables, and string lights.  And, of course, the FOOD!. . I've never had something here that I didn't like.  For brunch, the breakfast quesadilla is my absolute favorite.  I will never get over how much yummy avocado they include...plus fresh blackberries on the side...amazing.  All of the breakfast panini and espresso drinks are also fantastic.  Don't overlook this place for lunch/dinner, either!  I'm a big fan of their gourmet burgers, and as an added bonus you won't have to deal with that slightly claustrophobic feeling you can get during brunch here.. . Anyway, despite the sometimes insane lines (which move fast, all things considered!), I don't think there is anywhere in L.A. I'd rather spend a sunny weekend morning than chowing down at Alcove.  MMMM.
