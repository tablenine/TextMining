Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie

I use to wonder why people were waiting to get in to this little place with the neon sign, well now I know Why!  The pizza is yummy  thin crust and cooked just like New York pizza.  You can have your original pizza or ask for something special like the white pizza with pesto, sausage and garlic.  This was featured in Sunset magazine.  I would give it more stars but the parking is tough!
