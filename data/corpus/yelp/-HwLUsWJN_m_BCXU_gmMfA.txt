Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
It's part of my LA manifesto to come to Tito's each time I visit LA.  1 or 2 taco's with cheese and I share a bean and cheese burrito with my hubby every single time.  Don't get the guacamole - it's all blenderized.  But the salsa is yummy with the tacos and the burrito.  So good!
