Restaurant: 90 Miles Cuban Caf√©
Category: Cuban
So authentic, so delicious, so tantalizing and what an atmosphere - if I just close my eyes and hear the cars puttering by, I think I'm right in the heart of Havana. Next time you're thinking about heading down to the same ol' burrito place, STOP, and go Cuban instead. You won't be disappointed!. . Viva 90 Miles!
