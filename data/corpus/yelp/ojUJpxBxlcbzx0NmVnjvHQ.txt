My friend and I bought the blueberry velvet cake, red velvet cupcake, and blueberry crumble ice cream (yes, all just for the 2 of us), and had a dessert binge moment.. All of them were FANTASTIC!. the blueberry velvet cake was similar to the red velvet cupcake, except the red velvet was much much sweeter. but i didnt' care that the tastes were similar b/c they were certainly satisfying my craving for sweets.. and the blueberry ice cream wasn't as sweet, but still very good. i loved the pieces of blueberry and crumbled bread/cake/whatever it was inside the ice cream.. . overall, it's one of the best dessert places i've tried/binged at.. definitely going back there to try their macaron icecreams.
