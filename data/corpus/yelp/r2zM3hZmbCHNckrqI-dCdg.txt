Don't wait longer than 20 mins for this...just go to alibi room in culver city for it and you can have a beer while you wait.  And the korean breakfast burrito there is AMAZING.. . Anyway, the truck tacos are delicious, even though they're a bit over-sesame-oiled.. . Also, stay away from that kimchee quesadilla...that combo just doesn't work...I mean, imagine.  Cheese, gooey hot delicious cheese... plus spicy pickled cabbage?  . . But the truck, if it's by you, is def worth a try.
