Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
My friend raved about this place and insisted we go on Friday night. I was pretty turned off by the fact that they don't take reservations. Once we got there we had no choice but to valet for $7. Sure enough, once inside we were quoted a wait of 45 minutes. Of course we were going to stay because we already paid for parking. Sketchy...Half of the restaurant is like a waiting room so I'd imagine that there's always a long wait. Ultimately, my question is "Why?" The food was alright, but Julio's seems to always be looking for profit. For example, when my husband ordered fajitas he was asked if he'd like sour cream and cheese. Well, of course he would! Turns out it's an extra $2 for each condiment. Upsell, anyone? All in all, nothing about Julio's knocked my socks off. Though I do appreciate the sopaipillas. There are surely many better Mexican places that won't cost you an arm and a leg...and they just might have sopaipillas too.
