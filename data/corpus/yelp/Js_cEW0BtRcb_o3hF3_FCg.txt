Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
holy crap this place is good!  i'm giving it a 5, because they go above and beyond with the banchan.  . . normally when you go to a korean restaurant there's a limited panchan that they bring out.  however, being versed in the Korean language, i blinked my big, green, american eyes at our ajumah and asked her in my most honorific tones if she would be so kind as to help us cut our meat because we were just lost.... little..... Americans...... . she teared up a bit and was so charmed we got EXTRA banchan. raw crab and the special 6 months fermented kimchee!!!!. . this kimchee is different than the one they bring out normally.  the standard one is fresh and crispy, this one has been fermenting a long ass time and it's better for cooking on the grill along with your meat because it carmelizes as it roasts.  tasty stuff.....(you have to ask for it by name).. . our demur little ajumah brought out the wrong meat dish, we ordered the sam gyup sal (unsalted pork) and the dwegi bulgogi (spicy pork).  she brought out chicken instead, but we really didn't give a shit because it was so spankalicious good.  . . ok, back to the banchan (side dishes).   this is what you really want to pay attention to when you order korean.... this stuff was not the cheap-o stuff you get in a lot of joints.  the o-daeng (fish cake) was seasoned so nice, not overly sweet.  the oi (cucumber) kimchee not too crispy, but still a little bite to it.  and the crab?  oh my god, heavenly.  i rarely eat raw crab anymore, but this was ambrosia.  the claws hurt your mouth a little when you bite into them and suck but the more aggressive you are the less it hurts.
