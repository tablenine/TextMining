Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
I figured that Ian's Pizza was just another generic pizza place, churning out boring pizza by the slice to legions of drunk Cubs fans.. . Then one of my friends told me about their Mac N Cheese Pizza.. . Holy. Crap.. . The restaurant was just as I had imagined - annoying music not completely drowning out annoying customers. But the menu was not as standard. Along with the Mac &amp; Cheese pizza were a number of very unique pizzas - I'd like to try them all sometime. However, after the first slice of Mac &amp; Cheese there was only one slice that I was interested in having - another slice of Mac &amp; Cheese.. . And I can even avoid the nose bleed inducing atmosphere (although the staff were great) because they deliver by the slice - and have gloriously late hours.
