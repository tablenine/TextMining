AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's all that needs to be said.  This place. outshines any other Mediterranean restaurant I've ever visited: the. food is incredible, the service is excellent and the value is. unbeatable.   Atlanta is lucky to host such a rare find!. . Adding to the mix is the owner, Al. His hospitality rivals what is. found in much higher-end restaurants and he knows how to personalize a meal to fit the diner and the occasion.  The service is excellent and. he's as warm a big 'ole, cast-iron skillet.  You will feel like you've. dined with him many times after the first.
