Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I'm not the biggest pastrami patron in the world, but this place has some other tasty dishes, as well as a little bowl of pickles. That is the best way to win my heart... just leave me a bowl of pickles.. . Best part, it's open late! Hooray.
