Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
holy moly. HOLY MOLY. I love this place. The decor, the food (oh, the food), the waiters...oh, and the FOOD. I definitely want to go here again. It's too damn good to not go again.. . Came here on a date and the place was just too. cute. We sat in those 2 seaters in this insanely awesome tent looking thing. Okay, so my descriptions aren't doing it much justice, but you should know what I'm talking about when you see it, hah. There were candles placed on the tables and the lights were dimmed. I felt like we were put in a section of the restaurant especially reserved for dates. It was really an ideal place to go. The food was good--mind you, called Stinking Rose for a reason--and oh so garlic-y.. . We tried the garlic fries and I had the garlic chicken and it was exactly how I expected it. While these were tasty dishes, my boyfriend, being the curious one, felt the urge to try the garlic ice cream.. . ....yeah. Don't do it. Seriously. You're going to think about doing it, and then you see it and you MAY BE satisfied with your pick and then you spoon it into your mouth and...yep. Garlic ice cream for you.. . Very enchanting place, though. But I'd skip on the garlic ice cream...no matter how appetizing it may seem!
