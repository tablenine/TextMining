Category: Italian
Must trys: pancetta wrapped figs, special burrata cheese flown in from Italy, pancetta wrapped quail. . those were amazing but i was unimpressed by the pasta.  I got the calf's brain ravioli, the sausage orichette (sp?) and the gnocci with duck ragu.  The duck ragu gnocci was the best out of the three.  I might recommend just getting lots of appetizers and sharing them cause those definitely outshined the pastas!. . service was good.  the servers were oddly serious though even though the restaurant is not that serious.  their sommelier was also very knowledgeable and able to point us in the right direction.
