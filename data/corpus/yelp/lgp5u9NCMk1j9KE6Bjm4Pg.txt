Whoooa 727 reviews!! Â I love roscoes!! Service sucks but who cares just bring me my fried chicken and waffles so I can be happy!! My fav is the 1/2 chicken with 2 waffles. As if that was not artery clogging enough they give you some extra butter and syrup which I scrape off and put to the side. Still amazing no if ands or buts. Their corn bread is the best I have ever had I want to sing to it! Soul food at its best!! If you have not been here pleease go. Save yourself the headache and bring cash because they do not seperate checks PERIOD.
