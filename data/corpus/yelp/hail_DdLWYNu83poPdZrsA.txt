Double Dipped Beef with Swiss!  Speak those 5 words to the lady at the counter and soon you will be in samwich heaven.  Now some of the counter ladies have been there, well, since the 70's, maybe even the 60's, but they know how to deliver!  Like someone else said, everyone has their favorite and that is mine.  Plus I like the mac salad, and I've just discovered the chili (with cheese &amp; onions).  Wash it all down with a cold beer and life is good!. . I like Philippe's before a Dodger game, just go early 'cause it can get crowded.  And be sure to really look at the lines, and just don't get in the first one by the door.  There's a science to it!
