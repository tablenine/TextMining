Restaurant: Uncle Bill&#39;s Pancake House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I came here a few times with some co-workers and I really liked the breakfast wrap.  I also had the chocolate chip pancakes here and they were decent. Personally I like Original Pancake House a lot better.  But this place is not bad..I would go back...
