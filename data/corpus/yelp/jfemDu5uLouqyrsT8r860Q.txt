I think I'm done with F.O. Yeah, the beer selection is good but the expensive price tag and no-photo policy has become old. I was there with a friend and our bill at the end of the night for 2 burgers, fries and numerous beers= $175....ouch. Yeah, burger nazi+overpriced beers+no photo because we're so original and don't want to be copied is just f*cking gay.
