Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
this place is alright, but too small and cramped and they really rush you out of there because there is a long line.  The french toast orgy is really rich but delicious if you split it with someone else.  I just think that it is not a comfortable atmosphere so you lose something with that.
