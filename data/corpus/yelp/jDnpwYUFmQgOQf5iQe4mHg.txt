Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
Alright, I don't want to poo poo on everyone's parade here, but I did give this restaurant a fair ass shake - I went twice just to make sure I wasn't delusional the first time when I thought "  this restaurant is fair.". . Overall, food is hit or miss (not a horrible miss by a long shot, but not orgasmic food).  Today's Pureed Mushroom soup was decent, but lacked the mushroomy oomph, and the Eggs Benedict was solid, but nothing especially amazing.  Last visit, I had one of the egg/grit/mustard green bakes and although creative, wasn't that tasty.  I think what's difficult about this restaurant is value - after a meal there, you just want to have...well, a meal.  Today I spent nearly $25 on breakfast, and didn't feel like the portions were worth it.  . . However, there are a few things Square One does fantastic - their salads and their fancy fruit plate with fruit certainly from the morning's farmer's market.
