Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
This is the first place I ever had Shabu Shabu, so it holds an extra-special place in my otherwise cold heart. Â I'd imagine that for many LA natives (weird concept, I know), the same can probably be said, which I'm guessing would explain it's popularity. Granted, they do a solid job with some tasty, well-marbled beef and a good amount of vegetables, and as such, the place is a decent on the value scale. However, the wait is ridiculous and as such, you are hurried in and hurried out by the grumpy old man that runs the joint. He is affectionately referred to as "Old Man Shabs" by members of my family, but *wags finger side-to-side* I Am Not Having It.
