Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I give it a five star for letting people choose how they like their Ramen, everything from soup base, firmness of noodle to toppings control. (I am a big fan of all ShinSenGumi.) When it comes to Ramen, that's what its all about. I like firm noodles, and they make it just right. I like weaker soup base, they can make that. If you want great services, they have it, too! Some restaurant is good when it feels a little cramped, it feels cozy yet energetic, which makes the food more enjoyable for me.
