Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I love this ramen house!  it reminds me of the ramen i had when I was in Japan.  I like that you have a choice of base strength, amount of oil, and texture of noodles that goes into your soup.  The side dishes are also really good, such as the gyoza, spam masubi (lunch only), and the asparagus, corn and bacon sauteed in butter. There is a wait during peak hours at dinner time, but it goes by quickly.  And the staff are super nice.
