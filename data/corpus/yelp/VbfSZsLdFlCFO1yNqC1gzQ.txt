Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
Here's the agenda: Get an invite.  Plan on having a 3-out-of-5-stars meal.  Make sure you get to see all 3 shows.  Find a pin-wearing member for a little close-up magic after the shows or maybe even a private tour of the building.  There are amazing things to see, but many of them require a little inside knowledge for full appreciation.  Don't miss the WC Fields pool table or the Tiffany dome in the seance room!  Before you let your new friend/tour guide/magician member go, ask for his/her email for future Magic Castle visits!. . Valet is $6, it's $25 for entry, and dinner will run you from about $15 to $30.  Also worth mentioning, it's 21+ (except for Sunday brunch).
