Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
This is cheap, quick Thai at its finest. Nothing great, nothing bad. My favorite dishes are the Spicy Basil, Hot Pepper Noodle, and the Thai Fried Rice. Almost never eat in, but service is good when I do. Prefer this to Cozy Noodle, although Cozy has more variety.. . The prices are on par or cheaper than most other Thai places. It's also byob so it would make for an affordable dinner before heading out to the bars.
