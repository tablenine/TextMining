Decent tacos, good value (3 for $10 or 2 + rice and beans for $10), chill patio atmosphere, service is decidedly laid back.  First time I came, I wasn't as impressed with the service- second time, much better.  As for the tacos, I would get 3 of them and skip the tasteless rice and beans...I liked the cornmeal tilapia but there are many other options that you can mix and match, from chicken to beef to vegetarian.  It also comes with a generous supply of homemade tortilla chips and soupy salsa with a slight kick.  I had a frozen fruity margarita at the bar on the open back patio- a nice treat on a Friday evening!
