I was pleasantly surprised by how great this place was! Everything from the unpretentious front desk to our server and of course the food/menu. . . We had the tuna tartar and the smoked salmon spring rolls to start. Nothing extraordinary but just good. You get 4 halves of pretty big/fat spring rolls so you can definitely share that.. . For entree', we had the fennel seed crusted tuna and the chopped salad with cubes of chicken and a variety of crunchy veggies in a honey-jalapeno vinaigrette. The tuna was excellent, just seared on the outside and on a bed of coconut chili sauce with 3 fairly big potato croquettes. Again, very tasty and almost perfect, if not more than enough, portions. . . We skipped dessert only bc nothing seemed very appealing to me at that time AND I knew that Sweet Lady Jane was within walking distance from this place and I had my favorite three berry cake from there, already in my mind for dessert! . . I would definitely come back here again tho! Both the patio and inside seatings are open and airy. Pretty dim and cozy at night too!
