Service was going-out-of-your-way friendly and I'd give 5 stars if it were just for that.  The food was just okay, nothing particularly impressive.  I got the pupusa &amp; green tamale combo platter, and thought the tamale wasn't worth the calories to finish off, and the pupusa was just okay.  The black refried beans were good, although the rice needed seasoning, and I really enjoyed the spicy Mexican-style coleslaw.  Overall at the end of the meal felt guilty about the calories, which is a sign of a less-than-stellar food rating to me.
