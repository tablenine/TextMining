Restaurant: Canton House Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
My only experience at Canton House was solid - nothing more, nothing less.  My friends and I will try pretty much anything, but we don't have a huge knowledge of what all the different dishes are.  In that area, the servers weren't extremely helpful, but knowing what is in the dishes probably takes away from the enjoyment of eating them.. . We tried a decent number of items.  I wish I could name them.  One favorite was a pan-fried rice noodle ball stuffed with meat (pork, maybe), mushrooms, and some vegetables including water chestnuts.  I also enjoyed the Chinese broccoli and shrimp with sugarcane.  However, quite a few plates were just mediocre.  The shrimp filling in our har gow was rubbery and bland, and pork buns were so sweet that they reminded me of Krispy Kreme doughnuts.. . The meal did satisfy my dim sum craving - and for $15 a head, you can't complain about that.  I'd probably look to try someplace else before returning to Canton House.
