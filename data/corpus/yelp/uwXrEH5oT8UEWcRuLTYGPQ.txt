Restaurant: Alfredo&#39;s Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
I love Alfredo's! It reminds me of some Italian restaurant in New Jersey in the 70's...I hope they never change the decor. And the food....mmmmmm! So good...one of the few good Italian restaurants in the city, in my humble opinion. Try the Chicken Francese....you won't be disappointed. And the wait staff is the real deal. Great service.
