One of the best Churrascarias around the LA area.  If you are a die hard carnivore, try this place.  Wait staff was excellent, quick, friendly, and cute (Brazilian guys, need I say more?) Food was yummy.  Never ending plantains (awesome service since I love plantains). Needless to say, I waddled out of there after I was done eating :)
