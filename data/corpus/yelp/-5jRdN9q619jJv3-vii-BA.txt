Restaurant: Wasabi
Category: Sushi Bars
Wasabi, I couldn't love you more if I tried. I am a fan of raw fish, especially when it is wrapped in yummy rice and topped with eel sauce, avocado, salmon, or all of these things at once. That said, Wasabi is my favorite sushi in Atlanta. The food is consistently good, and the Double Stackedd, Happy Ending, Supercrunch, and Pink Lady are pretty awesome.. . For anyone looking for a laidback atmosphere to enjoy sushi with friends, Wasabi is a winner here, too. No annoying screams of, "Sake Bomb," but you can get one.
