Restaurant: Uncle Julio&#39;s Casa Grande
Category: Mexican
Cheese enchiladas with meat sauce. MEH. Reminded me of Chef Boyardee's cheese raviolis. Seriously.. Great chips and queso. OK margaritas.. But, the ONLY thing that ever makes me WANT to go to Uncle Julio's is that GIGANTIC painting of a Chihuahua. . I am totally planning a heist to steal that thing. It's probably my favorite piece of restaurant decor in all of Atlanta, if not the world. I definitely suggest stopping in here just to pay homage to that thing. It's glorious.
