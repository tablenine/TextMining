Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
Beautiful decor; friendly and talented servers who know their craft well. My girlfriend and I ate at the bar for my birthday and turned over the responsibilty for the four courses and matching wines to our server, Lauren.. . This spot is packed within minutes of its openning and reservations are booked two months out, so I recommend showing up for an early dinner at 5:15 pm (15 minutes before it opens) on a weeknight and making an evening of it.. . Mozza's Italian-only winelist is amazing and the pastas and grilled octopus salad have me dreaming about getting back next time I'm in L.A. during the week.
