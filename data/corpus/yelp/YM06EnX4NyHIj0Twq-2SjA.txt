I gave 3 stars, but it's more like 3.5. I ordered #1 on the menu with white meat: SCORE'S (1/4 Chix prepared southern style, 2 waffles, own private mix) $10.20. . It was a big portion, I couldn't finish eating all. My chicken was crispy outside, very good. My waffle was good, but I don't like so much butter on my waffles. Also why are they giving so much syrup for your waffle? Do people really use this much syrup?
