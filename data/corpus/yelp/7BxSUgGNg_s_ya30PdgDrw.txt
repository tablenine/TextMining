Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
I liked our waiter.  He was super nice and he made sure we enjoyed our food.. . BUT, I have a few BUTS:. . 1.)  I don't like the fact that they make people wait outside.  In the cold.  Sure there is a heater.  But, for real?. . 2.)  The outside seating area, was just not that great.  . . 3.)  They had NO CAFEZINHO!  OMG, I was SO excited to eat at a Brazilian restaurant so that I could end my meal with authentic Brazilian coffee.  So when the waiter said, they had NO cafezinho, I was so disappointed. . . The two stars are broken down accordingly:. . 1 Star:  For our waiter. . Another Star:  My picanha steak.  Mmmm.  Just exactly the way I remember my picanha steak.  When I bit into my farofa (yucca flour) covered picanha bit, memories of Leblon, Macae and Ipanema came flashing back.. . I'd come back for the picanha.. . And maybe the chocolate mousse too.
