This is the next trend...for those of you who want to say you knew it first, get your taco truck loving mits on some of these revolutionary Korean BBQ tacos.... . KORBBQTACOTRUCKZOMG. This stuff is so addictive! Probably the best advice anyone can give you is to make sure that you order a bit more food than you think you can eat because you will be sorely disappointed if you don't have enough food. I am a wee little Filipina, and three tacos [2 dollars a piece? wah??] did not satiate my craving.... . It was just THAT darn good. I was following a twitter update with 2 friends walking around Little Tokyo in DTLA, and after walking around for 5 minutes we found the truck (5 minutes after it got there) and waited behind at least 30 people in line...It took over an hour to get our food, but I feel like the wait made it that more epic to take that slow motion first bite.. . The short rib and spicy pork tacos were so tender and juicy. I loved the special Siracha they put in it...and the burritos were amazing I heard as well. Don't forget to check out their daily specials! Look for where they are at next because you don't want to miss them (they are only at a spot for like 3-4 hours at a time) and BYO-soda; they are 2 bucks a pop...thats another taco!
