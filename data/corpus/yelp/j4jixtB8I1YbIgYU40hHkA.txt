I have only eaten at Joys by way of carry-out, so this review is of their food as carry-out.. . Pros: So fast, they make Jimmy Johns look like some sort of slow moving ice formation. Seriously, I eat here ususally when I realise I have forgotten to eat and I don't have the patience to boil water and add rice, it is that fast. Â The food is reasonable priced. I have used the online ordering system several times and it has always been a charm.. . Cons: It isn't really a con, because the food isn't bad, but there is usually nothing that special about it. I am sure that it is much better when you dine in. When ever you order food "hot", it seems like they just add some chili paste in at the last minute and don't really worry about mixing it in.
