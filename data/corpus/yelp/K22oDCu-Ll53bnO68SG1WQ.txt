Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
Went here last night, and the champagne was very good, the servers were fun, and the place is just beautiful. They also have a jazz club in the back where they have small concerts, one of which I am definitely going back for. Didn't try any of the food, but it all looked delicious and was very nicely presented (always a plus).. . Added bonus - it was really cold last night and the tables have lights built into them, and it kind of heats up the table edges (hard to explain, but very cool).
