random review.  we didn't eat in...rather stumbled in for some post dinner beverages. what to do? my friend isn't allowed in blakes anymore...... . awesome service.  nice mixed drinks.  my pals had some pomegranate martinis that tasted like dimetapp...and i loved that the server 1.  did not give them a hard time about exchanging the drinks and 2.  came back and was like "yeah.  that juice was like syrup. sorry.". . would say that i would come back for food, but the aroma was not yummy. who knows.  the awesome service was a plus though.
