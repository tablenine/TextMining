I've heard and read so much about Shaun's that I was really excited to try it for the first time last night! Unfortunately things didn't play out as well as I had hoped.... . I think my experience mirrors what a lot of the other reviews had said: the atmosphere is great, the food is great, the service is well below what it needs to be at this price point.. . Everything moved at a snail's pace. I'm not sure if they were understaffed, or if it was just the wrong staff, or what the deal was, but our waitress seemed unable to multitask. She'd bring water to the table next to ours, then put the water away without glancing at our empty glasses. After chatting with her about which was her favorite of their specialty cocktails, and even taking her recommendation, she put in the order for the wrong one.. . The worst of it was when food started coming out. Both our first and main courses came out "staggered" -- there were three of us, and they'd bring two dishes, and it'd be several minutes before the third dish would finally find its way to the table. Not sure if it's just a pet peeve for me, but that seems unacceptable, and is just poor kitchen management.. . Aside from the service issues, the food was good. I started with a pumpkin ravioli appetizer in a sage brown butter sauce. It had really great flavor. For my main course I went with the crab cakes, which were heavy on the crab, though I think the cabbage slaw that came with it was probably my favorite.. . For desert, we split the ricotta zeppoles and our friend got the banoffe pie. Both were good, though not breathtaking.. . In summary, food and location great, service and experience not so great.
