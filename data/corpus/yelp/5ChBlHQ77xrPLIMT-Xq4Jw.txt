i stopped in for brunch on Saturday and while I only had the Steak Benedict, I thought that the food was GREAT!  The eggs benedict were prepared perfectly and the strip steak was excellent (melt in your mouth tender). . I did have to wait 45 minutes for 2 of us, but I guess that is to be expected at 1:00pm on a Saturday.  I also ordered a latte.  I found it quite odd that they served it in a pint glass, but the latte was pretty good.
