Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The wait at this place wasn't nearly as bad as I had anticipated.  I drive by this place all the time and I always see a long line.  My parents had warned me that this is one of those Asian restaurants that really rush you to eat and go.  I went with friends, some of whom I hadn't seen in 3 years and we knew it was going to be a long, catching up dinner - and apparently, the staff realized this as well as they attempted to rush us initially but we didn't budge at all.  The service was actually quite good; tea was promptly refilled as well as water glasses.  One of the servers even took a picture for us.  . . I never thought I really cared for dumplings and after today, I'm sure that is the case.  Everyone seems to rave about this places' XLB, my friends all really liked it rating it an 8 or 9 on a scale of 10 and  I...I just thought it was okay but nothing special.  This makes me think then it's not the food, it's me.  I just don't like dumplings.. . We ordered the XLB, Shu mai, fried rice, red bean cake, and red bean dumplings.  Again, XLB was okay.  The shu mai was very good.  Moist, plump, large-size (I don't think I've ever seen shu mai so damn big), tasty.  The fried rice was not good.  It was bland, bland, bland and very greasy.  Their red bean dishes were delicious.  The red bean tasted really fresh and sweet but not too sweet like many places I've tried.  It was like perfectly mushed and smooth.  In fact, I really liked their red bean dumplings - hey, maybe I do like dumplings.  Dessert dumplings that is.
