A BYOB gem in Lakeview.  This is definitely one of the best meals I have had in Chicago (close tie with the suckling pig at Mercat a la Planxa).  I'll start with the setting - friendly waitstaff and unpretentious atmosphere.  Relatively small restaurant by Chicago standards but cozy.  Table was ready and set at our reservation time.  BYOB without corkage fee - you cannot beat that!    . . As for the food - we did not indulge ourselves in appetizers as we had met with friends beforehand.  However, we were a party of seven and we were universally impressed by our entrees.  Several of us got specials (weekend of August 8th, 2009).  Slow-roasted pulled pork was one favorite (served with bacon baked beans and collard greens); the other was the softshell crab with a watermelon salad.  I woke up this morning wanting more of both.  Off the regular menu, friends loved the Philly steak and cheese as well as the Crabcake sandwich.  Entrees ranged between $14 (burger) to $23 (gourmet aforementioned Steak &amp; Cheese).      . . For dessert, we split several orders of brownie and bread pudding.  Now most women like to go for the rich chocolate (and don't get me wrong, the brownie was decadent), but the bread pudding was phenomenal and the crowd favorite.. . We are making our plans for a return ASAP!
