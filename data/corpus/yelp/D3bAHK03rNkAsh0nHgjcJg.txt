That was a freakin good burger!  Juicy patty, fresh greens, delicious sauce on not your typical burger bun.  We also shared regular fries and sweet potato fries.  Both really yummy.. . We came here on a Saturday night in a party of 4.  This restaurant was so packed.  Every table was occupied and people standing around just waiting for a seat.  There are no reservations or waitlist.  Open seating.  I felt like a stalker last night hawking at people who looked like they were about to leave.  Standing and sipping our beers, I was thinking to myself... this burger better be good.  . . So my tip: good place to mingle and eat good bar food.  Good selection of beers.  If you just want to eat, don't come here on the weekend evenings.  It took forever to get a table to finally place your order.
