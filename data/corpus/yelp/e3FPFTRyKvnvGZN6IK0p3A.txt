Restaurant: Nacional 27
Category: Latin American
Nacional has a very creative menu for a LEYE restaurant, and the food was excellent. My friends and I enjoyed all of our shared dishes as well as our main entrees.. . The reason I am only giving the restaurant 3 stars is because of the horrible service. We waited an hour to be seated for our 8:00 reservation, and when we were it was at the table right outside the kitchen doors. There were a couple of other open tables but they would not let us move. Which became even more annoying when we looked around and saw that in some of the big booths along the wall there were parties of 2 or 3, yet our party of 4 was at this tiny, douche table. Once we were seated our waiter was attentive, but his speech about the menu was over 10 minutes long. Shut up dude, I'm really hungry after waiting for my table all this time.. . And to make matters worse, because we weren't seated until 9pm, the tail end of our meal got cut short by the addition of the 'dance floor.' The crowd that this 'club' portion of the night brought in was laughable, so make sure you make earlier reservations if you want to avoid awkward encounters with the creepy kind.. . Overall the food was good but it is pretty likely that I will not be going back.
