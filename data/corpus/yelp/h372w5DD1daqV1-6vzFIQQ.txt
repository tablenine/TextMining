this place is excellent for downtown dining .... . great food , homemade bread .. coffee from Batdorf Bronson, the oj is like fresh squeezed ( not sure if it is ) . . this is in an old building that has been updated. . parking is handy and right on the bridge :-). . the wait staff is excellent and hip. . my favorite girl charlie has returned 6.08 !!!!. . you can't go wrong with the highland breakfast, the french toast, egg and cheese croissant, grilled cheese sandwich ( its not typical, its extraordinary ). . its open till 4pm usually . .  any questions about atlanta restaurants can be sent to me .... i was born here .. and i know my shit :-)
