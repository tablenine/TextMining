Went here after seeing it on Man Vs. Food. I was expecting alot, and I did get... alot of line and alot of price. What I didn't get was a lot of satisfaction. . . Upon recomendation from the employees, I got the pork sandwich and the roast beef sandwhich with sides of cole slaw and macaroni salad. The serving sizes were small for the price and the taste just wasn't there. I'm not really sure what the hype is all about.
