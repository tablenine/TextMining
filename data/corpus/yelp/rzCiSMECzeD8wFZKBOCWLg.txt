The lobster... is so... f*ckin' goooooooooooood... I don't know how to describe it really, except that each bite made me crave more and MORE LOBSTER!!! The flesh is slighty crunchy on the outside (from the deep-frying I suppose), while the inside stays virginal white and begs for you to sink your teeth into it... and when you do, the tender meat gives way to succulent juices squirting into your mouth and ... wow, am I the only one getting slightly turned on by this?. . If, for some unknown reason, you're not a big lobster fan, try the clams doused in black bean sauce and the black pepper beef. Somehow or other they've turned those beef cubes to such degrees of tenderness that they disintegrate (once again into succulent juices) on your tongue. Then again, why the heck would you want to come here if you're not a big lobster fan...?
