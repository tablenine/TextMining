A girl can work up an appetite shopping all day, so I really liked having an afternoon snack at wow Bao. The little warm doughy morsels came to me fast, were tastey and fulfilling, and made me crave more!! . . I want to go back and try the pad thai salad (bc i love ALL things pad Thai) and I want to try all the bao flavors...its like collecting pogs or something, you have to have them all! Â (did saying pogs date me?? eek!)
