The crispy  Santa Fe "chicken" sandwich is soooo good, you forget that it's not really chicken.  And for someone who loves eating meat, that's quite an accomplishment.   Great price, great service, plentiful seating and  parking, what is there not to love?   I will DEFINITELY be back.   . . (Oh yeah, get the raspberry/strawberry drink.  It's cool, light, refreshing and you can serve yourself as many times as you'd like.)
