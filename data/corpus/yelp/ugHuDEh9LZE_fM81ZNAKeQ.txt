Their Swirls are the best!. . Our waiter was inexperienced but good, he dealt with our party of 12 with ease.  We had a fun atmosphere and weren't at all worried about our rambunctious group.  There is a long wait on Friday and Saturday nights but Tuesday night we got right in.  I'd recommend going on the off hours!. . Valet parking is worth every penny!
