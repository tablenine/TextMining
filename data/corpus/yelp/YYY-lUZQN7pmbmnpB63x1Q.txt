Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Thank you YELP-land and all you motherYelpers.....This place was chosen solely based on the reviews in YELP!  And this place left no doubt how awesome it was and how stuffed you will stumble (Roll yourself) out of here.  I thought the prices were average for all the Korean BBQ I have had in NYC, so that might throw off my price meter a bit.  . . The GF and I strolled down here for some K-town BBQ and were excited with the real charcoal used and the immediate seating available.  We had the house special galbi and the bulgogi (RIB EYE, looked like brisket).  Both were marinated and grilled up deliciously.  We also ordered the ha mol pajin (Seafood pancake with lots of scallions) that was completely unnecessary.  . . Way to go Soowon. You won our hearts and our belly.  Go here for some great K-town BBQ.
