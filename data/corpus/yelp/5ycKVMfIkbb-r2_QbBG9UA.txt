Restaurant: Bocado
Category: American (New)
lunch at bocado was quite good, just a little slow.  . . first off, the interior is done by ai3 and is quite lovely (though the bathrooms are lacking in beauty).  the lack of sound attenuation does make the place quite noisy when it's crowded.  almost to the point that it's distracting.. . i split the bocado burger and the portabella panini with a co-worker.  the burger was good, but nothing really special.  very juicy, though.  the portabella panini was quite delicious, though.  it's hard to turn down goat cheese... our other co-worker had the tuna, which was good, but mispriced on the menu (by 75 cents).  we all split the herbed fries, which were quite wonderful and not too, too garlicky.  . . my complaint is the slowness in the kitchen.  "i think i may have drank my weight in water waiting for lunch," was one of the comments my co-worker made.. . also...don't think you're going to get full on soup and salad here.  the girl at the table next to us ordered just that and they came out in these teeny little bowls.  i will say that everything else is portioned well, though.. . not bad at all, i'll definitely return, as the food was delicious.
