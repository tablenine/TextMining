Yes, it's spendy. But if you have the $ to spare, go here for coffee.  Breakfast was good, but at $44 for two, I don't think I'd order a full meal again.  Though I must say that donut holes were fresh and unlike most donuts I've had. . . But I came here for the coffee.  I use a French press and Chemex at home, so I wanted something out-of-the-ordinary.  There's also a great indie coffee roaster with a Clover near my home, so I decided to try either siphon (which I enjoy) or Eva Solo (which I hadn't had).  Unfortunately, I was drinking coffee alone, and $15 for a pot of siphon brew was too much coffee and too much money for my morning cup of joe. (I'll definitely bring a coffee drinker with me next time and give it a try).  I opted for the Eva Solo, which was still a full pot of coffee but a more modest $8.. . One of the owners brought the coffee pot to the table and checked regularly until the timer was up and she could pour the first cup for me. She asked if I'd had it before and gave me a little rundown on the coffeemaker. We chatted a bit, and I learned that their small boutique next door had a lid for my Chemex.  I bought one after our meal.. . I do believe that the owners are truly passionate about their products and about the experience of eating or drinking at LAMILL.. . There's a casual elegance about the place, and if I lived nearby it might be a regular stop if I had a friend or two who could share a pot of coffee with me.  . . My coffee was excellent. Coffee experts might scoff at me for this, but thought the Eva Solo coffee maker was much like a French press. I believe it was a house blend that I drank, not too dark or bitter.. . One question remains, though. How do you pronounce the name?  El Ay Mill or laMILL?  The logo has me confused, and no one said the name aloud while I was there.
