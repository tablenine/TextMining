Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
I came here with my boyfriend for a romantic dinner.  I was so excited to try this restaurant after seeing it in so many magazines and then being reported as THE most romantic restaurant.  Super over hyped! How is this the most romantic restaurant in Los Angeles?!  I feel like you get the same atmosphere at most expensive restaurants.  The place was super loud and over crowded.  . . I liked the $50 appetizer, it eats for four.  We could have just both ate this for our dinner and been full.  it had 12 different small dishes and comes with a variety basket of bread.  We were stuffed by the time our entree came out.  My boyfriend's pork tenderloin, was super dry and unedible. . . The oddest thing about the restaurant is that they have only have one bathroom each, especially with a full wine bar and all that dinner seating.. . I would say save the money and take your date somewhere else.   . . $200 for the both of us, without alcohol
