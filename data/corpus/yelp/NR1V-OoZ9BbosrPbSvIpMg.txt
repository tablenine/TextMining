This place is a little BYOB restaurant on Western that has excellent food at really great prices. It is pretty tiny so get there early so you don't have to wait. Everything there tastes really fresh and homemade--I would definitely recommend the tilapia taco. The service was pretty slow when we went but it was really busy.
