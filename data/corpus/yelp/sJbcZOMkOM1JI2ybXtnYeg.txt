Restaurant: Bone Garden Cantina
Category: Mexican
Time will not look favorably on the industrial park trend of the early 21st century, with its mishmash of Bauhaus concrete, deliberate primary accents of painted steel and tight, controlled garden spaces. . . These places put the word urban into quotation marks - the physical embodiment of unnecessary spelling with Zs, and carefully orchestrated demographic profiles. I can't help but feel uneasy surrounded by so much deliberation -- and it was with surprise that I discovered Bone Garden Cantina smack in the middle of such a "lumberyard complex" on Atlanta's rapidly growing Northside. . . The Vortex folks, infinitely fond of the human skull, thought to branch out to tibula, fibula and femur; launching their Mexican-inspired restaurant around the skeletal Day of the Dead art. The tacos prove to be bare bones -- with too-darn-dry pork, insignificant shrimp (mojo de ajo), and forgettable carne asada. Tomatillo salsa provides a ghost of hope - it's perfectly tangy, and most everything it touches (like the brisket enchilada) redeems. . . Any dish with the phenomenal black beans as a backbone is worth decomposing for -- but in our humble opinion, the corporate digs just bury the place.
