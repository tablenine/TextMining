Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
3rd Street is now my favorite area to eat.  I had been wanting to check out Joan's for quite some time now, and I have to say that I LOVED it.  If I were rich, this is a place I would love to frequent on a weekly basis.  It's extremely clean, with white walls and bright lights and has a wide variety of candy, cookies, and pastries to choose from -- aka heaven for someone with a sweet tooth like me.  Prices are definitely on the more expensive side (I saw a package of 12 small cookies for $12), though their pastries are not too expensive.  I think a slice of cake is about $5.   I only ordered one dessert, something flaky with an assortment of berries on top and cream in the middle (frutta de something??) but it was freaking delicious.  The cream was extremely light and fluffy with a light dusting of powdered sugar on the berries.  It came chilled, which might have been another reason it tasted so good.  I can't wait to come back and try all their desserts as well as their regular food...if the dessert I had is any indication of what the rest of their food is like, then I will definitely be coming back often and bringing friends!  The only thing is that parking sucks in that area, but if you hang out in LA enough, then you're probably used to this.
