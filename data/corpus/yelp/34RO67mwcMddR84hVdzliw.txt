Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
The best thing about this restaurant is that you can mix and match your own combo of tacos.  But that's where the good ends.. . I went with a group of 4 of us total.. . We shared guacomole...what a disappointment. No taste. Not sure how there's is different from smashed avocados.  I make better guac at home so it was definitely not worth the money at all.. . We ordered the pork al pastor, duck confit, duck sausage, tres queso, avocado.  All were ok but I've definitely had better before.  It seemed like everything was under  seasoned or missing an "it" factor.  Somehow the best thing was the bottled de cero hot sauce that is at each table. It's smoky and very tasty.. . Probably won't be back. I'd rather go to Xoco.
