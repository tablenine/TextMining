Love, love, love the outdoor space on a quiet afternoon. Great spot to share an appetizer and a beer with a friend (much like my roommate and I did after finding our perfect apartment).. . The inside is purdy, the food menu looks tasty, and the beer selection is pretty decent but I can't say I'd spend a Saturday night here. . . But the patio, the patio is where its at.
