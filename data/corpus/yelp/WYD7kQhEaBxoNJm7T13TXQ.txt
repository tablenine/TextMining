Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Manna was like my gateway drug to AYCE korean BBQ.  If you like Manna, then all other AYCE places would be consider a step up.  Yep, that's right, Manna might have been my gateway, but I've long become an AYCE KBBQ snob.  LOL! . . Everything at Manna is acceptable although nothing is superb.  Out of the many many times I've been to Manna, I probably only received great service ONCE and that was because it was a slow day.  By great service, I mean, no crowd, we received all of our food and the sides, salad and water consistently got refilled and at the end of the meal we were offered the sweet rice drink.  Yep, only once did that happen.  . . Have I gone back to Manna since discovering other AYCE KBBQ?  Nope.  Would I come back?  Only to see my friend get sprayed down with champagne on his/her birthday and to hear that lovely Happy Birthday song that they seem to like blasting every 10 minutes.
