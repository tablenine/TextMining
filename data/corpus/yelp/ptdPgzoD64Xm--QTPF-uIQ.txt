Restaurant: Eclipse Di Luna
Category: Tapas Bars
Hyeon J. and I dined here with a friend few nights ago and I feel like we couldn't have picked a better place.  I prefer Tapas when I'm dining with a friend, just because we get to share and try many different dishes.  We chose Eclipse di Luna because we've tried Twist and few other Tapas restaurants in the past.. . Since it was a busy weekend night, the restaurant was crowded and loud.  Luckily, we had a reservation so we were seated promptly.  However, we were seated right next to the band, which totally muted our conversations.  (Next time, I'm going to ask for a table far away from the band.)  Seeing the unbelievable pricing for their dishes, we ordered plenty - probably too many.  Everything was absolutely delicious and unforgettable.  Some of my favorites among them were Calamares Fritos, Patatas Bravas con Romesco, Trucha Salteada con Almendras, and Chorizo al Oporto con Higos.. . Maybe it was the particular night that I was there, but our waitress was really rude.  Nonetheless, I was so impressed with the vibe and food of Eclipse di Luna, that I can easily see myself coming back here with a bunch of friends.  If you are looking for a place where a large group of friends who want to sip, eat, chat, and maybe dance along some lively music, then try Eclipse di Luna.  Just be aware of the fact that this place can get really busy and loud!
