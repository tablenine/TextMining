Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
The food selection here is enormous, not to mention their hot drinks selection. A wide variety of teas are provided for you to sample for days on end. If you have a hard time reading the chalkboard menu on their wall, don't be afraid to ask for their menu. They'll be more than obliged.. . The price in my opinion, given location, is just right. I ordered an Italian Panini, a large ice tea, and a cookie all for under $11 dollars. And wow. Not only was the food delicious, but I was only half done. Ended up having the latter half of the panini wrapped and eaten at home later. . . This cafe is comprised of two stories, with sufficient seating throughout. What's problematic though is that it's very hard to find enough seating for a crowd of more than two people. Hell, Even two people.. . From my experiences here, I've found that typically you have individuals or pairs sitting and dining, not to mention making use of the wifi and/or reading some literature. Which means they'll probably be there a while. You have to be patient and possibly consider the idea that you won't be able to eat there.. . But despite the seating availability issues, Bourgeois Pig Cafe is an all around great establishment to stop by into. Great service from staff, top notch food for an excellent price, and an interior that induces an escape from all the nuances of living in a major city.. . On a side note, yes. This place does throw a little bit of a pretentious and hippy vibe. But it's not the place's fault. Kids want to look cool, surf the web on their macs, or just be assholes as they glare at you coming into the cafe sounding off in their heads, "ugh. what are THEY doing here." Its a cafe. Don't be surprised. Nor distracted.
