This review is specific to the brunch at Bin.  I have been to Bin before for wine; it was good, and I do not doubt the good reviews here for Bin's dinner and wine and so forth.  . . I went for Brunch on 1/6/08, I was disappointed.  Bad bagel experience.  I ordered a bagel and it was horrible - dry and stiff like cardboard.  The rest of the brunch was OK.  Music was a bit loud for my taste on a Sunday morning.  . . I say think carefully about Bin for brunch.  Stick to the dinners and wine.  Had a good pomegranate mimosa.  Waitress was very nice and good service.  I like Bin, but the brunch is underwhelming.
