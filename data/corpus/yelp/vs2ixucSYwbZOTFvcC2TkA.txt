100Th review...... . On a cold and raining night like tonight Pho Cafe sounds so so good. (sigh).... My man brought me here when we were first dating. (over a year ago) It was my first pho experience. First thing that I noticed was all of the hipsters dinning here. Wasn't sure what to make of the place because hipsters do dine at some shitty places. So, I ordered the vegetarian pho. It was delicious. I wish that I was at Pho Cafe now.. . The waiters were not rude at all. In fact the entire experience was good.
