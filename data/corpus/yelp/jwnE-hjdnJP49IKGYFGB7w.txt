A group of 8 of us met at Fat Cat before heading to a bball game.  . . We arrived around 330 to find the place dead, so service was prompt.  Our server was a super nice gal who called all the boys "honey" and "sweetie", which they dug.  . . They have a nice beer list - but they were out of half of what we tried to order!  Our server said they were changing the beer list out in a month, so they were trying to run out of a lot of what was on the list.  That's all well and good, but they should keep the beer list updated so their patrons don't have to guess what they still have and what they don't!  They also had some nice looking cocktails (which we didn't partake in).  . . Our food was all average to good.  I had a salad - they use iceburg lettuce, which I do not enjoy.  I also split the corndog appetizer with a friend - I liked it in theory, but in reality, the portion was waaaay small for the price.  My friend fared better with the nachos, and everyone who had a burger seemed to like it.  . . Not a bad place all in all.  I'd go back if I were nearby, but it's certainly not somewhere I'd seek out.
