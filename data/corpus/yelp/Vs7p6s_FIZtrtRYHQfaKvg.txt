Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
I grew up on Philippe's. My grandparents lived in San Gabriel and we would hop on the Del Mar carpool on-ramp and take it all the way to Alameda street. It was like our own secret road. . We would take up one of the upstairs rooms all to ourselves. Uncles and cousins would gorge on a couple of the beef sandwiches. Some double dipped. . Me and my twin would always get one of the purple eggs. (I told you I was a weirdo) I love them! I LOVES ME SOME PURPLE HUEVOS!!!!! Oh and a pickle. (what the?) . . They have great beef stew. I have tried all the meat sandwiches. My favorite are as follow starting with my #1. . 1. Pork . 2. Lamb . 3. Beef . 4. Turkey . . Which are all great in there own ways. The service is always fast and accurate. . The best time to come though is during the week around 11 am or after 2. Weekends are madness but great for people watching.
