Meh. This was almost a one star review due to my dissapointment with my Â meal . . . however, it wasn't bad or anything . . . it just didn't excite me at all. So two stars it is.. . I had the beef Phuket curry and my girlfriend had the beef Panang curry. We both ordered them extra spicy . . . and they weren't spicy at all. My meal didn't even taste like curry . . . more like Pad Thai . . . and everything was just so damn sweet. . . Somehow cold leftovers a couple of hours later tasted better than when we were served in the restaurant.. . Maybe my expectations were too high, but this is just your run of the mill Americanized Thai restaraunt with a pleasant atmosphere. . . Not bad by any means but just . . . meh.
