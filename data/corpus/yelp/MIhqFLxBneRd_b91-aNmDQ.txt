Schweeet!. . Unique fusiony tacos that are ridiculously inexpensive! For lunch I had two tacos: beef and the fish. The beef was yummmmmy. The fish was a fried fish so I wasn't a big fan but it was still tasty. It would be amazing if they used ahi tuna but then the price would easily double if not triple for the fish taco.. . I can't wait to go back and try to chicken and pork offerings. I shall take a veggie friend so that they can sample the tofu taco.. . Great hole in the wall place that I plan on frequenting more often with my "hole in the wall" accepting buddies.. . Two tacos is good for lunch. You'll need three for dinner for sure. Although I can very easily say that you may end up indulging in four!
