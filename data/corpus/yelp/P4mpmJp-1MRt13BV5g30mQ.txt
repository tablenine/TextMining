I like the layout of the club, and have enjoyed myself during each of the three times I've been there.  The food is okay, the music suits the environment well...but a little more seating at the bar would be nice.  I enjoy the crowds and it's a place where you can actually hold a conversation without having to scream over loud music.  I will certainly be back once again.  If you go with a group of people, you can usually negotiate the entry fee after 9:00 p.m...it is normally $10-$20/per person.
