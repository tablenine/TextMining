Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
This is a fun little place that does your average diner fare. The breakfast portions are really big. I can't wait for it to get warm out so I can try one of their milkshakes.. . EDIT: I went here on Saturday with one of my girlfriends for breakfast and to do a little grad school work. After I paid $5 for a bowl of oatmeal the waitress told us we needed to get going because it was getting busy. A) That is like THE worst thing a waitress can say; B) there were a dozen empty tables in the back; C) When we left 20 minutes later there was no one waiting. She didn't get a tip and I won't be back.
