This is the best pho place you will ever go to!  The broth is amazing.  The pho tai has the most tender meat I've ever had in my life. And for you veggies out there, they have a Wonderful tofu pho with awesome mushrooms! SO good! . If I could change anything about this place, I would ask for cilantro to be served with the pho, and I always have to ask for extra lime.. But they do provide All the condiments I could ask for...most places don't provide fish sauce, but this place Does!. Also, the egg rolls are outstanding; and they actually give you enough lettuce to wrap each egg roll. Awesome!. They close every night at midnight, which is awesome for late night pho.. The only downside is they only accept cash; which is workable. . FOR AMAZING PHO, GO TO THIS PLACE
