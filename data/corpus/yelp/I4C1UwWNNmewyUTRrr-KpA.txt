I felt like I walked into every guys dream pad - flat screen tv's on the sports channel, comfy booths with coffee tables, beer on tap &amp; very very yummy food.. . Really good stuff, my husband &amp; I split a Oinkster Pastrami sandwich &amp; a Pulled Pork Sandwich. The Oinkster pastrami sandwich came with gruyeres cheese, grilled onions &amp; red cabbage - very tasty, but a little to salty for me. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was my favorite. The Ube shake was surprising good, I wish I got one to go.. . There are some other cool looking coffee shops/restaurants/boutiques down the street. I'll need to check them out.
