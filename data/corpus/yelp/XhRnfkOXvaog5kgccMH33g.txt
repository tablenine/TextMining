My New Year's resolution is to write more reviews, so here is the first one for 2008.... . Yes, there are a ton of reviews for this place, but I have to add my 2 cents.  I went to Griddle Caf with Rick W way back in 2007.  It was a Saturday, mid-morning.  It was pretty crowded when we got there, long wait, so we got a table outside and took a look at the menu.  Banana pancakes looked good, but I wanted something more.  The Golden Ticket pancakes seemed to be calling my name.  3 banana pancakes filled with caramel, walnuts, and streusel and topped with whipped cream, caramel and streusel.  . . I'd heard you get a lot of food here, but I was in no way prepared for the amount of food I got.  These pancakes were HUGE!  Like bigger than dinner plate size huge, and thick!  Whoa!  Always up for an eating challenge though, I was ready!  So, you ask, how did you do?  I'm not ashamed to say I failed miserably!  Partially because we were short on time, but mostly because they were monstrous, I only ate less than one pancake worth of my meal.  Embarrassed, defeated, humiliated and hanging my head in shame, I had to ask for a to go container to take the rest home.  . . As far as taste goes, they were good.  Fluffy and sweet and topped with gooey goodness!  I had to eat a section out of the side quickly so the whipped cream and caramel wouldn't drip over the side onto the table and make a mess that the cute waitress would have to clean up.  Hey, that's just the kinda guy I am.  The service was adequate, but nothing special.  Rick had the waffle, which looked really good.  Maybe I'll try that next time.  Note, they close at 4pm, so this place is strictly a breakfast/lunch restaurant and get there early to avoid a long wait.
