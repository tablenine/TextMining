Restaurant: Chops
Category: Seafood
The atmosphere is old school, traditional steak house. Lots of wood and marble, with brass everywhere. I've only dines in the upstairs dining room, never made it downstairs into the lobster bar. I love a good steak, and Chops definitely delivers. The steaks are perfect, and there's a good selection of sides (steakhouse classics, really) to go with them. My group had the seafood sampler for an appetizer once, it was a gigantic multi-level serving of amazing seafood over ice.. . The meals and the service are top notch, but it comes with a hefty price tag. To be honest, I've only been to Chops twice and both times someone else was paying the bill. Thankfully...
