I've been wanting to go here for a while. I went on a Thursday night, so it wasn't as lively as on the weekend, but it still was everything I expected and more. We ordered the baklava, which immediately became my favorite dessert. They also have belly dancers and flavored hookah. I recommend this Â for a date or a group of friends because even if the night is not going so well, the atmosphere and delicious food makes up for it.
