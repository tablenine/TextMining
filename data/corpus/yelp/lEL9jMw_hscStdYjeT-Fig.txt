Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
So this place was Boyle Heights at one point. The food was great and you tasted the mexicano status in the flavor and salsa.the lines are still long at the door but the food is not all that good any more, the meat is chunky and rough the beans taste out the can. At one point this was the weekend spot but it has now become just one more burrito place. the food has gone from being home grown to cater to the masses, its still a spot to eat, but not like before, try the tepeyac special, or the hollenbeck they are great if your a first timer.
