Went to El Barco for the first time last night after wanting to check it out for a few months and left happy.   Sometimes I just want to get some good seafood that isn't sushi, and this place didn't let me down.  I ordered the Shrimp A La Plancha (grilled shrimp) and it was very delicious - came on a giant elongated platter with rice and veggies, overall it was a lot of food, and I noticed the other platters coming out also had quite a bit of food as well (including some crazy dish that literally had an entire fish standing straight up on the plate, eye-balls still intact...I think I'll avoid that, but it still looked pretty cool)....the fiancé got a different kind of grilled shrimp (garlic shrimp) which was tasty too.. . The actual make-up of the restaurant is lively and very casual - walking in I noticed that there were a lot of people eating there which was a good sign that the food would be good.   Oh, and they had some interesting looking margaritas although I didn't try one....I chose to stick with Pacifico.  . . This place is not really much of a 'date night' place as it's boisterous and well lit, but I'd pretty much go here for anything else.  I'm looking forward to going back again to try something else out!
