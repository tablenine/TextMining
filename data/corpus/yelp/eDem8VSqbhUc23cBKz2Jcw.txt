I was always hesitant on trying this place cause it seemed like a vege place but I had some friends that made plans to go so I finally went....boy was I glad I did. The mashed potatoes are soooooooooooooo good, I would dare to say the best I've ever had. I had the flank steak hot place with the arugula, tomato, balsamic vinaigrette dressing, the combination was nice. I had my steak well done but it was a bit too charred so I think I'll get medium/well next time. The cauliflower was nice (grilled) but not worth a second try. I think what did it for me was the mashed potatoes...sooooo soooo good. Oh yeah, I also dig the cafeteria setup....I'm very into this new trend....which definitely equals out to me having to leave less of a tip.
