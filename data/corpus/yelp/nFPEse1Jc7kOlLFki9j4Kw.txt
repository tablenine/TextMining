Let me go all designer geek and first of all say how much I love the logo - it's so retro cute - and the ultra-clean, white walls and aluminum decor. Â I have this habit of going to places and not trying their "specialties" - ordering a sandwich at a pizza place, salmon at Lawry's, etc. - so I didn't try any of the desserts. But they looked yummy, especially the ice cream sandwiches, which come in mini and big sizes.. . I came here for lunch and they offer the usual L.A. fare - paninis and salads, which are decent but nothing too exceptional. But I am definitely coming back to try their desserts.
