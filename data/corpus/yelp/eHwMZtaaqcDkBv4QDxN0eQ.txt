Restaurant: The Twisted Spoke
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Oh, I dunno. Ok, well yeah I do...I guess. This place is sort of, not my style. . . Twisted Spoke is almost sort of awkward to me. Like, OK. I get they are catering to the biker clientele, bike culture, etc. However, this place is just a little too "kistched-out" for me. I get it, handlebars everywhere and bike decor, but it's all just a little too...contrived. "Chicks" and "Dicks" to mark the bathroom? C'mon people, seriously. Even I think that is lame, and that is a hard note to hit with me..... . My salad was pretty awful. I know, salad at a bar. I know. But, if it's on the menu, it should be decent. Not so much. God, how I loathe soggy, warm lettuce with Cesar dressing. It's just...the worst. . . Service was good, our waitress was very friendly. I was there for a midday meeting, so it wasn't crowded. The patio would've likely been a better choice on a summer's day....perhaps avoiding the food altogether and just basking in the sun, though that generally clears about any problem imaginable, right?. . Eh, skip it. Better options in the 'hood. The saving grace was that this meeting led me to my first ever visit to Sip Coffehouse and Garden, my newest, favorite place in the whole wide world!
