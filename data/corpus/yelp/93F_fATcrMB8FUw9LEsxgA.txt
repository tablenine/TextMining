I wanted to bring a taste of Chicago back home for my bro, so I picked up a frozen pepperoni pie and amazingly, it stayed mostly frozen like they claimed over a 4 hour flight plus delays. I was walking around O'Hare with this pizza and I was treated like a celebrity. It gets better because on the plane I meet this beautiful southern belle (I was expecting a fat Bluetooth guy, as is the norm). Something about this pizza....
