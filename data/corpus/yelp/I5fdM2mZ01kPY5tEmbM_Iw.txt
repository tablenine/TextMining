Parking sucks! But what else would you expect in DTLA? The sausage on the other hand is really good. I had the rabbit and rattle snake sausage, which to be honest I could have been eating ass and lips, and couldn't tell the difference. Anyways the rabbit was really good, as were the fries. You can get the fries with white truffle oil for an extra $1.50, not really worth it if you ask me. Compared to the regular fries they were a little stronger in taste but not something I would get again. On a serious note, the beer selection is ridiculously good, but the wait during the busy time, 6pm-9:30 pm, can be a bitch.
