As a Guy Fieri fan, and starting my own Adventures in Food, I had to visit! Wasn't TOO sure about what to get! My BF got a cheeseburger which was highly recommended by yelpers. Â I got the pastrami. The pastrami did NOT rock my socks OFF. It was tasty, but I've had better at local burger shacks in the LBC. BF's cheeseburger, however was ubertasty!! I wanted to eat it ALL!!. . On to the garlic aioli!! I want to bathe in it! Indeed, I would drive over 45 minutes for this. At least until I can successfully reproduce it in my own kitchen!! LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!
