Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
Manuel's is cool because everybodies dad use to go there. It's a much better bar than normal to meet old friends because it doesn't get all that loud. They keep it old school by keeping three pinball tables which is awesome but the tables are often broken. Right now they have 'T2', 'LOTR', &amp; old 'worldcup soccer'. The food is decent, but it's the feeling of being somewhere that has withstood the test of time that makes it great.
