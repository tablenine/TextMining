Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Oh.  My.  God.  The dumplings melt in your mouth.  Literally.  I haven't tasted a dumpling that didn't melt in my mouth.  I've been to the one in Taipei, Toronto, and Arcadia and surprisingly...they all tasted the same...ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!  It's worth the drive and the wait (luckily,  there are some great boba shops and bakeries nearby to kill time with).  Be prepared to car-stalk people who are leaving to get a parking space.  :)
