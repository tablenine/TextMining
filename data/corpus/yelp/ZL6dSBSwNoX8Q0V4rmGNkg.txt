I have nothing to complain about Craft. . . Service was perfect. . Food was perfect. . Wine was perfect.. Ambiance was perfect. . . They keep feeding you and feeding you. So much so that they even pack you your breakfast for the next day~!! A cute little packaged muffin. . . They started us off with a complimentary foie gras amuse bouche. Delicious. Then we ordered some Kumomoto oysters which were just as fresh as it can be. Next came the salad, a baby romaine and crispy anchovy salad that had a unique dressing that made you salivate for the next dish. For the main entree, we shared the braised Wagyu beef cheek and Diver scallops in a Vermouth Butter sauce. And for our side dish we ordered the Heirloom tomatoes gratin. . . The tomatoes were fantastic and cooked perfectly. . . The Wagyu beef cheek was so tender. It just fell apart as soon as your silverware touched it. Then it melted in your mouth. . . But the main star of the night were the scallops. Does it get any better? I think it was the best scallops I've ever had. Cooked to perfection and served nice and hot.. . We ordered the glazed donuts for dessert. It reminded me of our donut crazy yelper. Judy W...you have a not had a gourmet donut until you had it at Craft. They gave us complimentary cookies and some cold melon drink they made with the gum that fizzes, crackles and pops in your mouth. You know the ones in the little bags you bought at the ice cream truck when you were in elementary school. Anyway, it was a cute, fun little drink.. . If we had known we were gonna get all this complimentary stuff (foie gras, cookies, popping melon drink, muffin)...we wouldn't have ordered so much food. We were so full, we almost needed to be rolled out of this classy joint.
