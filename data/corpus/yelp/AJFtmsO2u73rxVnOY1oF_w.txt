If there was a negative star I would give it.   Only other people in restaurant yet waited over 15 minutes for some kind of service.   Never happened so I left.  . . They must be totally racist against Irish.   Remember how Spain was in the Olympics against China with the eyes and stuff... well now they got it out for the Irish.. . Such a bad service experience I will also not watch Paul Gasol anymore.
