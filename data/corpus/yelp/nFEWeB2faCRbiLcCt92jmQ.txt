Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
This is a real delicatessen. It is not a pseudo one, like Jerry's. The food here is real. It is not Nate and Al's. The food here is good and Larry King will not be seated here. The best corned beef this side of the Hudson (don't tell the Morristown Deli in Morristown, NJ). The matzoh ball soup is the best in LA despite the fact that Los Angeles Magazine thinks Nate and Al's is, they clearly don't know matzo ball soup. The pickles are actually pickles, crisp, fresh, the right amount of dill and garlic. I think I am home in NY. Thank you Canter's, I hate LA but I love you.. . Having just read Daniel G's review and the other guy who says the food at Norms is better, I ask the two of you and others like you to please stay away from Canter's. You clearly have no idea what a deli is. You do not go to a deli and order a patty melt. Go to Mel's drive in or somewhere else. You order a paddy melt at a diner, try Fred 62. You clearly have never been here before and please do not come back. Why is the homeless guy an issue? Who cares. Give him some money or ignore him. There are homeless people all over LA.. . You want take-out, there is a side that deals with take-out. You want to eat in, then take a menu and order from it. It is not that difficult. And to Daniel G who thinks he knows "important people." You don't know anyone. Major studio executives and some of the most important people in Hollywood eat regularly at Canter's. Sorry your little vegan friend "Hollywood elite" didn't fit in, maybe the problem is, it is a place that treats you as you should be treated and you didn't like that. Sorry, go put on your clubbing shirt and head back to the line at Area. Oh yeah, your rented Ferrari is due back by noon tomorrow.
