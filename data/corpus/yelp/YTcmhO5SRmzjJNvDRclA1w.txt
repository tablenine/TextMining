Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
Since this is a truck I can only set my max star points at 3. Â I can't stand having to "find a place" to eat my food. . . With that being said, I think the best part about this truck is their TATER TOTS!!!!. . Do be warned, some of their grilled cheese doesn't taste right with the tater tots...I had the american with wheat and it tasted like pastic after having my tots :(
