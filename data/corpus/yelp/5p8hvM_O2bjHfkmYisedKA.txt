Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Yum!!  Umami burger is delicious.  I drove by and got a truffle burger to go and was totally excited to try it and it was so savory.  Later that week I took my co-workers here and had a delicious lunch with the So Cal.  I recommend lunch, so that you can park on the residential streets in back (before 3pm).  . . My favorite burger is the SoCal burger, because of the butter lettuce and the sweet tomato.  The portions are overall a bit small, but its a fancy burger restaurant not fast food.  I liked the onion rings and the fries, since we had 5 people, they gave us one of each sauce.  . . Minus 1 star because they made us wait at our table for 20 minutes before we could order.  We saw tables after us, get served and finish eating.
