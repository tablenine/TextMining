Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
This restaurant is not veggie friendly at all.  I had a birthday dinner this past Saturday for 12 people.   i have ordered from Butterfly numerous times, and have asked for vegetarian curries and have always been accommodated.  Apparently, though, on Saturday, their vegetarian chef was off.  The waitress did not tell us that right off the bat, and then when we asked to speak to the owner, he was so rude.  He said we don't make vegetarian options ever, it always includes oyster sauce, and it's the customer's responsibility to inform us of dietary restrictions.  Yes, that is true, however, when we ask for vegetarian options, and you LIE to us and include oyster sauce anyways, whose responsibility is it then?  The owner did nothing to compensate us for the lack of other options, i.e. sushi rolls with cucumber or avocado, barely enough to satiate anyone's appetite.  The owner just turned his back and was nowhere to be found when the bill came.  VEGETARIANS DO NOT GO THERE.  AND EVERYONE ELSE, don't expect this place to have customer service.. or know what you're saying.  Their English is less than necessary to run a business and understand their customers.
