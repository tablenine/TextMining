Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
note: this is not an AYCE place. . ...came here for a friends bday.. 24 of us.. Â they split us up into 3 tables and gave us separate checks per table..so that was nice of them.. makes everything so much more convenient for the bill. . . The Goods:. - this place have good quality meats, but i still think Chosun Galbee's better.. - it is clean. - service is great. - a lot of banchan. . The NOT so good:. - it's quite expensive...so don't go w/ a big group of ppl who will eat a lot because you'll end up emptying your wallet. . - the banchan is really not all that impressive - i've had better.. . my table of 8 ordered two combos: A ($100) and B ($80)..each combo comes w/ a choice of drink for the group.. but we asked for no drinks and asked for more meats for one of the combo; the other we got a bottle of soju. The combos are suppose to feed 4-5 ppl.. thinking ordering 2 would be enough... wrong. we were still hungry afterwards..so we ended up going to the taco shop (el jalapeno) in front of Soowon. . . As my friend puts it... for the amount we've spent at Soowon, we could have bought out the taco shop for the night.
