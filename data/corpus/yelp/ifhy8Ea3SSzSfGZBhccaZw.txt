The food at HB came darn-near close to being some of the best food my tongue's ever had the pleasure of coming in contact with.. . Good food has flavor. Good food has character and complexity. GREAT food has soul and that little something extra that MAKES you chew slowly and remember it. . . The scene at HB is warm and inviting. Albeit small, our large group had just the right amount of space that made family style dining that much more intimate. . . From the vintage mirrors lining the walls to the old school hutch with candle-topped, empty wine bottles, this place just oozed with comfort. . . We started with bacon wrapped dates, complete with almond cores, and Edam (artichoke and cheese) fritters that, both, got me salivating from first whiff.. . Next came seabass on plate. We're talking the whole bass - fins, eyes, bones and all. Clams and shrimp followed. So fresh. Slightly spicy. The last dish, which officially put me over the edge, was chicken atop a bed of cous cous and asparagus. . . Despite the lack of space in my stomach, I eagerly indulged in their nontraditional desserts including Belgian chocolate topped with sesame seeds, and strawberry pie with thyme. I carried no shame or regret.. . HB gave me that little something extra that I will NEVER forget.
