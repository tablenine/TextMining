Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
A great place for brunch!  Recipe for Breakfast Success (in my book any way):  Coconut Crusted French Toast.  Oh my!  Genius!  Two of the best things on earth: coconut and french toast and Kitsch'n was smart enough to combine the two!  Love it!  Service was a little slow, however for a lazy Sunday brunch its ok.  Another huge plus in my book:  we waited 5 minutes for a table on a Sunday!  Amazing!
