this is a hole in the wall kind of place. but in disguise. you think you're coming to a cool trendy diner but then realize it's very low key. which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it does tend to put some people off. whatever.. . i've come here only at night and during breakfast time as those are really the only worthwhile kind of meals to come here for. food wise i've never had an unpleasant experience and you guys know me, i'll eat my nails if they seem tasty enough.. . the place is bustling and it seems to me a hit or miss kind of joint for those people of instant gratification tendencies as you may have to wait.. . again in my opinion i think the best time to eat at this place is after midnight. it has a what the french call, "an i don't know what". something about the ambiance at that time of day seems right.. . oh, and who is fred 62 btw?. . he is the man that lives inside you, inside all of us, and he goes "i am hungry, feed me" as he rubs his belly counterclockwise and looks at you with doe eyes.
