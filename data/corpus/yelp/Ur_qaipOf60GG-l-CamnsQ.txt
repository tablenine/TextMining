Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Very good baked goods!. . I tried their cookies &amp; creme cupcake--oh so good.  Red velvet cupcake was alright. Good peanut butter cookies.. . Haven't tried their lunch/dinner yet.. . Cute ambiance, other than the ridiculously crowded cash register / bakery area, where it feels like the Chicago Board of Trade pit.  Very poor logistics there.
