ate here last night with some friends. Solid service all around. Hostess came up to the bar to get us 20 minutes earlier than we were expecting. Things only got better from there. The waitress poured our beer into our glasses for us whenever they appeared to be empty. And I'm talking about everytime she walked by. The sushi was also very good. I especially recomend the tuna tar tar with quail egg for you adventurous types. . . I still prefer Bob San, but Mirai is a very nice alternative.
