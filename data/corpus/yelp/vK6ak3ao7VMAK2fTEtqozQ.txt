I LOVE Wurstküche! You see, I'm a  vegetarian, and it's not often I get to go to a brat house with friends and actually look forward to it. But not at Wurstküche; they have food to satisfy myriad eaters. They have 3-4 types of veggie dogs to choose from.  They grill them and serve with peppers and caramelized onions. The bun is good and fresh. Their Belgian fries: DEELISH. I love fries. They are one of my favorite foods and they are amazing here. They have a bunch of dipping sauces to choose from. Personally I like just plain ketchup, but the curry ketchup and BBQ sauce are good too. . . They have a good selection of beer both on tap and in bottles. And their water: so good! Has cucumber and lemon in it. I love naturally flavored waters. Service has always been good, the guys behind the counter are sometimes a little spacey but still friendly. . . Oh and a little word of advice to Jeremy H: How do you know that you've finally arrived as a hipster? When you hate other hipsters.
