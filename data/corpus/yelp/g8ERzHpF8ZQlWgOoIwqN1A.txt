Suuuch a cute place =). . Loved the simple decor, the service was incredibly attentive and the food was divine. I had Alaskan halibut, which melted in my mouth. I was with 2 friends from the West Coast (SF and LA) and they both loved their dishes as well (one had duck with this kimchi 'hash' and the other had ravioli with mushrooms and peppercorn). We had this amazing ahi tuna tartare appetizer too. omg I just ate but I'm getting hungry just thinking about the food... I also liked this little thing of hot chocolate they gave us afterwards (though one of my friends did NOT hahaha). The chef also changes the menu according to what's in season, etc. We actually got to keep our menus (which was totally helpful in captioning my pictures of the food on facebook lol).. . I wanna go backkkkkkkk!
