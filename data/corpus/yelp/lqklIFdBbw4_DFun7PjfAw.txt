Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Can I just say I love the Office's burger, the salad, the beer and I was really looking forward to having it today except the assholes who run this place wouldn't let a baby in a stroller in because it's a "bar" and noone under 21 is allowed. Yes, my 6 month old daughter wanted to get hammered in your establishment and puke on the floor. No idiots, you run a restaurant that serves beer. Â You're no different than the Yardhouse, or Bottlerock or the THOUSANDS of other gastropubs in LA, you just happen to have a really good hamburger. We've tried many of them and EVERY one we've ever tried to get in have let us eat there without even the slightest issue. You are not a bar, I've been in thousands of bars in my life and you aren't even close so stop blowing smoke up your own ass and realize that the only reason people come here is for your food.. . I could understand if the entire place was inside, but no, you have a huge outside patio area. Sorry we were crashing your really cool hip hangout with the wrong kind of clientele. God knows a sleeping baby just ruins the vibe. I could understand if we had a screaming, crying baby but our's is really quiet and mellow and doesn't bother anyone. We've eaten with her in some of the best LA restaurants without incident. I could see if the place was wildly packed and there wasn't any room and it was 9pm, but you had empty tables and noone to sit in them.. . So mister 4ft bouncer at the door, go back and hit the gym, pop those steroids into your ass and try and grow another few inches so you can find a job at a real bar. And missus manager, go back to Cotillion and learn some manners and how to dress as a hostess. I mean really, such a hip and trendy spot really needs someone who shops a little better than the blue light specials at KMart.
