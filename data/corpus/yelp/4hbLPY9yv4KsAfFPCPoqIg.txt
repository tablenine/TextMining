Category: Wine Bars
This one of my go-to places.  The wine list is great.  The service is really good.  The decor/space is very cozy.   The food, particularly the fries, is delicious.  . . The only reason I did not give five stars is that they do not have a lot of vegetarian options on the menu.  I sort of think that since it does not bill itself as a meat heavy restaurant the restaurant should be a little more conscientious of vegetarians.  (Then I could bring all of my friends there.)
