Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
Butterfly is definitely a place that I enjoy flitting to.  . . Full range of appetizers &amp; no disappointments so far.  Favorites include the Red Curry with Shrimp &amp; Black Dragon Maki.  I'm still swimming through the menu, but all of my friends have enjoyed their respective visits.  During the summer, be sure to try a Thai Ice Coffee.  Glad to know it is only 3 exits away from Bucktown...it is a keeper, especially for lunch.
