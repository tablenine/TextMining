It's a staple. A Los Angeles landmark. Yes, there are old mean women that wait on you sometimes, but it adds to what is already magical. Start off with a plate of pickles... follow it up with potato pancakes or matzo ball soup... AH-MAZING. I get the DOWNTOWNER [WITH PASTRAMI] amazing. You can't forget to add the Russian dressing and Sweet&amp;Hot Mustard. As you leave, you've gotta pick up some chocolate chip &amp; apricot rugalas. I drive a good 45 minutes from my house to eat here maybe once a week, if I have time, twice. Go at 1 AM on Friday night and listen to the band, sit back- take in the vast array of odd balls coming in and out. Amazing food, will ALWAYS have you coming back for more.
