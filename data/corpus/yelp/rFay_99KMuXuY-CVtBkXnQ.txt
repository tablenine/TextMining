the ramen was so good that i ate almost the entire humongous bowl and then had to sit down on the sidewalk with my top button of my pants undone just so i could breathe. there was a bit of a line here but it was worth it. i wish there had been more pork belly in the ramen, but whatever. i definitely plan on coming back here. oh, and to the (idiot) who claims that Cup o Noodles has more flavor than Daikokuya ramen....MSG, fool. i bet you swear by doritos, too!
