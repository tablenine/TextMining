Restaurant: Furaibo Restaurant
Category: Japanese
I've been seeing several plugs and interesting reviews from this izakaya style restaurant at Yelp, and I had to check it out, and so I did, just recently. The ambiance was busy and this place is old school. . . The other viewers are right on when it comes to the fine tasty nippon-tapas. I agree, the sesame fried chicken is famous and complimenting the menus would be a side of cold Japanese beer. It is really good and sorta in the mid level price range, however there are allot of izakaya style restaurants like these in Southern Cali, and several close to my area in which factoring the distance can rival the style. I like Furaibo, but the drive for me is a bit out of my league, I will just stick it locally for my yakitoris, but if I am in the area again I will definitely go for the infamous sesame fried chicken.
