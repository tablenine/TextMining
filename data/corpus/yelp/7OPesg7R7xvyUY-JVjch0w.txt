Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
Las Palmeras is an authentic little Cuban eatery tucked away discretely in a particularly residential Midtown neighborhood. It's one of those places you'd never know about unless you had an "in." In fact, I have reservation in writing this review because it'd be a shame if the secret got out and this place gets over crowded.. . It's casual, a little funky, definitely exotic. Dining outside, sitting in plastic chairs at plastic tables, under lush green foliage and next to a closed down convenience store makes me think I'm far, far away from the hustle and bustle of Atlanta (who knows, maybe even Cuba). The "downside" is that it's only open Wednesday through Saturday. Then again, that adds to its exotic allure. I love this place! . . The Sangria pitchers are dangerously good. So are the Mariquitas (plantain chips). And I wish to God I know how to prepare shrimp the way Las Palmeras does in its Camarones Enchilados. They're tender yet firm and swimming happily in a perfectly smooth and seasoned red sauce. For $12.90 comes with two sides. I always get the steamed Yuca, which is topped with mildly flavorful oil and onions, and Moros (beans and rice cooked together). My father-in-law, who is pretty strictly "meat and potatoes," loves it here. He swears by the succulent Pollo Fritto, parboiled and flash-fried chicken deliciously seasoned. Too bad today is only Tuesday...
