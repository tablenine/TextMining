My wife and i bought passes at a fundraiser recently for $200.  I decided to go when my dad and nephew were visiting us on summer break.  When we made the reservation i was informed that we could only attend the brunch shows because my nephew was only 13.  I was also informed that the brunch would cost $35 per person.  After it was all said and done we paid almost $400 dollars for 4 of us.  The show sucked.  It might be good for children under age 6.  I was fighting to stay awake during the magicians performance. It was the worst magic show i have ever seen!!   Also the other guests were rude and pushy, jockeying for position to get closer to the front of the line for each mini show that was offered. We saw the main show, 30 min.  and could not get in to any of the mini shows because it was too crowded. The brunch was delicious, and the waiters were nice, but it was like fighting off barbarians trying to go through the brunch line.   save your money, its a rip-off!!
