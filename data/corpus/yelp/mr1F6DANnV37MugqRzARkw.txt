Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Lawry's does what they do very well.  The prime rib is excellent, as is the spinning salad, creamed corn, and mashed potatoes.  . . But I just don't see what all the hype is about.  If I'm going to go to a restaurant at this price point, I expect variety.  Unfortunately, Lawry's doesn't have that.  They don't even have Caesar salad!  And don't even get me started about the seating.  I can't believe that people go to a "nice" restaurant and put up with sitting that close to one another.  If the staff has to pull a table out just to let you into the seat, that's not a good thing.
