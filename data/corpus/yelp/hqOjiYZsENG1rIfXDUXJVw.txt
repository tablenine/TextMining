This place is amazing. Every Thursday night, me and a couple of my girlfriends get together here. We enjoy the half of margaritas, queso fundido, and guacamole. . . The margaritas are made with real fruit which makes them the best in the city!. . The service is great, the margaritas are fantastic, and the food is to die for. Everyone should try this place sometime in your life!
