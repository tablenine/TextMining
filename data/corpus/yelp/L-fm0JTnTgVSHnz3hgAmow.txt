Ladies, don't dress up even if it's a date night.  Gentlemen, don't choose this place for your first date out of consideration.  Coz you are gonna get super messy!!!!!. . The table is covered with wax paper with a roll of paper towel sitting on top, you are given a bib (which, your waitress will put on for you), and the food comes in a plastic bag.  Ya, you get the idea.  You grab food out of the plastic bag, and whatever that food is, just rip open the shell and eat the meat, gut, brain, oh who knows what they are, but they are surely tasty!!!  Just throw the empty shell anywhere on the table and move on to another one.. . I had 2lb of crawfish and 2lb of shrimp with my friends.  I've never eaten crawfish before, and its appearance definitely threw me off a bit as I had several crawfishes for my summer science project as a kid.  But hey, they're already dead in front of me.  Might as well not waste any precious life, right?  . . I must admit though that I didn't have any high expectation on the crawfish meat itself, as most of the "unique" or "weird" food tends to taste ok, never fantastic.  People try it for the sake of showing off their adventurousness, but never actually for the flavor.  I mean, seriously, who goes back to try bees, turtles, sparrows, snakes, or whatever "unique" food that may have been for the second time?  One try is more than enough for that kind of food.  . . So with little hope, I dug in, and to my surprise, it was sooooo good!!  Actually, it tasted much better than shrimp.  Juicy and tender meat, all the garlic flavor with spiciness of your choice...  It was just so perfect and right for my beer.  I'd definitely go back there with tons of friends.. . Oh, one little warning.  It's guaranteed to have horrible garlic breath the next day.
