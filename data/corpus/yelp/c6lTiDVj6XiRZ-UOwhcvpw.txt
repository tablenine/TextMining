Colleen C. ain't playin'.  . . I love mexican food, but I'm also trying to eat really healthy, and its hard to have the best of both worlds.  Colleen took me to Los Nopales yesterday, and it was the best mexican I've had in a long time.  The food was amazing, even being on a dreaded "diet.". . I had to pass on the chips and salsa this time, but my chicken torta was fantastic.  I woofed that chicken up so fast, I should've gotten a prize.  The typical rice and beans came with, and them beans were the perfect texture (yeah, I'm sensitive about beans).  Of course the company was great, but expect to experience some lulls in the conversation when your whole table has their mouths full on a mission.  . . The atmosphere is authentic and cozy, but the highlight was the crazy mariachi music playing.  The loud "ow OWwwwwwiiiiii" definitely made me almost spit out my water a couple times with laughter.  Loved it.. . Will be back soon and often.
