I am rating toast on the food, service and ambiance. I would not knock stars off of a place because it is crowded or because I didn't like the clientele.. . That being said, I met my sister for lunch on a Wednesday at noon. we were seated right away at a nice outdoor table. The ambiance is nice although I am not sure what's up with the clothing store that is attached. Its just unusual is all. . . I ordered the ice tea and the Tucson salad and sis ordered the chicken chop salad, both 1/2 size. Both portions were large, like pretty huge filled bowls. The salads were 8.95 and the tea was 2.95. The flavors were good, the ingredients fresh. The bread was good and was served with a dipping oil/herb dip. . . The server, hostess and bus boy were all nice and efficient. I appreciate that they are equally attentive to all patrons regardless as to who they are, or what they drive. . . I thought it was a perfectly lovely establishment. Yes crowded, yes trendy, yes I saw a celebrity. Who cares, your in LA. If you don't like the scene, go elsewhere.
