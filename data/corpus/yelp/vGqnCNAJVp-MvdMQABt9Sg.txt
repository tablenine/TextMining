Restaurant: Kevin Rathbun Steak
Category: Steakhouses
I'm an unabashed fan of anything Kevin Rathbun puts on a plate. If he decided to open a hot dog stand next to Piedmont Park tomorrow, I'd be in line and telling everyone I know that it's going to be the best hot dog stand they've ever tried.. . I've been on the mailing list for Rathbun's, counting down to the opening and enjoying the updates on construction and design. I decided not to go right away when it opened since I wanted to try it for a special occasion. I ended up waiting a tad longer than intended, but I think the anticipation only made it better.. . Everything about this place screams perfection. From the updated old-world steakhouse wood and metal interior to the flawless service and food...I couldn't find anything here that didn't leave me perfectly content.. . And the food? Good God....the food...everyone at my table ordered a different cut of meat and said it was the best steak they'd ever had. My friend Rob just returned to Atlanta after two years in NYC and testified that Rathbun's beat every steak he tried at the best steakhouses in New York. Strong words, but I'm not going to argue one iota. My steak was the bone in ribeye (the biggest one on the menu for one person) with a black truffle butter on the side. Three days later and I'm still thinking about it, wishing I could go back for more right now.. . The sides were great: we tried the scalloped sweet potatoes, creamed spinach, and broccoli with government cheese. The white asparagus wrapped in serrano ham for an appetizer was excellent as well.. . The cost of the meal is definitely higher than Rathbun's and Krog Bar (meaning it's not going to be as heavily in my restaurant rotation), but if you want an honest to god beautiful steak...this should be your first and only destination.
