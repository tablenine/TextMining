I still enjoy coming here for drinks and an occassional bite.. I remember the men used to dress up in these silly sailor outfits - "look mom, I'm in LA now and I've made it!" and even though I am part Japanese the geishas that would come out were interesting.  The drinks are good.  The food is decent.  Parking is easy and they have valet.  On the top floor you can smoke with a roof like a sun roof that goes up and down.  They also have this pseudo high tech looking screen like Japan.
