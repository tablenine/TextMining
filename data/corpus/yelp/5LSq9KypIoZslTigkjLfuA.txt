HB is great, so much so that we've gone there twice in the last week!  I must say that all of the food we had was excellent.  We had the mussels entree for an appetizer, which was a great rec from the server.  Huge amount of mussels and even better....it came with a side of frites, which were delicious!  Great value for $18.  All of the entrees were delicious, especially the pork and the lamb burger.  My only complaint is that if you go on a Sunday, they seemed to have run out of a lot of items, but the servers are super helpful and will tell you up front what they are running low on.  . . The best thing about this spot is that they are totally BYO and they even seem to encourage you to bring a bottle or two along.  In fact, when I made my reservation, the guy went out of his way to mention they were BYO.  Now that is absurd!!  There aren't many places in Chicago who are cool enough to do that for you.  And even if you forget there are a couple of wine stores down Halsted that you can run over to an grab a bottle. . . Great food, and great value.  Nuff said.
