Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I've been here way too often now not to bump this up to 5 stars.  All I crave now is that oh so rich broth...and my favorite appetizer?  Get ready for it...chicken cartilage .. yeah.. you heard right.  Yum Chicken Cartilage!. .  I wish the restaurant was bigger.. I wish this place was some weirdly-kept cult secret...but those are all selfish issues that I and my therapist must work on.  . . Otherwise.. you've just been bumped from 4 to 5 stars. i love you.
