I had the fortune of coming here for business lunch twice in the past 2 months and let's just say I was glad I didn't have to pay the bill. Our bill came out to be about $50/each. . . I must have tried 10 different type of sushi and the best one was the Toro sushi. Everything else was great also. I give this place 5 stars for freshness, texture, presentation, quantity, and service. I'll be back soon, even if I have to pay for it with my own dime (or in this case a one-hundy bill).
