Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
You know how, when a restaurant gets a lot of hype, and then you eat there, and it doesn't live up?  Well Mozza Pizzeria lives up.  I've been twice now, both times it was spectacular!  Sit at the bar.  The wine list is amazing.  Service was perfect.  Try Nancy's Chopped Salad...really good.  I've tasted a small selection of the many pizza options, but all were super!  I've heard that Osteria Mozza is even better...but how do you get a reservation?
