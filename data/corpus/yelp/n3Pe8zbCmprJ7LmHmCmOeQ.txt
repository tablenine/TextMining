Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Overrated, overpriced, and just not worth the hype. The hot dog is nothing great and if anything the fries are better than any hot dog they offer. Also, the line is just absolutely ridiculous and I don't about everyone else, but waiting 45 minutes for a sub-par Oscar Meyer weiner is not worth it. Id rather pay 2 dollars and buy a ghetto-dog at the corner of the street.
