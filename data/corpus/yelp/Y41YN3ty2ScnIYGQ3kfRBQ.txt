Fraiche left a luke warm feeling after eating here last friday night. Its been a while since i've eaten out in LA after needing to save money for my wedding for the past four months. Fraiche was close to the top of places i've been wanting to eat at, and i finally got to go. I invited a couple of friends to go with the new wife and I, and made rsvp on open table at 8pm at 5pm on the same day.. . The food was good, but not completely great. We tasted each other's dish because sharing is caring. We started off with a baby beet salad, half a dozen oysters, mushroom salad, shrimp risotto special, duck confit, lamb, and ravioli. . . I really enjoyed the risotto with shrimp, oysters, and baby beat salad. I learned also from now on duck confit is an appetizer only, and their lamb dish tasted like short ribs. We finished off the meal with a pear tart which was nice. Overall it was a fun experience but overall an up and down tasty meal.
