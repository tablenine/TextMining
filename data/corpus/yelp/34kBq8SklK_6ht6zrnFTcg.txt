After the first time I came here, I came back once a week for 5 weeks straight. I love a place where there's no frills, great food, and a great selection of beer (not to mention a very hot bartender!) . . I'm making my way through the menu, but so far: . - The Chipotle veggie is just okay. - Italian veggie is really good! . - liked the Mango and the Hot Link. - Duck/Bacon *DROOOOOOL*. . Make sure you get the truffle oil fries!
