Last night, my sister and I were in the mood to eat something sweet...or so we thought.  When we arrived a Carroll Street Cafe, we went straight to the dessert case.  We both ordered the turtle cheesecake, which was really good, but we regretted ordering only dessert about halfway through our respective slices and asked for carry out boxes.  . . Sick but not full, we decided to peruse the tapas menu.  On the suggestion of our server, we ordered the garlic button mushrooms and the portabella caprese.  I wasn't impressed with either of the dishes.  I  thought the garlic button mushrooms, cooked in butter and garlic and served with bread, were much too peppery, but I was most disappointed with the caprese.  I tried to cook a portabella with some spinach, red peppers, and mozzarella once before with disastrous results.  What we ordered tasted much like my attempt.  The portabella was overcooked and a little too tough.  The mozzarella did not taste fresh, and the tomatoes didn't seem ripe enough.  . . Aside from the food, I was disappointed with the service.  Our server was really nice but largely negligent.  After we ordered our dessert and sat down, we weren't offered any beverages.  When the slices arrived, my sister ordered a drink, but before I could request one, the server walked away.  I had to wait until her drink was delivered to order mine.  We also waited patiently for the server to return when we were finished with our dessert.  I kept trying to make eye contact, but it was useless.  Finally, I had to walk up to the server to ask for carry out boxes and order more food.  I don't think I've ever had to do that...anywhere...and because I don't want to repeat that experience, I won't be returning.
