Restaurant: Heaven On Seven
Category: Southern
Sunday brunch at Heaven on Seven. Prompt, friendly service and tasty creole food. Cheese grits are highly recommend as well as jalapeno muffins. I ordered a bloody mary which was nice and spicy but kind of watery too. Ample selection of hot sauces on each table to season with and entertain oneself. Decor is also very NOLA.
