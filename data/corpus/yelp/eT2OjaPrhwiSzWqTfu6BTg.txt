Everyone was talking about this place so I decided to try it out...so glad I did, I am addicted now! . . The potato balls seem like everyone's favorite, as well as the guava and cheese pastries. Basically you can't really go wrong with any of the items. I also love the plantain/banana and black beans...yum! The cubano sandwich is good, so is the pork sandwich! I even tried their potato &amp; leek soup and loved that too! Even the milkshakes and blended drinks are delicious.
