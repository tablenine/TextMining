This place rocks.  I had to add two corks to the piles lining the walls because the corkage fee was non-existent.  I went there on a date and really liked how they squeezed you in between two other date couples and you could all basically eavesdrop on each other and talk under your breath pretending you weren't.  Good times.  Funny part was that me and my date seemed to be the only of the three having a good time, so we really played it up, offering to share a dish we we caught one of the others staring over at us.  Her and I were just like that - so if you're pretty social and up to an 'interactive' dining experience, i think you'll like this place.. . The food was really hit or miss.  From the other reviews you'll see that not all people had the same experience with different dishes.  I happened to really like the prawns.  And the paella was really, really good.  Whatever those crunchy lentil things were were not edible, so the waitress took them back and brought me something she thought I'd like, and by that time I was a few drinks into the second bottle, so the accuracy of the review will end here.. . Go for a good fun time where you can bring your own wine, and don't expect to have conversation without yelling, because it gets rowdy!
