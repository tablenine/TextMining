Restaurant: Fellini&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
On a recent business trip to Atlanta, the guys I was meeting with insisted that we go out to Fellini's after we wrapped things up.  Not being one to ever say no to pizza, I was game.  I've got to say, I'm surprised at such good pizza in Atlanta.  It was thin, huge and had a tasty, tangy tomato sauce.  Wash it down with a glass or two of beer and you are pretty much in pizza heaven, as far as I'm concerned.  If I ever get my a** back to Atlanta, I will surely go back to Fellini's Pizza.
