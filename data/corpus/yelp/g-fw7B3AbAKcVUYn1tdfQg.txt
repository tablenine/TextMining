Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I love this place! The food is so YUMMY! This is an outdoor place where you grill your own meats. The service here is ok. Could be better. But, i come here for the food and it's well worth it. All you can eat for $16.99. You can't beat that! . . PROS:. Yummy Meat. Great side dishes. Great price for AYCE. Outdoor ( good for smokers...eat, smoke and eat some more). Fun place.. Free champagne on your birthday.. . CONS:. Service can be better (lack of English speaking workers). Outdoor (Might not be the ideal place for non-smokers). . One of my favorite Korean bbq restaurants.
