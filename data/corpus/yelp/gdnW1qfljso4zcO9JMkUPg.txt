This place is really cool...server dude was friendly, and we went when it wasn't crowded at all. Bratwurst just tasted like a regular hot dog...but the bacon and duck was GREAT!!  Love the curry ketchup sauce for fries...but blehh their water tastes gross, guess I don't like cucumber water. . . Will definitely come back sometime to try other sausages..if you don't order drinks expect to spend like $10 bucks if you share a large order of fries with a friend. Not bad! Cool scene/locale in the arts district!
