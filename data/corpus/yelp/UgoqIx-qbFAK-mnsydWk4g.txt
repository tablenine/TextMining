Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
We met the other night downtown and ate at Phillippe's.. . You should try, as we do, the other items on the menu. We know what the sandwiches are, so we order the beef stew and chile. these items were really good. It certainly is a value $$ Â for dinner.. . Their sandwiches have too much bread for my taste, but to each their own.. . Look at their wine list by the glass. Their selection is pretty good.. . The restaurant itself is worth a look. Real downtown L A ! . . We rate the restaurant a good experience.
