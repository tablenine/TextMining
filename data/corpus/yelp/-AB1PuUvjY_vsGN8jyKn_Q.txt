Restaurant: West Egg Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
West Egg is a decent place to go on the weekend. It is cute and they do have tasty food. But, let's just say the food isn't going to change your life.. . If you're looking for a place to go for lunch and you need to budget your time, skip it. The staff is totally lobotomized during the lunch rush.. . I do like their desserts but - and I know others will disagree with me - I think their cupcakes are a little overrated. . . For better food, service, and cupcakes, scoot on over to Metro Fresh instead.
