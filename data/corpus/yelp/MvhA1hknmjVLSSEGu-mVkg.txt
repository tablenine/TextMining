this place absolutely blows my mind every time i eat there... the flavor combinations are out of this world, the ambiance is dark and wonderful, the service is usually very good... what else can i say? . . the only thing i don't love to death about this place is the prices. Â  but you get what you pay for.. . best thing the tagliata and the authentic motzerella from imported from italy.
