I went to HB with a few of my friends for my birthday a few weeks back.. . Every single entree was spot on! Â By the end of the meal we were all deliriously happy.. . Even now, reminiscing about my dinner inevitably elicits a sort of Pavlovian response.... mmm...... . Seriously you guys, this place is all that and a bag of crisps.
