Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Although I have cut red meat almost entirely out of my diet, I have to say if someone offers, "Let's go to Mastro's!" I would be the first one out the door. . . I love the filet mignon and all the steaks here. (This recommendation comes from a gal who used to work at the best prime steak house in Mammoth Mountain many moons ago.) Not only are the steaks tender inside, they are full of flavor and have a crispy outer texture that somehow carmelizes in the high heat process resulting in sure ecstasy and delight!. . The side dishes are outrageous with the lobster mashed and fancy smancy mac and cheese leading my favorites.. . I also tried the sea bass at the Mastro's in Corona Del Mar, and its quality, flavor, and precise preparation were equally delectable. Even the decaffeinated house coffee was memorable. This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion or if you're just in the mood to thrill your tastebuds,
