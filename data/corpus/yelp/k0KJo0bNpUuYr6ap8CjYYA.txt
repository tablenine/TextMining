I visited the Griddle while traveling to Los Angeles and was very impressed with this hole in the wall spot.  We found it through a random Google breakfast search and happened upon this find nearby to where we were.  I ordered pancakes which were huge!  They stacked high and overflowed the very large plate.  They were filled with yummy berries and were delicious.  Our server was a cool young guy, happy to help but not overly attentive.  My only complaint is that pancakes don't work all that well as left-overs and there's no way I could even eat just a portion of that meal.  So a lot went to waste.  But, when I'm back in LA, I'll be sure to visit again (and bring friends to help me finish the food on my plate!)
