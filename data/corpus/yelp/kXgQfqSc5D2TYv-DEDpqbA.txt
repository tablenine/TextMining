Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Their food is pretty good overall and it's a fast service too. Only take them 10 minutes from the time we order until the food arrives. . . However, on the down side, the place is soo crowded and noisy (Mr. Elvis?). Expect to wait 30 minutes or more on weekends and they tend to rush you from taking the orders and giving out the check before we even finish our food. We can hardly talk in there because it's very loud. . . If you just want to eat and enjoy 'Mr. Elvis', then you gotta try this place. Otherwise, I suggest you to try other thai places in Thai town.
