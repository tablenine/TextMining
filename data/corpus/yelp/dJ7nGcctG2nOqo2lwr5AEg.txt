EXCELLENT made by your table Guacamole. However I wasn't too impressed with my meal. I had the Enchiladas en Mole Verde, which is roasted butternut squash and wild mushroom enchiladas basted in mole verde, topped with cotija cheese, red onion and black beans. I found the meal to be pretty plain. I left full but not satisfied. However the Guac raised this review up to 3 stars. I would go back for that and I would probably choose something different and hope for the best.
