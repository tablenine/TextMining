Restaurant: Roasters

Roasters in one step above a place like Denny's, in my opinion. Large menu, variety of sandwiches, salads, soups, etc. Nothing spectacular, just good, home-cooked food. The food comes out quick and they give you a bottomless supply of corn bread and yeast rolls (I always practically fill up on those before the main meal arrives. D'oh!). And overall, the food is relatively inexpensive.. . During my last visit, I ordered a soup and salad combo (pretending I'm healthy, in appearance, anyway). Decent sized salad, cup of house-made tomato soup. Tasty.. . Parking is a bitch, however. The lot is small for the number of stores in the strip mall, and it's usually packed with tight parking stalls.
