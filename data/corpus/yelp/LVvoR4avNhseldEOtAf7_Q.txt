All right so this place has been serving up good ass pizza since jump street and considering the long lines it presents every afternoon on my drive home it is still getting the job done. . Definitely worth the wait, pizza is classic with its crispy crust and fresh ingredients. Pasta is also a straight G, cuz its like they make the pasta themselves and the sauce is very creamy
