After so many reviews on this place Im just going to KISS (keep it simple stupid). The interior of the place is definitely wood inspired. I ordered the Duck with bacon sausage and it proved to be tasty along with their fries. What I loved most about this place is that it has a nice little patio outside where you can sit and gaze at the downtown skyscrapers. I also loved the music they played here which includes some of my favorite bands like empire of the sun, breakbot and passion pit. . . Definitely not my last time at Wurstkuche.
