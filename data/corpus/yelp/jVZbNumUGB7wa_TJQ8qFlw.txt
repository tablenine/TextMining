Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's Tacos are the BEST!!!! That's what I kept hearing. You have to try them! People gushed.... I'd never had the opportunity, was definitely intrigued. . . So turns out I'm in LA last week. Just got a thai massage and I'm feelin the rumble down under... gotta feed the beast!! But where the hell am I? Culver City???? What's in Culver City?!?!? Â Someone mentions Tito's Taco's, I'm so down!!!. . So we get there and my anticipation beings to build. OMG, EACH of the 3 lines has 20 people in it! Oh the sweet agony! That surely must mean that the taco's are worth it, no? The minutes pass like hours... 20 minutes and we're only halfway there.... Who can complain when the Americanized Pseudo Mexican Crunchy taco goodness awaits? Not I! . . So, the moment finally arrives and we place our order. My mouth is salivating now... openly... seriously, I'm drooling a little. WHY did the cashier dissappear??? Is it break time??? I need food, now! . . SWEET HAY SOOS.. thats Jesus for the Nor Cal folk... they finally give me my box of goodness. I Run to the car(cause the seating was non existent) and tear open the box. I grab a taco and take 1 unadorned bite... hmmm.... reminds me of a Jack In the Box taco. . . Is this what all the fuss was about? Don't get me wrong... I USED to love Jack in the Box tacos, before I got on a health kick. Sure the meat's better than JITB, and so is the cheese, but I see a familiarity there too strong to ignore. . . I give it 4 stars because I love JITB tacos and i would give them 4 stars. I would actually give Tito's 4.5 stars if I could. And when I use fractions I typically round up or down. The .5 star gets taken awat because nobody should wait that long for a glorified JITB taco.. . Would I go back? Sure, If it doesn't take me 30 minutes to get there and 40 minutes to wait in line.
