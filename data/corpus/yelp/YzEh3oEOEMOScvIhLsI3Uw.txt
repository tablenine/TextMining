May have  been an off night, as I seem to REALLY be in the minority.. Hmm, it is hard for me to give this three stars but two is probably too low.  2.5.  Had reservations, but I was still at the bar for a while, where I was told a beer was similar to Bass then i got a big mouth full of wheaty beer.  Ok.  The bread was good, the olive oil was fantastic when it was on the bread.  Less good when it is on the floor on the way to the restroom.  I slipped (but did not fall in it) twice, both times the staff saw me.  This was not taken care of; that has nothing to do with the food, though.  I love, love, love Gnocci; this is one of my favorite foods.  When I saw they had Spinach Gnocci in quatrofromaggi (my spell check really wants to change this to electromagnets. Haha) sauce I was excited!  I got my food; I was disappointed.  The Gnocci was horribly undercooked.  I should have sent it back, but I was REALLY hungry; I did not want to do so after I consumed half the portion.  It was not only undercooked, but did not have much...  well, flavor.  I know it is pasta, but the reason I love Gnocci is because it HAS flavor when compared to other pastas.  The Sauce was horrible: no body at all.  Extremely thin sauce, with no distinctive cheese flavor!  I could not taste any gorgonzola!  That's a strong cheese! It tasted like salty cream, and did not thicken at all through the meal. Overall just dissapointing.  I was sooo looking forward to this place.  Nice atmosphere.   REally dissapointing food after reading all the glowing reviews.  May give it another chance and revise...  OH!  The waiter asked if he could take my plate about five times.  I was starting to feel rushed out of there.
