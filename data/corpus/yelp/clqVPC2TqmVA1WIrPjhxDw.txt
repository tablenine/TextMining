LOVE this place! The food AND service is amazing. It's super laid back &amp; cozy. Great beer, people, servers, &amp; awesome food! They also have a little stage with live music. Did I mention that the BBQ is some of the best I have EVER had!! Everyone should try this place, but don't be stealing my seat!! ;)
