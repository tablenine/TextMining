This amazing restaurant is by far the best Thai I've had in New York City thus far (okay...it's in Brooklyn, which if you ask me, is a better burrough anyway!). The place itself is poorly marked and if you didn't know what you were looking, you might think that it's a huge dive or doesn't exist. However, once you actually see the interior, you won't believe your eyes! The ambience of the restaurant is fantastic...lots of mahogany, exposed brick, big abstract art canvas paintings, and an exposed kitchen. The entire place is candle-lit but cozy, making it ideal for both a romantic dinner or a night out with friends. However, I haven't even gotten to the best part yet....the food! I highly recommend the Kang Masaman, which is so delicious that I haven't even dared to order anything else. Other friends have gotten the Pad Thai, spicy noodles, chicken and broccoli, and copious seafood specials and loved them all! The best part? Most of the HUGE entrees are under $10 and I had a vodka cranberry last time for a not-so-horrific-for-New York price of $6. If you get a chance and are in the area (or heck, it's worth a special trip) then absolutely check out this restaurant!!!
