I eat a lot of steak.  A.  LOT.  So with all my visits to steakhouses, you need to do something pretty special to get me to come back again.  Gibson's has the same cuts and quality of meats as most others.  The menu's pretty standard, and the drinks are poured nicely.  So what sets them apart?  I've always had excellent service here.  So I don't know if I'll crave Gibson's in particular, but I'll definitely go back knowing I SHOULD have great service again.
