So the four dollar burger is pretty dang tasty... pretzel bun? Delicious. Fries? Yum. Â Its on the smaller size though... I kinda wanted to eat two... . They offered like 2 bottled beers at the 4 dollar price otherwise you're stuck with their 10 dollar concoctions. . It just sucks to get a seat though, such a small space... you wait for a while.
