Came here on a lunch break one day and was pleasently suprised.  The atmosphere made me feel like I was in a fashionable area of nyc with is beautiful architecture and design.  The food is top notch.  A coworker and I shared the applesauce pork chops and the portobello fries.  if you are a fan of mushrooms, you HAVE to order these fries!  so GOOD!  The pork chops were perfectly cooked with the right amount of sweet dipped in the apple sauce.  To finish it off we stopped by the bakery and bought a macaroon each.  If you have never have had a real authentic macaroon, this will make you feel like you are in France.  I highly recommend.
