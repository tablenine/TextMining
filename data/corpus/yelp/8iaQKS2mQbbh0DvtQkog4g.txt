French Macaroon cookie sandwich- EEEEEE!!!!!. Soft chewy cookie sandwich. Blondie sundae. Nuff said.. .  I mostly come for those confections though others were yummy- had a blended green tea and a milk caramel drink on hot days, blueberry velvet, brownie bites, many ice creams flavors were so fresh and creamy. I have not tried their food, though some of it sounds tasty. Will do next time. I think for the location and quality- prices are fair...comparable to that of it's neighboring joints.. . I realized this is like my 9th review on a dessert spot. Yeah, yeah, I look like a fatty, but don't care cuz I'm a happy camper enjoying the finer, sweeter things in life. Â Ice cream sandwich now- gym later.
