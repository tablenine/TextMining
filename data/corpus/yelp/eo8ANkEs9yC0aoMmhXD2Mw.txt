This place is the bestest ever. The food is fantastic -- the french toast? delish. the fruit? fresh! the falafel sandwich? crispy and perfectly messy. the oatmeal? oaty! On top of that they have a full bar and sweet-as-punch staff. If only it were easier for me to get to I'd be there alla the time.
