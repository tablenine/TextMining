I've only been twice, but I love this place! . . The layout is phenomenal - I love indoor/outdoor dining, and Alcove manages to make the outside patio seating just as warm and inviting as indoor dining. The food is incredible - I'm a sucker for breakfast foods and their egg dishes are fresh and yummy and their crepes (peaches and espresso cream) are amazing. I love the atmosphere here - the kind of place where you could chill out for three hours talking with a large group of friends and not notice it.
