Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
The Hungry Cat has the best seafood in Los Angeles, hands down. The bulk of the menu is fish, but for those who are not fish lovers, the Pug Burger is a real treat (it's so thick you can barely fit it in your mouth). Every dish I have had is excellent. It has a raw bar where you can order fresh oysters and prawns, as a warm entrees menu. Their Â menu is constantly changing, but some of my favorites, when their on the menu, are the steamed mussels, lobster roll, and fish tacos (everyone I have taken here is a fan of the fish tacos, even people who aren't crazy about fish!). . They have a great wine and beer selection, and their agua fresca, which they make fresh daily with different seasonal ingredients is a delicious and refreshing non-alchoholic treat. The beignets served in a brown paper bag are a delicious way to finish off a meal.. I have been here for both lunch and dinner and never been disappointed with the food nor the service. Everything on the menu is fresh and great. If you are looking for something to do after eating, the Arclight theaters are only a block away!
