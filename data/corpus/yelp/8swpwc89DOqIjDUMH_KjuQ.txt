Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
I love Grey Dog so much.  Their coffee is great, their food is simple yet delicious, and their service is impeccable.  The only downside to this location is that it can be hard to find a table.  Still, it's on my walk to work, which means I come here regularly for iced coffee &amp; a morning snack.  I love it!. . They also have a lovely catering service upon which I've relied to get me through many a lunch meeting.
