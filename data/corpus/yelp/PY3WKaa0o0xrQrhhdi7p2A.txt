Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
This place is mosty about nostalgia for me.  The food is greasy and the menu limited (especially for vegetarians) but I still come here with my parents when I'm in town.  They've been coming here since I was an infant.  They'd make excuses to drive from the Valley to Culver City for something just to eat at Tito's.  "Pick you up from LAX?  Sure.  We'll stop at Tito's on the way."  They'd get the food to go and eat it in the car.  . . It was harder for me in my later childhood years to eat here.  I stopped eating red meat and chicken/fish were nowhere to be found.  The tostada (vegetarian) is pretty good and they've recently added a chicken tamale which was decent.  . . Basically, Tito's is an institution.  It's been here forever.  It's pretty cheap.  It's open late and always packed.  The food is good but you can find similar fare at other places (not a Jack in the Box though.  Come on.  It's better than that.)  I'd still reccomend that people go here at least once just for the experience.
