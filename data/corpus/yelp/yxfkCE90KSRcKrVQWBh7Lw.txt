Aside from a vast menu of choices and very large quantities, this place left me very disappointed. I've been wanting to come here for a while now and finally had a chance to visit. I was ready to sample a pancake, a french toast, and a couple of egg dishes. . . Boysenberry pancake was large and full of boysenberries. Flavour was nearly absent, but I will say that it was packed with fruit.. . Dark chocolate french toast was tasty but nothing stellar.. . Chicago Charlie's egg dish with sausages and vegetables was bland at best. I had to add ketchup and hot sauce to every bite.. . Same went for the Muscle something or other egg dish with egg whites, vegetables, and chicken breast.. . I'm sorry but if I do come back, I will sample other dishes and will steer clear of the eggs. I am curious to sample the Oreo pancakes and the chili and maybe something else but I don't see myself going out of my way to return.. . The coffee was good.
