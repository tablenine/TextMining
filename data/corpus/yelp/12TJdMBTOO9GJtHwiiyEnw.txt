Decent beer selection for your average bar, but not terribly impressive for a beer-bar; they have only a handful of Belgians on tap, and these are mostly the big names: Chimay, Duvel, Maredsous. I didn't try the food, but the menu looked promising, if limited. The decor is very slick with a retro-modern feel. The staff seems to be hit or miss; the manager came off as a complete prick, while the woman bartender was very engaging, knowledgeable and friendly. Maybe I just came in on a bad night (Sunday), but the crowd seemed very pretentious and demanding. A minority were friendly, Â but most seemed content to stay in their cliques and give the bartenders a bad time.
