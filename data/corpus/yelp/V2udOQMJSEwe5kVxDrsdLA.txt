Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Yam! The food is so good! Huge menu.., one of the biggest Thai restaurant menu that I've seen. The quality of the food and drinks are obviously excellent. It's so good that I've actually finished my plate, which I really shouldn't have..On the downside, the chairs are really tall, not quite to the proportion of the tables. OK, that made me really uncomfortable, having to lean over while eating. Seriously, what is up with that? Alright, that is my only complain. Still, the service and the food are excellent. Great place for lunch....
