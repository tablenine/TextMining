I go there for drinks occasionally because you can find parking and seating easily after hours. The view is ok, not fantastic, and the sushi and appetizer is nothing out of the ordinary. One thing I always remember is the first come first serve type seating at night. If it gets crowded, you have to walk around looking for seats, while the hostess stands around and do nothing. Not acceptable in my book.
