Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
I eat at the counter about twice a month. It's taken me a while to finally find the burger combination I really love. All of the topping are good, although I'm not a fan of a runny BBQ sauce. . . Mixed Greens with a burger topped with bacon, jalapeno cheese and ranch dressing (I know, I've tried all the others) pepperocinis, chilies and scallions. It's a stinkbomb, but it tastes great. . . Service is always excellent there, and the management is always able to cater to the fact I bring in two kids. I recommend to all my friends.
