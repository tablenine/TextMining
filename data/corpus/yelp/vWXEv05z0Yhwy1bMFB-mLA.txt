Restaurant: Thaicoon &amp; Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
I am not that impressed with Thaicoon. The sushi isn't that fresh, and the Thai food isn't the best I've ever had either. I have found that when a restaurant tries to combine two different cuisines the result is usually not good. Go up the road a little further to Thai Chili for better quality food.
