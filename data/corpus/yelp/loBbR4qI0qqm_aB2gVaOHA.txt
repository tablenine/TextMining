Way too loud. The food is pretty mediocre. My pasta was undercooked (not al dente but undercooked) and the sauce had no flavor. Pizza was almost flavorless. Hostesses were downright deceptive about wait time time and they don't take reservations. That said, it is beautiful to look at. All style no substance.
