Oh Ping Pong. I have a love/hate relationship with you. . . Love: the sizzling rice soup and calamari. Both are done really, really well and I could just eat those two things and be happy and fat. The decor is really modern and clean and I'm a big fan . . Hate: Just about everything else about the place. The service is TERRIBLE. GOD AWFUL. We have been sat there and waited 15+ minutes just to get menus... not to mention the additional 15 minutes it takes for them to come back for your order. The food comes out slower than the second coming of Christ. The transvestite waitresses look fabulous but their proficiency is zero. Aside from the sizzling rice soup and calamari, I haven't had anything else there that wowed me. . . On top of it, they advertise that they are BYOB. So we brought in a 6 pack of beer. They charged us a $3 PER BEER corking fee. We brought it to our fabulous tranny waitress' attention and she shrugged and said it's the policy. . . We haven't been back. It is probably better for my self esteem because the waitress had better legs than I do. But I do miss that sizzling rice soup every now and then...
