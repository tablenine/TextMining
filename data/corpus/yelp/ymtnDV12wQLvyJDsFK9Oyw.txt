Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
It was the first time for me at Pizzeria Mozza and I am rather impressed with the food. It's modern, it's unique, and it's tasty. I started with the Roasted Bone Marrow as my appetizer. Not bad! It could have used a rosemary sprig in the marrow during the roasting processes for a little flavor. For the main course, I had the meat pizza with the homemade fennel sausage and other meats. Absolutely love it! I also love the thin crust pizza or I say cracker-type crust. To die For! My dessert was the butterscotch pudding. The salt offsets the sweetness of the caramel topping and takes the pudding to another level of uniqueness. Anyway, Pizzeria Mozza is a a loud, quaint pizza place with a lot of pizazz!!!! Definitely worth going again and again.
