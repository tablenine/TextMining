In terms of the french dip sandwiches (which is what this place is supposed to be famous for).. I have DEFINITELY had better.. . This place could be good for something to do on a weekend but I would not go here thinking you're going to get the best french dip around 'cause its not going to happen.. . Definitely like the atmosphere, location, fast service regardless of line size, and the awesome rooms upstairs that are so plain I thought I was eating in an insane asylum (seriously cool though).. . I really hate how they dip the sandwiches for you.. that makes absolutely no sense. I would have definitely bumped this up a star if you were allowed to simply choose how much you want your sandwich dipped (or given the aux jous on the side which is NOT an option).. . Overrated for sure but.. worth checking out in case you like hopping on bandwagons.
