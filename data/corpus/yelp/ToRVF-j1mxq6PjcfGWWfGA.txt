Yum Yum Yumo.  . . I had the pasta special which was orechetti pasta in a pesto sauce with fresh grilled veggies and chicked with lovely dollops of mozzarella on top, I could eat a bowl of this everyday.  . . It has a great laid back feel to this place, 4-stars though for the wait time which was approx 30 mins to get our food.  But all in all a really good experience.  I didn't try the desert but everything looked wonderful.
