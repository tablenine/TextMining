Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
I m New York born and bred and continually search for worthy deli, pizza, and bagels in the diaspora-and the pastrami on rye that I had at Langer's makes this eternal search worthwhile-simply put, it was the perfect pastrami on rye. . . I even brought a pastrami virgin with me (what da ya want, he's from Wisconsin-not near Chicago) and he said it was the best thing he had "ever, ever eaten."
