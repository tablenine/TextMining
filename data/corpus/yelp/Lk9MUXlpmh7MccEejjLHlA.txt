avoid it, unless your pastime consists of being treated like crap.. . The promoters are some of the shadiest ever. They'll say that once you get in line by 10:30, there will be no cover. then as you wait, they switch the price on you. we've had 3 promoters come to us individually citing 3 different prices. They get you in line to make you desperate enough to pay for bottle service.. . never made it in, instead went somewhere else and had a blast there. as far as the venue itself, I wouldn't know. but if it's anything like the "integrity" of those running it, i'm glad i didn't get in.. . $30 cover charge? no thanks.
