Lobster tough (overcooked) and cold.  Sauce cold.. . I know everyone loves to praise this place, but I've been here a couple times, and each time the main course is always a disappointment.  The last time I was with friends from work and the lobster was tough (overcooked) and cold, and the sauce for the side dish was cold.  This place is presumably too good to let this happen, but this has not been the only time I've felt let down by the food here.. . On the other hand, I'd say the appetizers (including the oysters and clams) are top-rate.  But if everything leads up to the entree, then if that's disappointing, what's the point?
