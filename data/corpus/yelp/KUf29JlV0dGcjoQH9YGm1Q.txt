My 5 stars are purely for the Hainan Chicken.  Yum-O!  It is the best I've had and only thing I order there.  I love (when I used to live nearby), calling in my order and they always have it ready less than 10 minutes later.  I hate that they're not open on certain days/hours (Sundays, if I remember correctly).
