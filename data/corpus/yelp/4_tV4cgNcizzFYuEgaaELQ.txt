This place is a hidden delight! There are days where I am craving their belgium fries with truffle oil (this is a must)! Simply amazing, esp with the various sauces (tzatziki is one of the best). This place is known for their sausages and beer, but I highly recommend the chiptotle vegetarian.  This place is worth it. Don't let the long line out the door discourage you - definitely stick around, and really whatever you order, will be great!
