Came here after going to work with my mom on a Saturday. I have lived less than 15 minutes away from here and NEVER tried it! Whaaaaa! Anyway, parking was NOT as hard as I had heard. The wait time was decent for the amount of people in line. Got to the front, ordered a beef dip, potato salad and 2 lemonades and a banana pie for the road. So the sandwich was great (just a tip, be VERY careful with the amount of hot mustard you use, a little goes a looong way) I must say, I wasn't a huge fan of the potato salad. A little too sweet for me, but it was ok. The banana cream pie on the other hand, was seriously ridiculous. So as I'm going through it, what do I find? An ENTIRE banana!! It was soooo good, I was fighting my mom over it! She had the tapioca and that was really good. Kinda made me feel like I was a little kid and my Nana would make tapioca and serve it in the exact same bowl. Nice. All in all, I really liked it. Planning to go back in a few weeks to take my best friend who loves loves roast beef and has never come here.
