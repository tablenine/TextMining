This place is neat because it is kind of a surprise. You're on this sort-of rundown looking street right behind the scientology center and then suddenly an oasis of white people with slanted bangs and tight jeans just springs up out of nowhere. But that is neither here nor there. The food is yummy. My roommate really likes the chorizo, gruyere, egg thing they Â have. I had salmon benedict, and instead of serving it on an english muffin they bring it out on a little potato latke bed. Very cute.
