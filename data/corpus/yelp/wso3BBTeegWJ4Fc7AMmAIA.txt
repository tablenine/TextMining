I've been for both dinner and lunch (but not brunch, which I've read is also fantastic).  Both times were delicious.  Most recently when I was there for lunch, I had a mixed lettuce salad to start, the skate wing, and this awesome chocolately dessert.  All dishes were complex, the skate wing had a nice mix of sweet and savory (there was a great raisin sauce), and the service was very attentive.  For dinner, I've had the scallops, which were large and well-prepared. . . Most of their ingredients are from local farms and/or are organic, so that's an added benefit for me. . . In my opinion, it's one of the better restaurants in Chicago.
