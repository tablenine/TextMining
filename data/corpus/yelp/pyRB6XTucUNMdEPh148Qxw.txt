Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
Geisha is a cozy, intimate lounge/restaurant.  Valet parking only. Nice decor and atmosphere.  We got a table right next to the "fireplace."  It was a girls' night out so we ordered lots of sushi and drinks.  Some of the sushi were very good while others were ok.  Service was a bit slow at times.  Music permeated the whole restaurant. This would definitely be a nice place to go dancing but it was just a lounge/restaurant that evening. We had to go elsewhere for the clubbing part.  We paid ~$50 each for a party of 6 so pretty pricey. They have really nice drinks.
