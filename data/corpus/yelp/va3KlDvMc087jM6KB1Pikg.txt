consistently good however, inflated prices.... been going to reza's since i was a kid and decided to try a carry-out order to bring to our friends' for lunch.  the food was as yummy as we all remember.  i made a new discovery: kashkeh bodemjam =  a DELICIOUS eggplant dip.  it tasted like it included caramelized onion in the mix but the list of ingredients in the menu made no mention.  SO good!. the pitas were a bit dry - never been a huge fan of their pitas and hope that they work on that.  i also wish that they would find better ways to package their carry-out's.  tahini spilled all over the rest of my vegi sampler platter.  kabobs were smooshed into packages that were too small (should've just used foil!).  poor yummy dill rice was spewing out of their foam containers.
