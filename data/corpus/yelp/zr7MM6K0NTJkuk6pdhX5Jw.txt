Was looking for a real slice of New York pizza.  Encouraged by article in Sun Times Weekender, came by on Sunday.  As a former New Yorker, I truly miss NY pizza.  This is a weak imitation.  Too dry, crust hard rather than chewy.  My slice of  sausage pizza had a microscopic bit of sausage on it, though the cheese was adequate.   Service, as such, was poor.  Was told they did not have enough employees to bus the tables, which were covered in crumbs and dribblings.  Overall, a big disappointment.
