This place was good, but after everything I'd heard, I expected it to be better. I ordered the chicken with yellow rice. The portions are massive, so go hungry. Tasty chicken, but the rice was a little clumpy and the plaintains weren't as crispy as I would have liked. Still-that could just be my taste. People seem to love this place, so if you're thinking about eating there, give it a shot and judge for yourself. Oh, also-for some reason it was birthday night when were there-they sang happy birthday to three different people while we were there, and each time, they turned off the lights in whatever section of the restaurant the person was in, the better to see the tiny flickering candle jammed into a saucer of flan they brought out for the birthday person. It was a little jarring.
