Here goes the famous yelp line "...I want to like this place" ...But 15$ a person for, I like how Dave L. described as a "glorifed hotdog" that isn't all that glorious and a beer ? Really ? I still can't believed I followed the madness and waited in the long line... 2 things I can care shitless about: hotdog &amp; beer. So why did I do it ? Because this is where all the cool kids go. This place is like a dark &amp; hip clash between the art center's &amp; FDIM's cantine. . The food ? ehh... the vegetarian chorizo (m. chipotle) was nothing but spicy, with chili oil dripping out of it. I feel like they were stingy with the toppings as well. And I wish they served wheat buns as an option but whatever, that's my problem. My friend wasn't impressed with her rattle snake either. . The concept works and that's all there is to it.
