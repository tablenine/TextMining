i've been to feast a few times now and it wins me over every time. they use local ingredients, have a cozy atmosphere and serve tasty creations. . . try the butternut squash ravioli or the chipotle barbeque salmon... if you don't like it, get a to-go box and bring it straight to my house. i can be reached on yelp.
