This place is what it is. It's about as good as you're going to get for a 24 hour joint; I haven't had any major issues going here. It's about the quality of a Golden Nugget, which isn't saying much.. . If you want food, they won't disappoint. If you say, "Hey I would like this edible morsel of beef or eggs or whatever", that's what they will give you. The less complicated, the better. Most people stumble in looking for just that because they're wasted. That's my main reason.. . I think the cooks are aware of this and so they don't try very hard. . . The Irish girl is nice tho. My buddy Shane once tried to impress her with his false Irish brogue. I think he failed. :)
