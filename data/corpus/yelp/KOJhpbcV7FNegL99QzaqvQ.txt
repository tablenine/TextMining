Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
I noticed this place when I would go to Borders, and I thought it was a euphemism for something naughty :P  Anyway, me and the BF went there to try the Pug Burger and the Small Seafood Tower.  We both ordered the seasonal drinks; I ordered the Famous Door and he had the 4 on the Floor (which was super strong).  We both took a sip from each other's cocktails; since both drinks had bourbon in them, we got tipsy rather quickly.. . The Seafood Tower arrives and it looks amazing.   Normally I'm allergic to shrimp, but the peel-and-eat shrimp and prawns did not trigger any reaction.  I didn't like the raw cherrystone clam (too salty and reminded me of something totally gross that I cannot divulge on this site).  I didn't even know you could eat clams raw...  Me and the BF annihilate the tower and then the Pug Burger comes.  I wanted to try Luke's Lemonade, so I ordered that and we shared.  That particular drink tastes more like a mojito because it's so minty.  . . The Pug Burger was very impressive.  I can honestly say that's one of the best burgers LA has to offer.  I kinda wish I had ordered my own Pug Burger to chow down on, but I felt the Itis coming right after I ate my half and some of the fries.  I love how the entrees are named after dogs or cats.. . For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding.  The waiter gave it to us in a metal dish with a dog bone; it had a creme brulee-type upper crust.  We devored it even though we were getting full.  I'm not a fan of bread pudding but Hungry Cat's version is awesome.  We accompany that with some French Press coffee.. . Added bonus:  There are photographs of cats along the hall where the bathrooms are located.  I love the black cat with the lobster ^_^  I'm definitely gonna come back.
