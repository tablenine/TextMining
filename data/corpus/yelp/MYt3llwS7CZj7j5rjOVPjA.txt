Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Juicy, delicious morsel of food.  Socal burger and Umami burger are the best.  Tempurar Onion Rings and Fries are soft and fluffy.  The marinara ketchup has just the right amount of flavor to complement the fries.  Looks small initially, but is very filling.. . Stop complaning about the price.  It just means you don't make enough money.
