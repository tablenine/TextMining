I don't what I ordered, but it wasn't that great. However, I looked at the person next to me and their dish looked really good. I think I ordered the wrong thing. However, the hot sake made it up. I believe if the waiter/ waitress can speak better English and know what people wants depending on taste, this place would be better.
