Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
We used to eat here at Reza's years ago before other better Persian restaurants opened up in the Chicagoland area. Over the years, the food quality has gone downhill and the place caters more to vegetarians and American tastes than to making authentic Persian dishes. If you are a vegetarian, you will find plenty to choose from on their menu. But if you're looking for authentic Persian dishes, try elsewhere. Their soup has gotten more and more watered down over the years and their meat does not sit well in my stomach, probably because it's pumped full of preservatives. They've raised their prices a few times too over the years. The one thing I still like on their menu is their grilled mushrooms in pomegranate sauce. The food is slightly better at their Clark location than at the Ontario location. If you do want to give their food a try, go for the lunch buffet (if they still have it) so you can get a taste of everything.
