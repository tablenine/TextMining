I've been coming here since they were at the Hollywood and Hobart location, and will continue to do so. The food here is great, nothing too greasy or over seasoned with msg. My favorites have to be the pad thai and the crispy fried squid, along with tom ka gai (chicken coconut soup). While it isn't authentic thai, it really doesn't try to be. . . And as other reviewers have said, the nighttime entertainment of Thai Elvis and others are a staple here as much as the thai iced tea. The owner is also a really nice guy and treats his regulars well. Service here is also great and they know how to handle large parties with ease. . . Parking here sucks, and I do not like the parking service people in the garage. And the prices are a little higher than I want them to be considering it's Thai food, but I still love coming here no matther what.
