i had enough for leftovers and ate it for lunch today . just eating it again at lunch made me want to go buy another one after work. . i got the BBQ pulled pork. so good and with the red cabbage that really compliments it. served with belgian fries and this garlic mayonaise type sauce. yummy yummy yummy. . i didn't realize it was like a fast food place cuz it looks like a diner. you order your food at the counter and they serve you your food. . yeah, the sandwich is messy but with all the meat they give, i can't complain.
