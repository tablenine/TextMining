Had a great experience here a week or so ago.  One waitress covering the wholeplace, but she was quick and actually friendly!  The individual slices are really huge--way bigger than Fellini's, so be sure you can really handle all of that.  My b/f loved the sundried tomatoes and feta combination he created.  I had a small, super thin crust pizza and the crust was crispy and the pie had just enough cheese.  Watch out! The garlic cheese bread will give you bad breath for days!
