Finally, a delish pizza spot for carry-out in Decatur! Â The topping variety makes me one happy lady, especially "gourmet" items like: basil, cilantro, arugula, eggplant, buffalo mozzarella, goat cheese, roasted onion, gorgonzola, roasted red peppers, toasted walnuts, asparagus, artichoke hearts, prosciutto, portabella, shrimp, soprasetta. I also love that it's next door to LA Fitness.
