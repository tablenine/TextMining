First review on Yelp after using for so long. I finally want to be a giver, not just a taker. Not that Kogi needs any more reviews, but this is my most recent food experience worth writing about. Been following Kogi on Twitter forever, but could not bear the thought of waiting three hours for tacos, until now.... . I tried all four of their tacos--short rib, spicy pork, chicken, and tofu. The short rib was by far the best, followed by the spicy pork and chicken, and tofu was dead last. I usually like tofu, but this one had absolute zero flavor. All of the meats are marinated very nicely, but what makes the tacos (and what makes it uniquely "Kogi") is the addition of the Korean slaw they put on top. This added a nice vinegary, garlicky, pungent kick to the tacos that was the perfect complement to the meat. In hindsight, I wish I had taken my time and savored the flavors a bit more, but 3 hours of waiting left me a bit impatient. I scarfed down 3 in less than 5 minutes. So in the end, they were good, but not "3 hours wait in line" good. And if I ever go again, I'm getting all short rib.
