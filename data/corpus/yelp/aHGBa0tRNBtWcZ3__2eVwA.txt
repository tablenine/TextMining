This was my first time going there with a couple of my gals. I'm not a super expert on sushi, but my 2 other gals ARE!! Â We all ordered the same thing, the "Chirashi Jyu Sushi Box". Rice was tasty. The sashimi was fresh, and good deal for a combo ( assorted sashimi, tamago yaki, shiitake mushroom, fresh green seaweed, fish cake, yamagobo, on top of shredded daikon (bottom) shreddded egg omelette, toasted nori seaweed, and masago on a bed of sushi rice) for ONLY $18.95. If you're on a budget like me, this is definitely worth it. The place was super clean, good service, not overly packed and too noisy, and most importantly the sashimi was very FRESH!
