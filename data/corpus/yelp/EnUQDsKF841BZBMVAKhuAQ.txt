I have been wanting to try this place since i moved on Western 2 months ago. It always seemed so cosy from the outside. Finally i went there for brunch on Sat around 1pm. The place was pretty full. There were 3 people who came at the same time. All of us got a place to sit. The menu looked great - i wanted to order the burrito and my friend had his mind set on a Denver omelet. So we decide, close our menus and wait for the server. 10 minutes later I get an idea to go get a bloody mary next door. IT will definitely shorten the wait. :) I go over to the bar, where a very cute black cat is being fed on the counter. I get sent back because it is cash only. As i am walking to get the cash I see that the 3 people who came with us have ordered. At this point i get very excited. A bloody mary and we will eat soon!! I remind my friend what i want and head back to the bar. No one is there. Hellooo? no answer. So i wait there for 5 minutes until i convince myself that a good burrito is ok with coke. I don't really need the bloody mary. SO i go back to the table - no one has been there yet. I has been 30 minutes since we walked in the door. If it takes that long to take the order, just imagine how long will it take to get your food.... So the hunger won- we walked outside and went to grab a burrito at La Pasadita. (it was good) Waiting for food is ok and it's understandable, but waiting for someone to take and order for 2 people for 30 minutes Â is not really ok. I am willing to give this place another try, but not on the weekends.
