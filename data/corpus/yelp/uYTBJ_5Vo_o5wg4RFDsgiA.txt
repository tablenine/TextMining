After that darn Red Velvet Cupcake thread I had to try Alcove. I dropped by to pick up some cupcakes to have for dessert after lunching with the girls. :D. . I picked up 2 Red Velvets, a Chocolate Neopolitan, a Vanilla Neopolitan, and a Vanilla.. . Red Velvet: The bread portion of the cake was okay. Kind of corn-mealy. Dry, rough, but not horrific. Just not great either. The frosting tasted like artificial crap. It was gross. . . Neopolitans: The raspberry frosting tasted like artificial strawberry/raspberry/fake crap. The chocolate frosting was the best out of all and was creamy, and COMPLETELY different than the other frostings.. . Vanilla: Really dry and corn-mealy. Not good at all. Same gross frosting as the Red Velvet.. . HELLO ALCOVE! Your chocolate frosting is pretty good. What happened to the others? I would have rather bought a can of Betty Croker's frosting instead. It was SO bad. . . I rarely pass up cupcakes but this time I made an exception. We all took a few bites of these cupcakes, gave away, and threw away the rest. Bleh to Alcove. If I come here again, maybe I will try the food. The place itself was cute. Small, quaint, nature-y, busy, and cute.. . :D
