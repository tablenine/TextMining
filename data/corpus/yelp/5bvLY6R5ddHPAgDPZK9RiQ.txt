I just committed carbicide in pastries heaven! Yes, I'm just one of those million victims who would die just for a piece of whatever Porto's have to offer. The usual suspects: cheese rolls, potato balls, and meat pie! Okay I'm gonna keep my focus while writing about Porto's as I have a piece of cheese roll next to me, tempt me, *drool* me..... . The long lines of Porto's reminded me of a roller coaster lines where your heart beats faster as you move forward waiting for your turn to place an order. And the wait is paid off when you were handed a yellow/brown box full of warm happiness. And this happiness comes cheap! Like less than a dollar a piece kind of cheap.. . my fave:. Meat Pie - puff pastry filled with seasoned ground beef. Puff puff pastry... . Scrumptious potato balls - ground beef surrounded by mushy mashed potatoes, then lightly coated with breading and deep fried to perfection.... Hella bomb cheese rolls - baked pastry with cream cheese inside with sugary sprinkle on top. you just can't go wrong with these bad boys!. . Enough drooling, now it's time to eat my roll I have abandoned for 10 minutes... I must warn you, one isn't enough!
