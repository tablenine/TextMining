Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
It's better than McDonald's!  That should be their slogan (in some kind of nondescript accent) "Com'on down to da Father's Office, it's better than McDonald's (*shrugging shoulders)".  I know I'm not easily impressed - OOH A BLUE CAR!!! - but this place didn't blow me down. Or away, or...up down turnaround, please don't let me hit the ground.  Ahhhh, youth is wasted on the wrong people.  In summation, I'd like to say that Beer = good and this place has some, so go there to enjoy it and try not to take yourself too seriously like most of the jerkasses here do. . They should get a bumper pool table and some catsoup (ketchup).  I'm thinking about selling bottles of ketchup out of the trunk of my car in front.
