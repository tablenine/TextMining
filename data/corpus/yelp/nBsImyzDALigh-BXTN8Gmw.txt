THIS. IS. MY. JAM.. . God put a little piece of heaven on earth, and you can find it at Pico and LaBrea.. . If you are one of those people who say: "Chicken and Waffles?!?! Together!?!?". . a. You are probably white.. b. You probably de-crust your peanut butter and jelly sanwiches. c. Shut up and GO TRY IT!. . The salty crunch of the fried chicken and the cinamonny sweetness of the waffle go perfect together. And nobody said you had to eat the two together, if you want to be a real a$$ about it!!!. . Roscoes, I love you.
