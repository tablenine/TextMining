Restaurant: Houston&#39;s Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Houston's is one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta.  A step above the  sit-down national chain restaurants but not too fancy that you've gotta get dressed up to go there.  If you go on a weekend for dinner, expect a long wait.  The spinach dip is delicious and the French Dip sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.
