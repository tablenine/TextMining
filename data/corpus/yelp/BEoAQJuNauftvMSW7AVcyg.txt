Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
Lola's is fun cause it's a martini bar first and foremost.  They have every type of martini you can think of, and many you would never even imagine.  The food is pretty good but WAY too expensive for what it is.  I would just go for the novelty of having a couple of martinis and playing some pool.
