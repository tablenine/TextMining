hen house =bomb. . this bowl is saturated (not overpowering) with yummy sauces!! mix the egg, veggies, chicken &amp; sauces together and you have one effing scrumptious chicken concoction!!! . . we also tried the meatball appetizers, chubby belly and the prime rib... meatballs &amp; c.b. were good... not so much the prime rib though... try the hen house.. TRUST. . . the service was really good too... . . ps: makes for good leftovers...
