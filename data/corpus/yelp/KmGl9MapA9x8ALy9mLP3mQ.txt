Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
my mouth is watering just thinking of the cemita I ate. I really wish I ordered more than one. It was a perfect mix of avocado, cheese, meat and chipotle peppers. Seriously, I would eat here every day if I could. I tried the quesadilla, flan and tres leches desserts. All were delicious. You better believe I will be coming back for more real soon. . . side note: they accept credit cards so yippi for us debit card users!
