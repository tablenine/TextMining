Every time I go to the doctor I stop by here afterwards for a bubble tea. Its my reward for being a semi-responsible adult. The bubble tea is always solid, however sometimes you can tell that they over-soaked their tapioca and it is just too soft. . . I have gotten lunch here a few times, and the lunch specials are a great deal. The spring roll appetizer is also pretty tasty with tofu.
