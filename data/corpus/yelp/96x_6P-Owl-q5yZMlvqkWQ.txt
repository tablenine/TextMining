Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I have a warm spot in my heart for these tacos. I especially like the salsa, its not super spicy but really good--so good I could drink it. The all beef burrito is really good. They give you a huge amount of chips, too!. . Some things to keep in mind:. 1. they can be a bit salty at times. 2. be prepared to wait in a long line. . 3. they are cash only so make sure you have cash(they do have an ATM next to their building)
