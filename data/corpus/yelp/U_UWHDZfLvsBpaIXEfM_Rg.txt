went walking down in "my" new neighborhood, it was kinda late and I'm glad this place was still open... it was exactly what the boy and I were looking for. split a guac appetizer (not too much cilantro or onion - yay!) and their mexican steak style salad and had this delicious strawberry shortcake for dessert. yummo. Â all and all a pretty good experience =) wish we could have gotten their earlier their outdoor patio looked nice, maybe next time.
