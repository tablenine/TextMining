Ate here alone on a business trip and enjoyed the ambiance. Everyone was friendly and it felt clean and welcoming. There were quite a few Greek dishes on the menu and since I wasn't feeling like red meat (what they're known for), I asked the waitress what she thought of the spanakopita. She said all their Greek food was fantastic. It was okay, at best and I never got a refill on my soda. Maybe I should have stuck to their "hellavuburger."
