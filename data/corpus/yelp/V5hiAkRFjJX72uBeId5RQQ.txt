Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Orochon Ramen isnt a bad place to go.  It's not the best, but it will satisfy a sudden ramen craving.. . Orochon is probably best known for its scale of spicyness.  They number it from 7 to 1 and then S1 and S2.  7 being not spicy.  Those who can conquer S2 get to be on the Wall of Fame, but that only lasts a month.  I don't even think you get your meal for free.  Disappointing, seeing as how you probably wont have a good night after that.. . Anyway, I've tried the miso and salt broth, and both times i've gotten the extra pork and extra noodles.  The miso broth is quite thick and seems to have a few more bits of garlic than the other broths.  If you like your broth rich then this is the way to go.  Salt was okay, it really allows you to taste the broth, but towards the bottom the salt becomes extremely overwhelming due to the lack of mixing the broth.  Extra noodles are well worth it at 1.50 in my opinion, but 1.25 for one piece of pork isnt so great.  I order it because i get the pork for its tenderness and melt- in- your -mouth texture.  . . The price is actually what makes this place attractive.  at 6.75 for salt and soy sauce broth and 7.25 for miso, adding extra noodles puts the meal at about 8 or 9 dollars, and it becomes extremely filling.  Not bad.. . Orochon is a fine place to go for a quick Ramen fix, and it's worth the price you pay for a bowl.  However, I can't say that i'd recommend it if you're looking for high quality ramen.
