Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
You either like Pink's or you don't.  The reviews prove that.. But it's a Hollywood icon.  It's historical.  It's one-of-a-kind.  Well, it was until they opened one up in Vegas.. If you're not into greasy, heart attack food, don't bother coming.  If you do come, don't expect a gourmet meal.  Ask for a salad and the workers will laugh at you.  Hopefully the 30 people in line will laugh at you as well.. This place is good anytime, but perfect for late night cravings.  I first tried the pastrami burrito dog.  Pastrami, two weiners, chili, onions and cheese all rolled into a huge tortilla.  It was good at the time, but I can no longer do it.. While the selection is huge (and creative), I simply settle for a chili cheese dog w/ grilled onions, the mushroom swiss dog and chili cheese fries.  They never fail me.  The chili is the best in town.. And the best part?  The GLASS bottles of Crush (Grape, Orange or Strawberry).  It tastes SO much better out of the old-school glass bottles.. One of the guys behind the counter is amazing: he'll remember your entire group's order w/out writing it down.  And they'll make any changes to any of the menu items for you so you really can't go wrong.
