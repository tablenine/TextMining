We had to try this place after it was featured on that pinnacle of American television, the obesity inducing Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. We were not disappointed.. . First off, the place is crazy hard to find. Google Maps it and do a street view before you go because it's really easy to miss -- it's tucked into a little strip mall with a lot of stuff blocking the (small) sign. After pulling into the parking lot (free parking!), we were greeted with an enormous signed photo of the one and only Guy Fieri. The place had a lot of open seats, but then we went at the awkward hour of 3pm so I suppose that is to be expected. The staff seated us quickly and we were very well taken care of -- throughout the meal, we were checked out and were talked to very courteously, without it being annoying or fake.. . We ended up trying a quesadilla as an appetizer, then tried the Plato Tipico which had an assortment of goodies (pupusa, fried plantains, fried yucca, rice and beans), the Bistec Encebollado (Salvadoran style steak) and the Sopa de 7 Mares (Or soup of seven seas, which had fish, shrimp, crab, legs, octopus, and calamari). All were AMAZING. The quesadilla appeared to be pan fried with a little crisp and made with really fresh cheese, served with delicious guacamole. The pupusa is the quintessential Salvadoran food and it did not disappoint -- definitely try these when you visit. The steak was deliciously marinated and the other goodies were tasty but the stand out winner of the meal was the soup. Definitely try this if you like seafood -- even the broth was absolutely delicious!. . The horchata was alright. Next time I'll have to try the sangria which sounded good. Also, the portions are really huge -- I recommend sharing to try a lot of things and saving the remains for another meal or three!
