Hands down 5 stars.. . My mom was visiting from Michigan, and I took her here on a Monday night for a sushi dinner. It was about 6 pm, and luckily we were one of the last ones to be seated at the sushi bar.. . We first ordered toro and it was to die for! It just melted in my mouth...oh soooo good. Another highlight was the engawa sashimi. Engawa is the fin area of a halibut. You must try this! Best sashimi I've ever had.. . We had a decent amount to eat and our bill came out to be $90 for two people. Sorta pricey, but definitely worth it if you're a sushi lover!
