if you're trying to come during the normal dinner hours, be prepared to wait atleast 20 minutes for a table. this place is always packed and there will most likely be a waitlist. . . the waitstaff is friendly and accomodating. i have no complaints here.. . the ramen is good, but i wouldn't say it's amazing ramen. . . i hate the space because it is dimly lit and the bar area is stuffy and uncomfortable to sit in. . . if the restaurant space wasn't so uncomfortable in terms of seating arrangements and wait time, i just might frequent this place more often.
