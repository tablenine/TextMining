Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Asian Fusion
The food is alright, it just isn't anything special. If you are a big fan of Asian food, you can find something much better with minimal effort. If you are hungry and happen to by right next to Joy's then sure go in and have a huge bowl of something flavored with soy products, that makes it Asian right, putting soy sauce on it? What if we add some ramen too? Yea, that will make it really Asian, Should we be concerned on getting any one country's cuisine right? What do you mean, country, its Asian, duh.. . Sorry about that, what I am trying to get at is that this is a pretty mediocre knock off, although it is certainly adequate to sustain existence.
