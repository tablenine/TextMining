I'll keep this brief since I've only been here once for a couple of glasses of wine. Great sidewalk patio with unbeatable people-watching. Chic, modern, steel, crisp. Didn't like shelling out $13 bucks for a glass of tempranillo, but this place gives a taste of the Sex in the City-esque life to non-New York natives like myself.
