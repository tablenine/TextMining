Bottega is currently one of my favorite places near my school. I am addicted to their portobello fries and the aioli they serve with it is the perfect pair with the mushroom taste. . . I tried the Ravioli with pancetta, peas and a light cream sauce and it was very good. It is stuffed with ricotta and spinach so it is a good light dish if you want a pasta dish. I also tried the pappardelle with mushroom and foie gras and to my suprise, LIKED IT. I didn't even realize there was foie gras in it until my mom told me. A little strong in flavor, which I didn't mind too much, but after a few bites, I was pretty much done with it. My mom got the shrimp scampi which was not the best thing in the world. So skip on that dish.. . One time, my brother brought home the margarita pizza and it was one the best pizzas I've had in LA. Everything about it was so light with flavors in the right parts that really hit me good. The best thing about the pizza was that it was clean - none of that nasty feeling you get after eating the average pizza. Almost reminded me of Lombardis in NY. . . My only tip is that they don't serve a lot of food that we are accustomed to these days so don't think you will get full off of one dish unless you've got the stomach space equivalent to a penny. However, the food is worth it.
