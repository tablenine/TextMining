I'm all for a delish organic/natural/free range/cage free/ home grown/ hormone free/locally grown/seasonal/whatever else meal at an environmentally responsible restaurant. First off, this is much more than a restaurant. More like an experience! Servers know what they are doing here - and they do it with a smile. Atmosphere is warm and cozy, well thought out. Food is delish. I just want to say that their baked artichoke goat cheese dip is amazing. I would eat it with a spoon, in a bowl, like soup. It's that good. I've tried many things on the menu and everything has been excellent! Some things are a bit pricey, but you pay for quality food and appreciate the fact that no one was harmed in making...at least not inhumanely :) . . Some other things you should know: . *Free parking lot . *Outdoor patio . *Live music . *Drink specials . *Local art . *Farmer's Market (Friday's) . *They are strict with reservations (will not seat you until all of your party arrives, etc) . *That tomato on your sandwich? It's from the certified organic rooftop farm!
