Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Ate at this location only once,  while waiting to visit a friend undergoing emergency surgery at NMH.  (I usually get talked in to going to the one at Old Orchard.) . . I admire Sarah L. for being so observant* re: the bathroom STALL doors  (though her rational for the doors almost caused me to knock off a star from a restaurant chain that deserve high marks in the "quality control" department. ). . Am I the only one who appreciates "prompt service" - but feels a tinge of disappointment/suspicion when the food arrives a little TOO fast?. . "Inside of a gigantic cheesecake?"  "Soft and weird." Yes, that's how I felt as I waddled back to the OR waiting room.
