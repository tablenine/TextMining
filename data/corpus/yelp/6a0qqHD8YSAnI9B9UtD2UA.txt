have you ever been to a movie where you left clapping....?. . well i must be super fat cause i was clapping when i left this establishment. hahahahahahaha.. . I mean Damn, a large variation of "all you can eat meat," side dishes from 2 types of kim chee to spinach, and soy gelatin in sesame oil. You have rice in metal bowls and fluffy poached eggs aswell. All for a price that is well worth it...... $15.. . Manna's is an outdoor patio filled with joy and laughter, but for those who stuff themselves too much... pain... lol.. . Its the perfect spot for a group of friends... or a food consumption challenge amongst college buddies.. . i love this place as much as i do taco trucks... and believe you me, that means alot. hahahahahahaha
