Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
Ah. Bossa Nova. If I had a dollar for each time I ate there between August 2005 and the present, I might be able to pay back some of my law school loans. Not all of it, but a chunk. . . I originally discovered the place when I first moved to LA because I lived right around the corner, but once I had a taste of the bread and bustling atmosphere, I was a regular. . . I usually stick to the Chico or Carnivale salad, but highly recommend the Chicken Lambada sandwich (breaded chicken breast, mozerella, tomato, all warm from the oven and served on a baguette), or the Edgar's Goat Cheese Salad. They are known for their bread, usually served fresh and warm, as well as for the fact that there is (or maybe was?) a lot of hype about regular celeb spottings at the joint. To be fair, I ate at Bossa Nova on my first night in LA, and was sandwiched right in betwen Nick Lachy and Benjamin McKenzie from the OC. Keep in mind, this was my first night in LA, and all I remember thinking was, holy crap, I am living in an issue of US magazine. Funny enough, I think it was like a whole year before I saw anyone famous again. What a hoot. . . Geez my reviews tend to wander away from the topic at hand, which is the restaurant itself. Go early on weekend nights, and be prepared to wait at least half an hour outside (there is no bar to wait at, which I always thought was a sore point, but I spose the restaurant only has so much space). Also be prepared to hear the intimate details of diners sitting nearby - the accoustics inside lend themselves to some very interesting unintentional eavesdropping.. . A note on delivery: they are pretty fast, and the food is still warm. Oh, and they are open until 4 am, but I'm past the point in my life when I am ever up that late to order food! Call me a granny...
