Restaurant: Porchetta
Category: Sandwiches
I had been meaning to come here for over a year on the recommendation of a friend, so I was super psyched when I walked past it last night. I practically ran across the street, through oncoming traffic, towards Porchetta. I ordered a Porchetta sandwich, plain and simple, even though I had just finished dinner (I'm a sucker for pork). The Boy and I meant for it to be my lunch for the next day, but we devoured it within an hour of our getting home. It was DELICIOUS. The kind of sandwich where you wrap your whole mouth around the first bite because it's so overstuffed with goodness and then just chew in stunned silence because it is so so yummy and your mouth and brain are celebrating their good fortune. The kind of sandwich where, when asked how it is, you can only say 'um, DELICIOUS' over and over again. Oh god it was good. It seemed a bit pricey at ~$10/sandwich, but it was really worth it. Go get one so you can 'um, DELICIOUS' your way through evening conversations too :).
