The restaurant itself is pretty relaxed.  The tables are not too close together.  Clean and chill.  The staff is friendly, and not pushy.  Susannah and Julie are particularly lovely.. The food is killer!  Everything is fresh and bright.  The pork tenderloin is so tender and flavored to perfection.  I've only tried 3 things (the pork being my favorite) but they've all been perfectly prepared.  I'd go back and get just the veggie plate.  It changes all the time and the portions are gigantic.  The skate wing is buttery, not greasy.  What a great place!  I'm so glad it's in my hood!
