Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
Not so sure if any of the other yelpers have actual taste buds or not... . . The cemitas have no taste. It comes with sooooooo much cheese (I LOVE cheese, so not a big deal but where there is more cheese than meat on a MEAT sandwich...), a HUGE bun and little meat. I had to use a lot of sauce to make it have some type of taste...the sauces weren't even to rave about. . . The taco arabes were really good, though, but not good enough to trek all the way out for. Â (I believe that was the name...it comes with 5 as an app)
