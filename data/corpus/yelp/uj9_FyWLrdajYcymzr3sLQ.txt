Great place to grab a beer and a brat. They are still tweaking the decor, but it feels like an indoor beer garden. . . Sausages are great, Here are the varieties I have tasted. At each visit sausage is well grilled, nice and juicy.. . Austin City Blues - pork sausage, great taste and bite. Bratwurst - pork sausage, great bite and juicy. Rattlesnake and rabbit - Very tasty, rich and buttery in flavor. Buffalo, beef, and pork, with habanero - tasty sausage, but very similar to chorizo in flavor, would prefer other types since simple chorizo will fit the bill. . Fries - Tasty no great fries could be crisper, sauces are pretty good, aiolia good, ranch a little runny, walnut and blue cheese a little difficult to scoop but great taste.. . Water - nicely chilled cucumber water in the back and front of space by the forks, spoons, and mustards. . Grilled spciy peppers, onions, and saurkraut are all good. . Beer selection is outstanding, tons of Belgians on tap, even PBR for those on a budget. . Addition of dj at night makes it good place to hang out for a drink and recent addition of pens and markers to draw on table increase the fun!
