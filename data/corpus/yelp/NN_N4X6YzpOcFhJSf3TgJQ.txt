Restaurant: Hae Woon Dae BBQ
Category: Korean
I'm always pretty skeptical of asian foods, I guess mostly buffet type places at least. So when my roommates convinced me into checking out Korean BBQ i was hesitant but went along with it. Boy am I glad i decided to go! When we first got there was a funny misunderstanding about we wanted to drink, as i was trying to pronounce HITE (Korean beer) and our server brought me a hot tea. That withstanding, I was totally unprepared for what kind of foods they were putting in front of me. All four of us ordered two orders of spicy shrimp, one order of spicy chicken, and one of spicy pork. Thinking we could handle it, we had our server cook in the jalepenos into our meals, and after foolishly eating too many of those japs, by the time we got to the spicy pork our mouths were burning, and i couldn't drink enough HITE! i do think that the entrees were pretty expensive, but i suppose if you eat enough Kim-chee (sp?) you can get your money's worth. i gave this place a four because of the experience, which was something i'm glad i got talked into. . . oh! and the best part is that they are opening an adult theatre in that same plaza where couples get in free! how about that!?
