Restaurant: The Izaka-ya by Katsu-ya
Category: Sushi Bars
When a restaurant has a line out the door, we can't be but a little intrigued. When it serves Japanese food, we can't help but wait for a table.  . . Across from Sushi Roku, the Izaka-ya is a small bare bone looking sushi restaurant with a sushi bar surrounded by wooden tables and chairs. On a saturday night the place was packed and the host told us 30min-1hr wait which isn't too bad on a Saturday night anywhere. This place attracted all kinds of diners, young and old, those on dates and those on big group outings.. . Although no official bar, someone actually came by to ask us if we wanted drinks or cocktails. That was a nice touch and we were definitely seated in under one hour.. . The menu has a mix of Izakaya type items but also has a good selection of rolls and a ton of sushi specials. We ordered a mix of everything: miso cod (cooked to perfection! more cod please!), scallop sushi &amp; dynamite special (scallops were fresh but seemed to be thinly sliced, the dynamite was pretty heavy on the sauce), creamy rock shrimp over spicy tuna (it was on soy paper wrap and they were sort of skimpy on the tuna) and the Izaka-ya roll (albacore on top, crab tempura inside) which was really tasty but it cost about 2x as much as the other rolls.. . The prices here are all over the map. Some items are in the single digits whereas some of the specials and entrees were $30+.  The place is also really loud but we liked it, seemed like people were having a great time sharing food  and talking.  It's definitely more casual than Katsuya and we liked it better, at least here when they greet you "Irasshaimase" (welcome) it's by real Japanese chefs and not by some wanna be actor/actress hostess or sous chef!
