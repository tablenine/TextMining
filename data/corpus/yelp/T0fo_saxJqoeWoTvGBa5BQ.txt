Restaurant: Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar
Category: Seafood
Hugo's is one of my favorite places to go on a warm summer night.  The wait is hardly ever too long (and if it is you can have a martini or five at the bar), plus you can order things off of the Gibson's menu, if you so desire.  And let's face it, al fresco dining in the Viagra Triangle makes you feel like a rock star.  Dress appropriately, kids!
