Why is it that upscale taco places and I just don't agree? Am I cursed or something? I heard about the buzz on Big Star and came here with some friends on a Saturday night. I knew that the place would be packed and the wait would be long. . . Our group of six including a 7 months pregnant friend waited for about a half hour for a table. We had some drinks one side of the bar where other hungry people were waiting to be sat. I couldn't get over how gigantic the bar was. Did it really need to be that big? I kept on thinking how on earth are they going to accomodate diners in the wintertime with less than 5 booths inside! . . After waiting, we snagged an inside table and poured over the menu. Our group selected chips and guac and various tortas and tacos. The pork belly taco was pretty good as was the fish torta. Overall, the food was good, but slow to come out. We had to get more chips because we damaged the first one upon arrival and needed more to finish off the guac. . . Our service was alright, just slow going with the massive crowds. Big Star on a Saturday means a slow dinner whether you want to or not. Overall, food was alright and tasty. The service was fine as well. I guess I'm just not a big fan of a la carte tacos with fancy fillings. For me, it's just another case of someone trying to make street food high-end and hipster. I'll take my tacqueria anyday over expensive, fancy tacos.
