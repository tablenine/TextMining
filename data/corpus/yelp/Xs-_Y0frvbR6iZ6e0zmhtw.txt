Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
This place has the most expensive pho noodle soups, at $7.25 a bowl. However, the price is justified by lots of fillings in the soup. I ordered the pho with tendons, and for the first time in my history of eating pho, I was satisfied with the amount of tendons in the soup. . . The restaurant is minimalist, with rectangular wood-laminated tables and orange chairs. The place is always busy, parking is difficult, but it's worth a visit.
