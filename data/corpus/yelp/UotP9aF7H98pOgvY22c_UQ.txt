Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The food is good, but I'm just not into the combination of chicken and waffles, which is their noted dish. However, if it's your thing, you will thoroughly enjoy it. Their are plenty of other things on their menu that will fit your individual tastebuds. During rush hour, be prepared to wait a good 15 minutes but it is well worth it.
