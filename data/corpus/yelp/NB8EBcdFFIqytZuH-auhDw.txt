Update--Headed over to Stats before a friday night Hawks game, and things were a little better, but not much.  I got there when the place was empty.  It was around 4:15 and there were 6 of us TOTAL at the bar.  They were in the middle of a shift change and I waited 10 minutes for my first beer.  If I was not waiting for a friend to meet me, I would have left as soon as that beer was finished.  . . As someone with long legs, I'm not a fan of the bar itself.  The counter goes down to the floor at an angle, so there's really not any where for your knees.. The food was great, I had the Turkey Dinner.  But I was surprised the portions were not larger.. I gets one more star this time around, but I think it's time to hit the Taco Mac that's connected to Phillips Arena.
