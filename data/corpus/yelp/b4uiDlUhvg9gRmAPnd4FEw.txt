What can I say about this place... It's located within walking distance and is one of the best salad places I've ever been to.  The ahi tuna salad, flat iron steak salad, chipotle bbq chicken salad are ALL amazing.  Salads are created right in front of you and I have yet to eat anything at tender greens that isn't completely awesome.  This is my favorite lunch spot and I've even eaten dinner here at times because that's how good it is.
