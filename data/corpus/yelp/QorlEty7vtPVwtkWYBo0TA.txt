Went for dinner once and was impressed by the food. I'm into casual fine dining but this place was not enough casual and too much up tight. So i opt for their sunday brunch for the good food without the stuffy air. The cheese popover is amazing. I dream about it sometimes. And my girlfriend loves their almond kringle.
