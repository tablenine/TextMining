Restaurant: Veerasway
Category: Indian
Excellent! I was reading some of the recent comments and I have no idea what restaurant they went to, because Veerasway is a fantastic establishment. . . Like some of the recent posts, my girlfriend and I took advantage of a Groupon special to try out Veerasway for the first time, but unlike those who would not go back, we already have plans for a return. . . We had the full gamut -- from appetizers to dessert -- and loved every bite, as well as each accompanying sip of the Indian-infused cocktails from my Maharita to my girlfriends Cucumber Fizz. . . But if there was one food that left us wanting, it was the spicy fudge brownie. It was orgasmic. In a classic Sleepless-in-Seattle moment, ala, Meg Ryan doing the "O" scene in the diner; my girlfriend was spent after the last bite. . . In addition, not only did we have friendly service, but our waitress was a dead-ringer Jessica Simpson look-alike! No joke. It was almost distracting (which of course it wasn't because I was there with my girlfriend. Love you monkey).. . Needless to say, we'll be back shortly.. . Cheers.
