A nice little sushi restaurant in the hills.  The view is spectacular and the architecture is classic (especially the central garden area).  The service was great too.  The food however was good, but not great.  I didn't think the restaurant was too pricey (4 sushi, 1 appetizer, water = $50 w/tip. valet: $6). . . overall I would go again just because it wasn't too pricey and the view of LA was priceless.
