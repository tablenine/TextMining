Restaurant: Mirai
Category: Sushi Bars
Unbelievable, melt-in-your mouth, fresh sushi!! Mirai is a fantastic restaurant. What I love is that Mirai does not do gimmicky sushi. It does well-executed, fresh sushi. This is what a sushi restaurant should be. Although, I wish it was cheaper. That being said, Mirai does have some well priced wine. Even better is when I asked the server for a suggestion, she did not suggest the most expensive wine. She also apologized for the food coming out slow, which neither me or my friend noticed. But, I appreciated her thoughtfulness. . . One word to sum up Mirai: AMAZING. I will be back.
