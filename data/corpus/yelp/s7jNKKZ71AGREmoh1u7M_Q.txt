Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Wow!!!!!. Nothing BUT LOVE in this HUGE Bakery!. From the Guava Shakes to the endless cakes, muffins, cupcakes, Cuban sandwiches, soups coffees and with fantastic quality in everything they do - this place I miss so so much.. . Leaving LA was a divorce from Mozza Pizzeria and Porto's.
