without a doubt, my favorite chicago style deep dish pizza. i think its either the nice, greasy, buttery, and oily crust or the thick layer of juicy, fattening, spicy sausage they put on the pizza. either way, its effing delicious. . . whatever you do, you HAVE to order extra garlic on your pizza. it will be the best deep dish pizza you will ever have in your life.
