Restaurant: Mediterranean Grill
Category: Greek
VEGAN WET DREEAAAM.. When I go here they might as well send my food out in a trough. I always order 50 things off of the menu and the cashier always looks at me incredulously. Until I politely drop off my polished plate in the bus bin. . The best combination ever is greek potatoes dipped in hummus and smushed up falafel. NEVER EVER forget to buy the sweet tea aka ambrosia of the gods. They must brew that shit in a platinum teapot with only the finest of nectars. I love it. I love this place. I have eaten Mediterranean food across 3,000 miles of U.S. and for 12 bucks you cant beat the grill.. . PS. Â Remember to bring cash for tips, on the card printout there is no place for tips and you'll end up feeling like a scumbag when you use the 20 quarters from your car ashtray while apologizing to the staff...
