Tasty and fun. I went on a Tuesday evening, and there was a nice crowd.. . The music was a little bit loud, and the lighting was constantly adjusted, but those are the kind of things I tend to notice. I had the tartar burger, and it was great, with a side of onion rings that were a notch above standard.. . I appreciated that they put the milkshake in two smaller glasses when you say you are going to split a milkshake. I will probably go back here.
