You'd better be hungry if you go here! Â On the menu:. . Steak the size of your face. A cheese-stuffed baked potato. An entire head of broccoli. -No exaggeration!. The veggie option was a half pound of pasta with veggies. Literally. Maybe even more.. . PS, try a dirty gin marini, it's gooood.. . America, f*ck yeah!
