When you're bringing a group of 19 people to dinner, it would be extremely helpful to be able to make a reservation, but even with that many people, we weren't: we had to show up (several of us arrived early, to alert them to our number) and wait for everyone in our party to arrive.  Then, we had to wait for enough tables to empty to fit everyone.  . . Props to the hostess, who pulled me aside and said she needed my help, because a table of five just wouldn't leave.  She brought me in and loudly told me how we would move together a few tables, including the one the people were sitting at.  When they STILL wouldn't leave, she had us all come in and made it look like we were going to have to be separated.  The people left.  Mad props.. . Not so much selection for vegetarians, but I ended up splitting a goat cheese pizza (sans buffalo cheese) and a mushroom pizza, both of which were good.  The former had a lot of goat cheese and was extremely tangy due to it; the latter was extremely garlicky.  Nothing to write home about, but good.  My friends dug the food and drinks, one friend was given flan for her birthday, and the waitstaff was extremely patient with our large and noisy group, as well as efficient.
