Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
As Marge once said, "Don't fill up on the bread, Homie."  Vegetarians have no place in Fogo de Chao.  This is also not a place for a quiet, intimate dinner. Raucous, noisy and fun.  Expect both patrons and staff to bump your chair occasionally.  Take it all in stride and join the up-beat crowd.  . . Some of the meat products are a bit salty, but with a caipirina (or two, or more) the saltiness is balanced.  The caipirinas aren't the best, but they're good, quick to the table and do the trick.  . . The staff is top notch.  Fogo de Chao is a chain and benefits from the thorough training that chain restaurants provide.  Staff know their role and communicate well with customers and each other.
