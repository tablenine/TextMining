Restaurant: Doughboys Cafe
Category: Bakeries
Doughboys is an L.A. scenester restaurant, and if you can deal with the wait time and having some twit hover nearby your table you will discover that the reason everyone is there is the food. It's California caf, which means it's regular caf food with salads, sandwiches, entrees with gourmet additions like Gorgonzola and truffle oil, and bread with rosemary with roasted garlic. The wait staff tends to shop on Melrose and wear t-shirts that are a size too small. Very L.A. Average price for two people is about twenty five bucks before tip. (They expanded into the space next door and wait times have been significantly reduced.). Note, as of December 2006: Doughboys has remained a favorite destination for many months. Their beef chili is outstanding, and the after-school special of grilled cheese and tomato soup is one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. If Doughboys were any closer to my house, I'd eat here daily.
