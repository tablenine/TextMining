Loved it! . . From the moment we walked in I was "in love" . . The nautical decor is not overdone or overstated.. its perfect. . . The service was amazing and fast; but it is a bit loud in the back room. . . This may not be the best place for your first romantic evening together. . . We started with the poppers .. delicious and presented nicely. . . We both had the lobster sandwich.. heavenly! . . The bun is buttered, the fries are divine and the lemon sauce for the lobster is tangy. . . The beer selection is also adorable.. all beers have the nautical theme. . . I had the Whale Tale.. dry but tasty. . . The best part of the evening is the FREE chocolate mousse and the Fortune Fish. (I believe the mousse is free for all customers). . Fortune Fish is a paper fish you put in your hand to tell you future.. cute not cheesy. . . I would go back in a heartbeat.. great service, good prices and decor that is right on point!
