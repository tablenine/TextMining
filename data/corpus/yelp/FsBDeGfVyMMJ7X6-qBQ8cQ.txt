Porto's. What's the point of writing a review, seems like everyone's discovered this place already, at least judging from the insane crowdedness that's inside. And it's crowded all day, everyday now, so good luck getting there early.. . But the crowds are there for a reason: Porto's can do no wrong. Every single one of their baked goods is filled with such heavenly goodness that, for goodness sake, I can only describe these goodies as GOOD! (and also, nom nom nom!). Note that there is now a cafe adjacent to the bakery. I always go straight for the bakery and load up with box-fulls of baked goods (might as well get a lot since you'll have been waiting in line for a while).. . The essential: Cheese rolls. It's the closest Porto's has to a signature creation. They're flaky, sweet, and creamy. And it's so hard to stop yourself from eating them all. . . Meat pies and potato balls: Also incredibly good. The flaky, buttery crust of the meat pie, as well as the creamy mashed potato with a breaded exterior, both provide a perfect conveyance for the savory seasoned ground beef inside. Must try as well.. . Cream cheese and guava/strawberry pastries. These are also delicious. Flaky crust, sweet and creamy filling, what's not to love!. . And while you're at it, once you get up to the front of the bakery, just get whatever looks good. Hell, try one of each. It's hard to stop yourself. I say we replace the saying "kid in a candy store" with "yelper in Porto's Bakery"!
