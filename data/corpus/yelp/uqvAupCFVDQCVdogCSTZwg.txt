Restaurant: Gladys Knight and Ron Winans' Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Let me say this as bluntly as I can: if you do not feel this is a five star restaurant, get out, because your opinion is not wanted.  Okay, okay, I'm just kidding (maybe).  But seriously, this place is amazing.  I don't know how you can't like it!. . I LOVE chicken and waffles.  Such an amazing combo.  I have been to chicken and waffles places all over the country, from New York to California.  And NOBODY does it better than Gladys Knight's.  The waffle: crispy and flavorful.  The chicken: juicy and delicious.  The atmosphere: just cool.  The price: more than reasonable.. . This place is a must-visit if you're in the Atlanta area.  Great place to eat.  I can't speak highly enough of it.
