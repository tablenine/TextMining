i love everything about this place. the location is great. its high ceilling, well lit, simple chic dining area is flawless. the wait staff is well trainined professionals who take pride in what they do. Â the food is reasonable price and satisfying. actually the food is so so tasty. i would highly recommend the portobello mushroom fries on their tapas menu. the calamaris are whatevers nothing extraordinary.. The pizzas are delish and the sandwiches huge and flavorful.. . i brought two of my best students out for lunch to celebrate their excelling performance. at the end of the lunch, the manager came around to congratulate them and also brought them beautifully wrapped treat boxes. i thought that was a super nice gesture on their part.. . make sure to treat yourself to their macaroons. they will brighten up your day.
