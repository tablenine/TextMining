I don't get why this place gets more stars than other sushi restaurants in town.  There's really nothing special about this place.  Sushi's here were good but so do every other sushi restaurnts.  I wouldn't recommend ppl to wait 1-2hrs to get exactly the same stuff that you can get in other places without wasting your time waiting in line.. -1 star for waiting. -2 star for messing up my order (only got half of my order and the waitress didn't have a clue until I went thru my order with her and still, I never got my roll). -1 star for $2.50 parking fee
