yum yum yum!! first time there but my friend is a big fan. i like the seat yourself [ if you can] vibe. they dont have servers ,just bartenders and food runners, so you order at the bar. they have tons of beer on tap. i had the burger which was really good. we also got the cheese board which was really good. some guy next to me had the mushrooms and i was really close to stealing them. they smelled sooo good. good prices, good beer, good food. next time im in la ill be back!
