YUM! Chicken and waffles are on point-- washed down with some ice tea...I love their cornbread and sweet potato pie (and you better since it is four bucks a slice).  Whenever I am in the LA area I have to go here. IN ADDITION- expect to see some fitted and fine ass men in their three piece suits (thank you window view!) and women all dolled up in some killer cute pumps and outfits!  I think that is why I pretty much go to this location-- the food and the view... makes for a good trip back to norcal on a full stomach and some candy for the eyes
