Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
We hit up The Original (not the fake) El Taco tonight to grab some good Mexican food and margaritas, and we weren't disappointed.  Since we were at El Taco, we thought it appropriate to order... well... tacos.. . Best: Red Chili Steak.  . A Close Second: Fried Chicken.  . Others, Also Good: Shrimp, Pork Carnitas  . . According to the waiter, the fried chicken tacos are their most popular, but our table's consensus was that red chili steak is the way to go.  We also got the Surf 'n Turf fajitas, which were decent.  Their Mexican pizzas are gigantic (10 inch, if I remember correctly) and, according to others, good.  . . The margaritas were muy delicioso.  Top notch salt.  And there's not much you can mess up with a Tecate Tall Boy, short of serving it warm (which El Taco didn't.)  The Wheel of Fortune (tm) was spinning as we walked in on the hour.  If the wheel lands on the number you're given by the host as you're seated, you win.  We won a couple of Modelo pint glasses that we immediately poured our Tall Boys into.  . . We went to The Original El Taco for the food; we'll be returning for the food (tacos) and fun... beware of impostors.
