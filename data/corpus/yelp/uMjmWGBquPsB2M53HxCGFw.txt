Restaurant: Across the Street
Category: Mexican
This is my FAVORITE Mexican food restaurant in Atlanta, bar none.  It can be called "Mexican fusion" but it definitely is more Mexican than fusion.. . Absolute MUST have's for first timers:. - Shrimp enchilladas. - Chile Quiles (sp?). - Chimichanga. - Shrimp Fajitas. - Queso, Guac &amp; Salsa as starter. . The  house margarita, is wonderful as well. . . Their patio is superb overlooking the Decatur bike path and they just redid the entire bar area and it is spectacular.
