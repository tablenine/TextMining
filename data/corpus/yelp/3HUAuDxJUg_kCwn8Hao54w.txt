Great atmosphere; cool bar and it was nice &amp; warm with an old building kinda charm.  Located on Crescent Ave, not my favorite place to visit due to lots of traffic there because of all the bars and clubs, and annoying pay parking lots.. . We had a party of eight and were seated on the top floor.  It felt a bit crowded but luckily I was on the balcony side so it was cool looking down on the bar on the lower level.. . I started with some pino noir and the Low &amp; Slow Smoked Pork BBQ.  The Pork was a pretty tender and the BBQ flavor was nice and tangy.  Most of the menu items were southern Louisiana style, so I knew it all had to be tasty spicy tangy!  I had a bite of the Fried Green Tomatoes and the added goat cheese and sweet red pepper coulis was super delightful!  After that I had a big thirst for a Blonde Ale, but when I asked the waiter if they had any, all he could offer me was a Sweetwater 420; which is an extra pale ale and has no hint of golden blondness, but anyhow, I opted for a Hoegarden, can't go wrong with that crisp wheat beer!. . I'm not a big fan of Fried Chicken, but I was told that the Buttermilk Fried Chicken was to die for here.  So, yup, I'm glad I did that spin class before dinner, because it was nice and fried, but very scrumptious!  Paired with sautéed green beans, buttermilk whipped potatoes and bourbon gravy; the fried goodness was definitely something to die for.  :)  The buttermilk potatoes were especially rich and very good with the green beans.  This is a plate where I just wanted to mix everything together to have all the flavors at once!
