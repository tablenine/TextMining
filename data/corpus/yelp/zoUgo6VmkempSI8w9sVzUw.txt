burger = good. . sweet potato fries = OMG!!!. . beer = selection = sweeeet.... . price? = why this review gets a 4.. . worth check out out?!?!?! = HECK YEA!!!  . . if you want some of the best meat in town for a burger this is a good place to check out.  might seem like a place you dress up as a typical LA person to eat, but dang it's worth at least a bite.  the atmosphere is good, and the experience overall was a BIG part of why i was willing to pay and leave satisfied amounting to the 4.  if it were a bit cheaper than the 5 range would start kicking in... but bring 20 bucks... for yourself.  it's worth a treat.
