Fun times. Cheap beer, plasmas at all angles, and complete disregard for table manners. Shells and sauce will be everywhere since there are no plates and no way of disposing your shells. A group of four can share 3 lbs of crayfish if you're unsure of the portion. I'm assuming most people are like myself and have no idea what a pound of crayfish looks like. Spicy is spicy, but not Thai/Indian level spicy. Your fingers will smell delicious for the next 36 hours. Try not to consume.
