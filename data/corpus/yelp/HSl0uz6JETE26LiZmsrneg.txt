It was morning time, starving from sleep, Â and the lovely girlfriend had convinced me to try this place, even though we were on our way to my favorite cafe.. . First thing I said when I walked in: Geez, those paintings are so out of place. They had these brightly colored paintings by an artist named Michele. I liked the photo, though, above the fireplace. The wife status on the other hand? First words out of her mouth: "Love...I think bad things happen here at night." HAHA. She meant drinking and picking up ladies. Not sure what made her say that. Maybe the big bar area in the middle of the room?. . Anyhow, I ordered the sugar n' spice. It was quite the . http://bomb.com. . With an order of brioche french toast...which was great, as well, but for how tiny of a plate it is? Not worth 10 bucks. I ordered an english muffin to try to fill in this stomach of mine. Nomnom. The wife ordered a plate of breakfast melt. It looked amazing...and definitely had more food on it than mine did. The potatoes on the side were amazing. I'm not a fan of bacon so I didn't try the rest. . . Overall, the food was good. I just wish there was more for the price.
