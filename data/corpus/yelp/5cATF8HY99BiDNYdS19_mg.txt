Join the latest fad diet craze!  It's called the "Don't Get What You Ordered Diet!!!" Here's what you do:  order a bunch of food for delivery from Bossa Nova.  Then, when it arrives, there will be food for everyone in your party, except you!  Can you feel your waist whittling away???  Then, call Bossa Nova to alert them to the problem.  Don't worry, they will NOT accommodate your request.  Exert all your energy arguing with the chimpanzee on the other end of the line.  You are really burning a lot of calories now!  Ok, cool down.  What a great workout!  You're on your way, skinny mini!. . In all seriousness, Bossa Nova, let me share something you can learn from a little course called "Customer Service 101."  When your employees make a mistake, and you, as the manager, have to intervene, here's what you say, "I'm terribly sorry.  We'll get that food right out to you."  And then you bite the bullet on the $10.99 for the vegetable plate because you will have gained a customer for life.  Or, you could NOT do that and lose a customer for life, who will in turn tell everyone she knows NOT to go to Bossa Nova because they have atrocious customer service and an army of chimpanzees as employees.
