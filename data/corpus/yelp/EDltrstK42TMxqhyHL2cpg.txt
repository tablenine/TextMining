Restaurant: Twist A Tapas Cafe
Category: Tapas Bars
A note to the reviewers that say this place isn't authentic -- it isn't really trying to be.  The whole idea of the "twisted tapas" is that it incorporates multi-ethnic menu items.  I still think they do a pretty good job with the authentic Spanish tapas dishes, including the baked goat cheese, the bacon wrapped dates, and the stuffed mushrooms, among others.  But I think some of the more inventive menu items are what set Twist apart -- I LOVE the macaroni and cheese and also enjoy the lobster ravioli.  The guava sangria is yum, though I think it could be a tad stronger.. . Twist can get pretty crowded on the weekends, as the restaurant is very cute and small.  The little "tables" by the window are my favorite -- they are tiered and have little shelves to hold your many plates.  Try a weeknight to get seated faster, or call ahead or stop by to put your name in and visit a nearby bar while you wait.  The hostess will call you when your table is ready.  I've always had great service at Twist, in general.
