Restaurant: Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s Red Hot Stand
Category: Fast Food
Solid joint for dogs and those weird tamale things (those look nothing like the tamales I get at Mexican restaurants.). This place was really rocking when the old Thirsty Whale used to be next door , and I've only been back sporadically ever since the Whale became a friggin gas station. Look , every neighborhood has an old school hot dog stand , some better than others. Everybody will claim their hot dog place is the best , but the reality is they are all pretty much the same. That being said , this is a really good place. Great fries , great dogs , fountain soda , what else do you need?
