My review is based soley on the breakfast food here and coffee as I have not tried anything else. . . I MISS PMUC sooooo much. When I lived in Chicago I went here often. Banana nut french toast is to die for! Coffee rocks! Breakfast burritos HUGE and SO good!!! All breakfast is awesome, you can order it all day! . . I can't wait to visit soon so I can eat here!!! . . Service was never fabulous, but the food is by far 5 stars, so I rated based on that.
