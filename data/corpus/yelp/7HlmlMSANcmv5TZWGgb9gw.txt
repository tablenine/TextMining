Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
here's what you must do: come to las palmeras on a warm evening and sit on the patio.  be hungry!  the restaurant is hidden in a residential part of midtown and is full of neighbors/locals.  . . try the ropa vieja, the rotisserie chicken, the pork (lemony with sweet onions-my favorite), or guava shells for dessert.  las palmeras is small and family-owned, your waiters will become dear friends.
