Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
So.....I finally went to Osteria Mozza. The pizzeria is so damn good and my favorite spot in LA so I had really been dying to go. Took the girlfriend there on a Christmas Present date a little over a week ago and........ . Food: 7 stars. Waiter: 2 stars.. . If you go to the Osteria make sure you have some loot to burn and don't ask the waiter for any recommendations on wine because I think you can find the most expensive bottle and glass on your own. At first I thought the waiter was avoiding us because he thought we were cheap, but then I noticed the people around us were pissed, too. I couldn't believe it. I was so excited for the best place on earth (sorry Disney World) and this guy blew it. I know we're not Elvis Costello (we saw him, + one star) but the service wasn't even mediocre. Mario Batali would have bitch slapped this kid if he knew how he was representing Mozza. He was slow and a ghost and then he forgot to bring out our dessert coffee and Fernet Branca with our Chocolate Scotch cake!!!! Just forgot completely!!! The steak was brilliant and the salad was inspirational (yes a simple salad) and the burata/mozzarella sampler was fantastic, but the waiter was a stuck-up toolbag. Still gave it up four stars for my man Molto Mario, but I think I will stick with the Pizzeria......
