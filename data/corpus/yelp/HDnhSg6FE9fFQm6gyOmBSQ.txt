Expensive?  Yes.. . Worth it?  Totally.. . I heard about this restaurant years ago... finally went a year or so back and then kept on going back.. . Yeah yeah... there's a koi pond on the floor that runs like a river... that was kinda' cool.  What's more cool is the interior design of the place.  What's even more cool than that is the great bar with an awesome bartender.. . While you're waiting for your table, order the mango martini and ignore the snooty maitre d'.. . And if the maitre d' doesn't like the way you look, the bastard won't let you wear your jeans in.  Unless your someone famous.  Or wearing 7 Jeans.  Or if you give him a tip.. . But once you walk past the Gates of Snooty-Mc-Snoot, you enter a lush restaurant.  The seating makes me feel like I'm in a dream-like setting of some French influenced Vietnamese neighborhood.  It is a truly beautiful interior space.  . . The tables are spaced apart at a good distance and if you can, DEFINITELY sit upstairs.. . The wait staff is tip-top.  Be warned that when you ask for water, order the Chateau de Beverly Hills (aka: tap water), otherwise it's $8 a bottle for 1 litre of Fiji.. . Order everything... order anything... it's all good.  One thing that must be ordered is the famous garlic noodles.  You say you hate garlic?  Order it anyways.  I swear, they lace those home-made noodles with crack... 'cause once your done you'll want more.  Hell, order an extra plate to go.. . What's also great about this restaurant is that the chef/owner will come out and say hi to people at their tables and ask them how they are.  Just another nice touch to make the meal seem more special.. . Their website says it best: "In the end, there truly is a "Happy Ending.""
