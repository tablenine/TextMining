I've chosen Feed for brunch on multiple occasions. So, yay! I'm a fan.. . My tastes only really bring me here for brunch. Southern-style dinner isn't something that makes me start drooling, so I likely won't be visiting again for dinner. Either way, the rooster-themed atmosphere and tin roof motif set the mood quite well.. . Back on brunch though! My chilaquiles, a daily special, were far spicier than I expected and this was to my delight. While I was enjoying my course, I found my head spinning every time that my server brought out another dish. I will be back to try more of the menu items, so long as the specials don't keep distracting me.
