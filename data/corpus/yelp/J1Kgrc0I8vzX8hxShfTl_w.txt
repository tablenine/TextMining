Let me begin by saying that i'm a carnivore through and through.  i used to eat ludicrous amounts of meat - heck when some of us went to tony romas back in the day, 3 of us had the all you can eat ribs, and we seriously made our other not-as-robust carniverous friends sick by the sheer amount of bones that were piling up in front of them.  but i digress.  seriously though, as the years have past, my palette has become much more refined.  if i had come to this place, say between the age of 15 - 25, it would absolutely rate 5 stars. now.... . the good:  all you can eat = copious amounts of meat, good variety of meats. . the bad: every meat product tastes the same!  at some point, you are just gnawing on some ambiguous piece of dead mammal.  also, can't really get it cooked to my liking (medium rare) b/c the meat still cooks when it lands on your plate and if you are busy engaged with another piece, by the time you get to it, it has magically become well-done.. . the ugly: expensive.  much better places to spend that cash, like at korean bbq...mmmm...korean bbq...
