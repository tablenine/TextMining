Crispity.. Crunchity.. . Fried chicken and waffles.. . Weirdest combination ever, but this place makes it work. For alot of the items on the menu, they don't do substitutions or whatever. The wait to get in is pretty long, and they messed up with letting us in by calling out our leader's name with a party of 6 instead of 8, but a different group walked in of 6. Whatever.. . Good food though.
