WOW.... i didn't expect to like roscoe's because i thought...how good could chicken and waffle possibly be?. i was sooooo wrong.... first of all the sunrise- oj and lemonade was bomb.... it was so good.... I ordered the #13 [chicken breast and a waffle]. The fried chicken breast was super freaking good with the hot sauce.... and the waffle was uber yummy.... i am so glad that i finally went to get roscoes!!!!. but it was kind of pricey for fried chicken :?
