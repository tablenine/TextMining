I'm not a big fan of feeling like I'm not cool enough to dine somewhere and the people / wanna be watching is intense at Toast.  The food is relatively dependable, and reasonably priced, and the service is relatively quick, though more often than not the wait staff is a bit inattentive.  Perhaps they're too busy playing the game of "who's that sitting in my section"?  Parking is definitely a challenge on the week and weekend - you may have a good walk if you opt not to valet.  For a while this was a regular spot for a group of colleagues and I as Toast is close by the office, however Toast doesn't easily accommodate large parties (5 or more) and so the eight of us always got sat at exactly the same table - the one large rounder towards the rear of the restaurant.
