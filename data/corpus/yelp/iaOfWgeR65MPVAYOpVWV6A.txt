I've only gone here for their lunch buffet. But it is so good that I have been there 3 times in as many weeks (twice in Andersonville and once in the loop). Two of the times I've gone there it was on a Monday when they have half priced wine. Their house chardonnay was great and went really well with the dessert.. . I will have to say they have the best buffet in Chicago and I would recommend it to anyone.
