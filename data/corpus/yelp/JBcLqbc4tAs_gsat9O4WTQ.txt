Lovely pupusas.  I never had a pupusa before, and behold in on their storefront glass is a neon light advertising, 'pupusa'.  I've always wanted to try a pupusa, mainly because I like saying  'pupusa'.  I think I like saying the word pupusa more than actually eating a pupusa.   I had the pork &amp; cheese pupusa and the cheese &amp; herb pupusa, and really the cheese &amp; herb pupusa is the way to go.  And if you notice, the word 'pupusa' is in every sentence.  That's because I really like the word pupusa.
