The service is tops. Be prepared to be treated as a valued customer.. The owner/chief is a super nice guy, a great host, and  very creative.. . The food is great. Breakfast is the big deal here, but let me tell you that diner here can be down right amazing. . . The crowd is fairly local, and always great for people watching and making new friends.
