Restaurant: Caf√© Santorini
Category: Greek
Great ambiance. Sangria &amp; bread were good. Dessert was also very good. Service was horrible. Waiter didn't recommend anything. Just told us to look on the menu and pick what you like. Service was horrible. Waiter was treated us as invisible people. He didn't even come get the check. Main course (rissoto) was extremely salty and not edible. Has outside seating thought (but we weren't outside). Crowd was young and hip too. So don't go for the food... just have the bread and dessert and you'd be fine.
