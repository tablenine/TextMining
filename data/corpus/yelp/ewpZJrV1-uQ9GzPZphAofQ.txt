Definitely a cool looking place. A pretty good atmosphere for that neighborhood although yuppified, probably not more than the Gold Coast/Lincoln Park. . . It's one of very few sushi restaurants in the neighborhood (Thai Oscar being the other restaurant). The maki is pretty small but they have a pretty broad selection. They all sound good. I got the Crazy Eel and it was okay. I definitely had a "fishy taste" in my mouth afterwards. I've had better maki. . . The Edamame serving was small as well but you can't really screw up the taste of Edamame. . . I'd go back but you can have better sushi elsewhere for what you're paying here.
