Restaurant: Toast Bakery Cafe
Category: American (New)
When Toast first opened, there was a rumor among us NYC ex-pats that it was being run by the same delicious hands that brought us our beloved Magnolia Bakery. That this was ever true seems more and more dubious a claim. True, there are cupcakes to be bought that *look* a lot like Magnolia's, but a single bite tells you these are either Magnolia's 2-day-old leftovers, that much worse for the wear of shipping, or just crap LA imitations. . . Beside the disappointing cupcakes, there's a whole dining experience just waiting to bum you out. From the throngs of clueless hipster clones driving wait times into the stratosphere, to the often rude service, to the overpriced diner food that will, eventually, reach your table. . . Save yourself the time and frustration. The long line here is in no way an indication of desirability.
