Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
I wish Orange County had a deli that could come close to Canter's (yeah, Jerry's deli, not so much). Their reubens here are pure heaven. I've tried a reuben at Carnegie Deli in New York and it compare to Canter's perfection. Â The meat is piled so thick I can barely fit it into my mouth. And the pickles are perfect, a bit spicy and perfectly crisp. . Yeah service sucks here but that's all part of the experience so that's not an issue with me at all. I can't bear taking away a full star for this because the food is so good but be prepared this place is pricey! Its pretty hard to get out of there for under $25 a person.. Make sure to stop by the bakery and grab some cookies to go. They have a huge selection and they're all good.. PS: This place is extra awesome now that I know Guns N Roses hung out here all the time in the 80s.
