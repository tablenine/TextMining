I've been here twice for breakfast in the past month: a brunch on a Sunday and a Wed morning.. . The food is delicious and well presented.  The atmosphere and style of the restaurant are appealing.  I really like the open space and feel.. . The service was about average my fist visit and pretty poor the second.. I believe it was the first day for the server, and it really showed.  She made multiple mistakes and had a hard time remembering orders, or to bring items to the table.  My friend had to call over a manager in order to get her breakfast ... after mine was almost done.  When it was finally served, her food was cold.  Without asking for it, her breakfast item was 'comped': but then it should have been.. . Overall, I have to give high marks to the flavorful food, the great selection of pastries and the overall ambiance, fair to low marks must be given for the service.  Worth a try.
