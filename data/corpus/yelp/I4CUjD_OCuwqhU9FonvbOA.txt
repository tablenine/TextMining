Overall, I'd have to give this place 4 stars.  Very noisy.  However, the burger definitely deserves 4.5 stars, with half a star off for having too much mayo dressing on the burger itself.  The waiter admitted this at the end of the night when we talked to him about the burger, so a bit disappointed that it wasn't fixed before we were served the burgers.  Even so, my friend Melinda and I thought it was one of the best burgers we've had.  . . However, the burger definitely deserves its accolades for being one of the best.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked to a medium rare.  There is more than enough beef in this burger for you to truly taste the meat, and the burger is garnished with some sharp cheddar,  iceburg lettuce, and a mayo sauce.  The brioche bun pairs perfectly with the burger and provides a very satisfying experience.  Also, probably not talked about as much are how good their fries are that come with the burger.  Double fried-- and paired with a garlic aioli dipping sauce.  Perfection.. . I would come back here again, however, only if they go light on the mayo for me. :)  Oh, and look forward to a more in depth review soon on a new blog I plan to start with some friends!
