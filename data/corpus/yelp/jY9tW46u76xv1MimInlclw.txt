Came here hungry after apartment hunting with my prospective roommate at the time. I love eating with him, because he's open to all kinds of food, but is trying to eat less and less meat. I had seen this place on Yelp before, so I had been meaning to try it anyway.. . I didn't know what to drink, so the waitress suggested some kind of iced lavender tea with hibiscus or something like that. It was really refreshing and slightly sweet. Then she suggested a couple items on the menu, so I ordered the tamales. It was actually okay, but not delicious. However, I tried Jose's nachos, and they were REALLY good. They use cashew cheese instead of dairy cheese here, and it tastes reeeeeeeeally good. They should put that in the tamales. Yummy... it's a little on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it every once in a while. We both left full, so that's good. Definitely gotta come back to try more things, especially with cashew cheese.. . Oh wait, how can I forget? We had this yummy cake for dessert. It reminded me of carrot cake, but it had pineapple mixed in with a vegan frosting inbetween the layers of the cake. It hit the spot! Kudos to the waitress for recommending that.
