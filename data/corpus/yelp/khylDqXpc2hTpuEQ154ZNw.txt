I'd have to say Langer's has probably the best pastrami in Los Angeles.  I have had better in Portland...Kenny &amp; Zuke's pastrami &amp; egg salad sandwich is the mecca of pastrami sandwiches for me.  BUT, I had a great meal at Langer's today...a soup/half sammy combo which consisted of matzo ball soup, 2 delicious pickle pieces and half of the #19 (pastrami, swiss, coleslaw and russian dressing on rye).  The bread was great rye, with a nice crust that helped to hold the whole thing together.  The coleslaw was pretty good too, but I think next time I might try the sauerkraut on the sammy for an extra kick of flavor.  The pastrami was very tender and juicy...the pastrami side of the bread was getting nearly soggy as time went on (not a complaint).  My waiter was Greg, who was fantastic, very attentive, and one of those guys that's just so good at what he does...a multi tasker that was just fun to watch zoom around the place.. I might experiment next time and see if they can make a pastrami/egg salad sammy for me so I can do a proper comparison.  :)
