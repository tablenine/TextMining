Came back for the second time this past Thursday night for a friend's birthday.  Although we waited roughly 90 minutes for a table of 5, it was well worth the wait (even though towards the end, everyone started to get grumpy 'cause we were all starving).  SO FRIKKIN' YUMMY.  The things I would do to dine at Boiling Crab.... . Turns out one of my friends worked at Boiling Crab, so it was nice to have her as our server.  My friends and I ordered 4 lbs. of mild "Whole-Sha-Bang" shrimp, 1 lb. of clams, a dozen sausages, 2 baskets of mild Cajun fries, and a basket of mild Sweet Potato fries.  And that was just round 1.  Round 2, we got another pound of shrimp and another dozen of sausages.  Our lovely bill came out to the total of $110.. . I understand parking can be a hassle and the wait is pretty horrible, but I think if you come here every once in awhile, it's worth it.  I know someone who comes here at least once a week... and I would not do that.  Not only do I have better things to do with my time, but the food wouldn't be as good either.. . MY 3 MOST IMPORTANT TIPS:. - Try to come around 3:00 pm 'cause that's when they open and the wait is only about 10-15 minutes.. - If not, come about an hour before you know you're going to be hungry, so you don't get mad at the fact that you're waiting for so long.. - Also come with the understanding that there is horrible parking, so it won't get you in a bad mood.. . Do the above and you're promised to have a good time!
