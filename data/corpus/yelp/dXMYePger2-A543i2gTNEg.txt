Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
Eleven City Diner is a very welcome addition to the South Loop neighborhood.  I can't get enough of the latke!  They are thick, crispy, and very flavorful.  The sandwiches are too big for my taste (especially the open-faced reuben), but I like that I can order a simple pastrami sandwich (on their very yummy challah bread) or a variety of breakfast fare- all day and late into the night.  Bring your hungry friends to enjoy this modern diner.
