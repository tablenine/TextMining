I must admit that I like the old place on the cliff off Sunset better.  But, the food here is just as savory and fabulous as always.  I visited recently on Friday for lunch (great time for star watching as the patio is reserved seating for their Friday luncheons).  I had the veal meatballs with the homemade spaghetti that was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.  The beet salad is so beautifully presented (like slices of layer cake) that you just MUST TRY that (particularly if you are a beet fan ... which I am WILD for beets, I must say).  I had his pan-brasied chicken with wild mushrooms and mashed potatoes. I think it was one of the best chicken dishes that I have ever had (and given ALL that's been put into my mouth ... that's saying a LOT).  I wanted to like the sauce off the plate.  It was easily as good as any outstanding French bistro or brasserie will do it).. . If' you find yourself IN BH ... EAT HERE!!!!
