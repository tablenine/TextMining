Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pinks is great!  That is if your starving after shopping on Melrose and you're wanting something fairly quick (I use that term loosely, since it really depends on when you go), fairly easy, and hey might as well hope to see some star right?  I mean you are in LA..... . They have plenty special hotdogs and if you wanted to, you could eat a different hot dog for 30 days.  That's about how many different hot dogs they have.. . I've had their Patt Morrison (yeah yeah I know, the only non meat thing there.) and it wasn't anything specatular neither was the Planet Hollywood dog.  I've also had their onion rings and nacho chili cheese fries, and again no sparks.  My friend swears by their chili dogs (what they're known for) and plenty others I know like their Chicago and Jalapeno dog. Its fun to go with your friends and watch them change their order about a million times while you wait in line for almost eternity it seems like (at least when you're starving).  . . I'm not too much of a fan of Pinks.  I would rather get a 1.50 polish sausage with a soda at Costco with no more than a 5 minute wait.  It tastes the same to me...then again I'm not a hot dog connoisseur. . I wouldn't knock it before you try it.  You definitely should try it at least once.  Then if you don't like it, then you can say you actually don't, not just because you think its overrated.
