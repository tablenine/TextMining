Wow, again I say wow!  The #19 is so good that I cant imagine ever going in here and getting anything else.  I took my 2 kids last week to get their opinion and both a 16 year old girl and a 13 year old boy proclaimed that it was the best sandwich they have ever had.  Run dont walk to this legend in LA.  Yes a man was being arrested out in front but thats par for the course in this neighborhood.  Enjoy!
