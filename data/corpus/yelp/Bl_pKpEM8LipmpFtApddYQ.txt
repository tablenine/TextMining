You have gotta be out of your mind and poisoned in the front teeth to be not giving this place 5 stars.. . I must say I have NEVER been here outside of the 1/2 off maki hours. But why the hoop should I do that... They have a very nice list of half priced maki's, rolls that are normally 14 dollars are just 7, and this stuff contains variations with jalapeno's, strawberries, peanuts, mayo, green beans, etc.. . . Don't care about drinks, service, low key atmosphere, these guys know how to prepare a good sushi meal. I hear it turns into a lounge-y space at nights, with house/electro playing and stuff, but seriously why go splash much more when you can go for half price even on weekends.. . These guys were recently voted runners-up in Reader's best sushi category, and damn right they did!
