Wow! This is damn good BBQ! At first I was like Korean BBQ in a taco truck? That doesn't sound right but chicken and waffles didn't sound right either and I love em so I figured why not? . . First try was in front of the Golden Gohper...we waited about 30 minutes and had moved like 2 feet. Speaking of 2 feet...my two feet in my Jimmy Choos were not okay so we said F-it and went to the GG and had a cocktail instead. . . Second try. We were trying to follow them on Twitter and there were no updates. It said they were leaving DT at 7. This was after 11 now and we had given up. Something said let's just see if the are still there and THEY WERE! Sneaky hiders! . . Spicy pork tacos, short rib burrito and a kimchi quesadilla (it was a special) and 2 cokes for 16 buckaroos! Joy and I snarfed it down and I was in Kogi heaven! I can't wait to go again! . . Hopefully they will be easier to find and I'll be wearing comfortable shoes from now on! . . ~ Note: I reeked of garlic for like 2 days. Listerine didn't do $hit against Kogi!
