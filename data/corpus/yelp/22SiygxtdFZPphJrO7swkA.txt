HOLY EXPENSIVE, Batman! I was fortunate enough to have eaten here for free one evening a few years back -- the tab was picked up by some company that was trying to schmooze my former employer. The restaurant itself is amazing, with water flowing under your feet on the first floor and a great overhead view from the second floor. The open-air design of the building and the tasteful decor set the mood for what will most likely be one of L.A.'s top "Pan-Asian"/seafood restaurants. The service was impeccable, even for our high-maintenance party of about 8 or so. The food was delicious -- try as many different things as you can if you get the chance. Crustacean also has a very impressive cognac / brandy / rum selection in their dessert menu for smooth sipping as you reflect back on the one or two C-notes you just dropped on dinner. Enjoy!
