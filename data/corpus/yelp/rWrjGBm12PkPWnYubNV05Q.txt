I'm so happy to see this place in Decatur getting so much love on Yelp! I have been twice now and can say I really like it! I went on opening day, after much talk on a Yelp thread and thought it was good. I don't normally go to places on opening day and don't really feel you can give a fair review of a place on it's opening day, but that is just my opinion. . . I'm a simple girl when it comes to a burger. Medium rare, cheddar cheese, onions and ketchup, so I am very happy with the basic burger here. I also really like their fries (remind me of Five Guys) and also enjoy the onion rings. . . I hope they figure out a better way to take orders then the system they have now, as it can take a long time and most folks can't wait that long at lunch. As others have mentioned parking is tough at this spot. They share space with Watershed and have TDS right across the street. Lucky for me I can walk there! Maybe I should offer shuttle service for free food...what do you think? :o)
