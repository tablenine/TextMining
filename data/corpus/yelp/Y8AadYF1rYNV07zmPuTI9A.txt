This place used to be very good.  But over the years, I feel like it's lost it's touch.  The service gets worse and slower.  Everything is overpriced.  If you get something, I would suggest getting something from their breakfast menu. FYI - the "juicy" brisket they advertise..it's dry...Also, I've tried giving them the benefit of the doubt with their cabbage soup...everytime they disappoint.  It's always cold.  That doesn't work too well when you put in the sour cream.
