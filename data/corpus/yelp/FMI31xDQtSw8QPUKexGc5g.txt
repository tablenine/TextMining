First time - five stars.  Absolutely excellent food; the secret kitchen menu is phenomenal, the ambience was great, and service was impeccable.  Above average wine list.  Had all courses and everything was excellent.. . Second time, I went with my family who is the opposite of pretentious, so they sat us in their bar area looking out onto the street.  Service not quite as good there.
