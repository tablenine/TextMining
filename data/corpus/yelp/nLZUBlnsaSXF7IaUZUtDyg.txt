I used to like this spot for brunch but I've been here a few times now and I've reversed field. This opinion was solidified after my experience this past Sunday after the Shamrock Shuffle. After the race, we dropped by for some brunch. It was seemingly not at all crowded. We walked in to find many tables available, from the looks of it. Still, we were told the wait would be 30 minutes. We were cool with this as it's standard operating procedure at nearly every brunch spot in Wicker Park. . . However, we watched as tables were vacated and we still weren't seated 45 minutes later. An inquiry with the host revealed a policy of "not seating anyone who didn't have reservations" due to the kitchen being "slammed". With a half full restaurant this was hard to fathom. We were finally seated after a 50 minute wait and treated to the same menu that has been in place since the joint opened and exceedingly slow service. The chicken sandwich was tired, the pizza was burnt. The mimosa and bloody mary flights are always on point, but they need to be to survive an experience like this. . . After a 3 hour brunch that should have taken 45 minutes, my companion summed it up best by saying just after the bill was paid, "let's end this tragedy". I am in no rush to start up another one.
