For a while when I lived nearby I would run past this place as they took FOREVER to build it.  And they had all these window signs about fresh organic blah blah blah.  It was sort of cute, but I wanted to eat the food already, enough with the teasing!  Anyway, they have long since opened.  Hooray.  So my friend and I went on a Sunday evening to bemoan the fact that we had to work the next day.  And what a lovely place to do that!  . . Our service was that perfect mix of attentive enough to get a new round of beers in good time and laid back enough to let us linger and chat.  And the beer selection is full of yummy yummy beers.  I had the pepperonata and also tried a slice of my friend's italian sausage.  Both delicious.. . I'm so glad the teasing is over!
