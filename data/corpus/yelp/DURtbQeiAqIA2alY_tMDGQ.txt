Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Disaster, Dichotomy, Depressing, Damn. . I am not usually one to follow the crowd, but when it comes to food, a long line is usually a harbinger of good things to come.. . Not at Tito's.. . Why so many people line up for generic, greasy, and gross tacos that have no flavor astounds me. If a restaurant ever displayed signs of suffering from abusive spouse syndrome this one takes it. People must realize how bad the food is, yet they keep coming back.. . Tito's was at the top of my Â "why haven't I ever eaten there" list and after ordering 3 tacos, a chicken tamale and a root beer I was able to cross it off.. . The tacos have absolutely no flavor and talk about mystery meat, it's more of a paste and shares no resemblance no any meat you'd find in a decent taco.. . The Salsa is pretty much just pureed tomatoes, I'd rather smother my tacos in V-8 juice. . . No. gracias.
