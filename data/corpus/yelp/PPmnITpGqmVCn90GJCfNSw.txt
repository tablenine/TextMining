Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
Too expensive and the food is nothing to write home about.. . I'm very picky about my Mexican food and De Cero's food leaves much to be desired.  There are much better Mexican restaurants in the city, for example Zocalo.. . De Cero's food is bland, overpriced, and very small portions.. . Luckily work picked up the tab.  Never going back, spend your money elsewhere.
