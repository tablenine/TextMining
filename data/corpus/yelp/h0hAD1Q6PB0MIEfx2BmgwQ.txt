Restaurant: Ri Ra Irish Pub
Category: Irish
I am sure it is no surprise that I am a fan of this Irish pub. Especially since it is no secret that I am a fan of all Irish Pubs, but for Ri Ra there is even more of a soft spot in my heart. . . Why such a soft spot for Ri Ra, you ask? Well, I am so bored with the cold, contemporary slate gray, cement decor in all the other Midtown Bars. Ri Ra is warm and inviting with the traditional sculpted, dark wood with green and gold trim. I appreciate that I can look anywhere in the room and there is something unique and interesting. Oh and I especially appreciated that the eye candy is abundant. . . Came here for a quick bite with a few of the girls and had a pleasant time. Sadly, I really was not impressed with the food. I had a Club Chicken Salad and it was nothing special. I would have preferred the dressing on the side, rather than the entire dish being doused. The dressing was lacking flavor and pretty much just created a soggy salad. On the positive it was a healthy serving and very filling. Too bad it was such a forgettable meal. . . What was not forgettable was the hottie fireman that was sitting at the table behind one of my friends. Seeing a hot, straight man in Midtown is indeed a rare sight. He probably would have made the most spectacular salad forgettable, which means I will have to give the menu another try. . . This Irish pub has a warm, inviting atmosphere, not to mention (again) with an abundance of straight men. Who cares about the food, I will be feasting with my eyes!
