I've been here twice, and both times, it was because my sister absolutely adores their spicy bean curd.  She says that nothing else comes close to this stuff, and that it reminds her of the good old days of eating duck meat.  Mmmmm.  I guess I'm fortunate enough to be able to eat the real thing...though not as often as I would like.  Uh oh, I am craving duck now!  . . It's a pretty busy place, but it didn't take too long to get our food.  I ordered a noodle soup, and it was good.  Hey, I can't complain about food really, because I love food.  I also liked their pork sausages...in fact, so much that we bought some prep-packaged ones to-go.  =)  . . As for the shaved ice, yes, be prepared for the giant mound of ice and some toppings of your choice!  =)  I don't find that this place is "healthy" as there are plenty of fried foods on the menu, but yeah, good menu size, so good options, and again, if I never cared about what I ate (for health purposes) I would eat EVERYTHING in sight...=P
