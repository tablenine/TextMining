I see a lot of 3s and 4s here and I usually get slammed for rating too low.  Well here is a 5 for you Watershed! . . I'm not sure if my expectations were so low or that I had been so unimpressed with my previous visit years ago, but Watershed's food blew me away.  . . I had heard so much about this famous Fried Chicken on Tuesday.  Seriously, how good could it be?  I was proven wrong.  The chicken lived up to the hype.  Of course, I happened to get there fairly early and not have to stand with the grumpy people outside who may or may not land a plate of the chicken, but I thought it was a really great experience.. . My friend and I sat at the bar and the service was wonderful as well.  The bartender explained in detail how the chicken was made, although I can't really recall the whole process since I was devouring this perfectly golden dish.  The chicken was evenly cooked and was perfectly seasoned.  The veggies and mash potatoes were beautifully presented and delicious as well.. . Don't worry, I'm not just judging based on the chicken.  My friend's dish was good as well and dessert, though simple, was a winner.. . Go on a Tuesday when you get off relatively early.  Every Atlantan should try!  Best fried chicken in Atlanta.
