Have eaten here since they opened and get irritated every time.. Good food but worst, most incompetent service around! And occasional attitude! If you think you're being smart by sittin at counter to cut the line, think again.. Tonight we waitied over 20 minutes for someone to take our order.. Had to abandon the food to catch a movie. Clueless and slow servers!
