Started out night liking this place very much, but I had given it a second try and it grew on me. The Swirl (1/2 Margarita &amp; 1/2 Sangria) is great and packs a punch. The veggie tamales are really good and so are the quesadillas. Always have great service. The first time I thought the food was just average - but it has improved greatly since my first visit, and is worth the price. Can get crowded and sometimes the wait can be an hour or 1 1/2 hours long. I personally wouldn't wait that long unless your ready to pony up to the bar!
