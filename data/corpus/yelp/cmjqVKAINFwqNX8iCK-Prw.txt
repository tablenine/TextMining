I think I ordered a burger. Cheeseburger. It was... meh.. . The service, however, is what got them 1 star. SUPER rude servers. I don't even remember the food because the servers pissed me off so much.. . Someone below said it best... . . "No matter who you are YOU are not good enough to be here! The waitstaff is too good for you my friend. Too cool and edgy to serve you."
