I came down to LA to visit some friends and we all decided to eat here. The decor in the inside was definitely interesting. There were booths that were like tents. It looks pretty intimate. . . The lounge area in the bathroom had a crazy looking chair that stated if this chair is comfortable...you're pregnant. Good thing it felt UNcomfortable. . . Its a good place to eat if you like GARLIC :) I had some decent ravioli but I enjoyed tasting my other friends' food. Larry had a roasted rabbit. It was my first time trying rabbit...It tasted like chicken!
