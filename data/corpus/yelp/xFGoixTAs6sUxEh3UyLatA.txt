We had heard so many good things about this place I don't know what took us so long to try it. We went for dinner just before the holidays with some out of town friends. And because we loved it so much then took my parents there for a pre-Thanksgiving meal. Both times were great! Great atmosphere...great decor...nice to have live music. Someone compared it to Anthropology and i would say that's a pretty good description...eclectic, fun and somehow pretty romantic.. On our first visit we had the fried okra eggplant etc app and loved it...tasty naughty treat. Also tried the sausage trio...yum. For our main course my hubby had the burger with fried oysters...he was kind enough to let me try it and OMG! Mine was ok...i was looking forward to the Brussels sprouts except they were served cold...i think intentionally...not what I expected. Our friends had the pork leg...i think that's what it was...looked great...good crispy skin...tender meat...they were very happy!. The next visit was even better. Dad had the burger...still as good as the last time...my mom and I had the trout with the hoppin johns...which neither of us had ever had. she was in heaven...it was very good...I thought they seemed a bit salty but all together it was excellent. My hubby had the catfish...i thought was bland but he thought it was delicious. I felt the best part of his dish was the corn succotash that accompanied it. . Haven't tried the down stairs area yet and still would love to go for brunch.. . All in all this is one of our faves in Atlanta!
