If you like chicken, breasts, and sandwiches, you must try one thing: the Spicy Chicken Breast sandwich.  Order it on a potato bun and ask them to sub the fries for a salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  The magic in the sandwich, I suspect, lies in the cajun aioli.  I don't care if you're on your most serious diet ever-- don't tell them to hold it.  Enjoy now.  Thank me later.
