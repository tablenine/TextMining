If you and your friends are looking to jam up a busy city intersection on a Â weekend night by having your taxi stop in the middle of a street, and then dig out some crumpled $1 bills out of your jeans to pay the cabbie, only to laugh carefree as you dodge pissed off drivers honking at you, then The Adobo Grill in Old Town is for you!. . Best guacamole in the city, as far as I'm concerned, assuming that you get at least medium, preferably hot.. . The bar is more reliable than the kitchen (but I mean, really, where isn't the bar more reliable?). Me gusta margaritas!
