I've been a take-out customer for years until their sandwiches started becoming smaller and blander, and their dine-in service started to suck harder. That grandpa behind the counter sure gives a mean attitude when you ask him to add some cheese on your 'wich, sheesh... and forget about asking him for a side of pickles! So what if they are 24/7? So is Jerry's.. . Now for some shameless propaganda:. . CANTer's CAN'T make good sandwiches anymore.. Canter's is overpriced and impersonal.. Jerry's (insert greater than sign prohibited by Yelp) Canter's
