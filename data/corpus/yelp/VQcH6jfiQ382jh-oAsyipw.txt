Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
they start you off with some bread &amp; olive oil/balsamic vinegar. i love that stuff.. . the restaurant was reminiscent of Bossa Nova on Sunset, but i like Bossa Nova better. i know one is more geared toward brazilian food (bossa nova) and the other, argentinian food (lala's), but they had the same feel to me. . . i had the al champignon--chicken with mushrooms and some sauce. my other had had the milanesa napolitana--skirt steak, lightly breaded with some mashed potatoes and a tomato sauce. both were ok. they could've kicked up the flavor a notch or 2. . . on a lighter note, the service was pretty good and there's ample street parking if you look a round.
