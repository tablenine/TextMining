Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
I came here for lunch with my girlfriend and a buddy. I knew the lunch and dinner had identical menus but lunch is only $34.50!!!. . Everything was delicious. In comparison with the Fogo in Dallas, they are exactly the same. No complaints. I def recommend coming for lunch.
