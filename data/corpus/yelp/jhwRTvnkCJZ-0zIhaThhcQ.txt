Restaurant: Zocalo Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
Mexican places are one of my favorite spots. Its automatic chips and salsa. You can always make a cheap meal with just beans, rice and guac. Zocalo is nothing different. I've been twice within the past week but only for lunch. The salsa is good, the vegetarian tacos and quesedilias (shrooms and cheese) are mui fantastico. Only drawback is my bill was doubled with one modelo especial. No try on their famous margs yet but will at somepoint. Service is average. Their english is simple but with a smile so its all good.
