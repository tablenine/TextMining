Restaurant: Italian Village
Category: Nightlife
I came here Tuesday night for dinner before a show at the Chicago Symphony. . There are 3 different restaurants inside one ----in the basement is la Cantina,  main floor is Viviere  and top floor is The Village. . My friend and I ate at the The Village on the top floor.. We both ordered the same items of the menu. She copied me.. . We had the  Agnolotti--- supposed homemade cheese spinach filled pasta in tomato basil sauce. Pretty much a big spinach pierogi covered in tomato sauce. It was good, very generous portion. Each entree included soup or salad. We chose the salad with vinaigrette. It was very good but we each got only ONE cherry tomato.. Bread was excellent. I loved the bread.. . Service was very attentive. Waiter very cute however I got the feeling the restaurant was trying to pass this cute boy as an Italian while I am pretty sure he was Spanish.. . Decor is  very romantic. The string of lights around the restaurant really makes the mood. Must visit just once.
