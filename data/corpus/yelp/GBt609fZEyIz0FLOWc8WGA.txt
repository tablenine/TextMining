Generic pan-asian cuisine; however, the smoothies are absolutely amazing and will keep me coming back -- if only for the smoothies.  The smoothies are probably the best in the city.  My personal favorites are taro or avocado with tapioca pearls. . As food goes, the green curry stands out, as well as the japanese tofu with two mushrooms.
