Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Amazing!!! Fast and attentive tag-team service. Cheap and overly generous portioned food. Two people could share a $7 dish. Joys is also BYOB, so you can bring your own drinks if you'd like. They also have alfresco dining during the spring, summer and fall, which is quite delightful. If your in the mood for asian noodles, I highly recommend Joys! Always flavorful! Pouket Noodles, Crazy Noodles and baby egg-rolls are always my favorites. There were a few nights I trekked a couple miles in below zero snowy weather for some joys...totally necessary!
