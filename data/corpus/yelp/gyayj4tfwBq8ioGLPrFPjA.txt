This place is awesome; totally glad I ate here for dinner instead of Wienerschnitzel. Talk about an upgrade! . . The menu is pretty extensive; you'll be looking at it for 5 minutes before deciding on what sausage you want to eat. Good selection! Sausages of many shapes and sizes here! The exotic sausages are excellent! I don't like gamey meat but this place made them delicious from the bites I had. Plus how many times can you say you've eaten alligator? Try it! . . The fries are big, fat, and crispy, bot not too potatoey which I liked. You won't struggle finishing them. You get to choose 2 dipping sauces for your fries and there are some crazy ones; curry ketchup, pesto mayo, etc. And I just read from another review that the fries are cooked with white truffle oil - that makes me feel classy that I ate them. . . Finally I must comment on the place itself. This place is a true hidden gem, when I got out of the car I asked "..so where is it?" But once you get inside, it's really cool. Not too sure how to describe it besides the lights being dim and the seating was like eating lunch in a grade school cafeteria. The customers here look cool, I got hipster vibes from everyone here. I thought all of it was just really neat!. . The whole back menu is beer but since I already have a beer belly I didn't drink any, plus I'm not 21 anyways. . . Woohoo for Wurstkuche!!!
