Langers is just flat out stupid.  Stupid equals ridiculous.  Don't try and out think the room just get the pastrami and call it a day.  Don't order one of those dumb sissy combo sandwiches with cheese and cole slaw and dressing and the kitchen sink.  . . Pastrami, rye bread and mustard - thats all.  Pickles on the side.  If you're really hungry fries or a round knish to share. . . But if you really don't like pastrami then get the corned beef hash.  I love corned beef hash and this is the best I've ever had anywhere hands down, home made or from a can.  I love Hormel.  The corned beef hash comes with 3 eggs, a mound of crispy home fries and rye toast.  At $8.99 this is some deal.
