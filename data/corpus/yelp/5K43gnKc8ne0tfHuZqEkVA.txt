We stumbled into Feast while trying to find Wicker Park Fest and decided to grab dinner here after the festival.  I'm glad we did since the food here was AMAZING!  . . There are a lot of items to select from on the menu ranging from complete entrees to a turkey burger.  The prices are not too expensive and the portions are rather large so you definitely get your monies worth. . . The Pomegranate Martini was really good and tasted just like a glass of pomegranate juice.  David ordered the chicken stuffed with goat cheese and I decided to eat light and get the chopped salad with sliced chicken.  We both agreed that the food was excellent!  . . Service was good as well and they have a really great outside patio seating area to enjoy when the weather is nice.  I highly recommend this place for anyone in the area!
