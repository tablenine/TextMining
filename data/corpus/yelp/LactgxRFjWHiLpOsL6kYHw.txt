Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
so for years i've been hearing middle aged women tell me uncle julio's is the greatest place in town. they LOVE it. Â i finally went. . . The chips were weak. they broke into bits in their even weaker salsa. But both were over shadowed by my daiquiri... which was pretty much just frozen strawberry puree. We got a combo chicken/pork tamle plate that was really good, but the "carne salsa" is clearly just chili. . . I got the shrimp special with chipotle/lime sauce on top of corn,cilantro and pineapple rice. totally unimpressed. there was no flavor. i had to stop eating it. . they ended up giving us free desert, which was nice, but it was just a ton of fried dough with hot honey to dip it in... nothing special.. . As if the food wasn't bad enough when i got home... i had to sit on the toilet for about 20 minutes to recover i didn't even get sick in MEXICO... i got sick here.. . i will not be going back.... . I will say however, that they had great service and everyone was super nice- just lousy food.
