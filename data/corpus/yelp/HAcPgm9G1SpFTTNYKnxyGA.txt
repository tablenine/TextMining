The other day I made a Greek spinach pie (aka "spanakopita"), a vegan version made with tofu instead of the feta, painstakingly applying olive oil with a pastry brush to the phyllo dough, and the filling included a lovely blend of spinach, and dill, and garlic, lemon, and ground walnuts.  I folded each piece into a triangle, being careful not to let the phyllo dough tear.  The triangles baked up nice and crispy, with a warm, tasty filling.. . Spanakopita happens to be one of my favorite dishes, so, even though I had made it just the other day, I still couldn't resist ordering it tonight.  Unfortunately, it was a major disappointment.  The filling seemed mushy and left a bad aftertaste.  The dill makes the spanakopita -- and if not that, the crispy, delicious phyllo dough.  The dill in this dish wasn't very prominent, and there weren't enough layers of the phyllo dough.  I got it with the dill rice, which resulted in a HUGE portion.  My friend and I also tried the flaming cheese (saganaki) -- the waiter gave a rather lackluster presentation, and the cheese was not at all melty.  . . I did like the pita bread served as soon as we sat down at the table.  It was warm and tasty, and my friend and I wondered if it was housemade.
