They get 5 stars for the Cinnamon rolls!  Best in the city hands down.   . . I honestly dont think the food is all that great, but back when I lived in Hyde Park me and my friends would always just chill in this place and mark up the tables and walls.   . . Milk Shakes are also good (I have a serious sweet tooth)
