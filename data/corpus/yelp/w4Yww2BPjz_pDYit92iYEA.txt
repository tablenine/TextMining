Good old Rodan, the place that never fails to make me happy. Why you ask? Well, just because it's chill, cool, they have good food, drinks, and music. I guess it is my version of cheers, but way more hipster ;) Don't get me wrong, not every night here is perfection, sometimes it is so packed and the music is off, but for the most part, this is my favorite bar in chicago. I have been coming here about 4 or 5 years since it opened.
