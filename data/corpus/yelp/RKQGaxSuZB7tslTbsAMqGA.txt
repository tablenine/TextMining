Restaurant: Daily Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Pubs
The Daily Bar and Grill is sort of a "meh" sort of place in Lincoln Square. I've been here a few times, and it's pretty good if you're looking for standard American fare.. . I've had a few of the sandwiches and salads here, and they were good...nothing stands out as amazing but they did the trick. This is a fun place to eat outside if the weather is nice, because you're not right on the street but you can still feel a part of the square. . . I DON'T recommend the martinis here. I ordered one once and it was a terrible mistake. It honestly tasted AWFUL...I sent Â it back because it was literally undrinkable, and the waitress looked like she wanted to smack me. I always feel bad sending things back, and only do when absolutely necessary.. . The Daily Grill is good in a pinch, but I'd recommend going to one of the other many restaurants in the square.
