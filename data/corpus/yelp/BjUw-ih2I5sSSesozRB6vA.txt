I love this place. I went to the one in D.C. and loved it but this one in L.A. is jsut as good! MEAT MEAT MEAT!!! I am a steak lover and this restaurant has not disappointed me yet. I love that you can choose from the variety of meat and cuts. Each type of meat has a different flavor! I also love their appetizer bar. The service is fine (theyre always busy so they cant just wait on just your table all night). But overall I come for the food. Its like a gourmet buffet but instead of you going to it, it comes to you! :)
