Waited in line for [wayyyy] too long when it first started coming to Santa Ana. Partly because the truck had run into legal difficulties and partly because there were so many people. . . I'll wait in line for however long for anything that's worth it...I don't think it's worth it to wait more than 15-20 minutes for Kogi BUT if it's your first time then I say go for it, just so you'll know what it tastes like. There are other places to get it without waiting in line (Alibi Room) so there's always that option, but it's a little more expensive.. . Tacos are extremely flavorful and very delicious, but REAL Mexican food will always be my #1. They change their menu around pretty often which I think is pretty cool. Oh, and I also remember reading that one of the co-owners is Filipino but he married a Korean? Pretty cool... he should definitely think about "sisig" tacos or tocino burritos in the future haha. Now THAT would be awesome.
