All You Can Eat = Poor Quality. . . DUH. . . Sure, you can eat an endless amount of beef, chicken, pork, tongue, etc, but this is probably the worst quality you'll ever have. You might as well chew on a rubber toy. But shouldn't you expect that from all you can eat places? It's not like it's the Bellagio or Wynn Buffets in Las Vegas - for those, you pay for what you get. It's expensive, but the quality is better! . . The best part about Manna = the rice. That's not a compliment, either! . . MY ADVICE - Spend that $18 on a regular meal in K-Town. You won't get as much food (but a good amount) but of course, it's gonna be better quality!
