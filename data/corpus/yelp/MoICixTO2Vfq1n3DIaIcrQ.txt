Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I cant dump on this place, but I cant praise it too much either. The food is pleasantly average. Some meals I've had there have been good, (pair the steak sandwich with a Chipolte Bloody Mary for the ultimate hangover cure) but the breakfast dishes leave me kinda cold- the egg dishes are just a mushy mess of eggs and whatever stuff (spinach, bbq chicken, etc) the kitchen decides to throw in. Also I have never seen anyone caramelize the cheese on a tuna melt.... The atmosphere is cheery and the staff is friendly--- I just think the place is somewhat overrated, especially when you consider the long lines on the weekends.. . EDIT: I dont know why i was so hard on this place. The food and service is consistently good, deserves another star.
