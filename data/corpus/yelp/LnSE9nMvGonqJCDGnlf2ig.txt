We went there last weekend and the restaurant was already packed at 6:30, but if you have a reservation, you'll be seated right away. There is a great salad bar with a lot of choices (do try the fresh Mozzarella balls), but nothing you have to have if you want to save room for the meats. Flip your coaster to green when you're ready to chow down and friendly servers will bring different types of meat to your table, you tell them what temperature you like and how much you would like; If they didn't have your temperature of choice, they always return with it in a speedy fashion. Everything is pretty tasty in general but I personally love the Ribeye and the lamb chops. Flip your coaster to red if you're done or need to take a break. There are different side dishes on your table for you to munch on in between the meats. The staffs are wonderful, they're very attentive and your side dishes/drinks are always filled before it reaches empty without you asking. My friend ate so much I think he was sweating meat. . . Dinner is $48.50 per person ($24.50 if you're just having salads, but why......) Reservation is strongly recommended. Valet and self-parking are both available. . . In the words of Joey Tribbiani: " What's not to like? meat gooood." . . (Do pace yourself or you might need your server to grease the bottom of your chair to roll you out of there...)
