After my most recent visit I realized that LA has too many quality sushi joints for Sushi-Gen to stand out.  Heck even the Little Tokyo area has several quality sushi joints.  I definitely feel you can get equal or better quality elsewhere including Mako, Hama, Komasa, or Hirozen for either larger portions with comparable prices or similar portions for cheaper prices.   . . Ordered the uni, aji, albacore, toro, japanese snapper, kanpachi, ama ebi, hamachi, and salmon all for myself and was just barely satisfied.  My biggest disappointment was the hit and miss of the taste and quality of the nigiri and their small portions.  Disliked the albacore and aji.  The fish was bland and not fresh and the garnish overpowered the fish anyways.  The aji was the smallest cut of fish I have ever eaten in a sushi joint.  Kanpachi, hamachi, salmon and ama ebi were ok.  The uni, toro and japanese snapper were very good and enough to provide an A-Ok dining experience.  The total came out to $86 with tip and tax for one.  . . I highly recommend going to Mako Sushi in Little Tokyo over Sushi-Gen for the larger portions, cheaper prices, better taste and service.  Go to Hama or Komasa for cheaper but quality alternatives with the same bustling vibe as Sushi-Gen.  I would still visit Sushi-Gen but only if I'm treating or showing guests or friends.
