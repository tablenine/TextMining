Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Not too shabby, not too shabby. The simplicity of the menu is a welcome change from your traditional Mexican joint--fish taco, shrimp taco, drinks. No mas--and it's worth noting how clean the place was. The workers were cheery and nice and I even liked the wall hangings for sale by a local artist. The salsa selection was pretty good, their quality was so-so, and for the most part I liked the tacos, though think I prefer the shrimp to the fish as I believe they use catfish: not my favorite for tacos.. . Great value for a pretty good product. I'll definitely go back.
