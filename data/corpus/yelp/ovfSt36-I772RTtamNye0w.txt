wow, amazing, this is my new favorite restaurant. I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and we were obsessed with the atmosphere and decor. . sometimes when a server is so good and the atmosphere is so good, the way the food tastes is irrelevant...but on top of our great service, our food was really good as well!!! Â . . it's somewhat pricey for sushi, but who cares, if you don't have enough money, you shouldn't go out to eat in the first place.... . Fillet Mignon!!! Get it!!!!!. . some of the seating is in close proximity to other parties, which i thought was pretty cool, of course after all of the Saki that is consumed, everyone ends up in conversations with each other. . anyway, 5 stars all the way, we're definitely coming back
