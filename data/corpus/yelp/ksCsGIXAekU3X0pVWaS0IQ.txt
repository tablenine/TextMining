So... my best friend and her fiance (who is from England) are in town, and of all the restaurants in Atlanta, they insist we eat here.  I did not want to eat here, but figured that the reviews had been alright, and that we could give this place a shot-- not to mention I knew my friend from England would just love it.  . . It was alright, but to be honest I was very underwhelmed.  There was a level of pretentiousness that I didn't feel like dealing with, the food came out at different times and even though there was only five of us the server added 20 percent gratuity to the bill.  My food was OK, but was one of the meals that came out last and it was cold!  There was no one else in the restaurant... how does that happen?  You would think if there were only a few tables and we were a party of five that a "nice" restaurant could get it together to send the meals out hot and at the same time.  All-in-all not a terrible experience, but I won't be running to come back here at any time, and I don't think my friend from England is either.
