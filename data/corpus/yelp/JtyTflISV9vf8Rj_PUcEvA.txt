Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
This is one of my favorite places on Earth. My dad used to take me here after auditions when I was a kid. I don't eat food like this often, but when I'm in LA, I always go to Pink's. They really do have the best chili cheese dogs on the planet. You'll have to brave the line at any time of day, but the wait is definitely worth it.
