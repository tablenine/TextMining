I feel compelled to write this because I must shed some light on this over-hyped restaurant.. . I've only been here twice.  The first time, it was pretty darn phenomenal.  I enjoyed the multiple "chef compliments," especially the cold asparagus soup and strawberry sorbet.  My aunt's Kobe was off the charts.  The best meat I've ever eaten.  The pork I ordered was.. eh.. nothing too spectacular.  However, my sister's trout with morels.. OMGOSH it was THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER EATEN.. . The 3 stars are because my second visit was sub-par.  Not very good at all.  To start, we had reservations for 8 and weren't seated until 8:20.  If it had been $40, I may give it 4-5 stars but for $75 I expected something much much better.  I felt like their steak was not very flavorful and the sauce accompanying it was a tad salty.  My mom's fish was overdone and we had to send it back.. . The only consistent I found (in my 2 visits..hehe) is their desserts.  They are awesome.  So, hats off to the pastry chef.. . I wish I could go back in hopes of reliving my first experience but I just can't afford to take that chance.
