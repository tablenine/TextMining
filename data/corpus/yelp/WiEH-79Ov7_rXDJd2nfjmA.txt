My father was in town for business this past week, and we thought it was a fitting occasion to go out and grab a steak.   After having two more different cuts, (i had the porterhouse he had the w.r. chicago cut but we each cut a portion for one another since there is PLENTY)  I've decided that while the steaks are very good, better steaks can be had else where. The kick just wasn't quite there in the steaks.  They were very good but the seasoning just wasn't what could have been.  It's a classic place that you have to take in, but if Gibson's wants to be the best there is a little work to be done.  . When I go back I'll have to have the filet with one of the fancy things on top (i saw blue cheese covering our neighboring tables filtets, why didn't my waiter mention this to us? hmm)  and one of the massive baked potatoes.
