I LOVED this place last night. They have a fantastic beer selection, with some awesome Belgians and American craft brews. The atmosphere was very chill. I liked the music they were playing.. . This is a great alternative to the Brick Store pub. Brick Store has gotten too crowded for my taste these days. This bar has some of the same great beers, but you can walk in and grab a table. . . Great service, great atmosphere, great beer. I'm sold.
