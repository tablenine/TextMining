Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I really enjoyed this place.  It feels a  little more upscale than your typical Korean BBQ place in LA.  I could see myself holding a power business meeting here.  The prices here are slightly higher than other BBQ places (not by much) and it's not all you can eat.. . We had a group of 8 and ordered the Combo A, an additional galbi order, and some soon tofu soups.  Comba A comes with a wide variety of meat selections and includes some drinks which I thought was nice.  It would comfortably feed a group of five hungry people.. . In my opinion, the meat here was good quality.  I never felt that I was eating some second rate meat as I have felt at other establishments.  The soon tofu soups were delicious -- they were very flavorful with the right amount of spice.. . The banchan (side dishes) here was the best that I have experienced in LA.  There were a ton of different dishes and some that I had never seen given out before which were delicious (brussel sprouts, aloe).  All the banchan was delicious and fresh.  Top notch.. . Service here was friendly and attentive even without us having a Korean speaker.  We were able to order a couple of things which were not on the menu and the refills on banchan were prompt and plentiful.. . I was definitely happy with my experience here.
