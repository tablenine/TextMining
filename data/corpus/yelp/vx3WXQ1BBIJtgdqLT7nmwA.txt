Cafe Selmarie...  I love you!  I don't usually eat meals here but I get a selection of pastries every Saturday; the strawberry roulade, the banana eclair and a piece of torte or cake (we change that one up every week).  I spend about $15.. . It's usually busy but I never wait more than a minute.  The portions are on the smaller side but it is handmade with the best ingredients possible.  You can taste the love and experience.. . Whenever we have guests visiting, we bring them into Lincoln Square and force them to buy something.  I've only been disappointed once and that is because I asked for raspberry and was given a cherry torte instead, which I don't care for.  Other than that I've always had a pleasant pastry experience.  The coffee is good too.
