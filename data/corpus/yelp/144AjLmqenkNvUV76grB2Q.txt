Always busy, but I've yet to wait for a table in the dozen times I've been here. By far the most efficient setup to deal with a constant stream of hungry people (minus parking I guess, but I bike or walk here). I always seem to have better luck than my girlfriend does, and I'd say it's delicious 80% of the time, and average-to-middlin' the remaining 20%. The sandwiches are consistently good. Avoid the apple-pear slaw. Breakfast won't surprise, hearty and big servings. You can also get amazing little chocolates next door sprinkled with salt and chili. Yum.
