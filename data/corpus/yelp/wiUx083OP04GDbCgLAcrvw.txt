My cousins from San Francisco were visiting and wanted to eat breakfast /brunch somewhere that's been featured on "The Hills" before.  So I decided to take them to Toast.. . We got here at around 1:30pm (yeah I know late breakfast/brunch).  The parking situation is terrible, but you can valet your car.  We probably waited 15-20min to get seated.  I've passed by this place a few times and it always seems crowded.  The inside is cute, but would probably not be good for big parties.  They do, however, have a ton of outdoor seating.. . I ordered the "not-your-mom's grilled cheese" sandwich.  It was definitely not your average grilled cheese.  It had mozzarella and feta cheeses, fresh sun-dried tomatoes (always a plus in my book), basil and an olive tampenade on ciabatta bread.  I added grilled chicken breast.  The sandwich was okay.  The bread was too dry for the cheeses used and the chicken was also a little dry.  I did enjoy the sun-dried tomatoes though.. . My cousin ordered the stuff french toast with banana pudding and fresh bananas.  This was pretty good!  It wasn't too sweet, but sweet enough where you didn't need to add any syrup.  But you do have to like bananas in order to eat this.  My other cousin ordered the "Favorite" scramblette which was just okay too.  It didn't have very much flavor, but she added a ton of hot sauce and pepper and it made it taste a little better.. . Overall, the food is just okay and, in my opinion a little bland.  Toast is pricier than most breakfast joints I've been too.  It is also "very LA"...so I would not come to this place if you're anti-scenester or just can NOT stand The Hills.  You'll feel like you're part of an episode if you eat here.  . . I would give this place 2.5 stars, but it gets all three stars because our waiter was HOT!  Hahahaha =)
