Restaurant: Houston&#39;s Restaurant
Category: American (New)
No bad food, no bad service, but no hats?  I've been to Houston's many times but was shocked when I was asked to remove my hat.  Since when did Houston's implement this policy.  I've always considered Houston's to be a, slightly, casual restaurant.  Actually, I thought the hostess was joking when she asked me to remove my hat.  But, she wasn't and we were hungry so I obliged to remove the hat.  Other than this new, or new to me, hat policy, the food is still good and served in good portions.
