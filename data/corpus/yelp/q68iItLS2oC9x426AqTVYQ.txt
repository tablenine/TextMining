Unreal Draught Selection on beer.  You should be shot if you are drinking any Bud light Miller etc.  Went there for NBA finals- this place was bumping people actually cheering at a sports bar, and not just watchin.  Great Service and great wings.  Ask for my boy travis the bar tender, tip him well and he will treat you real well.  Sports bar with amazing atmosphere and amazing beer selection and good food no other bar in the area compares.  Sweetwater Georgia Brown is the best beer I have ever tasted.  I loved it so much that I bought a case to bring back to NY.
