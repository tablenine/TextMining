Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
I love the food here.  I downright loathe the service.  Pick Me Up has the worst service of any place I've eaten in Chicago.  . . At our last experience here, we were seated right away.  About 10 minutes later, they gave us water.  10 minutes after that, our waitress comes by and takes our order.  Really?  20 minutes to take an order? 20 minutes to stop by the table for the first time?  All the while, our waitress has visited other tables in our section more than once.. . Waiting for our drinks.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Yes, I would like some more water, thank you.  Still waiting for drinks.  Seriously, if I've sipped an entire glass of water before my ice tea comes, the waitress is doing something wrong.. . 40 minutes in, our appetizers come.  My lady had the veggie chili.  It's cold.  It's obviously been sitting around somewhere for a long time.  I had a salad.  Both items did not come at the same time.  My salad came about 5 minutes after her chili.  ... and right after that, about 15 seconds, our entrees come.  Nice.  They're cold.  Great.  No way I'm sending it back, I'm starving and I don't want to wait another half hour.. . Just god awful.. . I have a view of the register area from where we're sitting.  So, I peek there while we're sitting around twiddling our thumbs.  Two people, standing around doing nothing for most of the time.  That's really nice.  If it's so busy that we're served cold food, why don't these people lend a hand?. . Taking a break from this place.  It gets two stars because the food is good.  When it's warm.  It should probably get one star for the abysmal service.
