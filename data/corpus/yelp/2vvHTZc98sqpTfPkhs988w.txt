After a long long time, putting this place off based on one friends bad review, I finally decided to meet a date here and give it a shot. . . The result:. . Decor:  Excellent, however the lighting in the front could be better , but this makes it romantic I guess. Well as long as one can still see their date. . . Service: Excellent. The Bartender/Waiter told about a traditional dance in Chile that to him was less than appealing. . . Drinks:  My date asked for a Michelada after the Gimlet starter and it was granted. Myself, I started with a Mojito and it was good, but then I got the BeachComber (Big mistake cause it was bubbly sweet and seemed alcholess with ramifications of why did I order this whimpy drink). However,  I capped off the date with a Pacifico. Aah , the golden bubbly beverage that makes me go mmm.  . . Food: Good guac &amp; chips, but the green sauce (a what the?). The Ahi &amp; watermelon ceviche being god aweful,  left my date and I in awe. Oily &amp; vinegary, we wondered if it was even the right thing. Then, my date shouted in glee, "I just slightly tasted watermelon".. . Music: Trance &amp; House. I didn't mind it when I was in  my teens &amp; 20's. But, perhaps something else would have been more suitable.  I love all kinds of world music and this had to be the worst selections ever.
