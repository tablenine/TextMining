Took the family here before our visit to ComedySportz next door.  The four of us ate well for $27, so you can't argue with that.  The food was tastily and thoughtfully prepared and the service was very speedy.. . We are typically pot sticker people but we ordered crab rangoon in honor of Julia W..  Another B. family favorite is spicy basil chicken.  Most places do this with ground dark meat, but here it was made with sliced white meat, which I liked but the kids prefer it the "regular" way.  The Pad Thai was light and yummy, and our iced coffees were full of sweet, creamy caffeinated goodness.. . My one quibble -- they did not bring out any larger plates after our appetizer course was over.  We share our entrees (isn't that what you are supposed to do in Asian restaurants?) and we had a hard time eating them off the little appetizer plates.  If little plates are all you have, at least bring us some new ones so we don't get appetizer sauce on our entrees, a'ight?
