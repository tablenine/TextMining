Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
As I was only in Chicago for a few days, I was a little reluctant to head to Milk &amp; Honey for lunch over my usual favorites. However, this spot won me over instantly and would easily be somewhere that I would frequent if I still lived in town. My friend and I ordered our sandwiches from the counter and were directed toward a great window side table. We swapped sandwich halves so I got to try both the ham and havarti on a pretzel roll and the avocado and gouda on multigrain bread. Both were great. I was expecting the heavily favor the ham, but the avocado sandwich was probably my favorite of the two. They also have a great outdoor patio which would have been the place to sit had it not been 95 degrees outside.
