Finally got around to trying the venerable Oinkster in Eagle Rock.. . Fun little joint with an older style diner feel to it.  Seats probably 30 or so people inside with some overage along the bar.  Parking lot holds maybe 7-8 cars.. . Let's not kid ourselves...the pastrami itself is reason to try this place.  I like pastrami and Oinkster definitely does it well...for $10 you get yourself a decent sized sandwich that can work for dinner or lunch.. . Everything else on the menu is just average...above average prices  getting some sell through given the "eclectic" Oinkster menu.  Tried the pull pork which was decent but nothing worth writing home about and wasn't worth $8.. . They do serve some interesting beers so does make for a nice place to catch a game (have 2 flatscreens at opposite ends of the diner) with the boys and they also have a patio to bask in the sun on a nice day.. . Probably more of a 3.5 in my book due to the pastrami and beer selection but given that's not an option, I'm at a 3.
