Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
this place has great vegan food... the group i went with here, none of us are vegan or even vegetarian and we couldn't tell the difference between the meat substitutions... everything was really good... i recommend this restaurant to anyone, even if you don't usually eat an all veggie diet... best vegan food i have ever had...
