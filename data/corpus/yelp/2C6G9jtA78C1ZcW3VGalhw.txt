I had been wanting to try RFD for some time. The atmosphere is cheery, the menu is exciting (especially to me, a non-vegetarian fan of vegetables and organics), and the presentation turned out to also be very nice. I ordered the day's special, which is butternut squash with beets, tofu and a mushroom gravy. . . I was almost done with my meal when I was surprised to discover my face was heating up, my fingers were swelling and my breath was becoming constricted. I was having a glutamate reaction.. . I spoke with the waiter, who sent over a woman (I believe she was from the kitchen) who told me she gets hives from the gravy, and that for future reference, I might want to avoid "any of our dishes that have the gravy." She thought her reaction was from wheat flour in the gravy. I explained to her that many pre-packaged vegan products (i.e. tempeh, hydrolyzed wheat protein, and possibly part of this gravy) contain glutamate but do not legally need to state that. The restaurant is likely buying and using glutamate and does not know it. . . Bottom line: if you have trouble with MSG, be very careful to go over the ingredients before ordering. The staff is happy to help. I am just disappointed that such a respected restaurant doesn't realize it's using glutamate--this needs to be remedied.
