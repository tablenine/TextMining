Restaurant: The Izaka-ya by Katsu-ya
Category: Sushi Bars
I absolutely love this restaurant. My favorite food in the world is sushi. This is a great restaurant.... the only problems are that the Â  wait can be kinda long, parking is a little bit hard to find so most of the time you just have to use the valet parking and that the place is kind of loud. The food is soooooo good.. I love the spicy tuna with crispy rice, seared albacore with crispy onions, the bake crab hand roll and to be honest probably anything you get here will be amazing. It's not the most cheap dinner in the world but completely worth every penny. The food is so yummy....
