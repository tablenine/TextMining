Maybe i went on a bad night? But even still, a bad night at my Miki's in A-squared would be about 7 times better....so....i mean, great sushi makes you freak out a little. This limited, frankly- boring menu was on the expensive side esp considering it's ho-hum factor. I don't mind paying those prices when your eyes go wide and the freshness awakens your palate and excites your mind- but NONE of that is happenin' here. Again I ask- does LA even KNOW GOOD SUSHI? Cuz I'm getting desperate here...I might try it again EXCEPT that I have eaten at SO MANY places in LA that people rave about only to be so disappointed! And PS, lots of Asian people in a restaurant is NOT a guarantee that it is good.
