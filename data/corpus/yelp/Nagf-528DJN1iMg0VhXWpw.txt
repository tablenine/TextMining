I had the panini with basil pesto, mozzarella, and tomato and it was delicious. The chai shake was also great, and I slurped it up much faster than I expected! I love their gift shop, and they have quite a bit of nice jewelry. I need to come here sometime to try dessert as well! I am not vegetarian, but if I were, I would appreciate this place even more than I already do. . . I personally had no service issues the time I went, but I've only been once so I cannot agree or disagree with the harsher comments on the service here.
