I've been here once, and thought it was pretty great. Nice atmosphere and attentive service on my trip. I had the braised beef ravioli to start (I believe it was a special), which was really excellent. My main course, the monkfish, while perfectly nice, was a little bit bland and didn't really have the impact one would expect from a house specialty. It was nice, but definitely not a knockout.. . The one big minus for me was the restroom. Both stalls in the men's room were absolutely filthy - Jack In The Box bathroom that hasn't been cleaned in 4 shifts filthy. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that was an aberration...
