The bread and olive oil mixture alone is worth going here for.  My gf and I always look forward to the bread there, ha.  Anyways, the food here is pretty good.  You have your carne, pollo and some other dishes like pasta and seafood as well.  I usually go for the skirt steak w/ the mash and it usually never disappoints.  The other dishes are quite good as well and the atmosphere there is chill (especially the outside seating).  The sangria is pretty good as well (not as good as Cha Cha Cha's though).  If you have a skirt steak fix and wanna get your grub on, get out to Lala's.  Enjoy!
