Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
I just got a delivery from them and this is my first time eating from this place. I ordered from grubhub Joy's staff or whoever, forgot the receipt that you sign when they come to your door...so the delivery guy had me sign a piece of paper. I hope I don't get charged twice.. . I ordered baby egg rolls and chicken pad see eiw. The eggrolls were just regular egg rolls, made smaller - not exactly the same as baby egg rolls. The Pad see eiw is not flavorful and the noodles are all stuck together. I won't eat from here again.
