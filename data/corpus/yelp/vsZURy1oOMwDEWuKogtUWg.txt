Buffalo, duck and Austin oh my! . .      These are the flavors I tasted plus some (ok a lot) of the douplebock and other fine brews. I have little more to add other than it is an enjoyable place. Order food and beers at the counter, find a seat and dine on those fine sausage and beer fanfare, will definitely be back just less beer next time.
