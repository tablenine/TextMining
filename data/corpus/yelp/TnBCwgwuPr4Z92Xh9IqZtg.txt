Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
This loft space was transformed into an awesome diner that evokes an air of Jewish New York. From their bathrooms to their booths, 11 City Diner's got flair and kitsch to spare.. . Uh, if you go to a self-declared NYC style diner, you order the NY items. For dinner one night, I was in the mood for a bagel with cream cheese and a Brooklyn egg cream. The waitress looked at me a little funny when I asked for a chocolate one and said that was the only kind they made. Umm, Vanilla egg creams are really good too. And for the skeptical, there's no egg in it. it's chocolate/vanilla syrup, milk, and seltzer. When I am old and decrepit, I will have my IV drip of coffee replaced with egg cream. yum. And not that Hershey's crap. I'm going to have U-bet. Look it up.. . Anyways, the egg cream was a little bleh (I've had better), but the bagel was freaking spot on NYC style - giant and puffy. Plus, she gave me enough cream cheese for three bagels. And I slather my bagels too. . . BF decided to have the Moshe Cristo. That monstrosity - ham, turkey, &amp; swiss on French toast, was intense. Keep in mind I've eaten at Perry's a lot. He only polished off half of it. Though we also split a Chef Salad, which was also pretty damn huge - and good. And I'm not even a rabbit-type eater.. . I'd go back if I still lived in the South Loop...glad they don't forsake portion size for quality.
