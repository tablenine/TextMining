Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I swear, this is the Disneyland of nice steakhouses. Either Disneyland or Vegas. Over the top, huge, and everyone's here to celebrate a birthday or anniversary or something (with a coupon or discount somehow).. . We came to check out the spinning salad (tasty fried croutons!) show and try some of the food. The prime rib is par for the course, but what blew us out of the water was the coconut banana cream pie for dessert. Be sure to save room for that. If you love banana cream pie, you have to try Lawry's coconut banana cream pie. I think the crust is made with coconut.
