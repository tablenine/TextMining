i've only been once and it was looking for a place for us to go after work.  it was a nice sunny day so we hit up the roof.  not the establishment's fault--but it was ridiculously packed.  . . they did have a good beer special.  i think what they do is choose a random beer and put it at $3 or something like that during happy hour and i was pleased with that.. . don't think i'll be back, though.....not exactly my crowd..more of a yuppie crowd.  nothing wrong with that, though.
