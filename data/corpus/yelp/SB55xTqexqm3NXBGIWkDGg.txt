You know the saying, "doesn't it feel like a cold beer on a hot day?"  Well, on the rare occasion that LA is suffering from below average temperatures, I am going to coin the phrase: "doesn't it feel like a hot daikokuya on a cold day?" I'm convinced it will catch on with everyone who has experienced the tasty ramen noodles from this place.. . As I am writing this review, SoCal has just been berated with a week's worth of thunderstorms and cold temperatures (strange, I know!).  En route to see a show at the Ahmanson, I naturally pulled out my trusty Yelp! app on my iPhone to figure out what I can eat near downtown that would satisfy my taste buds.  To be honest, I had originally planned on going to a sandwich place, but a last minute glance for a restaurant called "Daikokuya" intrigued me and I clicked on the link.. . Daikokuya is ramen done right.  And not instant ramen, or cup noodles or any of that stuff.  While they might be good for a case of the late night munchies, the ramen here is a full meal.  I ordered the Daikokuya ramen, which came with a savory broth, yummy noodles, bean sprouts, and meat.  The meat was tender, the egg was cooked like I had never experienced before (I later learned it's a special type of cooking, where the inside is more runny than usual) - delicious, and the broth warmed you up like a furnace just lit up inside you, not too salty, just right.. . Needless to say I was overjoyed that this last minute discovery paid off.  Something should also be said of the atmosphere here at Daikokuya, waiters shouting cooks at orders in Japanese and greet you in Japanese.  I like that, it's like you've been transported to another country, cause there ain't no way these fantastic noodles could be found anywhere else.
