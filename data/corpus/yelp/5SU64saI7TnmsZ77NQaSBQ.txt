Quaint, cozy, cool. . Came here for a quick 'bite', ha. Had a delectable grilled cheese and sweet potato fries dish- sweet and simple. Cheers to the chef, thank you for not over-salting the sweet potatoes, seems to be a big habit of most chicago dines. Don't over salt the sweet potatoes!. . Dig the 'current' paintings on the wall- some talent. . Strawberry lemonade huh... interesting. Didn't try it, but I shall be back.
