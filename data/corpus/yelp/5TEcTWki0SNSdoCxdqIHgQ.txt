Hi. My name is Ayelet. I am officially the very last native Los Angeleno to try Canter's. Why this abomination you ask? I have a problem with bread. That is, I refuse to eat it. And Canter's, a place where sandwiches, old fashioned Yiddish style baked goods, and matsa ball soup reign supreme, was thus scary for all its lore and old school charm. . . Well, fuck it. Sometimes a girl just needs to bow down to the power of carbs. Especially on a freezing cold night when comfort food doesn't include a salad. So I dragged my Moobs on over and partook. The atmosphere was well, stogy...in the best sense of the word. Hipsters sitting along side crusty cute old folks and families, and all with giant plates of food before them. Moobs was ill so we got out quick, but the food was good while I shoveled it down and my experience worth the potential belly bulge. I had the half sandwich and cup of soup combo with barley bean soup that was tasty and soooo what I wanted with my toes still half frozen from walking outside, and a brisket sandwich. The meat wasn't too fatty, which is a big plus for me and with the spicy mustard and pickles made my tummy full and happy. Moobs had a chicken caesar salad in a bowl so ginormous it must have been used as a punch bowl in it's past life. Holy crap was it massive. So while he wasn't up to eating it there it fed him the entire next day. . . Imposter L.A. native no longer! Success.
