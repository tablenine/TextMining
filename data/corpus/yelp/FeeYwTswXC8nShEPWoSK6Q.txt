The first time I went to Philippe's, the lackluster environment almost scared me away, but once I tried the food, it more than made up for it.  If you're not into fancy decor but love great food, definately stop here. The lines are a little intimidating sometimes, but they move quickly enough to not be bothered.  Get the French Dip &amp; have a pickle or 2.  :)
