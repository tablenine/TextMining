Way over this place.   1 thing i will admit, their boba is the best tasting around, but otherwise, they serve mediocre food over a ton of rice to make you feel you're getting your money's worth.  . . I came here with a group of 5 and we ordered a korean soup, a korean soup/bulgogi meat combo, orange chicken and fried green beans.  It all tasted decent to me, but afterwards it all felt so heavy from the oiliness.. . I'd probably only come back here out of desperation for chinese food.. . Ambiance - trendy, to the point that they put you in uncomfortable oddly shaped chairs.  . Food Quality - heavy, oily, and eh.. Service - really good, theyll get your order and your food out fast. Value - i'll give them this, its quite affordable, we each only spent about $10 per person
