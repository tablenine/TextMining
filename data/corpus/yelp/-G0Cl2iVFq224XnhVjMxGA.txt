The thing about Phillipe's is that its great reputation will generally precede it.  So when you get into the line that makes you think of theme park hell (yes, it's that long) you start to feel like it may be overrated.  Fortunately, this is not the case.  . . The meat is tender and juicy and the cheeses melt right on top giving it a wonderful gooey, juicy texture in every bite.  Top that off with French rolls that have been dipped in the juices from the meat and this sandwich quite simply rocks your socks off.  And the cherry on top is their delicious spicy mustard.  It will clear your nostrils the moment you take a bite so be careful if you're not into spicy food.. . This place is as good as people say, believe the hype!  For some quick recommendations, you can't go wrong getting the roast beef but for me, my favorite is the lamb and blue cheese, double-dipped of course.  Also, the potato salad and chili are delicious and the lemonade is a very refreshing.. . Cheers!
