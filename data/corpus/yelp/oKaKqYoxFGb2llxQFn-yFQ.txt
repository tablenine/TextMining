Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
I've been to two other Hamburger Mary's (back home in Long Beach, CA [rip]... and West Hollywood, CA)... and I think this is probably my favorite location. While there isn't so much difference in the atmosphere... I do prefer this one over the others. It's just a quick walk from our place. The servers have been friendly each time I've gone (and this is the only place I've ever been called "baby boy" and "ladies" in one sitting! TEE-HEE). . . The burgers are decent, yet filling. My favorite is the Barbara-Q Burger, and the Buffy the Burger Slayer was good too. French fries are sweet potato fries, so be aware (I personally liked them, but my roommate didn't). Mashed potatoes were just ok --- side was really small, and had a hint of garlic or ginger or something like that. All in all, it's a good place to go when you're on a burger-fix!
