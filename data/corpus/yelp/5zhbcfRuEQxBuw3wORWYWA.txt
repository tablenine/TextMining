Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
I put Dunlay's to the ultimate test yesterday. I decided to go there for brunch on the weekend. . . The weather was sunny and perfect for outdoor dining. The Logan Square Farmers market was in full swing across the street as was the Milwaukee Ave Arts Festival. You might think we were being naive, expecting to get a table under these circumstances, but NO, my companion and I were seated almost immediately. . . Now, I've been to Dunlay's several times, mostly to drink, so this time I was determined to review the food. The brunch menu is pretty OK, albeit expensive ($3 for one pancake?). I ended up going with the cheeseburger with blue cheese and my friend had the fish sandwich, I believe it was blackened tilapia. Both were outstanding. But, the real winner at Dunlay's are the fries. They are the best, especially if you like them like the way I like them, with a side of Mayonnaise. Yum. I've decided, my next visit will be later in the day so I can finally try the (margherita) pizza. . . Do yourself a favor if you live in the area, give Dunlay's a chance. There's nothing around that's quite like it and I dare say you won't be disappointed.
