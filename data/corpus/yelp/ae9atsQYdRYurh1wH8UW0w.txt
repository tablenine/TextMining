I know I'm in the minority but I like this place, mostly for its delicious chopstick salad.  My boyfriend said the place felt dirty which is actually a complaint I often hear about Dojo.  I'm not sure I get it.  Maybe it's because it's such a hippy, veggie spot that it gives off an unwashed vibe?  I don't know but I think it's pretty good.
