So its been awhile since I've been back to Wurstkuche. The last couple times I left unsatisfied, but this past visit was different. I ordered the right things and they came to me hot and fresh, not cold as previous times. I went during a weekday evening and luckily there was no wait and available seating outside. . You can't go wrong with the duck, bacon, jalapeno sausage with caramelized onions and peppers, an order of fries and a floris apple ale.. I was excited to see they had dessert on the menu, an apple pie ice cream sandwich $5. When i was leaving, I went to the bar and ordered one. It was basically a pre made Coolhaus ice cream sandwich. Nothing to rave about and totally not worth the $5. .  Overall it was a satisfying dinner.
