Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
Tucked away in a typical strip mall in the Silverlake neighborhood, Pho Cafe is the quintessential pho establishment in Los Angeles. It's been my experience that the simplest and minimalist of Vietnamese restaurants do good noodle. I met a good friend of mine here for a weekday lunch and was appreciative of the flavors and spices in their cold vermicelli dishes. The service is fast and attentive (but not hawk-like), and there is a certain air of sophistication that comes along with your meal - a far cry from the casual nature of such a simple dish. It is definitely a cool joint filled with a pretty attractive crowd but I felt comfortable in my t-shirt and jeans. The prices are spot on for a pho restaurant in LA. Parking is available on premises but it was also a good thing to park in the neighboring residential streets and take a stroll here. Something extra: if you get a chance to head towards the rear of the narrow restaurant, and if the back door is open, take a peek outside beyond the greenery. It's a split-second respite from what lies beyond the front door.
