awww, it's so sad.  the daring risk taker merrill got a parking ticket.  what's more sad is that the ice cream wasn't worth that risk she took.  they have over a dozen different flavors including sorbet, bars, bon bons and soy milk based ones.  i had a scoop of hazelnut crunch ($2.50), and it was way too sweet and creamy for me.  i noticed blue velvet cake.  i must try it next time i am in l.a.  actually, maybe not.  i don't really want to drive to l.a. and end up getting a ticket.
