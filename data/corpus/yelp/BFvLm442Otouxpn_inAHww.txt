I don't care how good your food is, ripping off your customers is completely unacceptable.  I went here with a group of 9 and we ordered 5 pizzas, an appetizer and a beer per person - a few people got two beers.  When our bill arrived, there were phantom beers, phantom salads and two phantom pizzas (at $15 a pop) on the bill.  We immediately disputed the bill and our waitress (who was, at best, average with her quality of service) became very defensive.  A few more staff members came over and said they would take care of things.  They knocked $25 off of our bill - about $30 to $40 short of what they had overcharged us and we still had to pay the mandatory $40 gratuity charge on top of that.  A few other Yelpers have noted that this place does not handle larger groups very well.  If you do go here with a larger group, be extremely conscious about what you order, unless you don't mind paying a lot more than you actually owe.  Our waitress should be fired and this establishment should take the time to ensure that their servers understand basic math and can handle the service of larger groups.
