Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
I am basing my review on having eaten at Phillipes often as a child in the early 1950s.  It was my late parents favorite restaurant and I have fond memories of the food and ambience (sawdust floors, community tables.)  From reading about it now, it has hardly changed at all.  I live in another state now, but reading these reviews makes me want to take a nostalgia trip for one more delicious French dip sandwich.
