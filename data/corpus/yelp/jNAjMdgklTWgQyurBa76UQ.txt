I came here for Mother's Day brunch with my momma mia and fiance.  Taste had a pre fixe menu for the occasion.  The brunch started out with a pastry basket, salad, and mac n cheese for the table.  I love love the mac n cheese and can't wait to go with Christina L.  Christina is a HUGE mac n cheese fan.  From there each person decides on one of the entrees off the list.  I had the huevos rancheros, fiance chose the protein omelet, and my mom feasted on the crab cake eggs Benedict.  My dish was good but not stellar like my mothers dish.  I kept picking off her plate.  I will have to get that the next time I dine here for brunch.  To close out brunch, Taste offered dessert buffet.  I made a bee line for their bread pudding.  The bread pudding definitely made up for the huevos rancheros.  I had to hold myself back from getting seconds.
