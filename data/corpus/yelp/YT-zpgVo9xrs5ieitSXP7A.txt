Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Burger #161: Raiders of the Burger of Doom's Last Crusade to the Crystal Burger. . Sub-Meh. . . I had a feeling going in that I would leave unhappy and I did. The location, service, and d√©cor were all fine, but none of that matters when the food is so average it hurts. Ford's, like so many others in LA, has a pretty standard Nu-American menu that I'm getting sick of seeing regurgitated at ever other restaurant. . . So like clockwork I order the burger, medium rare with onion rings. The burger was served cooked past medium but was still juicy. The root cause of the lackluster burger once again boiled down to a serious lack of flavor. Why can't these guys season the beef?! Or at least use good enough meat that it doesn't need extra seasoning? At least the onion rings were good.. . If I was ever to come back it would be for the whole pig dinner, but knowing I can go to SGV and get a baby piggy for a fraction of the price, the outlook is grim.
