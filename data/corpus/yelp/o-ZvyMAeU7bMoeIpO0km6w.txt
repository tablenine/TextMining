Pizza was good; although, I wished I tried other pizzeria joints while I was still in Chicago. . . No joke about the sausage patty. We ordered the Supreme, and I, Â originally, thought that when it said it comes with sausage, I thought that there were gonna be small chunks of sausage on the pizza. Little did I know that the sausage patty was gonna take up the ENTIRE PIZZA. It was the surface of the pizza. . . What I really REALLY liked were their spinach sticks that came with the sampler platter.. Now, THOSE were yummy.
