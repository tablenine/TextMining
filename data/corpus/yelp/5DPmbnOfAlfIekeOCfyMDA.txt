Sausage w/ Chocolate....yeah, I said it.....CHOCOLATE SAUSAGE!  And...for only a buck fifty....WHAT?!. . SinBaLa is one of the most authentic Taiwanese eatery in the SGV and its close proximity to my house makes it a great place to stop by for cheap eats and yummy shaved ice.  YUMMY.. . "SinBaLa" actually refers to a Taiwanese sausages and this terms can be often overheard at any street sausage stand in Taipei's night markets.   Sausages are must-haves at this place.  I actually think there are over 20 different types of sausages sold at this place ranging from the classic sausage to sausages with mangos, passion fruit, wasabi, etc.  The Sinbala sausage rice is a great steal at 5 bucks and it's sure to get you full for lunch.  CHEAP EATS!. . What I love more than anything is the mixed shave ice.  At 4 bucks plus tax, it contains red beans, green beans, grass jelly, jelly, rice balls, taro balls, flan, boba, coconut jelly, and condensed milk all over a mountain of shaved ice.  It is easily enough for sharing without fighting.  . . Other notable mentions....the oyster pancakes, fried green onion pancakes, taiwanese glutinous rice, chicken roll....also, they have a bunch of ice slush, teas, and bobas....
