Restaurant: Feast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Feast has a nice physical space.  The restaurant is nice and airy and has a casual feel to it.  But that's where the positives end.  We went here for brunch and despite it not being very crowded, the service was terrible.  I ordered the french toast and it was cold when it arrived as was my friend's eggs and pancakes.  The mango iced tea was watered down and they were out of lemonade.  The food was mediocore at best.  Nothing to return for.
