Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Fantastic selection of sandwiches and beers and very reasonable alcohol prices.  The staff is always friendly and the music is usually excellent unless played live and then it can be spotty.  Great outdoor seating too!  I've never been disappointed with any sandwich I've gotten.  Sides tend to be a little on the small size but I don't leave there hungry ever.  I would also like to recommend their coffees and chocolate cake desserts.  I was very impressed with both.  I always feel comfortable here and love this place.
