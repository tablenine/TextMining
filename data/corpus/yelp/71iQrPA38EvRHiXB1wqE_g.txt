Food was incredible and the place gave off this uber romantic feel. Â We were seated in their garden courtyard area with a candlelit table, and suddenly wished my husband was with me to enjoy this (I was with two friends). Our food was amazing (I say our because we just HAD to have a bite of each others' dinner). . . I ordered the Pistachio Crusted Monk Fish with Preserved Lemon Sauce and Rhubarb Chutney, Couscous, Carrot Puree and Fava Beans Potato Pure . . Friends had the:. Roasted Duo of Duck Breast and Leg Confit with Candied Kumquats . Wild Rice Cake and Asparagus Tips . . Grilled Rib Eye Steak with Sel de Guerande, Herbs and Cracked Black Pepper, Potato and Leek Gratin, Steamed Spinach and Baby Carrots. . . Alongside our meal, we ordered bottles of the Malbec red wine from Argentina and Badoit sparkling water. The bread selection and dip at the beginning of the dinner was quite tasty and to top it off shared a couple desserts that were recommended by our server. Exquisite!. . It was a definitely a night of indulgence and I thank my friend for footing the tab! I recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants to experience romantic dining in European country and have a few extra dollars saved in the bank....because this is going to be an expensive dinner! Well worth every penny though, in my book!
