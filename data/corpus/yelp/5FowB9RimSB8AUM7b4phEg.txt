Yeah, yeah, I get it. This place is a steak house. It's supposed to be one of the best in the country. So why the heck did we go for Sunday brunch?! Good darned question. . . It looked really good on paper. An American style dim sum. Love dim sum and love brunch. Again, looks good on paper. Well, not so much. . . The startling litany of course after course SOUNDED good. For $35 and wanting to really PIG OUT it just didn't cut it. . . The Best Dishes: The starting pancakes were Delicious without syrup; the desserts were quite nice, especially the house made vanilla ice cream; the salmon was tasty. . . The Worst Dishes: well, all the rest. The mac and cheese = tasteless. The mini filet burger = overcooked. The lamb meatballs = dry. . . The Service: The staff was really nice. But we weren't really sure who was our primary server. At best guess there were 4-5 faces serving us. . . The Booze: the $10 all you can drink mimosa/champagne could really be worth it! . . The Atmosphere: the dining room is okay. . . The Plumbing: Â But dang, if that bathroom isn't hot! Metallic tiles (I think Ann Sacks). Great poured concrete sink. Beautiful. . . Next time it is back for the steaks.
