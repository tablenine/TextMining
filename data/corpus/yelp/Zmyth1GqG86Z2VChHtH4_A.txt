FANTASTIC FOOD.  The best cupcakes I've ever had, the malted milk ball cupcake, try it.  I've been here multiple times and the service is GREAT.  The portabella wrap= excellent, the Vegetarian Chili= excellent.  Love it.  The omelet was great, too, it had pesto and spinach in it; they have breakfast all day.  The cream of spinach soup= Perfection.  I LOVE this place.  It is not boring diner food, it's much better, and maybe some people don't appreciate something different.  The cupcakes are the best in the city.  Ooooh I had the spinach lasagna recently and it was A+, the service was A+ and very quick and polite.
