Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
The shrimp tacos are SO good and I love how there are seriously only two things on the menu. I was really confused when I walked in and tried to look for the list of food items, the man even laughed at me. The staff was friendly (almost a little TOO friendly..) and the salsa was pretty good. Good for a quick cheap bite, most definitely.
