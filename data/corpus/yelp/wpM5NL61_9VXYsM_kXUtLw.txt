It is loud but not unbearable. Our table enjoyed the Plateu of Fruits de Mer. Good portion for 6 of us. I tried the roasted beef marrow and oxtail jam and I am not impressed. I also had the special that night of the Pork Belly. It was excellent but I think this "French" dish has a hint of asian influence. That's okay because I'm not a huge fan of French cuisine anyway. Others at my table had the crispy skate, the snapper and the steak, everyone was pleased with their entrees.. . BTW, I'm not an overweight 210 pounder, but I seriously thought I was going to break the legs off those flimsy plastic chairs in the dining room.
