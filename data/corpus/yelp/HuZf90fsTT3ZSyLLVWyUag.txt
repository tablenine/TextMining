Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
You know how restaurants and small businesses often leave "stuff" rubber banded to your door? It's that "stuff" that most people just throw away without looking because it's usually nothing of interest.. . A few years ago we had a Friendship menu put through our mail slot, and it caught my eye -- enough to actually read it. The owner described his life-long love of Chinese food, and how he opened this restaurant. We decided to give it a try.. . Three years later, Friendship has become a bi-weekly staple for us. We've never been to the restaurant (but plan to one day, we swear), but the delivery is just as quick as Miss Y says. They always tell you 50 minutes to an hour, but it's never been more than 30, and usually a lot faster than that.. . The food is exceptional - The Orange Beef is tender and sweet/hot, Sesame Chicken has a glaze that really accents the toasted sesame seeds, and you can actually taste champagne in their Champagne Lemon Chicken! Pot Stickers and Crab Rangoon are excellent as well, and the portions are generous.. . The restaurant itself will sometimes have sponsored events like Chinese music troupes, and usually they announce this in advance on their delivery boxes.
