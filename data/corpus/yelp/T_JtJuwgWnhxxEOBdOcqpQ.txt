While it isn't as good as the Burger Bar in Las Vegas, it is a good alternative.  The only thing they are really missing is beef choices.  Even adding Kobe beef to the menu would be awesome.  The choice of burger weight is a fantastic idea.  I barely got through the 1/3 lb. burger!  The sweet potato fries are fantastic, and the 50/50 order is a great idea for people who want to share sweet potato and regular fries.
