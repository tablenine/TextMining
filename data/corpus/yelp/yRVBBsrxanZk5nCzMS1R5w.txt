Met a friend for early dinner.  We sat in the bar area for drinks &amp; dinner.  Like the bar area alot, much better than main restaurant area.  I've been here a few times and last night was not one of the best.  My dinner was swimming in butter.  It was yummy, of course.  Surprising based on my previous experiences here.  Good menu, lots of variety.  Love the little desserts - just enough.  Good service.  Not sure what time but the singer/piano player started up.  Too loud for a small place (and not crowded) and he was better at the piano than singing.  Fair prices also.
