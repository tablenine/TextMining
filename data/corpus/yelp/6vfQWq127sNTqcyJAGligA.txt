Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Great classic pizza joint...to me, pizza is pizza, this place seemed better than others.  I've read in reviews that the sausage and eggplant is the pizza to try here and I haven't done that yet.  I was with a picky eater so we ended up with a large pepperoni and bell peppers.. . The crust was thin and crunchy and the pepperoni was that salty pepperoni I always associate with a "real pizza". There was definitely layers of oil oozing off but I don't have a problem with that on pizza, it comes with the territory.. . The atmosphere was great, doesn't seem like much has changed in this restaurant since they've opened in the 50s.  A couple of people at our table got the house red wine which was cheap but smelled like vinegar.  I took a sip of it and I wasn't impressed, glad I stuck with beer.  I guess the saying "you get what you pay for" stands true, especially when it comes to wine.. . There was a wait and the parking is whatever you can find on the street.  There's also a bar called Chalet within walking distance that this place is probably great after.. . Next time I'm there I'll have to try the sausage and eggplant.
