coobah.  glory.. . when i was 10 years old, my father drove me to cooperstown to see the major league baseball hall of fame.  he pointed to the bronze plaque of ernie banks and said: "son, do you see that guy?  that guy owes me 50 bucks." . . 17 years later i was sitting in coobah staring at a bloody mary with a shrimp and a block of cheese in it.  much like that day in cooperstown, i was confused.  i didnt understand what it meant.  after my third one, i still didnt.  no matter.  . . i ate some delicious brunch food, enjoyed the bloody marys and the $2 PBR tall-boys and -- like i did in cooperstown -- suckled from the teat of life.  it was magnificent.  . . my dad never did get that $50 back, but he keyed walter payton's car after a flight from LA to o'hare (long story) so i think he's calling it even.
