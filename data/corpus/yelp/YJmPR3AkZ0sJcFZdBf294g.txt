Restaurant: Caf√© Agora
Category: Turkish
Today was my first visit - and WOW, was I blown away! I ordered a chicken gyro and side of hummus. Both were excellent, prepared fast, and the proportions were HUGE! I could hardly finish the gyro and only had a few tastes of my hummus (will eat it for dinner later!). I had found the restaurant while searching for Greek restaurants in Buckhead on the internet, and was pleasantly surprised when I found that Cafe Agora was located within walking distance of my apartment. I was hopeful - and let me say, my expectations were certainly exceeded. One of my favorite parts about my first visit to Cafe Agora was the atmosphere. It was lively and fun - and Al, the owner - made my first time here very memorable. When I told him it was my first time at the restaurant, he gave me a nice big plate of samples of some of their yummy sides - hummus, tabouleh, etc. He made me feel welcome and right at home. He didn't have to do that - to give me the sampling - but he did and it showed me that he really cares about the quality of the food and about the happiness of his customer. The whole experience was wonderful and the food was excellent and truly authentic. I'll be back again (and again, and again, and again). :)
