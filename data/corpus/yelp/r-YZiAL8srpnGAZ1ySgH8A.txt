We couldn't wait to try this place after seeing it come up on a Big Bites phone app and seeing how high it rated after so many reviews.  Neither of us had ever had Salvadorian food, so we were pretty excited to try something knew.  We ordered two pupusas (cheese &amp; herb, bean &amp; cheese) and they were pretty good.  I think we ate them incorrectly.  They come with a side of pickled slaw which we picked at, but I later saw someone put it on top of their pupusa and kind of eat it like a taco.  I ordered the fish tacos which were salty and really nothing great.  I added a side of plantains to me dish for $2 and got 4 bite sized pieces which means I essentially paid $2 for 1/8 of a banana.  The man ordered some kind of stewed beef which I expected him to love, but even he wasn't really into it.  The nachos served in the beginning were stale and the salsa was a little watery to me.  All in all, the only actual flavor I tasted in any of the food was salt, and at the end of the meal I felt quite sick.  The service was extremely friendly, but I really don't see a reason to return.  I think I'll stick to Mexican food in the future.
