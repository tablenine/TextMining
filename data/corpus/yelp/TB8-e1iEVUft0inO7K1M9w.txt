Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I came to this place for a friends birthday dinner. Before anything else I asked how much the all you can eat was. I am on a tight budget and didnt want to spend too much. That beng asid, he said it was 17 Dollars. Fair enough for all you can eat Korean BBQ, I'm in!. . We get there and sit down at a small table which ended up seating 9, somehow. The experience was fun and cooking your own meat  was part of the experience that added to the atmosphere and flavor. I must say that I didnt think the food was THAT bad, but seeing piles of uncooked meat didn't sit too well in my stomach. . . ** BEWARE. It is the "hidden" costs that will kill you at this place. The sticker shock was pretty crazy, my 17 dollar mean turned into 40 dollars because of overpriced and no pricing on the walls  of the $7 beers and $25 large Soju. Ask before you order, even though if you dont speak Korean the language barrier was pretty harsh.. . On top of that, it was his birthday, and at this place for some reason it was customary to spray said birthday boy with bottles of champagne. The first bottle is free, the second is $11. If it is your birthday, play dumb but also dont BE dumb. I saw at least 10 people get hit and those outfits were destined for the trash. Wear something fun, but not somethint NICE. Everyone in our party (as did other parties) walked out feeling ripped off, overfeed and undercooked. I can't say I will ever come back here, and if I do, Im getting a separate check, not on my birthday.
