Restaurant: Eclipse Di Luna - Park Place
Category: Tapas Bars
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Well, that may be a slight exaggeration, but Eclipse Di Luna has a knack for being both charming and mystifying. Case in point: the main room has plenty of tables and a long, comfortable bar, but the blaring Spanish guitar overwhelms any attempt at conversation, unless you don't mind shouting across the table. And you're lucky if there's only a solitary guitar player on stage. On the other hand, sitting outside on the patio is great, with the brick wall as a noise neutralizer and the warm air a perfect complement to your glass of delicious white rioja. It's here, on the porch, that you can truly relax and sample plates of seasoned potato or beef Â  or goat cheese tapas without getting too full. The wine goes down easy behind the spicy food. And then, around ten, the entire ambiance is demolished by the sudden thumping beats of some brutal hip hop being blasted through the speaker system, as the latest cool dj assumes center stage inside. It's always a bit pathetic to watch someone try to be something they're not, certainly the case with Eclipse Di Luna as it attempts to transform itself into a late-nite club. Forget it. Stick with the flameco and sangria. Sometimes things are best left unimproved.
