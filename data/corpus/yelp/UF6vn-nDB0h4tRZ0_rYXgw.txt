There are some great breakfast and lunch options at Bite, local art displayed on the walls, fiftiesesque tables and menus and a generally cute vibe throughout.. . I particularly like the Bacon cornmeal pancakes and the nachos are amazing. Â The veggie hash is rather uninteresting and the granola is a little sweet for my taste.. . This is a great place to have a quiet breakfast or coffee during the week but it does get busy on the weekends so you'll want to plan ahead.. . It can be a bit chilly inside.
