Restaurant: Sun In My Belly
Category: Caterers
I got my first taste of Sun in My Belly at work; Apple came to host a seminar on its new operating system, and lunch was catered by this cute Kirkwood joint. I chose a brown bag labeled "tuna," unaware that I soon would sink my teeth into the most ethereal tuna salad sandwich of my life. The reason: dill. Dill was mixed into the salad. Mmm.. . I had brunch there again today, opting to scarf down the Kirkwood: scrambled eggs cooked with Boursin cheese, topped with honey glazed bacon and a biscuit on the side. The Boursin cheese turned an ordinary breakfast staple into a disco party in my mouth. And the bacon, although chewy (as opposed to the preferable crispy), bursted with flavor. . . I've had a sit-down meal at Sun in My Belly twice, and I've found the only foible to be the slow service. Definitely friendly. Just sorta slow.
