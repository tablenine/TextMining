Went here last night for a friend's birthday dinner and had an amazing time!  Dining room is a little cramped but we had a reservation and they were very accomodating.  I wasn't hugely hungry so didn't do the prix fixe option but definitely would under other circumstances; it's a great deal.  . . I enjoyed the hell out of the bread and the garlic tapanade and drank copious amounts of an extremely reasonably-priced sauvignon blanc.  Seriously, they have several bottle options under $30; if you're a wine-lover and a frugal sort it's worth coming just for that.  Service is friendly and competent, there's even free coat check! . . Ordered the Rigatoni Buona Terra and absolutely loved it; I'm furious that my leftovers are at home in the fridge instead of here with me at work.  Had a bite of my friend's pesto mashed potatoes and thought they were fantastic, also tried the caprese salad and the profiteroles.  Everything was top-notch.  I eat a lot of Italian and this is a place I will definitely go back to ASAP.
