Talk about a slice of history...My waitress was 148 years old and had the sass to go with it.  . . This place is a landmark in infamously "historic" MacArthur Park [read: between Korea Town and downtown].  . . I had the pastrami sandwich and was not disappointed at all.  The coffee was decidedly strong and the booths / stools have that great plush "pleather" material with the large gold upholstery tacks.. . I suggest heading there when the sun is up.  I used to live a block away and know all too well that the freaks come out at night...literally.  The gangbangers won't mess with you if you don't disrupt their drug trade down there.  . . Don't half step.    Go there for a great hangover meal.
