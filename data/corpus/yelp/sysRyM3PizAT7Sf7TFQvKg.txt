Restaurant: Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse
Category: Latin American
This place is good and always crowded. The milk shakes are good also. I would not say it is excellent. I used to be blown away by this place, but that was before i started going to other south american restaurants. However the food is just a bit too greasy for me.
