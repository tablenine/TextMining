I'm interning in Chicago for the summer and my roommate is Korean.. . She was beyond excited to take me here for my first Korean cuisine meal.. . One word - delicious. I have never tasted such amazing authentic food in my life. It was amazing. I couldn't tell you what we ordered but EVERYTHING smelled delicious!. . I'm definitely returning before I go back home at the end of the summer!
