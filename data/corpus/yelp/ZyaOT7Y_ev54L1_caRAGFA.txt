I love this place...  Step in and you feel like you just walked in off the street in Paris.  Sit in the back patio when the weather permits, it's devine!. . They have a wonderful selection of sweet and savory crepes, some of which are vegi friendly!  They have a nice wine selection too!  . . I have been here several times and have not been disappointed!
