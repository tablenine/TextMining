Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in LA.  I appreciate the late hours on weekends and it's entertaining to watch the Thai Elvis sing everytime I go (I believe he sings nightly!).  I've never had to wait for a seat and food comes fast from the kitchen.  Their new location is also much bigger and has a stage, a bar, and nice tables.  . . To name a few items, I like the Thai tea, the pad thai, the chili and holy basil ground pork stir fry, papaya salad with dried shrimp, chicken sa tae, and the deep fried trout or the deep fried whole fish (w/ spicy lime or chili/garlic sauce).  Yum!  Yes, I do love my fried fish here.. . Valet parking is the best option as it is on a very busy street and intersection.  The menu prices are very reasonable and is a great place for large parties (4-10 people are easily seated).
