Restaurant: The Varsity
Category: Fast Food
I would say the best part about The Varsity is just going for the experience. . . It is loud and crowded and the people behind the counter are yelling for you to order, so stand back until you know what you want.. . The food is just ok, but it sure comes out fast. Â If you are in Atlanta you have to check it out at least once.
