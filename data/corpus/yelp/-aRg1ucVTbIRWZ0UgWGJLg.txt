Restaurant: Blu Jam Caf√©
Category: American (New)
I was in LA with some friends, sharing a hotel room, which meant sharing a double bed with one friend. Well, one of his friends living in the area got too drunk, and had to stay over in the hotel. At some point in the night, he pushed me to the middle of the bed, leaving me with like 12 inches of room for my body. I slept through this until 6am, when I realized what happened and thought "WTF." I didn't want to be sandwiched between those two, so I figured I should go find breakfast.. . I searched yelp for a breakfast place open early enough on a Sunday and came across Blu Jam, hopped in the car, and headed up, hoping I would beat the weekend brunch crowd. Sure enough there were only 3 tables occupied at the restaurant.. . The staff was really friendly and far more awake than me at that time. I ordered a gunpowder green tea and the Blu Jam Benedict (an eggs Benedict with Bacon as well as Ham.). . I'm picky about tea, so I was a little surprised when the tea came out steeping in a french press (You don't want to use a french press because it's plunger is a screen, and you can't completely isolate the tea leaves from the water when you're done steeping, meaning you end up over-steeping what's left in there. Bodum makes something that looks like a french press for tea, but has a container to isolate the tea.) Anyway, it was better than bagged tea at least.. . The Benedict was awesome. Looked perfect, tasted good, and was a generous serving size. The country potatoes served on the side were seasoned well, but a little bit undercooked.. . L.A. has more breakfast spots than the Bay Area, so I am hesitant to give that fifth star, but if you transplanted it up north, it would top the selection here.
