Restaurant: Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar
Category: Seafood
Hugo's is my Gibsons of Seafood and it is even the same owners. I understand they even share a kitchen.  The night I proposed to my wife we had dinner here before I took her somewhere else for the proposal.  It was like every other time I have ever been, perfect.
