Five stars for the atmosphere and "fun" level. Very cool and very different. Even if you're not into magic, you can't help but have a good time. I don't really like getting fooled, but when you have so much fun with it!!! Love that. . . The food, however, not great. Edible and not Del Taco but not fine dining. Standard "wedding" food. . . We had our Christmas party here. Great location for such events.
