Not your typical Lettuce Entertain You restaurant; meaning more sophistication and no screaming children.  The drinks were great, and the food was better than I expected: a lot of variety on the menu, definitely something for everyone.  The decor is dramatic, although a little bit dated.  I went with my girlfriends on a Friday night when they have Salsa dancing.  Next time I'll bring a dance partner, but it was still fun to watch everyone else participate.
