Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
I never went to the Pig when I used to live in the neighborhood.... no no, I took it for granted, and only after I moved to North Center did I stop in one summer day on my way to the beach.  . . It was a hot afternoon, and it felt instantly refreshing to walk into the cafe.  The inside seating area is sunny, but feels cool and shady because of the dark wood and the tall bookshelves.  My friend and I ordered from the large sandwich/salad menu handwritten on a tall chalkboard.  I chose the Good Earth Salad and a Mango-Peach smoothie - gotta go light when you're about to wear a bikini!. . We found seats out on the patio, which has both sunny and shady spots, and soon got our refreshments.  The smoothies were perfect for summer - fruity and smooth - and the salads were a great light lunch.  Simple, but flavorful, they each came with two slices of fresh bread.  I was able to finish my salad without feeling stuffed, and we headed to the beach feeling very satisfied.. . The Pig has such a cool atmosphere, and lots of other goodies I didn't get to try (loose tea, ice cream, huge cookies, etc) - if you're in the area, don't miss your chance like I did so many times.  Stop in and take advantage of having such a great cafe in the neighborhood!
