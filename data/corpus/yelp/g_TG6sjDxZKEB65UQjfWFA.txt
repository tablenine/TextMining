Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
Stella's is the perfect diner. No frills, just plain good service, clean tables, and simple American diner food at decent prices. . . I love the cashier guy (too bad I never catch his name). He's always friendly and welcoming. I love the Dum Dum pops at the check out counter. And of course, I love the food.. . I usually go for brunch and order a Western omelet or pancakes. Or I go at dinner and order chicken fingers and perfectly cooked french fries with a diet coke. Or I go just because and order a peanut butter chocolate shake, or during the fall, the most moist, delectable pumpkin spice cake you will ever have in life.. . Unfortunately, I no longer live in Chicago, but if I should ever make my way back, I'll return to Lakeview just to be near one of the greatest diners I've ever experienced.
