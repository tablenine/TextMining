This is a pretty good gourmet pizza place with a nice social atmosphere. I ordered a squash pizza, and it was excellent. The cheese melted was creamy and melted in my mouth.. . The truly annoying thing about this place is the ridiculous wait. There's barely any room to wait near the front...and I swear, we waited about 45 minutes to get a seat at the bar. By the time we got our food, we downed it and wanted to leave.
