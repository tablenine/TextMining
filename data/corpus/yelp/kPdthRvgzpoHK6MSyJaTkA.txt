Actually, the whole setting was great.   I was there on a glorious, lazy, sunny  summer morning... (a weekday, which was key - so no wait, a lot of tables available)  Plus, my adorable baby niece was sitting next to me and my Sis and Bro-in-law too, (they were visiting).    . . Yes, the strong Julius Meinl coffee was killer.  I had the "Frazzled Eggs", over easy, on top of grilled (with nice charry grill marks) bologna.  Yumfest 9000.   It was egg-cellent.  (Yah, I just did that.).  . I tried some of my Sister's blueberry granola pancakes, with like maple butter, I think.  They were incredible.  Pretty good crispy, applewood bacon (Although not as good as 3rd Coast.). . My only gripe:  Rather average potatoes.  Coulda done somethin' more with 'em, I think.   The staff was super-friendly (it helped that my lil' niece was the hit of the place).  And the other diners customers around us were cool too.   All in all, a very warm, laid-back experience, with some pretty darn good breakfast food.   I will go again.
