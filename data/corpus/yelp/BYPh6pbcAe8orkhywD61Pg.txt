We walked into a alternate universe full with pictures of (I think) the owner posing with various (maybe) celebrities from the 70's &amp; 80's. He even cross dressed in several pictures, and wore boob t-shirts in others. There were posters of Bruce Lee and Mexican wrestlers on the ceiling, along with pictures of different soccer teams. . . We ordered the chalupas with meat (Cecina, carne asada, pollo, chorizo), the atomic cemita and carne enchilada cemita. The chalupas were AWESOME. Hot, crispy and filled with special sauce &amp; meat, I almost burnt my tongue trying to eat them. The cermitas were good with great sauces and Oaxacan cheese, which is the great melted.
