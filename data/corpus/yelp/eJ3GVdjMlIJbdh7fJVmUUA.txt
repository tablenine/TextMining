OK, I've been back and tried some of the sashimi, and the verdict: so yummy and delicious!  The tuna was remarkably tender, and the hamachi and salmon were great too.. . The spicy tuna roll at this place is just fantastic -- the best I've had anywhere.  I also really enjoy the salads here -- most sushi places give you boring iceberg lettuce, but this place does spring mix -- fancy!. . I was surprised by how fast the service was.  I stopped by after work to take it to go, and I'm pretty sure they whipped up everything in under five minutes!  That's awesome!. . Sadly, the didn't play any of the weird brazilian 80s music when I was there.  Perhaps I'll get lucky next time I go!
