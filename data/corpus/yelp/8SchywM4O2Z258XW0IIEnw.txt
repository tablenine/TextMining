I got to Atlanta a 6:06 am on Sunday after taking the red eye and dealing with someone's screaming child the entire flight (2 words people: Children's Tylenol).  What kept me from leaping over the seats of the plane and harming the child's grandparent for not fixing the situation was the fact that I knew that by the time I landed, got to my hotel, and checked in, the Flying Biscuit would be open.. . By some twist of fate, my hotel had a room at 7am and I was able to get a couple hours of sleep.  But as soon as I woke up, got decrudded, and bought a marta pass, I was there. . . I sat at the bar - the bartender/server Brooklyn was nice and fun.  She kept conversation with some of the patrons, but I was still a little tired, so I read my book and she let me be.  She also kept my coffee full and warm...which is really 85% of what I need/want/expect from breakfast.  I ordered the eggs with the blackbean cakes.   They were pretty good -it's definitely one of the UGLIEST meals you'll ever see. So if you don't like ugly food - don't get it.  I wasn't wild about the grits...way too much creaminess and not enough grit.  I was also shocked that my food came out in like 3 minutes...seriously.  WOW.. . So there you have it...the meal that saved a grandparent's life....kinda
