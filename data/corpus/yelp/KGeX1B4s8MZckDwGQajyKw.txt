Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
this was a tough review..and i might be a little tough on uncle julio's here... Â But i think this place really lacks quality of food...its really not mexican food..its bogus and its for people who enjoy the american version of mexican food...they do have a few bright spots which keeps it over a 1 star...homemade soft shell corn tortillas..pretty awesome..the drinks are pretty good here too..and the atmoshphere is pretty exciting.... . the food isn that great..i think the salsa is very poor..its some chipolte flavor which im not feeling..its not even hot..everything about this place is right below average..the veggie fajitas were the best thing i had off the menu...for some odd reason girls seem to love this place...but if you want good mexican food dont go here...go here for the social scene
