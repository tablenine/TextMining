Got the beef double dip, cole slaw, potatoe salad, chocolate mouse cake thing and lemonade.. Sandwich was good, a little small but good, cole slaw tasted pretty good with a balance of sweet and tart-ness. The potatoe salad left something to be desired. Drinks are a bit small and you might have to buy 2 in order to finish your meal. The pie thing was alright; not overly grand, but just alright.. Maybe I'm biased cause my family made roast beef sandwiches since I was a  wee lad, but these sandwiches don't really fill ya up. I got out of there for about $13-14 which is a bit high for small portions..I might wait another 15 years before I go back again maybe then the sandwiches will be bigger. . Things I liked,  the disposable plates and counter style service.. Things I didn't, prices and portion size.
