My friend suggested this place for dinner and I was so glad she did!  I've been wanting to try it out for a while.  It is a little hole in the wall restaurant, but the food is superb!  My friend and I were the only ones there tonight, besides the guy that works there and his family. It wasn't Al, but a younger guy. . . For starters, we ordered the hummus.  It was probably the best I've ever had! I couldn't stop eating it!  We also ordered a small greek salad, which was very good with the balsamic dressing and all the veggies.  I ordered the lamb gyro and my friend ordered the falafel.  My gyro was very good. I loved every bite of it.  The portion is pretty big, but I still finished it.  My friend's falafel was delicious as well, but I liked my gyro better.  . . Towards the end of our meal, Al came in and talked to us for a bit. He asked us if we've been here before and then he gave us a sample portion of baklava which he fed to the both of us.  When we went up to pay, our bill came out to be $24 and some change, but Al told the guy to charge us $20. . . I do agree with the others about the parking.  There is a lot in the back and some street parking.  Also, the restaurant is really small so get there early! I'll def be back for more gyros. They are the best in Atlanta!
