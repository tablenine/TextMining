There are some delicious things going down at Gingergrass:. 1. The Chicken pho soup is out of this world.  I have had the same cold for the past two weeks and decided I couldn't do any matzo ball anymore.  So, I got the chicken pho and MAN OH MAN this soup is amazing.  It hits the comfort food spot because of the chicken broth, the warmth and the noodles, but it also hits the sophisticated taste spot with it's incredibly complex flavor layers: lime, chili, garlic, cilantro, basil.  It's exotic yet comforting.  For me, this is the best thing if you're under the weather.  Get it to go, and they seperate out all the ingredients for you.  I put in extra basil and extra hot peppers.  It's cool to kind of make your own deliciousness.. . Also, the bf LOVES and I mean I'm a little nervous he's going to leave me for the Bo Sate. It's spicy and peanuty, and just one of the best things on the menu.  . . I used to not be the hugest fan of Gingergrass but after I was introduced to the bo sate and the chicken pho, it's one of my favorites in the area.
