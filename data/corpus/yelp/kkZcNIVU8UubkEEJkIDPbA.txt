I quite enjoyed most everything I tried at Mana. They take those things that aren't meat (what do you call those again?) and make food out of them. Fresh! . . Between two of us, we had split pea soup, Thai pineapple salad (this was kind of a weak dish imo), sweet potato pancakes, pumpkin ravioli, and coconut avocado sorbet. It sounds like a decent amount of food, but we got the small portion of each. The bill came to around $30 before tip with two Diet Cokes. After tip it was like $130 because we're really bad at math. . . Needless to say, my fat ass was hungry again like 45 minutes later, and I negated any healthy choices I made at Mana by eating dinner at Tecalitlan. Still, Mana is kind of foodie (remember when I said I had avocado in my sorbet?), so it's definitely worth putting down your gyros for a light meal at Mana, especially if you're going heavy on the sauce and you don't want to throw up gyros, which I think would be disgusting. Still though, gyros... mmm...
