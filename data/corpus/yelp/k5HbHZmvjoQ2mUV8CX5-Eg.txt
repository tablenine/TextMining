Category: Pizza
WORTH THE WAIT!  One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  Perhaps for the  novelty of it, but I do love their pizza pot pie.. . THE WAIT:  I arrived at 530pm on a Saturday and waited for 1 hour.  Here I thought I was missing the dinner rush but the place was packed as usual.  This is one place I don't mind waiting, though, especially in good company.  . . The entrance and bar area were crowded with people.  I waited for the host and he just asked me how many were in my party and then instructed me to wait by the bar.  My friends were concerned with how the host could possible remember our place in line, but I have complete faith.  I asked for a wine list at the bar, but they rattled off a generic selection that they offer.  I cannot do cheap wine since it often means instant headache, so I went with hard liquor instead.. . DINNER:  AMAZING!!  . . The Mediterranean bread always makes a great starter.  Their pizza pot pie never seize to amaze me.  It's so gooey and the sauce so delicious.  Don't expect to substitute a taste for deep dish pizza with a pizza pot pie because they are two very different creatures.  I love the sauce here and it's more like spaghetti sauce than pizza sauce.. . The only decision you have to make is whether you want a half pounder or a one pounder (a $21.50 one pounder costs the same as 2 $10.75 half pounder).  The pizza comes with sausage and door knob sized mushrooms that you can decline or pick off if you decide.  . . AMBIANCE:  It's dark and cozy.  The restaurant is pretty small and I wonder why they haven't expanded or open a new location.. . BATHROOM:  One per gender towards the back of the restaurant.. . PARKING:  There were plenty of street parking that's free.. . CASH only.
