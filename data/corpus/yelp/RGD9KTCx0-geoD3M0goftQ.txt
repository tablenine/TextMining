Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Basic info:. . 1. Order the white truffle Mac and Cheese. Immediately.. . 2. If you plan on getting a full sized steak, realize that the biggest thing they have is 8oz. (pre-cooked I surmise) hangar steak and it's actually slices of steak laid on top of the most delicious pile of mashed potatoes I've had in a LONG time. But it's not a whole steak.. . 3. WATCH YOUR STEP WHEN ENTERING THE RESTAURANT. Especially my ladies in heels. Def almost broke my leg and have a swollen foot from slipping on the stair. 60% at fault were my heels, which have no traction. But they do actually have a "watch your step" sign just below the stair so even they know it's a hazard.. . 4. Order the Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding. I'd never had bread pudding before and I tried my friend's order and I low-key wished I'd gone by myself so I could've eaten more lol. . 5. I've read a number of reviews that say there was poor customer service. That's unfortunate for those yelpers but our waiter was gr8. Jeff was a nice guy and he kept us well. We didn't have to wait too long for food, etc,. . 6. What people have said about the noise is right AT CERTAIN TIMES. My friend and I got there at like 6 o clock and it was quiet and lovely. Around 7:30 it started to get loud when people started to show up, but by that time we were pretty much ready to go.. . 7. I'm not really used to the whole "trendy/fine dining" thing so in my eyes they are kinda pricey. I went on a Groupon. But If you have money like that (which I don't. Starving Student), It's worth it,. . M'kay any questions, ask.
