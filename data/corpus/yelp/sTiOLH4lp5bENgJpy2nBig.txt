I have to imagine this place has been used in some movie or Sex and the City episode. With gorgeous staff (fortunately of more than one shape and size), a grazing population of models amongst the clientele, and perfect style to the brink of being drab, it would fit in with any number of fictionalized portrayals of Manhattan life in the industry. . . The "comfort" food is good and in parts pretty expensive, but the cocktails are far out of whack with their quality. Seriously, the mojito was made with skill, but $12 for one made with Castillo is insulting. You don't think I know my rum? . . Similarly, though breakfast is commendably sold all day, there is not a single vegetarian item amongst the lunch/dinner entrees or sandwiches, relegating us in a faux health conscious establishment to salads or non-vegan breakfasts. A great many kinds of businesses can get a pass on that accord, but the level to which its expect correlates with community, anticipated clientele, perceived vision of the business, and the rest of the cuisine.
