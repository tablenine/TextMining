Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I love ramen (in fact, I'm eating homemade ramen as I am completing my review).  When people ask me for a recommendation, I usually recommend orochon and daikokuya.  . . If you want spicy ramen, this is the place to go. You have a choice of shio (salt), shoyu (soy sauce), or miso soup base, then you choose the level of spiciness. It ranges from 1-10, where 4 is medium and 10 is mild. You can also add in other items (extra charge), such as bean sprouts, to add to your ramen. . . I have been here at least 7 times now, and Orochon never fails to deliver each time :)  The bowls are pretty big and I usually struggle to finish my own bowl of ramen.. . There are other other appetizers/entrees on the menu such as fried rice, gyoza, scallops, etc.  They also serve alcohol here.  When you order the spicier levels, just beware that although some vegetable pieces may resemble bell peppers, they are in fact jalapenos in disguise.
