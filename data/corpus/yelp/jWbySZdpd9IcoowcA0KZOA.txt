Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
It's pretty damn good at night...when it's more fresh I guess.  The hot dogs have a snap to it and the chili dog with kraut is a killer for me. I love that. I haven't really tried anything else but the lines are horrendous. Those were the days...oh yeah, I've also gotten food poisoning here  a couple times! Ouch!
