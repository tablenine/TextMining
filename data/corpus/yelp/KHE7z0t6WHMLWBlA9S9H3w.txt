A decent Japanese restaurant in Westwood located in what used to house Eurochow.  I had the combo with sushi, sashimi and gyoza.   The food was decent but pretty standard; nothing really stood out as amazing.  You do get your money's worth here as the portions are very generous.  The atmosphere inside is nice but the outdoor patio could have used some more work.  It felt a little run down compared the the restaurant.
