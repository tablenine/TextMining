It was a nightmare!! Came for some drink and dinner around 9..didn't leave the place til 2 am!!!! Out waitress was M.IA and we had to always flag her down for more drinks. Finally when we got our bill they automatically added gratuity when we were only a party of 5. After we asked to talk to the manager a buss boy came out and told us her was "busy" WTF!?!?! We just spent $200 on drink and that's the service we get? Finally after arguing with the rude waitress and manger we got the gratuity take off. Then the manager had the Odasity to ask " so your going to leave her something right?" Umm thats at my discretion and her service was sh*ty! With that we finally left after 5 hours of waiting leaving no tip!
