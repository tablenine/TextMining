Probably the best steak house in LA. The appz that we ordered were really good: Bone Marrow Flan, Pork Belly, and Bone Marrow Dumpling. The meat is rich but the accompanying sauce or greens balance them. Â The American Wagyu is rich and fatty but not too soft like a kobe beef, so I actually prefer the American Wagyu than the Kobe Beef. . However, for the price, the ambiance/atmosphere is lacking. The restaurant is really dark and the tables are set too closely together.
