Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Best cheap Thai food in Chicago.  Don't really understand the Penny's people... way too much soy in their Pad Thai - tastes funky.. . I'm always happy at Joy's... I've tried some other places, just to see- and Joy's is definitely the one.  . . Pad Thai- a staple- is terrific!  . Tom Yum soup- delicious (i get veggies with no cabbage) and it is filling to rim with awesome veggies with perfect flavors.  . Nam-Tok - (beef salad) is real good, nice spicy, very fresh/refreshing and I think a healthier choice.  . Being bad- all about the Beef Lard Na - They will send you the fried, crispy noodles in a seprate container so that they remain crispy for you.  . . EnJOYS!
