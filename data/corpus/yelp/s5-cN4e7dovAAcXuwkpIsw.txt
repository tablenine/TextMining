i haven't been to the studio city location, but i've frequented the encino one often and it's always been fantastic. this is by far my most favorite sushi place in la. . . my favorite dishes are:. crispy rice with spicy tuna. seared tuna with japanese salsa. . the decor is bright and airy which i like because most sushi places are den-like. it's also a bit rustic with a lot of natural elements. . . a very cool place!
