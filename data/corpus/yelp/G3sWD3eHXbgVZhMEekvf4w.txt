So I remember this place from like 9 years ago, when a pharmaceutical rep. brought some goodies to the medical office I was working for in Pasadena. After all these years, I never forgot about how good it was. I recently had to go into Burbank, so I stopped in. Awwwww, it was just as good as I remembered!! Â I got the cheese danish, the meat and potatoe balls and the meat pies with chorizo. To die for!!!! I brought some home for a dinner party I was attending later in the evening!! Everyone went crazy for this stuff!!! You gotta stop by this place if you're ever in the area. Don't be afraid of the line, it goes really fast!!!
