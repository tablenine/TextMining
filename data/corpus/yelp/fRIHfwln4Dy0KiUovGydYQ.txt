Playing catch up to these things called french dips required me to be objective and try both places that invented it in one week.  SO, I'll have to play the pros and cons of Philippe's in comparison to that other, newly re-opened place:. . Pros:. 1) Philippe's gives you more food for a better value.  They have more on the menu, and more meat on the sandwich.  They're pretty efficient at the sandwich making once your order is in.. 2) The atmosphere is great, old-timey, but more 40s and 50s old-timey.. 3) Banks of telephone booths.. 4) Dang, that mustard is spicy and good.  Just watch out for the horseradish shooting out of your nose like some old cartoon character if you put too much on your food.. 5) Parking seems way more convenient.. . Cons:. 1) I'm not sure I'm a fan of the pre-dipped sandwich.  I have to say I like the freedom to adjust my au jus intake as necessary, plus it seems to stay hotter when it's separate.  I have to have things stay hot. . 2) The service, while manageable, just seems really slow.  I can't imagine trying to get a bit to eat while in a hurry during lunchtime.. 3) Some of the side dishes and other foods just have a high school cafeteria kind of feel to them.  You may like this, but some things just gross me out.. . I think the choice for your french dip needs ends up being where you feel most comfortable, switching even between the two based on your mood.  I think LA has room for two inventors of the french dip....
