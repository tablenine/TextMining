Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
They make their own mozzarella at this place, hence the name I suspect. . . The starters here are really great. the squash blossoms and the procuitto parma with buffulo mozzarella were both fantastic. I also like the pizza with the fennel sausage. the burrata pizza was a winner with two of my friends, and the one with bacon was also really tasty. . . If you can't get a reservation, the bar is first come first serve.. . Really nice wines.. . $60-$80 per person
