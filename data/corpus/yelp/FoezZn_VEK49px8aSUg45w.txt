Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
A word of caution: read the instructions on how to eat the dumplings on the back of their chopsticks packet. I totally ate one without reading the instructions and got completely owned by it.. . Aside from scalding soup in dumpling when you're not expecting it, the dumplings at Din Tai Fung are truly exceptional. I had the pork and shrimp dumplings, juicy pork and crab xiaolongbao, pork and vegetable buns and a dish of fried noodles, and they were all very good. I've also had the regular xiaolongbao and those are by far my favorite. The noodles are decent, but the dumplings are the real star of the show; I'd just skip the noodles all together. . . The reason I give this place 4 stars is because I've had been to the Din Tai Fung in Hong Kong and that place was 5 stars, hands down. I guess knowing what it *could* be made this place a little bit of a disappointment; the food just tasted better in Hong Kong. Still, Arcadia's Din Tai Fung is still a close second, and the dumplings are really phenomenal. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been before! Worth the slog from West LA, at the very least.
