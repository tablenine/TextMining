I'm typically not interested in chicken unless it's seasoned spicy, breaded and deep fried... but this was great. Hainan chicken is a regional dish popular in Singapore and Malaysia... whole chicken that's been poached in chicken/pork broth and served with chicken stock infused rice. I know this sounds really boring, but the sauces they pair it with are outstanding! . . They give you 3 different sauces, a chili paste, soy infused with garlic oil and freshly grated ginger to go with the above. Amazing! . . Serious hole-in-the wall... I think they could accommodate up to around 15 people, just by eyeballing the place. (inside) Helpful if you bring a Chinese person like I did to communicate with staff. Get the chrysanthemum tea!
