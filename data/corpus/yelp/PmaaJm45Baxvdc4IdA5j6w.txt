One of the best, most unique, freshest, inspiring dinners I've had in quite some time. Three of us ate, we all ordered different items and everything was magnificent. Will be back again definitely. Our waiter was fantastic as well. Tall, slim, bearded dude with glasses. Looked like a member of Phish.
