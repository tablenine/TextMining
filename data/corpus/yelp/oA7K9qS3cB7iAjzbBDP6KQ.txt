Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
Took my buddy's advice: Â . http://is.gd/3Rquu.  and brought some out of town clients to Yamashiro and they loved it. The view was breathe taking... Service at the restaurant was good; valet was on time which is important in LA. Food was decent, not great. Hence the 3 stars. I'd definitely go back but won't be my first option for sushi.
