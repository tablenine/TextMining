Why do I keep coming back to this place when I find myself dropping Daikokuya's rating by 1 star every time I go? Well, contrary to what others may say, I don't think their food is that crazy good at all. . . This was one of the first times the 3 of us have passed by and saw no line out front. Parking in J-Town always sucks, so my friend dropped 2 of us off to grab a table and order for him while he looked for parking. . . 2 of us were present, and the 3rd was on his way from the parking spot. It kinda bothered me that the they gave us a hard time saying that we couldn't be seated until EVERYONE was present...they proceeded to seat the couple that came in AFTER us first!!...We finally talked her into giving us a table...but it did take some coersion and telling her that we were ordering for the other buddy.. . My friend ordered their house ramen, and once again the egg was cold, and the noodles were a bit hard/undercooked. He had to let sit for a couple minutes so it would cook until it he could eat it.. . The other homie and I ordered fried rice...The dish was lacking any form of substantial meat and flavor. I had to add quite a bit of soy sauce to eat it....just doesnt compare to good ol' Thai style Fried Rice!. . The gyoza was good...but 5 small ones for 6 bux. $40.00 for 2 fried rices, a ramen, and 5 pieces of gyoza!?!? thats a pretty high price to pay for some rice and noodles....2.5 stars..
