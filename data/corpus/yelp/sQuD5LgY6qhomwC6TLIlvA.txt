Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
Dunlays is the best neighborhood spot if you want a relaxed atmosphere, they've added some new great beers and from what we've heard are adding more, and they also amazing food. The service is always awesome. Brian the bartender is hilarious, and Lindsey the waitress is so sweet and provides great service. Â . . There is nothing bad on the menu, head out for brunch on sundays you can't go wrong.. . Hey Dunlays - if you get some new beers a beer called "Loterbol" is absolutely amazing.
