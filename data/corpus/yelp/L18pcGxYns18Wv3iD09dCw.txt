Category: Asian Fusion
This Hawaiian fusion chain restaurant satisfied my desire to enjoy Seafood while I am not in Seattle :P  The menu offers a great selection of fish dishes - salmon, mahi mahi, butterfish, cod...  I got Jessica's recommendation Blackened Ahi Tuna, which is really delightful.  Everyone enjoyed their picks.  We completed our experience there with two desserts - Pineapple upsidedown cake &amp; Chocolate souffle.  They are both delicious that I can't vote for the best!
