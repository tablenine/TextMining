This place is special. It doesn't have all the glitzy and glamour, it actually looks pretty worn, but the food is amazing. Service was great. The chefs, on the quiet side, but very friendly otherwise. I asked the chef to pick a couple things for me on my first time. Everything was super fresh and delicious. Be warned, even on one Tuesday night, this place was packed. Can't wait to get back there.
