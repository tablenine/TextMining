I had high expectations for this place even though some friends told me it was only ok.  We had gone on a long eating adventure that night and decided to end the night with some Furaibo chicken wings.  That is apparently what they are known for so imagine my disappointment when we got tiny little anorexic looking chicken wings.  We also got the fried fishcake cheese things which are supposed to be amazing but I was again unimpressed by the fishcake with some Kraft sliced cheese in the middle.  It did taste a lot better dipped in the soy sauce +mustard though. . . Perhaps it was because they were closing and didn't have quality ingredients anymore, perhaps we just didn't order the good stuff.  I supposed I'd be willing to give it another full shot at impressing me since this was a baby shot.
