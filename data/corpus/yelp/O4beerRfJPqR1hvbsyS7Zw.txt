This will be a sweet review : -) Just like the sangria and stellar company that completed my first LA dinner outing!. Tortilla de patatas, patatas bravas, skirt steak, scallops, short ribs, and fried lentils off the secret menu (Thanks to in-the-know Iris &amp; Bryan!). Â Pretty much everything they threw at us kept us yearning for more, and the tapas-portion sizes made for a good excuse to do so! We reordered the potato torte and the scallops - yummy!. We topped off dinner with sage bread pudding, churros, and chocolate with no regrets, nor guilt. Again, the portion sizes here kept our waist bands from busting.. Service was good and thanks for letting the flower vendor in ;-). Summa summarum, I look forward to next time!
