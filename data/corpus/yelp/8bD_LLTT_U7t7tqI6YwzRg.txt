Lots of hipsters, standing around blocking the street.. . Oh wait, I'm supposed to be reviewing the bar... . . Um. . . Lots of hipsters, standing around blocking the street. . . Normally I am all about a dive bar; in fact, I love them. But not when I'm compelled with the urge to punch everyone I see in the face. Every time I go to Castleberry Hill, I suddenly remember why I never go to Castleberry Hill.. . So, back to the bar. It's early on a Friday night and not too crowded. Gettin' mah drink on. My boyfriend goes in to order a sandwich, and comes back out saying there is an hour wait for food. Really, an hour? Is there like... a single one-armed dude back there assembling bread and meat? How can it take an hour to make a sandwich? Well, I may go back sometime to actually TRY the food, but I definitely won't go if I'm already starving.
