Checked this place out with my man on  Thursday night.  When you walk in, the place is dark but inviting.  Our waiter Brad was efficient and definitely made some great recommendations for both dinner and dessert.  The Hell Fire Nachos were superb and neither I or my boyfriend have ever tasted nachos of that sort.  I guess this joint is also known for their interesting selection of beer, so if you're a beer junkie, then this is a place to hit.  I, myself being the stereo typical female liquor drinker prefer the fruity flavored drinks so I had a blast with the Fourth Ward Pink Lemonade.  It's basically Pink Lemonade with a twist.  Beware, the alcohol in this cocktail is hidden so you might find your vision blurring after a few glasses not knowing why, as you slurp down this very sweet, tasty beverage.. . All in all, I'd return for dessert and drinks.  Just a heads up though...steer clear of the creepy guy on his laptop sitting at the end of the bar with a very x-rated wallpaper.  My boyfriend and I found it very odd that he was sitting there pretending to look at spreadsheets while he casually allowed customers accidentally looking in his direction to catch a glimpse of his bizarre and inappropriate wallpaper on his laptop.  It might just ruin the mood of your night during your stay at P'cheen.  ;)
