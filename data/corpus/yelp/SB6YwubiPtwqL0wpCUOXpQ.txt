The sandwiches are not bad! These are great if you're in town and just want to kill two birds with one stone; good grub and good history! I recommend having breakfast here, it's really good! the ham is served like chops and the country gravy soaked bread is pretty delicious..too bad the you have to order the gravy on the side!
