ok mofos. we drove here from sf on our way to palm springs just to hit din tai fung..  i had heard so much about this place and their legendary xiao long bao. we ran into traffic on the way to LA (surprise surprise) so it actually took like 7 and a half hours to get to DTF. we got there just around 9:10.. 20 mins before closing. the hostess was hot. Our xiao long bao was not. I think they were old ones..  the skin was dry and the meat inside was on the verge of being room temp. I actually liked the shrimp sui mai better b/c they were piping hot. So yah..  to say that I was kind disappointed is an understatement. There were moments in time when I was screaming down the downhill highway area zipping around 18 wheeler trucks goin 115 mph cheating death for some orgasm in your mouth xiao long bao from DTF!!!. . Anyways, we came back b/c I desperately wanted to give them a second chance.. so after our golf trip was done in Palm Springs we came back to DTF. The hostess was a dude so that sucked.. but our xiao long bao was FRESH. They were excellent and close to what I was expecting. We also got some spicy beef noodle soup and it was fucking good. The vegetable and pork dumplings were nasty though. Totally dry and too much veggie taste.
