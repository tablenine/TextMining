Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
This place isn't as good as other places I have tried and they try to rip you a new one with their prices.  It's about $8.00 for a bowl of noodles which comes with just ginger and green onions.  Everything else added cost extra!  An egg will cost you a whoopin' 75 cents (USD!).  I know our currency has gone to ish... but common... I can think of at least 2 other things I could buy with 75 cents that are more worth it.  . . Enough about the expensive eggs.  The service there is pretty good, but the wait is horrendous (especially since they don't allow you to wait inside).  Upon my first visit ever I found a hair follicle in my crab cake.  They handled the situation well, but still charged for that appetizer!. . Will only be coming back if I meet a very hot Japanese exchange student and she only wants to eat at this very restaurant.
