Restaurant: Wurstküche
Category: Hot Dogs
As a Chicagoan, I am quite picky when it comes to sausages but Wurstküche definitely met and exceeded all my expectations.  If I lived in L.A., I could see myself going to this place on a weekly basis.  I love the decor and ambiance, it's very chill.  The food is amazing and the beer selection is quite impressive.  I had the duck and bacon sausage, it was fantastic.  I had no idea such an awesome meat combo even existed.  It's the kind of place you want to go back to over and over again to try all the different items available.  I'll definitely stop by the next time I am in town.
