Took my parents out for Father's Day. Perfect spot. Why? It's one of the very few restaurants where they have an older classy crowd, great food, and INEXEPENSIVE prices! Forreal. It's like an UES vibe but in the middle of the East Village.Gotta get the meatballs for appetizer. That was the best dish. Tried the octopus just bc i thought it'd be interesting. Not bad but i wouldn't get it again. Â I had the moussaka, pops had the pork chops, and mama the greek salad. We polished off 2 bottles of white wine recommended by our friendly server. This was my second time here and defintely not my last.
