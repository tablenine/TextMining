This place feels like you just stepped into a high end restaurant in New York City. I am so glad that this place is helping to establish the restaurant row in Downtown LA. The decor is very simple and clean, white and gold everywhere. . . There is a bakery which makes really expensive pastries, small grocery section, a bar and of course the restaurant. The price isnt that bad at all for dinner, there are choices of Pizza, Pasta and even Tapas. The Breakfast i thought was a little over rated and extremely expensive. . . The overall environment is 5 star but the food was average (3 star).
