Best to do the sharing thing at this place. Treat each dish like they are tapas and get the servers to bring out dished in rotations. . . The food is awesome if you are into the hummus, pita, lamb flatbread thing. Which I am. Also, the grilled eggplant was probably my favorite dish. Great snack. Sit next to the front window if you can so you can watch the passer-byers and catch a breeze if it isnt winter. Overall, I am for sure going back.
