Restaurant: Yolk
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
First things first: Yes, this place is crowded on the weekends and at lunch. This is what happens when a million people all try to go to one place at the same time, which happens when everyone leaves work for lunch or when all of the lushes roll out of bed at the same time on the weekends. . . I usually go weekday mornings, and have had some great experiences then. They've got an expansive menu. Mostly good stuff, although when a friend and I last ate there, they appeared to have prepared the crepes on the same grill as they had turkey or ham, as it had that tangy taste to it. Bad Yolk!. . The two nearest places to me are Yolk and Bongo Room and after a few tries of each I have to say I like Yolk much better. Nicer interior, more roomy, more menu choices and great food.
