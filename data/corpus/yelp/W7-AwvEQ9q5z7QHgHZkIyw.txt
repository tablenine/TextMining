Great place to take out of town guests as long as they are not afraid of heights. Of course it has the spectacular view, and a decent selection of drinks. We had a cheese plate that was quite delish the last time I was there. . . It's great to sit high above the driving masses during a rush hour sunset and watch as the red and white lights of the cars below snake their way home on 75/85, all the while sipping on a cold beer and eating spinach dip.
