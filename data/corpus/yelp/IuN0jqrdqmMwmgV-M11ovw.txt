Restaurant: Clarke&#39;s
Category: Diners
Out of the Three Clarke's I've been two (Evanston ,Lincoln Park ) this one has the worst service. I don't think any time I've ever been here I've had a good experience with the staff. . . That aside, food is good. . Big big portions worth their price. . I like Clarke's because of their "One egg" special. It's Egg (scrambled or fried), toast and potatoes for $2.99.  . If you like your southern style corn beef hash.. you know, all greesy, unhealthy and oh so good.. they have it here :). . In my college days we used to come to Clarkes for birthday dinners. It's open late and they have this AMAZING Charlie Brown brownie Sunday that makes even the biggest chocolate lover cry tears of joy.. . Oh, and I like their pancakes too. Good pancakes = good diner.. . For the best service check out the Clarkes in Lincoln Park.  Evanston is good too but it's usually packed and takes forever to get seated.
