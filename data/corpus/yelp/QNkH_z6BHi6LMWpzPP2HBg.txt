Bottega Louie! I have to admit I was very excited to try this place as I had read in the Times about its excellent menu options and modern European decor. And everyone in town buzzes about it.. . I loved the food, and the staff was great. To my surprise seating was extremely fast during a hectic lunch hour in DTLA with no reservations. Â Inside the energy was great, not too loud and everyone seemed to be getting the same great service my friend and I were. When our food came we were not disappointed. I had the Penne Pomodoro Pasta which has Tomato sauce, garlic &amp; extra virgin olive oil and house lemonade. It was a great choice, can't wait to go again and try another menu item.
