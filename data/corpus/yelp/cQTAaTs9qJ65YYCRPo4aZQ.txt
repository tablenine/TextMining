Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Hands down the best steak house in LA.  Me and my husband usually share a rib eye and can't finish...portions are generous and they give you the martini shaker when you order a drink - that's 2 glasses at the price of one.  And you can't eat at Mastros without trying the Butter Cake - this dessert will blow you away. Gary the piano guy is awesome and keeps the crowd entertained.  Crowd skews a little older, mostly 40 and above, but the atmosphere is great. There's no where else I'd rather go for a night of good food and good ambiance.
