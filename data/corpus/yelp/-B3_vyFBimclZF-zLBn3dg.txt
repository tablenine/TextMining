I've been here a few times and love the affordable, yummy thai food :). . It's in Hollywood, so I really thought they would jack up their prices, but it's nothing more extravagant than any other thai place I've been to in the LA area.  Bonus is the asian Elvis haha but one night I went and some lady almost killed Alicia Keys's "No One" for me.  I need to listen to my cd as redemption :)
