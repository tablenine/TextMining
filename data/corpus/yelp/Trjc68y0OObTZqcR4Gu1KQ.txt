Restaurant: Dante&#39;s Down the Hatch
Category: Fondue
I'd heard many great tales of people coming to this place and not wanting to leave. Jazz music, alligators, pasted peeping toms in the window of the girl's restrooms( and a cackling witch making fun of your hairdo). The food was great, the atmosphere was quite interesting, and the jazz music echoed throughout the restaurant ( if a little too loudly). I'd say you should probably go here once and then let your wallet recover for quite some time. While I've heard only good things about the desserts... they are extremelly stingy with them. I know, I know, it is hand-made and takes hours upon hours to create, but they have a limit of only one per night and you have to call it in waaayyyy ahead of time to even think about getting any. Also, they don't give you a choice on listening to the live music, they automatically charge you for it. Â I enjoyed the dining experience, but I won't be going back.
