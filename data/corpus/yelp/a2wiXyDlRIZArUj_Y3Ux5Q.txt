I was used to going to the Portos in Glendale, but decided to check out the Burbank location. In terms of food, the quality and taste are exactly the same, however it took forever just to get my latte and half a dozen cheese rolls. I understand that its a really busy place, but the Glendale location was always just as busy and got my order out efficiently. Parking was terrible as I watched people engage in screaming matches over stolen parking spaces. I'll be sticking to the Glendale location from now on.
