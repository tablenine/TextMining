I always expect this place to be better than it is.  But's it's still pretty good.  I love that it is open late, and the portions are pretty generous.  I personally love the magic caps, they come with a gigantic pile of onion curls!!!  Everything on the menu is pretty good, the bread can be a little hard on their sandwiches.  . . It's a little expensive for what it is, and now and then the service can be really slow, but overall it's a good late night spot, as long as you can deal with hipsters.
