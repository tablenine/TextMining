Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Food: Best fried chicken on either coast. This is what comfort food is all about, albeit on the salty side. They have gots to fry it in like trans fat, peanut, butter, pork oil, how else can it be so tasty? Then the gallon of gravy dumped on top with no regard to safety or health for that mater, yet the skin somehow stays crispy? Now this 8th wonder of the world gets topped of with like a pound of butter. Surviving the mini-stroke I received just by looking at it, I proceed to devour it and can honestly tell you that I am willing to flirt with death again. Crunchy skin, moist white and dark meat, and the gravy just lubes it down (o god that sounded so wrong).. . Well onto some low points, the waffle flat out sucked. Tasteless, unless you actually use that side dish of butter provided and gallon of syrup. The biscuit was flat and soggy too. Unless soggy style is LA style and I'm missing something, this is not good eats.. . Drink: Down that soda and order another. Then another. You might want to consider a soda to go too. . Me: Food is salty. Colonel Hans Landa: It's a bingo!. . Service/Crowd/Ambiance: Diner service, diner layout, not diner food. Get a booth over the table, more spacious. Crowd has a fair mix of locals and tourists. You can spot the tourists taking pictures out by the entrance where the Roscoe's logo is. I was there waiting for my turn too. Head over to the Grove afterwards and walk the itis off, there is no where else in LA one can walk it seems.
