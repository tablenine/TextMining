This place kinda sucks.  I've ended up there a few times b/c sometimes you are just hungry after poker and it's late at night.  I can't really say that I've had anything close to spectacular.  Usually, I order breakfast or the french dip.  The boyfriend had the mac and cheese balls and the chicken fried steak last time and neither were great.  Chicken fried steak was really dry but the gravy was ok.  . The club was almost inedible.  Last time, the french dip was made of roast beef that should have been at subway.  Do give them point for the onion rings, but I'm on an onion ring kick right now.  . Nothing worth writing about and I'm looking for late night options in the Echo Park area should anyone have an idea.
