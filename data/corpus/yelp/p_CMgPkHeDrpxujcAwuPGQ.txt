Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
Noodle Town isn't a bad spot to grab a quick cheap eat after a night of partying and drinking. You can pretty much always count on Noodle Town being opened in the wee hours of the night on weekends.. . I personally lover their Singapore Mei Fun noodles here, it's one of the more authentic tasting recipes I've tried of this dish. . . Other than the food, late hours, and cheap prices, there's not much else to say about this place. Typical Asian restaurant service (rude), no ambience at all, and a bit dirty. But this is typical for small Chinatown restaurants. I'd rather eat here than 69 or Wo Hop though.
