Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
The best thing about the Hungry Cat is the food.  They've got a great chef and are always changing things up yet it's consistently fresh and delicious.  They also have a full bar.  What's better than oysters and a cocktail?  Not much.  Unless you're paying.  Then it's even better. . . My only complaint about this place is the size and location.  It's at Vine and Sunset.  There is always a ton of traffic.  Both foot and car.  And the restaurant itself is just too small.  Last time I was there I made a reservation days in advance and asked for a good table.  Instead, they seated us right next to the door so I was constantly being bumped into and freezing!
