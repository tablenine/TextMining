Service is excellent and the food is good, but the margaritias are not great at all.  . . My mom has a strong aversion to cilantro.  Rather than having guacamole on her chimichanga, the waiter suggested avocado on top instead.  That made her meal.. . We had the house margaritas, and they are way too sweet.  In addition to the salt on the rim, I had to pour sour in the glass to neutralize the sugary flavor.. . I had a chimichanga with guacamole and my fiancee had the enchiladas with mole.  The mole sauce had a mesquite, smokey taste with a spice at the end.  I liked it since most moles taste like chocolate to me.  That was stellar.  My food was ok.. . Nothing to write home about but the service is great.  The interior is cramped but refreshing juxtaposition with the uninviting signage.
