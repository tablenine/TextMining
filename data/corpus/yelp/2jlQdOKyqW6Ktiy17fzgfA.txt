So I just recently moved to downtown and I was stoked to try this place out.  And the verdicts in: its fan-freaking-tastic, the perfect fusions of Italian and French cuisine!  Whether it's just for a cappuccino and croissant with a friend in the morning or for one of their gourmet sandwiches (seriously, try one) in their restaurant side, its perfect.  My friend and I both got one of their sandwiches, which we were a bit wary of because, well, it's a sandwich.  The presentation was beautiful, making it seem way fancier.  It's not the cheapest place around but their attention to detail, from décor to food presentation more than makes up for it.  My only qualm was I wasn't really wowed by their macrons, the chocolate caramel and coconut were really good, but the rest really didn't impress me.  However I did study French pastries in Paris so I'm a rather tough critic on those...!
