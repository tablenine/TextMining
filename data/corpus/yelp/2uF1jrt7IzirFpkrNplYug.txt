A year later and trying the Hainanese chickren rice and typing this review....sadly and the taste is still not there at all. And seriously, the blob of youngsters still chain smoking outside Savoy is a seriously disturbing and disgusting sight. . . All proper techniques that go into preparing HCR are not accomplished here. The rice doesn't taste like it has been fried 'raw' in garlic, scallions and chicken broth. Then cooked properly. . . The chicken still doesn't taste like it's been ice-bathed after being cooked. This is a crucial step in preparing HC and Savoy missed it. . . I am not asking for a 100% match to the best HCR places in Singapore. Because there is a specific kind of chicken to use, ingredients (fresh pandan leaves are hard to find here in the US) etc. But least using the proper techniques are important. . . How I know? Cos I help my wife prepare HCR at home. The preparation is tedious and requires a lot of patience. . . And what's with the chili sauce with a fake tangy taste to it? Use real lime juice, garlic, ginger, chicken broth and of course fresh chili. How difficult is that....Sigh...
