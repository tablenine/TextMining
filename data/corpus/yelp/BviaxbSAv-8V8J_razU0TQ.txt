I'm giving a Shout-out for today's lunch! Three reasons why:. . 1 The calamari! I am a picky girl about my squid, and so is my dear friend and lunch companion. We both agreed that our dish was perfectly cooked (no one likes rubber bands masquerading as calamari, right?), and the aioli and marinara were both delicious, plus my friend liked the fresh jalapenos tossed in.. . 2 The chicken empanadas! On the tapas menu, two empanadas served over fresh chopped tomatoes and corn (like a chilled little salad). Yummy!. . 3 Firefly, served over ice with a splash of water and a twist of lemon. Enough said.. . Surprisingly, given our 11:30-ish arrival and 1pm departure, the place wasn't crowded. Service was attentive (we ate at the bar) and despite having to pay-to-park (a bit pricey at Colony Square since there's no valet at lunch), the atmosphere was worth it- great for chatting, catching up and getting ready for a good weekend! If you're not inclined to be part of "The Scene" this place can be given to at night . . . try lunch!
