Restaurant: Sushi Go 55
Category: Sushi Bars
This place gets packed during the weekends, so if you want to try the place for the 1st time I recommend going on a wed or thurs nite when the crowds are less.. . The place is quite small, and the menu is a little confusing.  If you like sushi and don't know what to order I recommend their deluxe Chirashi, it has a little of everything and the presentation was amazing.. . Service: Good, nothing exceptionally. . Atmosphere: Noisy during weekends, weekdays are pretty quiet.. . Food:  Excellent!  Im more into the appetizers, so try the grilled yellowtail collar.  The spider roll was pretty good as well.  Sushi was fresh and portions are generous.. . Price: Reasonable, considering the prices at almost all the other LA sushi bars are about the same price.
