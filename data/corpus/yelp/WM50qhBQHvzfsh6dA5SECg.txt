Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
The portions are tiny, and not a fan of the cost of the burgers, but the concept and atmosphere is great. The tempura onion rings &amp; roasted garlic aioli sauce is awesome. I had the umami burger &amp; manly burger, both were great. I'd recommend sharing 3 burgers between 2 people.
