Restaurant: Rodan
Category: Nightlife
Last month I went to Chicago on business. My coworkers and I all have friends in the area, so we decided to get a handful together and take them out on the company dime. One girl suggested Rodan to which I said "sure" knowing only it was in Bucktown.. . There was no wait for a table, which was nice due to the fact we were tired from work, but should have been a sign that maybe, just maybe, this place wasn't exactly the next Top Chef host restaurant.... . My one moment of happiness was, while looking over the drinks, being able to order a 90 minute Dogfish Head IPA (this isn't available in California where I call "home") while everyone else was gulping down the too-sweet-for-me lychee martinis.. . So we all order food, I suggested we order the wasabi fries and tuna ceviche.. . Boy, was I wrong. The wasabi fries weren't even up to Jack in the Box standards (invisible wasabi, when was this invented?!), and the tuna ceviche both resembled in appearance and taste that of low-grade cat food.. . I can't even write anymore.. Just thinking about it... oh god.. . BLARGH!!
