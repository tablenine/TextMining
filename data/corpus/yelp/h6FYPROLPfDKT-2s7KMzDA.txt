The best juicy pork dumplings in Los Angeles.. . The Juicy Pork Dumplings (number 50, $7.25) had more soupy juice than the Juicy Pork/Crab Dumplings (number 51, $9.00).  Eat them while they are hot because the wrapping becomes plastic when cold.. . . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . . Spicy roast beef noodle soup (number 3, $7.25).  The soup and meat are good.  There is a lack of vegetables and the noodles are a little too soft for me.. . . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . . Shrimp Fried Rice (number 8, $6.75).. . . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . . Rice and Pork Shiaomai (number 55, $7.75).. . . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . . The service is good and maybe too good as all the food comes immediately and simultaneously.  It then becomes a race to eat everything before it cools.  Next time I think I will ask them to stagger the dishes into courses.. . I do think the Taipei branch tastes better.  Joe's Shanghai and Joe's Ginger in New York City is juicier and also tastes better.
