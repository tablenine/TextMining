Walked over to Stats following the Falcons game to continue the victory celebration.  We went up to the rooftop bar to swill as it was a beautiful day.  There was a nice size bar and plenty of seating - high tops, wooden benches, and decent size round tables.  Ordered the bucket of Miller Lite - five 16 oz bottles for $18.  Great deal!  We didn't order food, so can't review the eats.  However, looked like nachos were a big hit.  Everywhere you looked it seemed people were chowing on nachos.. . The interior consists of brick walls, iron railings and TV's everywhere.  A nice size bar with two dining rooms on either side.   Also, thought the individual restrooms downstairs with a red light/green light system was a nice touch.  Pardon the pun!. . Definitely liked the atmosphere and will go back to try the food.
