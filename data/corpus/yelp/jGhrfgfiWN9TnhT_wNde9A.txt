Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
OK. I am not a fan of chain restaurants at all.  However, I love the cheesecake factory.  My mom and I do lunch here once a month and have a few favorites on the menu.. . We love love love the brown bread.  I've tried to re-create it at home many times, with no success.  The sweet molasses and chewy texture is pure love. . . Favorites on the menu include: Thai chicken wrap appetizers, herb crusted salmon salad, chinese chicken salad and garlic mashed potatoes.  The sandwiches are enormous, and the entrees could feed a small family.  The chocolate cake is almost the best chocolate cake I've ever had.  My ex and I used to come JUST for the chocolate cake. . . The only thing I don't like is the wait.  I can't believe they don't take reservations.
