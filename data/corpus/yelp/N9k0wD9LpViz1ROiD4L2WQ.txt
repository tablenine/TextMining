My order: alligator and pork sausage in an artisan roll bread, Belgian fries laced with truffle oil, and Fentiman's Curiosity Cola.. . My impression: the gator was tasty but not as succulent was I thought. Perhaps it was lean meat to make it pretty healthy. The truffled fries were magnificent. They have a variety of homemade dipping sauces but I liked the fries by themselves. Liked? Actually it's love. I washed it down with Fentiman's Curiosity Cola, a fermented botanical cola which tasted like a cross between regular cola and ginger ale. It was tasted great but I thought it was a bit too pricey for a soft drink (about $5).. . Environment: distressed brick building with a modern twist in woodwork, cafeteria-style seating with some individual high tables, a bar area, and outdoor patio seating. It's hip, with DJ-spun music and great people.. . I rate it 4.5.
