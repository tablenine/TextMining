Found one of these trucks last night. It was at a private Halloween party. There was no line when we got there. Had the short rib burrito, short rib sliders, chicken sliders, and the black jack quesadilla. All the food has outstanding flavor, size and wasn't that spicy. Can't wait for the trucks to come close to my town. They were out of the dessert, so that sucked. Can't wait to find these trucks again.
