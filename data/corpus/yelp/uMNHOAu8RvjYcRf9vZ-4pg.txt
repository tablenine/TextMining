Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
It's not as well-known as Smoque but Smoke Daddy has never seemed to fail me as far as service, taste, and quality.  I love the selection of 3 different sauces at the table.  Half-price burgers on Thursday is worth a go as well.  . . Oh, and I've seen the same band play there twice and they are great.
