Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
Last visit: April 2009. Friday dinner for two.. . This is my favorite location for my favorite restaurant! Great environment with multiple seating areas and location is fantastic (near Millennium Park). Food and service is always great!. . If you've never been, get the stuffed pizzas! I always get the large stuffed pepperoni and you'll do the same if it's your first time! However, keep in mind these things are thick and take time to cook (40 minutes to an hour depending on how busy). You can avoid the wait by preordering by calling in advance and letting them know when you will be stopping by to eat, which is what my friends and I always do.. . The only downside to this location is that it is always relatively busy when going for lunch or dinner on the weekend. Because of this, preordering in advance will not guarantee you a seat.. . Value scale: 10/10.
