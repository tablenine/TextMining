This place is DEFINITELY going into my regular breakfast/brunch rotation.  While the atmosphere might scare the tourists (and probably some locals), isn't that a good thing when all you want is to eat your yummy eggs in peace?  Another bonus is you get to watch the hordes lined up in front of the Flying Biscuit and laugh, since you'll get the same biscuity goodness without the hellacious wait!. . We went at about 10:30 on a Saturday, and we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a seat.  My boyfriend and I both had omelettes--his was the Felix (with ham and cheese and a few veggies), and mine was the garden (with peppers, onions, tomatoes, cheese, and cilantro).  Both were perfectly cooked and very fresh-tasting, and they didn't skimp on the fillings.  Let me put it this way--my dad's omelettes are my benchmark for perfection, and this is the closest I've found to that mark.. . We also split some Paris Texas Toast, which was good but fairly standard.  The biscuits were AWESOME, since they were sliced and then thrown on the griddle with butter.  The beans were good, but I didn't care for the taters--I just really like my breakfast potatoes to be crunchy, and these weren't.  Coffee was strong and refilled frequently.  Service was friendly and fast.. . Can't wait to go back!
