O, how I wanted to love this place, but I just couldnt get that excited about it.  My boyfriend and I went here for a lovely night out, but we just kept giggling over how pretentious all of the food was.  Despite the fact that everything came out prefectly primped on our plates, the only thing I was blown away by was a mushroom soup.  I honestly don't really remember what else we had, it was that forgetable.  . . Being a veggie, I wish I had more options for a nice vegetarian night out, but usually I have to choose from one or two items on an otherwise expansive menu.  Maybe I'll give it another shot when farmer's market time rolls around.
