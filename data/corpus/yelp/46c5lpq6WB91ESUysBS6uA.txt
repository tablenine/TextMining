Restaurant: The Flying Biscuit
Category: American (Traditional)
I went here with a friend who raved about The Flying Biscuit - and boy was she right! I ordered a Bellini and the salmon omelette (I don't quite remember if it was an omelette or just an egg dish). Either way, it was delicious! There was also some sort of dill creme fraiche or sauce mixed in that was fantastic. And, of course, the biscuits were great. I am quite demanding of biscuits when it comes to texture and flavor. This one (or two) moved high up on my list. I can't wait to go back to try the other delicious options on their menu.
