Came here with the family on a Thursday night.  I was not a big fan of the Buddha heads at the entrance, as it reminds me of all the pillaging that goes on in Asia at various sacred and religious sites.. . Decor was very nice and elegant in the main dining area.  Pretty impressive for the area.  We went with crab rangoon and lollipop shrimp for the appetizers.  They were pretty average, nothing special.. . I guess this is a big BYOB place, since every other diner came in with a bottle of wine.  Server did not ask if we wanted anything besides water.. . Curry Tofu Tofu, grilled chicken in garlic sauce, seafood chow mein, and honey walnut shrimp were the entrees.  We ate family style, split among the 4 of us.. . I would recommend avoiding the curry tofu tofu at all costs.  The grilled chicken was too tough for my liking, the seafood chow mein was good, but a little salty, but the honey walnut shrimp was very good.. . I give them credit for using fresh ingredients, and for style.  No complaints about service.  Overall it was a decent dining experience, but I don't see myself coming back anytime soon.
