So, remember when I said the next time I'd go to the Highlander I would order something different because they are known to have a decent menu and kitchen? . . Yeah, well, eating there three times after my initial review of The Highlander, I'm still eating the mushroom burger with Swiss cheese and tater tots.  And washing it down with a pint of cider.. . You all can have your H&amp;F burger, Farm Burger, and FLIP.  I'm hooked on The Highlander for my burger fix.  :)
