Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
I am a huge fan of Mexican good. It's one of those things that always makes my "if you're stranded on an island" list. And I love de cero. Not my fave Mexican restaurant (that still goes to Blue Agave) but I love their menu and their margaritas are good enought that my bro- in-law doesn't remember even eating there. Definitely a little fancier (aka expensive) but worth it and I love the vibe on Randolph...
