After spending somewhere around 500 hours of my life eating Mexican food in the Wicker Park/Bucktown/East/Ukrainian Village neighborhood I'm ready to call El Barco Mariscos the best option.  I'm not aware of any Mexican joint in Chicago gives you a more diverse menu or better quality food.  . . I order the fajitas (salmon, beef, or vegetarian) almost every time I eat here.  Regardless of which kind you order, the fajitas are served with a ton of great vegetables.  The chips are crisp and the approach they take in presenting them is pretty cool.  The salsas are really heavy but taste great.  . . I've had the seafood platters, but they don't feel like Mexican food and I don't like having my entire meal consist of chips, salsa and fish.  If you are a seafood platter type person, you get a lot of bang for your buck here.  I'm not into it, just an idiosyncrasy.  . . This place does get loud and crowded and the drinks are pretty expensive.  All that stuff is irrelevant when you are just there to get fat off their food.
