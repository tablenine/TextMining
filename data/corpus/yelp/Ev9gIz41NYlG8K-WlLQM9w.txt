Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Roscoe's is the quickest path to a heart attack.  Before coming here, I never would have thought that fried chicken and waffles could ever mix.  This place is the bomb and the food tastes great.. . The fried chicken was done very well and not dry like most other ones.  What sets this place apart was the side of waffles and generous serving of syrup and gravy to go with the meal.  Our party also ordered an assortment of different side dishes, like their collared greens and mac-n-cheese.  Both were tasty.. . Will definitely make a trip back the next time I'm in LA.  This place could be an excellent meal no matter what time of the day it is -- especially for a midnight snack or breakfast!
