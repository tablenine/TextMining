Restaurant: CUT

YUM! I've been wanting to try Cut for the longest time, and finally got the chance this past weekend. Is it everything I hoped for? YUP!. . The decor is very chic and modern. I love the portraits of all the celebs up on the walls. Comfy chairs, nice table settings, etc.. . Our waiter was very helpful and so sweet. Also, very honest with the menu. We went for Valentine's day, so it was a preset menu. I had the Fuji apple salad, which was very fresh with a perfect amount acid. My boyfriend had the crab and lobster cocktail, which was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend that for starters.. . We shared the porterhouse (medium rare), which was mouth watering good. At first, I thought it looked a little too much on the rare side, but ended up being just right. It came with creamed spinach, potato puree, and onion rings.. . For dessert, we shared the banana royale. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but I actually wanted more! Had I not been so full, I probably would've devoured it all.
