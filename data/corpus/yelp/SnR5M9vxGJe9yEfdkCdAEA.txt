Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Oh yeah! I'm feeling the vibe ... feeling the Flo!. . It is amazing how many great brunch places there are in this great city. You can only get a better appreciation of this if you lived in various places such as myself. I send my visiting peeps to my favorites but it is surprising how that list keeps growing. Well I'm moving Flo close to the top because it absolutely rocks!. . To get a better gauge of their menu, I ordered one item from the savory side - the chilaquiles. I also ordered one slice of their 3 berry French toast. The chilaquiles was awesome especially if you like it spicy as the poblano salsa throughout the dish kicks it up a notch. And the french toast was really really good too and it is nice to know they have a Brazilian french toast (tropical tasting) and some pancake options too.. . Damn - I just want to go back now! The curse of finding a great place for the first time just leaves you with this thirst for more! Oh yeah! I'm feeling the vibe ... feeling the Flo!. . But I digress, Flo has pretty good coffee and surprise surprise it costs less than 2 dollars - other places should follow suit! You can have some complimentary coffee while you wait. Speaking of waiting, yes this place rocks and as such, you will have to wait during busy times. I tend not to feel this pain as much since I go alone most of the time, I find single diners wait very little for a seat at the bar. However, I wouldn't mind waiting the average 45 mins if I come with friends as I know it would be worth it in the end.. . Go feel the vibe ... feel the Flo!
