didn't get a chance to try the food, as this was the last stop of a night that started in downtown LA this past weekend.. . the musicians were entertaining, and i found the crowd to be diverse, fairly unpretentious, and talented. :) it was nice to visit LA and to be thrown into a crowd of mainly mid-20 to mid-30 year olds. i haven't been able to find a bar like this in Phoenix.. . the music, though on the loud side, was just soft enough to allow a conversation between 2 ppl w/o yelling. i prefer it this way versus too quiet. . . i had a couple of gin and tonics, but i now wish i went with a tom collins. ...i read in another review it is a specialty here. the bartender and the musicians were very friendly (i sat at one of the tables that blocks in the band).. . parking was a piece of cake, this time. It wasn't so easy last time I was here around 2004. I parked a block south on Vermont. IMO, you'll likely find parking easier than at the bars more dense neighborhoods farther west.. . Out of 10 (10 being the best, 5 average). Decor: 7. Food: N/A. Service: 8
