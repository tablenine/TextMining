Restaurant: Yamato Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Yamato was pretty solid overall. Went with good company for happy hour, nearly every dish was half-off. . . Drinks were tasty, good variety and decently made. . . Sashimi was very fresh, we had the hamachi and salmon. In addition, some amaebi, and the 911 roll. Everything was very fresh but what really stood out was the sashimi.. . Ambiance was okay, I'd say it's probably better at night time.
