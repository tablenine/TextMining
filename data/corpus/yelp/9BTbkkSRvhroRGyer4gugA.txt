believe all the good reviews out there...it's true, philippe's has amazing food!! the beef french dip sandwich is to die for...i think about it a lot. i dont live downtown, but definitely worth a drive on the weekends.. . parking here can be kind of tough. i usually just drive past it and then turn right at the first stop sign. there's plenty of street parking near the dim sum place.. . it's worth the wait people!
