If you cook greek food like myself this is where you want to go to buy your products. They have the best feta cheese, kalamata olives and even ship Loukanico in from Boston. They have great baklava and this is my favorite ethnic shop in LA. Dont expect the cafe to be as good as the store, its just okay...would be a decent bite to eat but all in all I give this place a 87/100. Buy the goods and cook them yourself.
