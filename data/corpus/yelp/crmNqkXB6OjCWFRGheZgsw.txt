Restaurant: P&#39;cheen
Category: American (New)
P'cheen is really supposed to be cool.  It's supposed to be sexy.  It's supposed to be hot.  But honestly for some reason that I cant put my finger on it really isn't everything it's "supposed to be".. . It's dark, the ambiance is pretty low key/sensual, but at the same time there is an energy in the place that competes with the vibe they are trying to create.. . The drinks are pretty decent.  The service is pretty good.  At one point the owner/chef suggested a sauce with calamari since they dont officially have a "marinara" type sauce for dipping.  It turned out pretty good.. . The calamari is tasty, but nothing really to write home about.  Decent spot, with good service...food is ok...
