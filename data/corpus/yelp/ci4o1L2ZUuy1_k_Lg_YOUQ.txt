Where else can you find a place that serves chicken with waffles? . . I had huge expectations for this place when I first went with my brother, Dad, and Wilmar D. I instantly fell in love with their waffles, but to be honest, the chicken was average to me. It's juicy and has good flavor, but it didn't stand out among other chicken that I have tasted.. . The next time that I went here was with some of my friends. I wasn't feeling chicken and I remembered how much I loved their waffles, so I ordered two waffles. NEVER do this. I'm warning you. Once I was halfway through the 2nd waffle, I thought I was going to die from SWEETNESS poisoning. Plus I was sososososo full. Now I understand why they serve chicken with waffles; its the perfect balance of salty and sweet. I had to take some chicken from my friends to kill the overwhelming sweetness of the waffle.. . ANYWAY, enough about the food, I think that it's cool that they have a guy outside that directs parking :). . Oh yea, some advice, if you have a large group, be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes before you are seated. We went at a really random time (3pm) and they were still pretty busy.. . +1 star for the waffle/chicken combo. +2 star for yummy waffles. +1 star for that parking guy. -1 star for average-ish chicken. . (I won't take off for the 2 waffle being too sweet thing, cuz that was my fault. but i'm warning you, DO NOT order two waffles without some chicken to balance it out!! Stick with what's special about this place, CHICKEN and WAFFLES. Don't be a weirdo like me :)
