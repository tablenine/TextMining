Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
What was everyone smoking when they came in here? Seriously, this food is not good. I'm not sure if the problem is specific to this Roscoe's or if it's a universal thing, but their chicken and waffles did not work.. . Food: I'm not against the idea of mixing chicken and waffles together, but the truth of the matter is that when you combine BAD chicken and BAD waffles you've just created a recipe for disaster. The chicken was dry as hell. I seriously wanted to just throw it away. Truthfully the waffles were okay, but it wasn't like I'd sell my left arm for a taste. The condiments are pretty limited as well. . . Value: Cheap? NO. A dinner here will definitely not cost you under $10. More like.. $18-25. . . Service: Pretty standard. . . Atmosphere: The restaurant was super dirty inside (I had some weird lip marks on my glass and my utensils were gross). It was dimly lit and more in a creepy than mysterious fashion. . . Synopsis: Don't be sucked in by the hype. As a lover of both fried chicken and waffles eating at Roscoe's was one of the most disappointing times in my life.
