Yesterday, I wanted to want my usual beloved checca. But . . .it just wasn't quiiite what sounded perfect. So after a bit of menu-perusing, I went for the calamari (and decided I could always get the pasta to-go, and have it for dinner!).. . For $7, a huge plate. Even better, it was delicious - all "rings" (the tentacly pieces creep me out), lightly fried just so, and with a yummy marinara sauce and fresh lemon wedges for squeezing over the dish.. . Exactly what I wanted, as it turned out - and certainly something I'll order again!
