Black. Red. Shiny. Graphic. Â . . A lovely interior. A little bit like walking into a giant lacquered bento box.. . You might be able to walk in on a Saturday night without a reservation and get seated in a reasonable amount of time. Maybe even no waiting.. . Trendy but understatedly accessible, with a nice waiter than even told a couple of funnysarcastic jokes.. . Nice weather? Sushi on the patio! Eating sushi outdoors in hot weather, not recommended. But with an autumn or summer breeze and a glass of white wine.. . Eat more sushi than you thought your stomach could handle.
