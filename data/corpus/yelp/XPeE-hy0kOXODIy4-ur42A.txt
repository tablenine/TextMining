This is where we, the cool kids,  went in High School to smoke and have coffee because we were too young to do anything else.. . Occasionally, we would talk about  Really Deep, Intellectually Stimulating things like, "OMG did you see what happened on Dawson's last night?!". . I have definitely grown out of this scene. The food is not good, the coffee is by no means memorable.  I do have some really funny memories of this place, and for that, TWO FLAMING BRIGHT STARS!
