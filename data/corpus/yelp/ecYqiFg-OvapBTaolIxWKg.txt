Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The food is not too bad and the dumplings were very tasty. One of our pork dumpling plates were undercooked but I think it was because they had a mad rush of customers. Whenever that happens, expect to get your food fast....very fast. Get there a little early if you can. . . The service was good. I would of given it a 4 star but they jacked up Â my pork dumplings.....
