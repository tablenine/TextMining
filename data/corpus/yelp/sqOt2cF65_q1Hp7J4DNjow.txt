Ok ...disclaimer before you read my review: - i guess i derno really too much about how a french dip should taste.... . I think this place is waaay too hyped... . the sandwich is FREAKIN tiny..i can eat two of those.. yes the lemonade and coffee are FREAKIN cheap - but hella small. . . i feel like you get what you pay for - which is cheap but VERY SMALL PORTIONS.. . and the sandwich is just ok - it's NOT to die for and certainly not worth the wait...i think we waited around 20 min? on a sunday afternoon.. . O MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CASH...they are cash only!
