I have to say, I really like the way that the waiters come and present a huge tray filled with slabs of meat. The cuts are really impressive to look at, all next to each other on a serving tray. My favorite appetizer is the crab with avocado salad. Yum yum, just enough spice on the crab and nice slices of avocado to top it off.. . They cook the steaks perfectly--medium steaks that are not overcooked. The steaks are really so big that it's hard to fit in the sides as well.. . Now for dessert... they came out with a half-dome of ice cream topped with nuts and caramel. The ice cream came with its own steak knife.. . I would definitely return!
