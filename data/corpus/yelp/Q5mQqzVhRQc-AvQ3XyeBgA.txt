Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
Um this place is awesome. Cheesy tiki decor aside, the food is really good and cheap! It's weird-- kind of Asian but not? I believe I got the chicken teriyaki last time, and it was really good! Macaroni salad, also good! I wasn't sure what to expect from a Hawaiian place...Very simple restaurant, reminds me of beachside restaurants in the Pacific Islands (sans beach-- we are in ATL remember!). If I worked closer, I would for sure come here all the time.
