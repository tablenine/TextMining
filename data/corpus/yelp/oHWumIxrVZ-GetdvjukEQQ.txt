I was pretty grumpy after waiting for over an hour to have breakfast at 1:00 pm. Low blood sugar, long waits and smoking hipsters could not ruin this place. I loved the gourmet chili with the possibly homemade tortilla chips and sour cream. Best ever. In an attempt to balance things, we chose to split one of the healthiest things on the menu (the egg white scramble with pesto, shrimp and garlic toast) with one of the junkiest (peanut bubba french toast with crumbled nutter butters and whipped cream). It was worth the wait and worth the indigestion that followed.
