Great place.  Nice decor and ambiance, which almost screams tapas the second you walk in, not even sure why, bu trust me it does.. . On Sundays this is supplemented by $10 all-you-drink Sangria and great live Flamenco music (Sasha who plays here on Sundays is awesome!). . As far as food...  You must try the patatas bravas.  Amazing!  Perfectly cooked with a nice sauce to accompany them.  The empanadas are great as well.
