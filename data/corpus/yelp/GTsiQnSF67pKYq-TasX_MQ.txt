Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I've eaten in most of the locations and they all taste the same. This is a like it or don't kind of place. I always order the chicken and waffles and the chicken is always alright but then I could live without ever eating chicken again so i'm not the one to ask but I love the waffles. Let me be clear, it's Â not the waffle that's so good, it's smothering the butter on it and then drowning it in syrup that does it for me. I wouldn't even dream of saying it's the best, but like many things this place grows on you. I used to order the gizzards but they're so greasy they just sit in your stomach for days and I got tired of the feeling. I like them though, if they had a half or quarter order i'd probably still order them. The mac is okay. Great for Sunday bruch.. . Best Plates: Chicken and Waffles, Fried Gizzards. . Food - B.
