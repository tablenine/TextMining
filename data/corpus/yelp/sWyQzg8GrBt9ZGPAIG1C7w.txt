I first tried this place before I went to a Dodger game with my friends. It's famous for their french dipped sandwhiches and they are pretty good. The first time I went it was packed, perhaps because it was a weekend and a dodger game day. The line wait was about 15 minutes that time. The second time I went on a weekday in between lunch and dinner time and it wasn't crowded then. Didn't have to wait long in line. . . I had the beef dipped sandwich which was pretty good. I wasn't crazy about the macaroni salad, ok to try, don't think I would order that again. . . I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the area it's still worth a try.
