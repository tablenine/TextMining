We walked in at 1130 on a Monday and skipped the 30 min wait for a table by grabbing two seats at the counter. I had the "Poached y Papas", which is basically eggs benedict on potato skins. Joyce had the "noisetta" (nutella) french toast. Great food, interesting crowd of friendly folks, very friendly  waiter, quick service, great coffee... I dunno, maybe we caught everybody on a good day, but what's not to like? In a class with Dottie's and Mama's in SanFran. Highly recommended, if you don't mind a little side of chaos with your food.
