I must admit that I am a bit sad to write this review because I grew up just five minutes from this veritable institution of LA culture, and I definitely associate it with home. That being said, the only time I really enjoy the food is after a night (or afternoon) of drinking with buddies who haven't been here before. The meat is often quite bland and most of what they offer is lacking that certain something. Ah yes, flavor. . . This is definitely not authentic Mexican food and sometimes I feel like it survives on reputation alone and the ignorant (OK...uninformed) people who believe that coming here constitutes obtaining "Authentic" Mexican food. If you want Â "Authenticity," there are plenty of other places, several in this area even, that taste much better but may not be "sanitary" enough for your needs.
