It was stated that when my parents and my sister walked in, there was no 'host' and a woman at the 'bar' just stared.  Um, okay.  After about a few minutes of non-communication or greetings, they were finally seated.  I came in a bit later, and we looked over the menu.  It seemed somewhat appetizing.  I had the cheese popover with the mushroom - the portion itself was extremely small, and it was basically boiled mushrooms in a bit of a bland sauce with a huge cheese popover just set on top.  Mine was definitely the best-tasting compared to the other selections (even though it was at best, mediocre).  My dad had the enchiladas, and those were quite mushy and disgusting.  My mom had the sausage biscuits and gravy, in which the biscuits were overly salted and the sausage gravy was quite unappetizing - like a gravy gone wrong with bits of sausage bits throughout.  The french Challah toast with whipped cream and strawberries were the worst french toast ever - the batter was gross, the taste was gross, and it was just a nasty mess.  The egg with avocado sandwich?  Very soggy and anyone, (and I mean anyone) can make a better egg sandwich than that.  The french fries with the housemade mayo was just eh (the mayo itself had a little tang, and it wasn't a pleasant tang - I'd rather have packets of mayo instead); the cheesy grits were quite bland.  The presentation was okay, and I think at this place, the looks are quite deceiving - the taste definitely doesn't match.  Plus, the prices are quite steep for the poop they serve you.  Would I come back here?  Heck no.  Why this restaurant was rated top in the country, I really don't know.  The writer was on crack.
