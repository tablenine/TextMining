Every neighborhood deserves a Domino's alternative. This is definitely the neighborhood pizza joint that is consistently good and has jumbo slices, which is kitschy but also satisfying. When you're with a bunch of friends and all you want is a pizza pie on a lazy Sunday, do you look to Domino's? No, why would you when you can get free delivery from a clean, good pizzeria a block away. Everyone who is giving this place 2 stars are just wanna-be food critics from out of town who think that loud nonsensical criticism of any kind equals wit - it doesn't. This is quality neighborhood pizza and that is just that.
