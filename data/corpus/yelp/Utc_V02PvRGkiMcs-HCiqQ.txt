The best breakfast place in the world, period. The pumpkin pancakes are insane. The french toast is the best in the world and the "Yellow Brick Road" would be on anyone's "last meal" list. But the creme de la creme... their selection of chili is unparalleled (they probably have 30+ different kinds). Breakfast or lunch. Unlike other places with long lines, this one actually makes you glad you waited. ;-) Their potatoes, fresh squeezed orange juice, and their french-press coffee are also all amazing!. . Sadly, I just found out that the guy that made the chili passed away - and they have no plans to bring chili back. I'm changing my review from 5 to 4 stars. Understandable as this guy was simply awesome - it was the best chili ever.. . Still... go for the pancakes. I don't even LIKE pancakes and they are awesome. And forgot to mention... HUGE portions!
