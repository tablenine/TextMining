Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's has some of the BEST pastries on the planet.  It's definitely a popular place for socaler's, and can get quite crowded, but the Burbank location seems to be less crowded and the lines more organized than the original Glendale locale.  I recently discovered their breakfast offerings in the cafe, and highly recommend the ham (or chorizo) omelet on croissant.  Very reasonably priced for a deliciously decadent croissant sandwich (just gotta get there before 11:00 a.m.).  They've also got a ton of other sandwiches available all day. . . They also have to-die-for cheese rolls.  These should be a requirement to order these by the dozen so you won't regret making such a dinky initial order and craving that second...or third...or fourth.  The dessert and bakery selection is enormous, but a family favorite has always been their fruit tart.  Pretty much everything I've ever tried here is awesome, so I don't think you can really go wrong with anything you order.  Just be prepared to want to go back the next day for a round 2 the next day.
