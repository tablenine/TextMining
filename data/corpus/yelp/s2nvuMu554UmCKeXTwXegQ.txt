Restaurant: Clarke&#39;s
Category: Diners
My favorite late night place/diner ever. I often order skillets and have to take most of it home because they give you so much. The service is not great. For example, went there this past Saturday around bar closing time. My friend ordered a gyro omelet. The waitress did not write down our orders. Result: my friend did not get his gyro omelet but rather something else that relatively sounded like 'gyro omelet' I guess. I don't care if a waitress/waiter doesn't write down my order, but I do mind if they don't bring me the correct order. . . I do love Clarke's because they deal with drink people who are rude and leave crappy tips. I have gone there in such a state and basically fell asleep at the table...teeheee
