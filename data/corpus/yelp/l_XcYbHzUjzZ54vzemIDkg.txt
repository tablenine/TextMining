Restaurant: Sura Thai Bistro
Category: Thai
I can't decide if eating here is like dining at a trendy mental institution-as indicated by the all white interior complete with padded wall- or at a neighborhood diner on Saturn. Since I'm very familiar with both settings, I'll call it a toss-up.  Either way, it's fun. . . Sura is progressive Thai- both in food and drink. Probably one of the few Thai places that rank pineapple margaritas and Flirts (pomegrant and champagne) amongst its specialty bar treats. . . The food has it's moments, namely some of the appetizers and seafood dishes. Most notable were the papaya salad and sea bass, . . Other entrees were disappointments. The jungle curry was a thin soup that tasted like soy. We opted for the specialty pad thai with mango which was severely lacking in noodles. . . Overall, I must say it is an unbelievable value. I respect that Sura has resisted the urge to jack up prices when it could easily get away with it.  . . Though you can certainly find better Thai food elsewhere, you won't be able to swing in a bubble chair while waiting for a table.  For this reason alone, I'll be back.
