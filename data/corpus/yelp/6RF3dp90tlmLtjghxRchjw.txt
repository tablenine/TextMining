Based on the 70+ reviews, I guess that I was wrong about this being a hidden treasure on a relatively barren stretch of Western Avenue near Lincoln Square.  I stumbled upon it one afternoon, looking for any old place to have lunch.  How fortuitous.  . . Although lit rather dimly, it was friendly and inviting on a cold late-winter day.  The service was great, especially given that the duties were split between a woman and her 12ish-year-old daughter.  . . I had the tilapia tacos--awesome--and chicken enchiladas (very good).  They get an A+ for the food.  It tasted fresh and was obviously cooked to order, unlike some other Mexican joints.
