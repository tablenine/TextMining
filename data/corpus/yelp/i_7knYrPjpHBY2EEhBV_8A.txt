Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
I believe this little hidden treasure to be one of my favorite Cuban restaurants to date. If you aren't looking for it, you'll never find it. The lady who waits the tables, is also the owner. The restaurant is small but offers a patio for nice evenings and there couldn't have been more than 10 people in there total, but not because it's not abso-freaking-lutely mouth watering. . . Being someone that LOVES Tostones, I was excited that when they arrived at my table that they were just as good as I wished them to be (much better than La Fonda). The Bistec Empanizado (breaded steak)was seasoned to perfection and was probably one of the best things that I have ever put into my mouth. These items were accompanied by the ol' faithful white rice and beans and I had a glass of sangria to start and end my meal ($5 for a large glass). The portion sizes are a little on the small side for the price, so I wouldn't go there on an empty stomach, but the food is so good that I really have nothing but good things to say about Las Palmeras.
