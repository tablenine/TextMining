Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's is a landmark and is featured on several different Food Network programs, so it's worth it to go. Especially if you have a family member or friend in town, it's tourist friendly. . . The hotdogs are all right, toppings are good -- and they have those extra big onion rings. Also-- I thought the guacamole was surprisingly good for a hotdog place? I mean, I've had better -- but for what it was, it was yummy.  The buns are kinda small and mushy so it's messy...but who cares, right?. . The inside is decorated with photo's of all the different celebrities who have eaten there, and several of the hotdogs are named after them. . . They also have a valet parking, which I get a kick out of.  . . So, go -- be touristy, stand in line (which moves pretty quickly), and eat your Rosie O'Donald hotdog and be happy.
