I don't like con-fusion food. I hate Chinese and Korean fusion!  It's overpowering. Generally, I don't like Korean sushi places.  When it comes to sushi, I like it artful. Korean sushi joints I've been to usually offer slabs of fish but lack the subtllty. So now my Korean girlfriend is raving about this Korean pizza joint so here we are at Mr. Pizza. The thought of Korean fusing with Italian turns my stomach but I have to remain open minded.. . Before the pizza arrives, out come a small plate with sweet dill pickles and hot pepperchinos and a basket of bread rolls. These rolls are warm and have a subtle garlic flavor. Not bad.. . We order the regular size Gesal Montand Gold.  This hand made 10" pizza costs $26. It contains Alfredo creme sauce or salsa, sweet potatoe mousse, ground beef, onion, bell pepper, crab, paprika, bacon, cheddar cheese, oregano, blue cheese dressing and parsley.  Upon reading the list I marvel at such an odd combination of seemingly arbitrary items.. . Well, the pizza was certainly inventive.  All the ingredients actually went together.  It looks like a pizza but tastes like no pizza I've ever eaten.  The outer crust is infused with sweet potato mousse.  Very interesting.  It's the richest pizza I've ever tasted.  It's a sweet yet subtle collusion of tastes and textures that leaves me both puzzled and pleased.  . In my mind, comparing Mr. Pizza to regular pizza is like comparing a burrito to moo shu.  Next, I want to try to potato pizza since it does contain tomato sauce.  Maybe then I can compare apples to apples.. . But I tip my cap to Mr. Pizza until I return for a more fully formed rating.
