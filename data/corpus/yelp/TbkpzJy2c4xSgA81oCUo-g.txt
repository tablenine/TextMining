We came here with my parents, my sister, and grandfather. My dad got the shrimp tacos, my mom got the tuna salad, my sister and I got the Mac N' cheese, and my grandfather got the chicken sandwich. I tried EVERYTHING that the family got at my table and it was SO DELICIOUS!! . . For dessert my Mom ordered the original Blue Velvet Cake and I got the strawberry shortcake ice cream bar and my sister tried there Drumstick.  We also had the Red Velvet Poppers.  Everything single dessert was as good as it sounds.. . What is really unique about this place is, EVERYTHING is homemade and there complimentry free lemon and orange water which is delicious and such a wonderful mix. Now, we are going back as soon as possible!! If i were you this would be a great place for lunch or just to stop by for dessert.. . One of the many highlights besides the food is it's right near the huge outdoor mall The Grove. So you can grab some lunch here and then head over to The Grove or shop at the Grove for awhile then just head over here for dessert.
