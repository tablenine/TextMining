Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
What can I say, I love this place.  This place has great food at great prices, friendly service in a great neighborhood.  I have tried almost all the items on the menu but my all time favorite is Hot Pepper Noodle.  This dish is wide noodles stir fried with egg, tomatoes, onion, red bell pepper, hot pepper and basil.  You have a choice of beef, chicken, shrimp or make it combo.  If you want a twist on this dish ask for crispy noodles, this is my favorite way of having it.  I must have an appetizer and it's either Japanese gyoza or Tom Yum soup, accompany the meal with an iced coffee.  So many other things on the menu are also good, the soups are great on that cold winter day.  The shrimp soup specially is good or order the wonton soup the "old way".  What's the "old way", well some years ago the wonton soup was wonton and noodles now it's just wontons. So if you want noodles say the old way or half and half, they'll know what you mean.  The other cool thing about this place is that they support artists so on the walls you will notice the paintings are for sale and after some time they will put someone else's art work.  I have tried other Thai restaurants but none make me feel more welcome like Penny's does.
