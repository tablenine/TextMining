Went there for Saturday night early dinner. Had a reservation. We were 4 in the party.. . Ordered spring rolls for appetizer. The rolls were over cooked / fried and had literally no taste. The waiter brought us the wrong bottle of wine. BTW the wine list is not that impressive. . . The main courses - we had foru different courses. All great dishes and a good amount of spice. So main dishes all around very good. . . For dessert we have mango icecream and chocolate cake. The mango icecream had lots of ice and barely any mango. The chocolate cake was beautiful and very good. . . We had coffee with the dessert. Was never offered a refill! The coffee was OK. . . The bill arrived halfway into the dessert - they more or less pushed us out. Overall the food was good and the service was terrible.
