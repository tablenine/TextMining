Belly Shack makes my belly happy!  Went here on a Wednesday and it wasn't too busy for a group of 6.  We pretty much tried one (ok maybe 2) of everything.  Things you have to try:. . 1) Brussel sprouts with chorizo...there really is no other way to eat them. 2) Tostones with chimichurri...excellent chimichurri. 3) Hot and Sour Soup...could be a meal in itself. 4) Korean BBQ Sammich and Meatball Sammich (altho my less carnivore-ick friends really liked the Boricua.  . . The only negative is that it has such a similar name to their other place, Urban Belly.  In a text-ident, I sent 2 of friends there by mistake!
