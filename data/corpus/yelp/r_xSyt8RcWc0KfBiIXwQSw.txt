My bf and I came here for the famous crawfish. 12:30, 2 people, was seated immediately by the friendly waitress.. . We ordered:. 2 lbs crawfish (w/ corn) w/ all sha-bang sauce medium spicy. 1 lb shrimp w/ all sha-bang sauce medium spicy. 6 pieces regular chicken wings. 2 water -they charge $.25 for water.. Total bill was $33.65. We immediately got our hands dirty and the garlic flavor stayed for the entire afternoon.. It might not be the place you wanna take your first date, but definitely a nice little place to enjoy your life with!. . Btw, even though their private parking lot was pretty small, but you can find plenty of spaces on the street or nearby lots. . They do not reserve seats unless your entire party is here.
