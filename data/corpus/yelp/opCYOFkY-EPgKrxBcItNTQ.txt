It's time for my first review; instead of just peeking and using my fellow yelpers for recommendations :) I've been to this location numerous time and have always had amazing service, great food and outstanding ambiance. Â I love Opera's decor and their pre-fix menu on Tuesday and Sunday, which are an amazing deal!
