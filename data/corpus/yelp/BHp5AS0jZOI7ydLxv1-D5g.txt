Category: American (Traditional)
I am not really sure how I should review this place, but Im so high on reviews right now that I need another fix. . . Well my friend Igor and I went here after a long night of questing in the Northrend of the World Of Warcraft and our bellies got hungry for some virtual food. It was way late, like 330 and Igor checked his Iphone app to see what was open, and this place was! . He had been here for dinner lots and said the food was good so I said "Lets go quench our thirst and feed our bellies and then on to quest some more".. . Our quest to Wiener Circle was everything but a total disaster. How could two cool guys who maneveur through the WOrld of  Warcraft so deftly be so bad at procuring a hotdog and a burger? . . Geez someone must have salted those ladies Kool aid bc they were not in a good mood! I dont think I have ever been called such words in my life, and all i wanted was to give them my money for some nourishment for future questing! . . I got called things that arent fit to print and even a cracker!  But I didnt order a cracker! I wanted a hot dog. I cant say for sure, But Im pretty sure they spit in my food. I didnt want to risk it so after I finally got my food I just threw it out. I cant risk saliva in my food. thats just gross. Igor didnt fare much better, he got called all sorts of names and then when he ordered a chocolate milkshake they wouldnt give him one and they just showed their BOOBIES! And their boobs were not the playboy kind they werent fun to look at! Why would they do that?. As soon as that happened I ran out of there and left Igor and ran all the way to his building back to the World of Warcraft. In that game people may shoot at me but at least they dont call me names and show me their booobies when I never never ever wanted to see them!
