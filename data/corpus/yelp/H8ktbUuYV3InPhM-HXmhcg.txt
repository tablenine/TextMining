If you like some slathery chicken skin in your diet, they've got it, and they've got it tough. I know some fans of this place that would be bothered that I started my review with that sentence, because the Hainan chicken is incomparable to that of many places that try to emulate but instead make decent food to go. I know what you're thinking, "What does that even mean?" I tell you this, just let it happen, just let it happen.. . I really enjoyed the Hainan chicken and I recommend trying it.
