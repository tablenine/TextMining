Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
De Cero is a great beer and taco place.  It isn't perfect, but certainly worth a trip, if only for the fresh food.  The tacos, tortillas, and salsa are all quite fresh, and can be appreciated by those who can palate the difference.  . . There certainly are flaws.  The front staff is horrible.  More than half the time, I've walked in with my party, and waited a handful of minutes before anyone came by to seat us.  Also, the drinks aren't their strong suit, so I typically lean towards a beer here. . . Anyway, bring a friend, and split a taco platter.  That's the way to go.
