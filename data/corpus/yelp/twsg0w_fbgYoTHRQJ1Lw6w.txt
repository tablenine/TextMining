I didn't wait in line since I knew the promoter, but what was up with all the douchebags??? It was like all the DBs in LA decided to come here. UGH. . . Eh.. I ain't feeling this place. On top of it, the bartender asked for my ID again. Umm.. they checked it at the door! WTF.. . Whatever. This place can kiss my azz. Music was blah too. Change it up dudes! Drinks were typical $12 each. UGH. Suck it.
