Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
Came here to celebrate a birthday, we had about 25 people on our party which is pretty big so I expected the 30 minutes wait (and that's with reservation.) It was $40 per person, which I thought was average for an upscale restaurant in Hollywood. I was impressed at how prompt the service was. Our waiter was really nice and friendly. The geisha also came to our table so we were able to take some photos with her.. . This is a nice place to go out with your friends or date because of the cool/hip ambiance. Don't come here expecting good sushi though. The food is prepared fresh and presented nicely but the taste in bland and unimpressive. I've had better sushi!
