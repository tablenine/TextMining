This place was packed on a Saturday night at 9:00.  I guess for good reason; the service and food are top notch.  The skate wing and trout were the favorites for our group.  My arugula salad and seasonal soup were very fresh and more filling then I anticipated. . . The ambiance of this place is wonderful for a romantic date or just an upscale dinner with friends.  I was surprised how quiet it seemed at our table despite the high ceilings and packed space.  . . A word of wisdom: make reservations.  No matter what time of night (we had to wait almost an hour when we arrived sans reservations)!
