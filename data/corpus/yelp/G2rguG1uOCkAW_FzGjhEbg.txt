I first tried Porto's at work, where they have fundraisers every once in a while and sell the ever popular potato balls, meat pies, and cheese rolls for breakfast - all delicious.. . I've been here a couple times since then.  Every time, it was pretty busy - long lines to order!  I've tried their pastrami sandwich, which I was very pleased with - the bread was exceptional - a fresh, hot French roll - lightly crusty outside, super soft inside.  They're not stingy with the pastrami and the plate also comes with pickles and banana chips.. . The last time I went there, the beau and I had the chicken plate to share.  (sigh) What a disappointment!  $8 and you can view the picture... They weren't very generous with the portion and when the food arrived, it was lukewarm... almost cold!  . . The chicken was dry and flavorless, the beans and rice were fine (but how to do you mess up beans? ), and it was a small bowl flipped of rice.  I think they tried to "fill up" the plate with beans, as a full plate always looks nicer.  You get - count em - 3 slices of plantains with it and there were almost more onions and chicken.  This is the definition of blah.  All I could think about was going to Versailles and having the garlic chicken plate instead.  If there was ever a "wrong thing to order" here, this is it.   . . I still like Porto's of course - excellent bakery and good sandwiches, but I would definitely not have these "dinner special plates"  again.
