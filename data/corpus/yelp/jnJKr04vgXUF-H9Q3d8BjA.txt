You could feed a small army--or nation--with the pancakes they serve there.  Love the vibe and the friendly waitstaff--lots of eye candy.  My only complaint is I felt like a fat cow the rest of the day.  I mean isn't that so like counterculture right now!  Someone book me a high colonic already.. . The banana pancakes where amazing!  I wish I could say I finished them all and made my Nana proud, but it just wasn't happening.. . Next time I'll shoot for the oreo pancakes and a one way ticket to the ladies room!. . Thanks Jodi!!!!!!
