Home Bistro (HB) is an aptly-named restaurant, because whenever I go there, it feels like home.  No matter how many outlandish, expensive, experimental restaurants I go to, I know that I can always come home to the elegant yet unpretentious confines of this North Halsted restaurant.. . The food is amazing.  Simply prepared, but nothing short of gourmet - I have never had anything that wasn't delicious.  This is a restaurant where you can tell immediately the quality of the ingredients: the fish is always fresh, the mussels never have that "too much sea water" taste, and their lamb burger is to die for.  Also, they always have at least one vegetarian entree on the menu, which is an added plus.  I have known several non-vegetarians who ordered the vegetarian options here just because they sounded so delicious (and they delivered on that!)!  And BYOB is always a plus.. . Service at HB is always friendly, always attentive (if you drop a fork, they've replaced it before you've resurfaced from bending down to pick it up).  They always make you feel at home, and do their best to get parties seated in their beautiful front window seating area.  . . My only problem with HB is that they used to do a WONDERFUL brunch, which they stopped serving.  Please bring it back!!!!!  It's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5!
