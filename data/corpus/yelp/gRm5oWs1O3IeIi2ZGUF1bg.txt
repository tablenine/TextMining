Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's is my favorite LA bakery. In fact, we loved it so much we got our wedding cake here. Alternating layers of cuban cake with ducle de leche, guava and custard... SO GOOD. . . This place is really an LA staple. If you live her, you must try it at some point. Amazing cuban sandwiches, deliciously crisp potato meat balls, flakey guava custard patsteries, mmm... I could eat here every day. Go early to eat though, this place turns into a mob scence at all peak hours.
