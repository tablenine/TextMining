I elected to go here with a friend instead of watching the Laker's get blown out by 30 points.  It was a wise decision.  While I have been here a few times before, I think our ordering this night was particularly good and made me compelled to write this review.. . While I'm sure the margherita and goat cheese pizzas are tasty, this place offers interesting items that should be noted:. . 1) bone marrow al forno - while scooping out the fatty marrow from the bone was as tricky as eating stubborn crab legs, the reward was worth the patience.  The combination of the marrow, oil-infused garlic cloves and salt on the buttery toast really made this appetizer come together;. . 2) arrancine alla bolognese - crispy rice balls in a savory sauce.  simply awesome;. . 3) chicken livers, capers and guanciale; sorry chickens, but your livers taste freaking good.  you are truly almost as versatile as pig;. . 4) burrata and squash blossom pizza - delicious subtle flavor perfectly complemented the stronger taste of our next pizza:. . 5) egg, pancetta, et. al. pizza - taking a chapter from the korean "throw a gratuitous egg in there" philosophy, the stronger flavors of this pizza perfectly set the scene for:. . 6) the butterscotch budino - this is essentially a butterscotch flavored rich pudding.  incredible.  but not as good as:. . 7) the gelati sandwich combo plate - peanut butter, mint and ginger.  all were great (esp. the peanut butter dipped in the hot chocolate sauce) but my favorite was the mint - you can really taste the mint leaves.  goddamn that was good.. . Throw in a nice bottle of red, a couple glasses of moscato during dessert and you can really construct a compelling, pizza-based meal at this place.   At some point I will stop being lazy and make reservations at the next door osteria and similarly construct an interesting meal there as well.
