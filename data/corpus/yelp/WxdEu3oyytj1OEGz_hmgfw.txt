Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
This place is really romantic... unless the hostess puts you at a table that's not really a table but is really a bench and you have to sit there for two hours sharing the table with couple who apparently like to discuss their hobby of "swinging" all night. I sat in the front part of the restaurant, I guess it could be considered the "garden area" and one bonus is that you can smoke, unless you don't like to smoke, in which case it's disgusting to sit there. It's very French I guess in that aspect. If for some reason, the hostess starts leading you and your date/friend to a bench at the far right hand side of the restaurant JUST SAY NO! Nobody likes sitting at a bench when they're trying to have an enjoyable, albeit romantic date. . . The food was pretty good, but nothing amazing. I really enjoyed our server. He was a real hoot. Great sense of humor and the perfect amount of attentiveness without being intrusive. I recommend this place for a romantic date or a fun evening with your friends.
