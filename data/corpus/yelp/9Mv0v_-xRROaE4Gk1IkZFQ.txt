I loved the the millman burger which is made wtih half pound angus beef, nueske peppercorn bacon, boursin cheese &amp; piquillo peppers! . The burger is HUGE but I split it with a friend.  I also got the Sunshine salad with organic veggies and a warm rhubarb tart with goat cheese vanilla gelato.  We sat outside and it was very relaxing.
