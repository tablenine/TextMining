I've been reading about this place on yelp for some time now, and finally decided to try it last Thursday. . . First of all, the service was very sloooooow. If you're in a hurry, don't come here! The place was fairly crowded (not packed, but crowded), and they only had 1 waiter for the entire place. It took about 15 - 20 minutes to place our order (although we were ready to order after 2). The waiter was very nice and I could tell he felt bad about the lack of service. . . The food came fairly quickly after we ordered, which was nice. We had the Cheese &amp; Herb pupusa (very tasty) and a Pork &amp; Cheese (pretty dry, lacking in flavor). . . As a main my husband ordered Tampiquena (Marinated steak with rice/beans/guacamole and 1 enchilada) , which was OK. Â It wasn't bad by any means, but you can get a very similar plate at Paco's Taco's with better quality meat and more flavor. . . I ordered the Sopa de 7 Mares (Seafood soup), which the waiter warned us would take approx. 20 minutes to cook. It tasted OK, but was way too salty which overpowered the entire soup. The seafood was Ok also, not super fresh, but not too bad. All in all, an OK meal, but probably won't be back.
