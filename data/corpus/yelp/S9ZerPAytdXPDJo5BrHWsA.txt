Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
I've been wanting to try this place, but I read how crowded it gets.  My brother works near there so I told him to pick me up an order one day since I don't go to East L.A. much.. . I had the fried catfish with cajun fries.  For $9, the catfish was very plentiful and meaty with a good consistency and flavor that I really liked.  I would go back for it and one day I do need to try the crab since that's what the place is known for!
