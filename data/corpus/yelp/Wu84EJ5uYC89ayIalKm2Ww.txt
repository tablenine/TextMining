Easily the best Churrascaria I've ever been too.  But even as a "steak house" it holds it own.. . Service is nothing short of impeccable.  I kid you not - the moment I flipped my little card to "Green":. . Filet Mignon?  Check.  . Ribeye?  Check. Parmesan pork?  Check.. Sirloin?  Check.. Chicken legs?  Check.. Sausage?  Check.. Garlic Beef?  Check. . Bacon Wrapped Chicken and Filet?  Check.. Pork Ribs?  Check.. Picanha?  Check.. Lamb chops?  Check.. . I kid you not.  I had ALL of this meat on my plate within 3 minutes.  My only complaint is that you really do get overwhelmed.  You don't really get to savor your meats and you really do experience the "hottie effect."  . . The "Hottie Effect" is when you walk into a club/bar/lounge and you see that one REAL hottie.  And then you take a look around at the perfectly attractive girls/guys around you... but thats not good enough when you have the hottie right in front of you.. . The hottie?  That my friend, is the Picanha (prime sirloin).  After Picanha, chicken, pork, lamb, and sausage that tasted perfectly fine before suddenly tastes so bourgeoisie! . . Other amazing cuts of meat?  The Fraldinha (Bottom Sirloin) and the Alcatra (Top Sirloin).  Surprisingly, it was the relatively "cheap" cuts of meat that ended up being the juiciest, most flavorful cuts.  The typical steakhouse cuts of Filet Mignon and Ribeye were satisfactory, but nothing to swoon over.. . But hell, you're at a buffet.  Eat EVERYTHING.  And once you had enough, down a glass of Cabernet and eat some more!
