After hearing much buzz about this spot since moving to the city, I finally made it here for brunch with friends just over a week ago.  Since then, I've already been back a second time, and I can definitely feel it becoming a new favorite spot for lunch/breakfast/brunch in the area.. . On the first visit, I was in a lunch mood and gave their falafel wrap a shot -- fantastic hummus; big, flavorful pieces of falafel and very fresh ingredients all the way around made for a great meal.  On my second visit, I tried the New Yorker scramble-thing and it was equally delicious.  Both times, the coffee service was attentive and, of course, the decor is very eclectic and awesome.. . A great spot for hipster-watching, as well.   Will be back.  Often.
