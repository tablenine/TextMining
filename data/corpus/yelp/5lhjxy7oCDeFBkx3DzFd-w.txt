Holy crap, this restaurant was fantastic.  Also interesting, I never thought I'd see a fancy Vietnamese restaurant, and especially not in Bev Hills, but I too can be proven wrong!  The restaurant itself is very lovely, with one of those interesting glass walkways w/ a fish tank underneath (which actually scared me a bit the first time I walked on it), the decor is like the food, a fusion of east meets west.  The one thing I didn't like was that some tables seem really close together and I felt cramped while eating.  In terms of food, GARLIC NOODLES and CRAB.  You cannot go wrong.  Granted, you could probably get crab for less $$ at Boiling Crab, or at the market for that matter, and it will be as equally tasty, so I won't force you on that matter, but you MUST get the garlic noodles.  You will die because they are so good.  Next time I go, I will for sure try other things.  Also kinda cool, Hiro from Heroes was at the table next to us, HA!
