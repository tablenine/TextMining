Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
It was freaken 2am and the line was long and the air was colder then ice cubes running down your back. I stood in line with a slight hangover only to come for the experience. . . After an hour or so, I finally got to order a two-hot dog burrito with pastrami. Damn it was so huge and tasteful. But greasy, greasy. It dripped down my shirt with a stain I cannot ever remove! . . Finally I got to experience it. But I came again here this past February. It was a weeknight so my best buddy from LBC claimed to never gone here. We ordered all kinds of more greasy foods and continued our night away. . . The fat: Come for the experience. . . The skinny: All for the joy of hot dogs!
