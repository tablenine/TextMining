Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Ah Father's Office.  I think it's funny when critics review a restaurant and call it a "gem." I think it's because I would never use that word to describe anything I've ever encountered.  However I may use it for this restaurant.  Yes, Father's Office is a GEM.  . . This was the first time I've been to the Culver City FO, I used to go to the santa monica location back when I was at UCLA.  But those days of crowded bars and all-nighters are behind me, and.. wait no I still very much enjoy a good dive bar and in grad school I have had my share of all-nighters.. but that's besides the point.  Anyway about Father's Office.. yes the burgers here are spectacularr.  Are they worth 15 bucks?  well I'll leave that up to you to decide.  I love the non-mainstream beer selection and the cozy ambiance reminds me of a San Francisco-type gastropub with the LA attitude.  . . Definitely a regular stop on my trips to LA.  Oh and the bald guy from SaTC was eating at the bar next to us so Grace's goal of seeing a celeb in LA was finally met.  congrats!
