This could quite possibly be the best breakfast in Los Angeles. Went there on a quiet Monday morning and was just thrilled at the calm atmosphere. I'm sure it's much crazier on weekends, which I'll probably avoid when possible. The place is small, and quaintly so.. . Their breakfast menu is incredibly expansive, unlike any I've seen before. Not only that, but it's not filled with variations on your standard fare, but instead it includes just tons of fresh, enticing creations. My friend and I both ordered trademark dishes: the Roma Via Paris for him, the French Toast with blackberry jam, vanilla yogurt, fresh berries &amp; bananas for me. We were both just enamored with the freshness of the food, and I could not have imagined a more satisfying breakfast. The coffee, I suppose, could have been a little bolder.. . My only complaint was our waitress, who generally met all of our needs, but could have been more personable. I can't wait to come back here for another quiet weekday breakfast, and it was the perfect start to my week.
