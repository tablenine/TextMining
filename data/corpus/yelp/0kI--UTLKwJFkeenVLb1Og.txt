Don't come here if you are a sushi aficionado.  Don't come here if you are hungry, because it will take 30 minutes for you to be seated.  Don't come here if you are not o.k. with paying obscene prices for booze.  Don't come here if you cant deal with rude hostesses.  Don't come here under dressed - or you will stick out like a sore thumb.  Don't come here if you're not into the typical tired ass LA boujie scene, or you will leave vomiting.. . Do come here if you love miso black cod.  Do come here if you're going out in the area, its the perfect place to start out.  Do come here in your sluttiest gear - you will blend right in.  Do come here if you're with a large group; they have several large tables.  Do come here when trying to impress out-of-towners who want to go somewhere "hip".  Do come here with a date who has a trust fund.  Do come here if you want to be "seen"; this place is ALL about it.
