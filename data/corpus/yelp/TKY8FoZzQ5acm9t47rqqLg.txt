Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
One of the most overrated establishments that I can think of on Yelp. . . All hype. Seriously. . . The chicken and waffles is not worth the price. . . The service was indeed friendly, but the service was lacking. Wheres was my drink? . . I dont know what the craze is all about. It was just chicken and waffles.
