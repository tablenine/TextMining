OMFG...This place is definitely heaven on earth.  This place is pretty far so I can only make it out here for some desserts a few times a year but I think my hips are grateful for that.  The lines can get pretty crazy here but I think they do a good job with getting through the lines as quickly as possible.  I've always waited almost an hour all the times I've been here but it's seriously worth it when you take a bite of ANY of the pastries.  My favorites are the cheese rolls and the fruit tarts.  It's like a party in your mouth with every bite.  I almost have to put the cheese rolls in the back of my car to stop myself from eating it all on my drive back all the way to Anaheim.  The anxiousness is grueling but the payoff is great because the sweetness of the cheese and the sweet flakey pastry outer shell is everything you dream of.
