Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
The Tender Greens experience: You will wait on an intimidating long line (that always moves surprisingly fast). You yell your order at the first cook, and through some sort of complex Rube-Goldberg mechanism involving some 16 salad chefs and 43 mixing bowls, you emerge at the other end with a delicious yet mildly overpriced salad. Easy pleasey.. . There's so many line chefs cooking and tossing behind the plexiglass here that it's fun to go and pretend you're visiting an alternative North Pole where Santa and his elves make salads instead of toys.
