Restaurant: Surin of Thailand
Category: Thai
Truth be told...I don't know what 'authentic thai' is.  But I do know what consistently good food is served in a great atmosphere.  That's exactly what you get at Surin.  The space with it's dim lighting, fresh flowers and beautiful people is very comforting.  I've never ordered a bum dish either.  The waiters and waitresses are very polite and kind.  I dig and endorse.
