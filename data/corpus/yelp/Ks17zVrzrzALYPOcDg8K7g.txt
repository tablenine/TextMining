The best lobster ever. This restaurant know how to cook a lobster. In addition, the price of the lobster is cheap if you compare it to other fancy restaurants. . . I wouldn't say that the service here is good but it's a lot better than some chinese restaurants. . . It gets pretty crowded during dinner time and parking also gets crazy. If you don't have any patience with parking and you are coming here for dinner, just go straight to street parking.. . Just remember, order the house special lobster.
