Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Sometimes, you just need those nights....all you want to do is just order tons of take out and just sit and eat it all while zoning out to The Office to get your mind off things. I was looking forward to doing this all day, so I started looking at Friendship's menu during my lunch break at work.. . I ordered about $44 worth of food...I think that included tip. The delivery was the standard hour, and since my entire alley was iced up, they were nice enough to come to my back gate and drop off my food. . . So what did I get for my $44?. . 1) Calamari: It was soggy by the time I got it, but I should have known better. It would have been great fresh though. I stuck it in the oven to crisp it up bit, and it was pretty decent.. 2) Beef with Snow Peas: I was pleased. Wasn't like home...had a bit of a sweet flavor to it, but it was delicious over my rice.. 3) The rice came in a microwave safe box. So cute. (Please, I come from a Chinese restaurant family...and I hadn't seen this before....we're a bit behind down South.). 4) Egg rolls: Some of the better egg rolls I've had in this city. I was pleased.. . I think when I want to splurge on higher end Chinese food, I'll order from here again. I'd love to try half price Tuesdays but, as of late, I really don't want to be caught in huge crowds. For now, I'll stick to delivery.... . And yes, after a few tears, stuffing my face with Chinese food and just zoning out to the Office definitely made me almost forget about what's her name a little bit. Plus, I had great leftovers. Plus, I had spinning the next day so I didn't feel as guilty eating so much.
