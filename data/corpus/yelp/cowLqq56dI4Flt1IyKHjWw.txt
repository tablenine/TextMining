Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
Food was decent and drinks were great. Our server was very nice, but mildly outlandish. When we asked him to fix the wobbly table (very simple) he said he really couldn't. Inside the restaurant there were people everywhere. Hanging out near our table, etc. It was a fun scene, but a friend said she saw people using cocaine in the bathroom. Overall it was a nice restaurant -- it was just trying very hard to be hip in Atlanta.
