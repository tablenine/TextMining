being a japanese ramen virgin, and the fact that i don't like hot soup, i thought the flavor was creamy and really good. only bad part was that i waited in line for an hour on sunday afternoon while the weather was freezing outside. despite how busy the place was, the service was still attentive and now i'm totally craving the miso soup. . . p.s. the pork was really soft like a baby's tush. not that i ever tasted the baby's tush before..
