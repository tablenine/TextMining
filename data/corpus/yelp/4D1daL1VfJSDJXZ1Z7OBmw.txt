Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Very reasonable prices and tasty food. We came here as a group of 5 and ordered several fishes from Pad Thai, Papaya Salad, Fried Fish, Chicken Skewers, Spicy Noodles, Pad Se Ew. Food tasted awesome! Some fun and cheesy entertainment too with the Elvis singer.. . 1 star removed for the service (could definitely use improvement) and the strange layout of the restaurant tables.
