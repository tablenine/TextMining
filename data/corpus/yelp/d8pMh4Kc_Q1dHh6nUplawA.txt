My friend and I wanted a place to have a laid back and cheapish dinner on a weeknight. The Grange delivered just the experience I craved! . The Grange Public House has a friendly atmosphere and a great outdoor sitting area. They also offer an extensive and reasonably priced beer menu and a bunch of pub food classics (fish and chips, bangers and mash, pot pies, burgers, stew, etc). I opted for a burger. It was quite yummy topped with gruyere cheese, but it was overcooked (I ordered medium and it was well done). The chips on the side were fantastic. . I could definitely see myself coming back here: it is inviting, casual, has a good classic pub menu, and is priced right, especially for decatur.
