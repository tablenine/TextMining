I've been here an couple times and I'll keep coming back, I've never had a bad experience here, the food is great and the waiters are on top with the wine &amp; dinner menu-. . I like the environment inside N9ne, it's not stuffy and it is a younger crowd, yet last year I saw a 70 year old version of a Playmate, at least it was entertaining-And it's nice you can wear something a little "flashy" here since it suits the environment of N9ne-. . Last night I got the pan seared scallops that were on top of a bed of sweet corn, peas and lobster risotto, drizzled with truffle oil-I get leery when I order scallops b/c I have some places serve me small, fishy scallops but these were fresh, huge and perfect, so good I had to close my eyes and say "Mmmmmmm"-. . My husband ordered an entree that the server kept pushing, the Black Cod Miso, when it was placed in front of him I could just tell it was going to be good-The fish was cooked just right, and the Miso sauce was perfect-Such a simple entree with a lot of taste-. . I didn't see anything on the dessert menu I wanted, but my husband did so he got the Carrot Cake to go, he said it was "pretty damn good"-. . This place starts getting entertaining &amp; busy around 8:30-9:00, so if you want an early dinner you will get right in, unlike some other places on Randolph who have an older crowd-
