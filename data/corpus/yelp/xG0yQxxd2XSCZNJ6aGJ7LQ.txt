Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
I've been here at least 5 times and NEVER dissapointed. Everytime i have friends coming from other countries in Los Angeles, I would (most definitely) bring them to Geisha House! It's equals to what Hollywood should look like, plus good sushi.. . I love their DJ, and thered interior. you feel like youre in a club But!!! its alright if you don't drink! Go for a good girls night out late dinner, you'll love it as much as my girlfriends and I did. Plus, hot waiter/ waitress alert!!!!!!
