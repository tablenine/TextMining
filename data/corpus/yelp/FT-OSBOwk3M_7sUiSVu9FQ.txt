Category: Pizza
Overrated.. . I was expecting the food to be spectacular based on the fact that it takes a long time to make a reservation at this popular restaurant. . . Appetizers:. 1) Asparagus $12-not worth the price.  I can make it myself and make it better.. 2) Fried squash blossoms with ricotta $12- This was ok.  But I think they only give you like 4 blossoms...and 2 of mine were burned! Nothing but fried flour..didn't taste the squash.. 3) Fried potatoes-$8 - not bad. not great.. . Salad:. 1) Nancy's chopped salad-$15- small for the price.  The dressing is very tasty.. . Pizza:. 1) Egg, guanciale, escarole, radicchio &amp; bagna cuada $16  -My favorite pizza! . 2) Margherita with mozzarella, tomato &amp; basil $13 - Typical pizza with marinara sauce. . . Dessert:. 1) Butterscotch budino, Maldon sea salt &amp; rosemary pine nut cookies $9 -  A cup of pure heaven!!!  Must get this!. . I had a good time with friends at this place...but like I said, very overrated.  Place is crowded, noisy, expensive, only 1 bathroom stall, and the $10 valet sucks.  Probably will not go here again.  I can get a better pizza for $10 at the local joint.
