I caught another experience with the Kogi truck and tried the Korean Spare Rib burrito - that thing is da bomb! So tasty and so good! Also, I got to try their dessert of the day, which was a apple crumbled cake, or something like that. It went for $3, but it was pretty sweet and tasty! Â . . Can't wait to catch the Kogi again in the future!
