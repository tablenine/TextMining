Restaurant: Maggiano&#39;s Little Italy
Category: Italian
Did not go to the actual restaurant but Mobile Waiters delivered to us for lunch. We really wanted to see what the rave was about after seeing several departments have their holiday lunch's catered by them. So we became the "Jones's" in order to keep up! I will say this... I ordered the calamari fritte appetizer, the Brunello's lobster Caronara which is a combination of lobster, smoked ham, snap peas &amp; garlic cream sauce) and cheesecake with fruit for dessert. I must say that I have not even looked at the entree nor the dessert. I was waaaaaaay full off of the calamari which was the best I have had....ever. It was tender and the batter light, lighly seasoned and not too overbearing as to take away from the tast of the sea. Large portions...everyone else enjoyed their meals too and we ALL had the ITIS(case of the sleepies) after eating....I am still full @ 4:30 and I ate at 12. I don't even know if I'll be able to eat my entree b/c I am still full! Everyone agreed about the very large portions..Kudos to Maggianos!!!!!!
