If I could give this place less than one star, I would. The food is ok, but not worth the poor customer service. I had to repeat my order three times because the guy behind the register was more interested in looking out the window than he was in taking my order. If you're too bored to give me decent customer service, I'm too annoyed to ever go back to your restaurant. This place really is not worth me giving it a second chance and I honestly recommend that you do not bother giving it a first chance.
