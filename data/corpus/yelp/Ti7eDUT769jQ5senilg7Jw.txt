Restaurant: Pho Dai Loi
Category: Vietnamese
I think everyone agrees that the Pho is good, but what about the decor? I just don't get it. . . This place is an assault on my eyes! Sea Green paint with sherbet colored trim, faux wainscot in Oak trim and brick red paint, solid oak entry, display case and counter and randomly displayed cheap prints. Yet, the worst is the gorgeous crystal chandelier that hangs from a low acoustical tile ceiling. Wrong I say, just wrong! . Of course this is obviously just a personal issue, as my dining companion claims he never even noticed. . . That was when I focused in on the other diners, hunched over their delicious Pho, oblivious to their surroundings.
