My friend told me he heard they have the best human chicken here, the very best!, so I made a long drive in the rain last night to see for myself. The fates were against me though, as I had much trouble finding the place, and it didn't help they were blocking off all of Alhambra that night in preparation for chinese new year.. . Still, this stopped me not and a rainy cold walk finally found me at the kitchen counter with my friend. We both had the chicken and rice. He paid two dollars more for dark meat (yet paid less than me when the check came... hmm...) It was okay. I wish I had more sauce. And it turned out to not even be human. Disappointing.. . The rest of the menu looked intriguing. I want to come back here again, except not in the dark and in the rain. So many other places here I want to try on this street, wish I lived closer.
