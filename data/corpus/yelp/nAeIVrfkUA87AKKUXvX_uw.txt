I heard great things about Sticky Rice and really wanted to like it here. Somehow I just didn't. The place is tiny (ok, I can deal) and the service was god-awful (Hey! Where did our server go?). The menu was huge. Took our table awhile to make up our mind. I went with the soy duck dish and spring rolls for the appetizer. Meh. I've had better at other places like, Alice and Friends also located in Chicago. I believe the only thing I did end up liking at Sticky Rice, was well, the sticky rice dessert w/ mango. So delicious! Not sure if I'll go back, but hey, I'll give just about anything a second chance. . . P.S. Sticky Rice is BYOB.
