Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Mozza is a great place to go for GOURMET pizza.  Some of these reviews make this place sound like a corner pizzeria.  I had the goat cheese pizza with fennel, leek, garlic and smoked bacon and it was outstanding.  I also had the fried squash blossoms with ricotta which were recommended by our server, it tasted more fried than anything.  The people next to us got the caprese and it looked awesome.  Getting that next time.  Coming from New York, it has a great atmosphere that you don't find often in LA, crowded  a little noisy, but it makes you want to be there and it is comfortable.
