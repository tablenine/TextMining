Wa-wa-wee-wow. . This place is awesome. It was recommended to me as the most authentic Italian deli, by someone who recently came to the US from Italy. So we're talking yum-town good.. . The 9" sandwich fed me for 3 days. The 12" sandwich could feed a family of 10.  Service is quick! The grocery market is filled with imported Italian treats, and the deli has many tasty delights to offer.  Just remember that there is no place to sit and eat your monstrous purchases, so head to the park just east of the store.. . I'll be back.
