Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Ohhhh snap! I've been dying to try Papa Cristos.   We walked in and figured out we needed to wait in a long line, place our order, then sit down and wait for our food to arrive.  As we got closer to the front of the line we could see more and more of the menu.  Everything looked amazing, but we ended up getting Vegetable moussaka (they were out of the meaty one), 2 spanakopita and the sizzling feta and tomatoes. . . I loved everything, but the moussaka...I think I would have liked it more with meat. . . Great environment, food came out fast and it was GOOOD.
