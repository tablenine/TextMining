Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
Go to the Weiner's Circle at bar close - you won't be disappointed - lots of drunk people being harassed by the counter staff. It's worh checking out once. . . The food isn't very good, but if you had enough drinks before going, you might remember it otherwise in the morning. I had a char dog &amp; cheese fries...the dog was mediocre. I had great hopes for the fries, but the cheese was that horrible 'pub cheese' that is grainy and tastes like...well, not like cheese.
