Restaurant: Green Sprout
Category: Vegetarian
I have to admit in the beginning I hated Green Sprout. I didn't think they would last. But my husband fell in love with it, &amp; I knew something was up when he started addicting his carnivorous coworkers to the place. . . After boycotting it for awhile, I recently gave it another chance. I went back again a mere 3 nights later. The dishes I'd picked in the past just didn't allow Green Sprout to show off. Instead of venturing down the travelled path (Chicken with Cashews, Shrimp Lo Mein, et al), I've found their special dishes to be where it's at. . . My last visit I had "fried fish." I was curious how fake fried fish in a Chinese restaurant would taste - it was delicious. Don't ask, because I can't explain. We had the zucchini appetizer - also delicious. And this coming from a vegan who usually hates vegetable dishes in favor of fake meats.. . The service there is always great, as it's a small &amp; friendly place. The location can't be beat - right at Monroe &amp; Piedmont.
