I went here for lunch and wasn't impressed.  I haven't read any other reviews, but I'm guessing most people like it for the roof top bar?. . Why I didn't care for the lunch:. . I made my own burger and ordered the ribeye burger with cheddar and bacon.  It arrived with both of those, but also a pile of caramelized onions.  No big deal, I am not going to complain about something I can easily scrape off.. . Burger was an absolute grease bomb.  Maybe ribeye was a bad choice, but that's what the waitress recommended... I'm not a picky eater and like greasy food, but this was just too much even for me.. . The fries were good, I have to admit that.. . Overall, I don't think this place is anything special at all, at least for food.  It's pretty expensive for a burger (ribeye one was ~$25 with the toppings).. . I likely won't go back.
