their chicken wings (sweet) are tasty but they are very tiny and have little to no meat on them. they are worth a taste though, at least have them once. Â their dishes are small so it's more fun to go with friends when you can order a ton of things and try everything. i love the bacon spinach, tofu salad, yakitori chicken, rare steak, scallops, salmon, and tofu with ponzu sauce. it's fairly inexpensive. there is parking in the back of the restaurant. there's almost always a waiting list. so, get there early and expect to wait for a while. but, you may get lucky and only have to wait for 5-10 minutes. i've never waited more than 20 minutes. i've been lucky. if there is a long wait though, sawtelle is poppin' now. take a lil stroll and come back and check the list!!
