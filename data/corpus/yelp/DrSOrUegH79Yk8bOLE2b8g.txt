Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
4.5 Stars.  Love the kbbq here!  Although we were late for our dinner reservation, our party of 7 got seated right away on a Friday night.  We ordered Combo A (non-marinated meat).  It was goood~  We also got the galbi (25.99) and bulgogi.  It wasn't until then that we realize Soowon's marinated meat is absolutely declious!!. . A bottle of alcohol (soju or beer) comes with Combo A.  We ended up getting the black raspberry wine, which is like $3 extra tho.  The salad was good and the side dishes were somewhat decent.  The potato side dish is way too sweet.  This place is as clean and tidy as the pictures on Yelp depicted.. . Service was great except one little problem.  The waitress there speaks VERY little/limited English.  It was kinda difficult to communicate since our Korean friend bailed out on us last minute.  They didn't understand what we wanted, but fortunately a waiter showed up and he spoke fluent English...hooray!  He chatted a little bit to us and answered our questions while he help us cook.  Great service!. . The bill came out to $26/head.  It thought it was a very good value, but my friend later told me that he was still hungry.  So, I guess we didn't order enough.  Oh, forgot to mention, we shared 3 steam egg (thing in a small individual pot).  I had better, but it was pretty good~  Worth a try.. . Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience and a very satifying meal indeed ^^
