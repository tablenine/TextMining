What the fuck did I eat?. . All I could think about was how close the next baskin robbins could be. . . To be fair I'm not a vegan, but I didn't enjoy it. The wait was long so I guess a lot of people must like this place. We had the meatballs and a salad. The salad was mostly celery. . . I will say that the fake cheese I had was yummy, but besides that I couldn't handle it.
