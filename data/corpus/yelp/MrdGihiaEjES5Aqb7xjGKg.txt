Holy crapola this place is huge! A bakery that has 2 floors, 2 rooms and both of which are the size of a library?! I was in sweet sweet heaven!. . this was my 5th stop in my glutenous filled day of yelply famous LA food joints.. . The lines here are definitely ridiculous looking but it moves very quickly. I had to try the famous potato balls which are mashed potatoes filled with seasoned ground beef and deep fried. It was def. good but not nearly as amazing as I had expected. The bf had the carrot cake which he described as being so good it hurt his taste buds!. . Can't wait to come back to try the rest of their ginormous menu!
