Dear Short Rib Tacos,. . You guys were a delight to devour. I've heard so much about you guys but nothing compares to trying you guys personally. I don't know how your Papa Bear did it but you guys were a masterpiece. The short ribs were juicy and tender. The lettuce was delish in how it tastes kinda like kimchi. And whatever sauce it was that you guys were drenched in, it was just spectacular. With a spritz of lime and a bit of sriracha, there was officially a party in my mouth at 12PM. I'll be sure to give your cousins a try next time Papa Bear rolls around. No worries, I won't forget about your brothers and sisters. Until then.... . Very Yours Truly,. . May
