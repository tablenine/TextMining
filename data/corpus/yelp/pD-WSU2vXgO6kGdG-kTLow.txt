I can't get enough Shabu Shabu, I've been there twice this week and tonight will be three.  Just make sure to get there like an hour and a half before you want to eat.  No exaggeration.  But totally worth it.  But it's also right in Little Tokyo and there's plenty of places nearby to shop or snack on some edamame while you wait.  Now, on to the food... the most perfect, thin, heavenly beef you've ever tasted.  Comes to you raw, dip it in boiling water, and there you go.  You get unlimited rice refills, some tofu cubes, some noodles, and vegetables to cook in the water and eat on the beef or make a broth out of.  Now I'm getting hungry.  These guys have a system, your food is in front of you immediately when you sit down, so be courteous and pay your check while you're still eating and get out of there once you're finished.  Nothing makes me madder than seeing people chilling at the counter at Shabu Shabu even after they're done.  It's infuriating.  But yeah, respect.
