Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
YES! YES! and YES! Yelp, I need 7 stars for my Smoke Daddy review. This is now my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. This is Southern deliciousness done right! Can we say Pulled Pork? Brisket? Baby Back Ribs? Macaroni and Cheese? Sweet Potato Fries? Sweet Tea? Banana Puddin? Cornbread?!?! You can taste the smoke in every bite. The meat is tender and well-cooked. Portions are very, very filling. Prices are reasonable given the area. Me and my friend shared a $21 platter of three meats and two sides. And we had to take some home. Great service. And by great service I mean our server was genuinely nice, always attentive and took good care of us. Operative word: genuinely. Highly, highly recommend this BBQ joint. Great food, great service, great food, decent prices, great food. I will be back to taste the cornbread, banana puddin, and some of the other dishes I didn't get to try the first time.. . P.S. Avoid the collard greens like the plague. They were tough, chewy and under seasoned. I don't know if they know but collard greens take a long time to cook and a little sugar and baking soda added to the pot will soften them up too.
