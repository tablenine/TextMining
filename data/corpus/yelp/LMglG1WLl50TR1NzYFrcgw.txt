okay, so there is hamster bedding on the floor and the lines are comparable to disneyland's space mountain during the summer time but it is well worth it.. . no fussy and unnecessary crap. just simple and casual food done right.  i love the sauce and the meat, although there could be more meat but that may just be my gluttonous side coming out.  . . BEEF greater than pork. OH AND THEY HAVE A PARKING LOT FOR FREE. a rarity in downtown.
