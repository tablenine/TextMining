Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Got to be kidding me.  If this is Korean BBQ then what the heck have I been eating all the other times?  The meat is really good here.  LEGIT. . Food:  QUALITY - my group ordered a set A and a set B. . Service:  So I had to call this place a million times before my first visit because my party size kept fluctuating.  I probably talked to everyone that worked there over the phone and they were all nice still.  When i finally got there it was no different. . Parking:  I ended up parking on the street.  There is valet.  Not bad.
