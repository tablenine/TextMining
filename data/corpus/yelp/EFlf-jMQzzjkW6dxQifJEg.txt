Restaurant: Tin Drum Asia Cafe
Category: Thai
This is a lot like Saigon Cafe, but the menu is smaller and food blander.  It also feels more like a fast food casual instead of a sit down restaurant.  Basically an eclectic pan-Asian eatery offering the most popular of mildly Americanized Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese dishes.   It's not really offensive but I find I can easily contain any kind of Asian food craving knowing that Buford Highway, Roswell-I285, or Tasty China are all just 15 minutes away from where Tin Drum is.  . . Doc Chey's is not a better alternative to Tin Drum.
