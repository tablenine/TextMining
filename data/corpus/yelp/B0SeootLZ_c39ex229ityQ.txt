Had the sweet and sour pork--it was average. . The pork Lo mein was average as well. Not nearly the "best Chinese food" like some people rate it, but then again I have "Best Chinese Food" on Santa Monica Blvd, in Santa Monica, CA as my reference point. Now THAT place really lived up to its name. Small take out joint and everyhting made to order. Anyway I give this palce 3 stars for the food and 4 for their service (great customer service). I would have rated it 31/2 stars.
