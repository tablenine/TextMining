Damn...omg..damn. . . This is the dankest ramyun I have ever tasted in my life. The soup is absolutely delicious. It's not too salty or thick and the texture is just soooo good. It has the perfect consistency and temperature. The noodles are not too soft or hard either (it would be a lot better if it had Orochon's noodle). The pork is cooked perfectly, but I'm not too sure about the melting in your mouth part (unlike Orochon's)...still amazing though. Also the egg they put in the soup makes everything so much better since it gives the soup a more comfortable feel. The onion sprouts they put in the soup gives the soup an edge...i think it evens out the mild saltiness to it. . . If you want ramyun in Los Angeles, you have got to try this place out. The 40 minute wait is totally worth it. . . Parking can be difficult...I normally park my car at my bf's apart on Grand and walk from there, so if you don't want to pay for parking, you should find street parking and walk or pay a ridiculous amount at the parking garage across the street.
