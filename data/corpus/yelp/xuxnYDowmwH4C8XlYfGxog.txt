Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
yes, a bit cliche but if you want to have a late-night meal sitting next to one of the guys from Cold War Kids and see attractive kids continuing their need to show off their good looks, Pick Me Up Cafe is the perfect spot for you!. . Get the Chicken Taquitas as the entree offers the largest amount to eat on the menu, and is very good. Also, the french toast is recommendable.
