I'd give it 3 stars because I have gone on several occasions with friends and family and enjoyed the food. I have to say I will not go back after going there on a Monday night with a total group of four of us. It was a cold night and three of the four of us arrived. The 4th person was about 10-15 minutes away. I can understand that they'd make us stand outside if there were only a couple tables open but it was practically empty and there were several spots we could have sat while we waited for the last person. The host (an older gentleman with an accent) would not allow us to sit and told us we could go get wine in the wine bar next door. We were willing to sit down and order both drinks and appetizers while we waited for our friend but he refused to let us sit. It was an awkward situation considering the place had many empty seats to sit in. The 10-12 people eating also noticed that we were told that we could not sit. So after going outside for a few minutes our friend arrived and they gave us several options of where to sit. We sat down and ironically later in the evening they allowed a group of three sit next to us and order a bottle of wine. Later walks in a fourth person who is brought over by the host to join them. We spent $200 dollars for small portions and were rushed out by the waiter. We noticed the food arrives very fast to peoples tables and then they pressure you to move on. All four of us have brought people to this establishment in the past though we have all agreed not to go back due to very poor service and treatment. There is a great Italian restaurant in Clinton Hill that treats it's customers like family. Plus the food is much more authentic and their portions are larger with healthier and fresher ingredients.
