First time ever at FO...while the burger is as advertised, it was surprisingly small in size. The beer selection is awesome, and from everything I hear this is infinitely better than the other location in regards to size and overall fit.. . Funny thing, a line, yet it wasn't crowded at all inside, what gives? Trying to make it a Hollywood club?!? Busy outside empty inside? Go figure.
