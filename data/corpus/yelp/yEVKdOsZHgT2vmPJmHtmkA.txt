The location is horrible. Stuck atop the Paseo Colorado which used to be a rather sad, typical indoor mall before it got totaled for this mess. Â . . Fortunately I enjoy beer and even then, there are better selections found elsewhere in Los Angeles without the necessary crap of Bud and Coors being "on tap" and bringing down all the good beers by merely having a keg next to them.. . The wait for a table can be lengthy and with the lack of a real place to wait, people decide to head to the bar (which is also packed with people), try to get a beer and then stand around in the pathway until its time to sit down because again, the bar gets crowded.. . Overall, I'm up for people trying new things and that's what Yelp is all about when you get down to it, so if you HAVE to, check out the Yardhouse in Brea or Irvine and then make up your mind from there.
