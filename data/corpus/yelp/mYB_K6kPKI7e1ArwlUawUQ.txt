Looks like a restaurant from TJ from the outside. l but it's extremely cozy. walking in the atmosphere is warm and the staff in welcoming. Chips and salsa of course. I enjoy good sangria and it was perfect! Tons of options/ combinations. The portions were large for the entrees...I wasn't too hungry so i got a side order of a a fish taco and a tamale. The food was fresh. Alex got tooooons of food with his entree, especially beans and he farted all night but it's ok he liked his food. he doesn't lie well with spicy food. Alex says he liked his beer it was pilsner from C. America. Service service service service! fast and sweet men :)
