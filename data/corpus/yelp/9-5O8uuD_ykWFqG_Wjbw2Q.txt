I've never been disappointed by anything I've ordered. It's a great place to go for brunch, lunch or just a little snack. The only thing that's kind of irksome is that it's always crowded but they're stuff is just that good, so there's always a crowd. . . My faves are the bread pudding, coconut macaroons, and the plum cake that they have during the holiday season.
