Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
You don't go to Tito's for quality, authentic Mexican food. You go for those guilty pleasure regret-it-later oh so greasy and crunchy cheap tacos. There's something about Tito's that just makes you crave it when you haven't had it in a while. It's the perfect place to just order 3 tacos and pig out!!! It's just so satisfying to come here with friends when you're stoned and broke and need a taco fix! It's one of my top places to go eat when I'm back home in L.A. The service is horrible but what do you expect? It's a fucking taco stand! It's so close to Venice that you might as well get come Coronas, a blunt, some Tito's and chill on the beach all day...
