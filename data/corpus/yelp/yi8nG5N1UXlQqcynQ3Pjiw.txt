Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
You may take years off your life, but at least you would die having tasted a great pastrami sandwich!. . The pastrami sandwich is awesome---and with their fries its even better. Just remember to finish it all! If you try to put the remainder of the sandwich in the fridge, you will freak when you find out how hard it gets when all of the grease congeals.
