I've eaten here so many times but always forget to write a review about it. So here goes... Parking...$2.50 for valet. Parking is okay...better than the other place that palm used to be at. But you can also park on the street if you can find one.. My boyfriend and I always seems to order the same thing. Why mess with something good right. The tom yum koong(shrimp) is the best! not to salty..not too sour. Or you can also try the tom yum seafood...also very yummy. Deep fried trout with mango saunce is also very yummy here. the fish is crispy and tender. the mango saunce is out of this world with hot white rice. Try this combo. I guarentee it if you like fish. Also you cant go wrong ordering the pad krapao...or chicken with mint leaves. Its good!!
