Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
My BFF and I tried Casa Bianca last Wed and were pleasantly surprised! The place was packed considering it was a Wed night. We waited about 20 mins. We decided to order some appetizers and of course pizza to share.. Mozzarella sticks were yummm, crispy on the outside and melting dripping mozzarella on the inside. We also had the caprese salad, I liked the dressing, but my BFF thought it was a little too much on the sweet side. We ordered the Hawaiian( ham and pineapple)  pizza with whole wheat crust and that was good as well. Even though we were stuffed, there's always room for desert! What else would be order  but TIRAMISU! It was wonderful, almost tasted homemade. It got a bit loud at one point, but to me that's part of the charm of the place!
