Yes this place is awesome.  The Reuben is amazing, the bagel and lox plate rocks, and the matzo is good too.  The sandwiches can be pricey..but you can walk over to the kibitz room after and enjoy some cheap drinks and figure out who in the bar is coked up.  I like that game.  I met a crazy Australian bloke at Kibitz once...he was high out of his mind.  I wanted to make out with him but my guy friend unintentionally c-blocked.  damnit it all to hell.
