Went there again last night. Had to wait about 1.5 hours for a table, but hung out at the bar and had a good time. Talked to Andy (mixologist) a little bit, he was very friendly. . . Ordered the chopped steak (tartare), fried oysters, charcuterie plate, and once 10PM rolled around, two burgers. The salumi/charcuterie plate was a lot more sparse than the last time I got it. Everything else rocked, but the burgers are a real treat. Plan on being there to order them as soon as 10PM rolls around. Seriously, they are that amazing.
