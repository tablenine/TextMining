Restaurant: Rodan
Category: Nightlife
Despite some problems, Rodan is coming into its own as a solid new restaurant, offering a unique mix of South American and Southeast Asian dishes. While the video mirrors in the bathrooms are more gimicky than useful, I think it's a cool touch. The video screen in the dining room that often features art by local video artists, and DJs in the evenings (Sunday nights in particular are hopping), and overall spare design lends it a sort of sleek ancient-future, cyberpunk-chic vibe that Tizi Meloul once had and lost. In the end, it's the food and service that matters most. Of the four times I've been, one experience on a busy night last year was absolutely horrible. We waited 30 min to have our order taken, another hour for the food, and then my steak was so undercooked it was still bleeding and twitching. I was so hungry and frustrated I was going to lose it. They did make it right by not charging for it, and my other experiences and those of others were just fine. However, another problem is that the portions are just too small. I'm used to taking home leftovers, not leaving hungry. The desserts are excellent, and I'll be willing to give it another chance.
