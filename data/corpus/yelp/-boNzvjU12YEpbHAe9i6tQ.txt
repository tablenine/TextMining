Restaurant: Daddy D&#39;z BBQ Joynt
Category: Barbeque
Daddy D'z was pretty good a few years ago, but of late the quality has slipped even as D'z prices have soared. I guess ya could pay a premium for ok'Que, but why not just mosey across the street to the Greeks. Nick's to Go is a good deal and has great food.
