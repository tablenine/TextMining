Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
This was my second visit to the restaurant. Without a reservation, I was able to be seated at a table although the second time was after an exactly 45 minute wait as promised. Thanks to the host (Sorry I forgot to ask his name) for putting me at a table twice in a row!. . To my expectation, the quality of the food was unsurpassed. Despite the simplicity of the menu, the delicious and varieties of pizzas made up for being one of the best pizza restaurants I had been. In addition to trying to decipher the secret of the melt-in-your-mouth meatballs, we ordered special of the day Eggplant Parmasana just thinking to take the leftover with us. We ended up finishing up almost everything. . . Service was attentive especially the busboys. They were courteous as well as professional. Although the noise level was a little high, we did not regret the wait and we would do it again hopefully with a reservation next time.
