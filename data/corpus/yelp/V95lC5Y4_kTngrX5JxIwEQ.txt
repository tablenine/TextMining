Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
The wait usually sucks, but it's still good pizza. I ordered the wheat crust with eggplant. My friend ordered half artichoke/tomato/garlic half sausage/mushroom. His was better than mine because the wheat crust is just too dry. The eggplant was delicious though. I don't eat a lot of pizza in Los Angeles so I can't say that it is the best in the city, but I do know that it is good. I wish the wait wasn't so brutal.. . They corkage fee is 5 dollars. . Cash only.
