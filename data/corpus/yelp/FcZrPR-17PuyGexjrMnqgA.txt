Once of my favorite places in Pasadena. Their prices are a little on the high side, but no more expensive than the other Paseo restaurants. The booths are big enough for a group of 5 or 6 so my friends and i meet up here quite often. It can get loud w/ the large crowds and music, but it keeps the atmosphere more like a bar than a restaurant.. Happy hour is the best time to hit up this place. They have a great drink and appetizer menu that will fill you up and get you buzzed for pretty cheap. You will wait for a table, but there's a bar where you can wait. Â . I love thier food, and haven't been disappointed with anything i've ordered. My fave is the thai salad. . Not a great place for the older crowds or people that don't like to wait or like loud restaurants (i.e. my parents can only come here for lunch on weekdays)
