Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
Gloria's salsa and guacamole is great. The sangria pitchers are very good. So is the tortilla soup, the carne asada, the carnitas adobadas, and all the Salvadorean food. In fact, everything that I've ever had at Gloria's has been pretty fucking good. And I've always had consistent, not pushy, but attentive service. So why four stars and not five?. . NO HANDMADE CORN TORTILLAS. . . A pox on your restaurant!
