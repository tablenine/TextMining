Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Overall, I really liked Ford's Filling Station. We went with a group of 4 and were seated very promptly on a Friday night. The wait staff was very attentive, professional and helpful. We had the pan-roasted salmon, fish and chips and the steak and fries. All were good, especially the fish and chips. Generous portions. Good drinks. Good mix of indoor and outdoor dining.
