the atmosphere is exciting featuring a great view of the city and a cool garden room with a sweet koi pond.  its a little on the pricey side, dinner for 2 can easily run over $100 if you are drinking.  The food is good but not great.  I probably won't come back without a cupon.  Yamahiro has an interesting history that can be read about on their website.  minus 1 star for being overpriced for no reason. minus 1 star for the food being nothing special.
