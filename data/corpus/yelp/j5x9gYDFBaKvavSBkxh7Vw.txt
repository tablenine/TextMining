Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
after a full weekend of moving across the city - my family and i found this little gem late monday afternoon.. . the employees were as nice as can be! the decor fun and bright - very clean and comfortable!. . then the food! - im a sucker for diner food. but this wasnt the normal overly greasy diner food. it was perfect! a good amount of options to choose from (pasta to breakfast to burgers...etc) my sister got a plain grilled cheese and chocolate shake - delicious (i stole a few bites). . a really reasonably priced place to enjoy breakfast, lunch, or dinner with friends and family!
