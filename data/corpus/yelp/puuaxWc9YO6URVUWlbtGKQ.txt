I have been here quite a few times. I haven't had anything i don't like. The hush puppys are amazing. The shrimp and grits made me almost cry when i had them. perfect on a cold day. The Ruben is also amazing! Best Ruben i have ever had. . . Now beer. I have had many of the beers and just about all of them have been great. The staff is very knowledgeable so just tell them what you like and they will bring you back some samples.
