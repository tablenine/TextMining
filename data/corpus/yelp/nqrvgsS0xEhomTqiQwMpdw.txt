Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
I came here with my husband for our anniversary during DineLA week and it was everything I could have ever imagined and more.. . We came for lunch and sat right next to the courtyard (apparently the courtyard's tables were all reserved).  The weather was perfect and the view was wonderful.. . I got the tandoori salmon which was delicious and so meticulously prepared. My husband got the pork... so good.. . The dessert was amazing.... . Spago lives up to its reputation.  I'm going to have to find an excuse to come to this wonderful restaurant again!  Getting to dine here is what makes living in LA awesome!
