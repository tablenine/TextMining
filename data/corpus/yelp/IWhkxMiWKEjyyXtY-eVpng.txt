Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Went there for a birthday outing. Been going to Lawry's since a child and they still knocks it out of the park, still fantastic. Had the the Beef Bowl cut with creamed spinach, yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes, whipped cream horseradish, sizzling skillet of mushrooms, the spinning bowl salad, jumbo shrimp cocktail and a bottle of wine. Nothing but par excellence on the whole meal and experience. Reservations are recommended, we had one with minimal wait time to be seeded. Service is prompt and friendly and the decor is still classic of what a beef house should look and feel like. . . Only complaint is not of Lawry's but of some of the diners. Can not believe what people will wear to such a classy and elegant dinning experience, shorts and collar-less shirt, really people? They where few but stood out like a rotten brushstroke within a masterpiece. Men please wear business casual at least.. . Go early and often, for special occasions or not, just GO!
