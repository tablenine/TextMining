Best vegetarian restaurant i have ever been to hands down.  I actually was surprised by the review that this was not full of flavor...my boyfriend and I are not even vegetarians and we were shocked by how flavorful the food was.  We loved it!  It is best to order about 3 courses each and split them.  They are not very tiny but not huge either and they taste very light, but we feeling satisfied and not stuffed it was the prefect amount :)
