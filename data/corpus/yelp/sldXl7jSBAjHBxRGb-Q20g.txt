Restaurant: Fox Bros Bar-B-Q
Category: Barbeque
For a bbq joint, it doesn't get any better than Fox Bros.  My husband has recently developed a fetish for bbq.  So, we have been traveling to the various bbq places in Atlanta.  Fox Bros is by far the best.  . . We arrived at 8:00 on a Saturday, and there was a short wait.  We were seated, and our friends immediately ordered the chicken wings and "the lopez."  The girls were insisting that we only 6 wings, while the guys pleaded to order 12.  It's a good thing that we ordered 12, because the wings were devoured!  We could have easily eaten another 12.  "The Lopez" was also good, but next time, I would just order the tater tots.. . For entrees, I had the chicken, my husband and friend had the sliced brisket, and our other friend had the "burger."  All was wonderful.  While the chicken was a tad dry, the coleslaw was plenty moist.. . The service was good, and the atmosphere appropriate.  . . We were too full for dessert, but we look forward to returning next time for more incredible bbq!. . For the best bbq in Atlanta, head to Fox Bros!
