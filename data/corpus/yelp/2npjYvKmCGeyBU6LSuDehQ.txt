Finally checked this place out after eager anticipation.  . . Food: OK but not great.  I like that we have a restaurant that doesn't shy from serving animal innards and things in jars.  food is all extremely rich and heavy though, even the salad we had with rabbit bacon and roasted butternut squash.  Rabbit bacon overpowered it unless you made the perfect bite  . . Kumamoto oysters were awesome - fresh and served with a great pickled cucumber/vinegary sauce.  Lamb liver fritters were great - almost too glutinous though.  scallops are supposedly one of their best entrees but I was underwhelmed.  I felt I could have easily sauteed some scallops just as well in a super rich brown butter sauce.   In fact, everything seems very simple and easy to prepare on the menu - but I think that's what they are going for.. . Service was also not amazing.  Server seemed very apathetic.  She was not the least bit enthusiastic about the food like you see with staff at their other restaurants. . . The space in the restaurant is well designed.  kind of a modern farmhouse feel.  Place is worth checking out but doesnt hold a candle to Floataway Cafe.  (and obviously Bacchanalia)
