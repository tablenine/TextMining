I've never really been a big fan of Front Page News for food.  No specific reason that I can think of other then everything seems to be overpriced by $1.. . My meal started with a Cajun bloody mary which had some cajun spice mix on the rim as well as in the glass which really gave some good flavor to the mary.  I had a buffalo chicken sandwich with pasta salad for I think $9.  The sandwich was pretty average but the pasta salad was quite good....they even had crumbled cheese in it.  But $9??? Eh more like a $7 sammich.. . My girlfriend had a couple of poached eggs with spinach and cheese I think which I didnt have but did get her leftover potatoes.....they were tasty.  Had a couple more fat tire beers.. . During our meal my girlfriend wanted the closed captioning on the soccer game so we asked the waiter to change it.  Within minutes someone came out with a remote and made it happen.  . . Also during the course of our meal the manager came out to make sure everything was ok.  Our waiter was new.  How do I know this?  He told us.  That and he asked how my gf wanted her poached eggs cooked.  But he was a really nice guy and I thought he did a really good job for being a new waiter.  Hell he was pretty much as good or better then most experienced waiters.. . Yes, I hate overpaying. Actually I was surprised this place only charged me $6.50 for my Bloody Mary since there werent any drink prices on the menu.  But I like the food here, the service was exceptional and this place has sooooo many tv's I'm thinking this might be my go place if I'm in the mood to go out for college football and a meal this fall.  I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could.
