Restaurant: Barney&#39;s Beanery
Category: Bars
Peculiar decor, mediocre food (typical pub grub at restaurant prices, perhaps to pay for the decor), and lousy service .  Barney's is your typical sports bar but with peculiar decor.  . . The "Stratosphere" is a triple-decker club-style sandwich with pastrami, turkey, and bacon (mmm meat) on rye, for those curious - it was not stratosphe-rific.  A few additional notes:  There is an upstairs, ground floor, and basement.  The basement smells like dirty hockey socks (if you know a hockey player, you know what this means) - but service is usually quicker downstairs.  The upstairs is nice but they refused to open it until 5PM despite there being a 3 hour plus wait for tables. . . Scene: busy Saturday day (and night) / NCAA College Football. Order: "Stratosphere", beer. Service: could be worse and also much better. Cost: $13/pitchers, $12/meal
