It's been six-ish years since I've been here BUT I do remember the food being great! . . I took off the stars for the condescending waitress who mysteriously vanished halfway into our meal.  Her name was Erin.  Not that it matters because I don't think she's working there anymore (well, I hope she isn't because it's been six-ish years).   The rest of the waitstaff wasn't great, either.
