Seriously, why do people like this place so much?! I hit the Kogi truck this weekend when they were in Culver City for an afternoon appearance. I was pretty excited for it too. I went to the truck once on a Friday night and gave up after seeing the line. But the other day I was up for the line.. . Thankfully I had good company because the best part of the experience was waiting in line. We cracked jokes and laughed the whole time.  After about an hour and a half we got to the front and ordered 7 tacos (they are small) to split between us. 2 ribs, 2 pork, 2 tofu, and 1 chicken (I don't eat chicken, its the dirtiest meat on the planet.) . . The wait for the tacos after we ordered was another 20 minutes.  I was so excited that I didn't care. Once the tacos came out, I was even more excited. The looked delicious. I added a little Sriracha aka hot cock to each of them. I made sure not to put too much (even thought I typically douse my food with it) to avoid masking the flavors.. . Here is the thing though ... What flavors? This taco was bland city. I had the tofu first. They didn't do anything to the tofu. They just took it out of the package and went from there! No seasoning, no marinating, it wasn't even cooked.  . . Next!. . Next up was the pork. This one was a little better but not much better.  And finally was the best one, the ribs. The concept is good, the hype is good but the food was just meh.  The meat lacked seasoning and the cabbage they put on it had so much vinegar that it made my stomach turn.. . I am assuming that I needed to be drunk in order to enjoy these tacos. Or perhaps they were feeling lazy the day I had them. I will definitely not go out of my way to try Kogi again. I hear they serve them at the Alibi room, so maybe if I ever find myself there I will give them another go. . . Good hype. Meh food.
