yum.. normally, the thought of of thanksgiving dinner served by anyone other than my mom has me thinking of yucky frozen dinners or hospital food.  not here! i have no clue why i decided to order it. but i did. and it was delicious. far from yucky.. . sometimes you need to just get away from the "Scene" and enjoy tasty food in a relaxed setting. this is your spot. cozy into a booth, order a beer, and relax.  you'll find yourself on (silver) cloud 9.
