Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I got off work and one of my clients offered to take me out to dinner for my birthday.. . Okay he didn't offer. I made him. But I just considered it part of his training. It's funny I used to train with him at another fight academy and I used to put the hurt on him regularly. So he decided to train with me to get as good as I am. Part of that means taking me out to eat!. . He suggest Palms Thai. Sounds good. When we got there, Thai Elvis was singing and I was amazed. They had bought the metal Elvis sculpture that used to be displayed in a gallery downtown. The one I used to pass by all the time. . . Thai Elvis looks nothing like Elvis IMO, doesn't sound like him and moves like the Asian imitation of how Elvis moved. But that's what's great about it. It's very campy.. . They were filming the guy when we got there. Then I spotted the Thai chef guy from PBS, the one who goes all over Thailand showing you authentic dishes. The one with the bandanna. You foodies know who I am talking about! I said what's up and he didn't even acknowledge me. Who does he think he is? Yen Can Cook or something?. . Anyways our food was about a 3 but the Elvis gave this place that extra star. And the fact it was free helps too. We got beef salad, salty fish fried rice, and spicy seafood soup. It's the saltiest meal I've ever had! It's large hall seating. Which is kind of weird for me to see in a Thai restaurant.. . Anyways our conversation went down normal paths most guys talk about. It was basically about if we knew of any illegitimate children that we had. I said no. He said yes. You know. Same old same old.. . Actually it's not my birthday yet. I gotta get packing though. By tradition I am always on a plane during my actual birthday. Which means I never get older crossing state lines, I am in the air, space time continuum, etc .
