I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could. Â Was pleasantly surprised here-. the food was tasty (and I usually do not like tex mex or mexican because it's so majorly bloating) but I have gotta say..... my veggie tamales were...yummy!. and my ceviche was surprisingly....tasty!. Guacamole=fresh and awesome. drinks were not very strong but pleasant to drink.. . Veeery loud and busy on a Saturday night but hey- I actually had a very good experience and I would for sure go back.
