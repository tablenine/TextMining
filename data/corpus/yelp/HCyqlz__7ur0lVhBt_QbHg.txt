I have drank the kool-aid and it came in the form of an orange-infused cappucino.  I'm a slave to coffee and let me tell you, it just doesn't get any better than this.  Their waitstaff is incredibly knowledgable and surprisingly nice for a joint like this.  I was expecting our beautiful tattooed waitress to give us the usual I-work-in-Silverlake-so-I'm-totally-over-you kind of attitude, yet she was uber professional, very nice and quick on her feet.  The interior is impeccable and the food is worthy of their prices.  I'm sorry, brioche donut holes?  Um, it just doesn't get any better than that.  When they ask if you'd like the cream to go along with them, don't think, just say, "Yes please!"  I (heart) La Mill.
