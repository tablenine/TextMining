Yes the wait is terrible. I went once at 10am and waited a hour and then at 2:30pm and waited 45 minutes (both on Saturday). After 3 though, it seems like you can just walk in and get a table.. . The portions are gigantic! The waiters are really nice, but slow since there are a million people there. It's crowded and loud.. . I've had their scrambles and pancakes and the strawberry waffles and they've all been delicious! Parking is impossible, your best bet is the Rite-Aid parking lot.
