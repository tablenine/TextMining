Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
You hear a lot of hype about a lot of places, but this is one that does not live up to its reputation. The hard-shelled tacos are good, but so are Taco Bell's. The guacamole is good. The burritos however, are just bad. . . Granted, if you're drunk and hungry, as people often are, the greasy food here will definitely satisfy.
