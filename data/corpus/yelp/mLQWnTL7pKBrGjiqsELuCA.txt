Yep, I still like it! . . Our waiter was on point for the majority of the night and kept the beer flowing. My spinach and feta wrap was surprisingly tasty and the perfect amount of food.. . Trivia (Wednesday nights at 8:30) was pretty fun, with the questions starting out embarrassingly simple and becoming increasingly harder. $30, $20, and $10 to the top 3 teams, all in bar cash that you can use that night! Definitely a nice perk that a lot of trivia locations hold back. . . I adored sitting out behind the big garage door windows that were open on this mild February night. The people watching was phenomenal and it truly felt like a neighborhood kind of joint.
