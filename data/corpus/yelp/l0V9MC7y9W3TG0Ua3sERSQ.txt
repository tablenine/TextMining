Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Yep, after my second visit, I am pretty much ready to agree with Amina--this is the best Chinese restaurant around.. . I found this place through a friend who is typically clueless about good places to go, but boy did he ever dig up a gem.  The classy interior is utterly unexpected stepping in from the grimy neighborhood outside.. . The service is merely adequate, but who cares.  The food is phenomenal.  Last night we ordered spring rolls (at B+, the "worst" dish of the evening) and a superb pan-fried calamari appetizer.  . . My spicy garlic chicken was excellent and just the right level of spice for me.  My friends had the Red China and tofu lo mein, both delicious.  I can't recall what we ordered last time, but it was so enjoyable that we came back only four months later.  Believe me, that is rare for me when there are so many restaurants in the city still left to try.
