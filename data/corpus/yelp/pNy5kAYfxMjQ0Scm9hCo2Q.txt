We both got the salad bowl meal but i did it right.  They give you the base of lettuce, 5 falafel balls and two add ins (we both got hummus and eggplant), then you go wild on the salad bar- but its not your typical options.  I piled on roasted garlic broccoli and califlower, israeli salad, beets, roasted carrots, chikpea salad and tons of sauce.  I could barely close the lid to my bowl.  Two meals squeezed into a bowl (one eaten at 8pm, one eaten at 10:30...gross) and a drink costs about ten bucks.  If only they would throw in some pita, it would have been perfect.  This place is all about the salad bar and fries.......the actual falafel is fine, but most places have better.  If you need something quick its a good option.  We all sat in Union Square park (only four stools in the joint) when it was too cold to do so, and looked homeless.
