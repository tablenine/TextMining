Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Very small inside, so going during lunch can be a challenge.  It wasn't too long of a wait though.  Inside is nothing to write home (or in a review) about.. . Since this was  my first visit, I just stuck with the standard Umami burger and didn't branch out.  . . The burger was delicious, if slightly pinker than I'd normally go.  Fries were really good too.  Service was adequate.  Paying $2.50 for valet to move your car 20' is a bit absurd, but there is no parking and that is pretty cheap.. . Price for the burger, fries, diet coke, and a desert was about $18.  The burger itself was $9.. . Overall, very enjoyable and very tasty burger.  I still like 8oz better as you have more options for your burger and better ambiance.
