This is Greek and Mediterranean food on a grand scale.  Premium ingredients and attention to fresh seafood also equals premium prices. The wine list includes many greek bottles with nothing less than $37 which is a bit much for table wine.  The food here is delightfully prepared and presented.  The chef and owner is dazzling with fish.  True to the basics of Greek cuisine, everything is heavy on the olive oil, lemon, and oregano.  This simple combination combined with fire equals a great way to cook the fine ingredients.  I enjoyed the shrimp and feta cheese and tomato sauce appetizer.  The main entree of grilled lamb chops were perfectly griled to medium.  Deserts were a let down with a poor version of rice pudding and a so so chocolate lava cake.  Service was impeccable.
