This is hands down the best sushi in Chicago, but best of all is their lunch. For $7 you get miso soup, edamame, a house salad, a california roll, and another maki roll. Then I roll out the door because it's so much food. Mitch is awesome, and will always answer any questions or offer samples of something you are iffy about. The wait gets really long the later you go, so go early if you want some delicious eats. Also, order the Arizona roll and thank me later.
