Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Build your way up on the levels of spiciness.... I went from regular to hyper-orochon and paid dearly.  This apparently wasn't warning enough.  Did I learn my lesson?  Of course not.... Special 2 hurt going in as well as on its way out, and I'll have another as soon as my GI tract heals from the burns.. . Pricing is for the basic bowl, the extras that normally come in ramen (hard boiled egg, chashu, bamboo shoots, whatever floats your boat) are a la carte so it can be pretty expensive.. . Survey says most people think it's good for groups.  I would agree if group meant 4 people.  The restaurant is very small and you'd have to wait a while to get any larger of a group in.
