Split decision review. . . On one hand The Boundary is choadbox central... with an abundant overflow of douchedudes and Paris Hilton wannabes cavorting around, you wonder if anyone is actually there to watch sports and not just get boinked. However, on the other hand it does provide for pretty interesting people watching - as a matter of fact, I got so caught up watching these vapid cronies interacting that I managed to spy this hot guy I went out with once back in the day... homeboy was cute, unfortunately though, turned out the poor sob only had two functioning brain cells that were desperately fighting to form coherent thoughts - it was insanely inconvenient for him (as one might imagine) and resulted in him calling me Brenda all night. Actually, I've run into him several times in the past year and at the following places... . . The Tavern **. RAM Brewery (in the burbs) ** . a Fallout Boy concert **. . Apparently the lesson here is: where this guys lands, douchery is sure to follow. If you see him, run, fast. . . Clearly The Boundary isn't my first pick for a spot to hang, although all of you sports enthusiasts (and dudes that dig blondes in tight sweaters) should bookmark NOW. I imagine I'd own this atmosphere on off-nights when large, popular sporting events aren't taking place or in the summer when the patio reopens. The only reason they don't have next-to-no-stars is because their food was monster good... big, tasty burgers with all kinds of fixins', great salads, super spicy wings and a really nice beer list to boot. . . Am I likely to go back? Maybe only to point out 'the guy' to you in case we miss him at next weeks tool show.. . ** [clearly all places I went to under duress]
