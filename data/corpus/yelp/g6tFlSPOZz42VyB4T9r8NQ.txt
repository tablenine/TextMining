Not cheap but damn good. I've been 3 times, each time exceptional.. The cusine is american with a hawaiian/pacific twist, and I'll take it. I've had many of the specials, some almost leaving me in tears of joy from the overpowering elation of my tastebuds.. . The shortribs: best I've ever had. The mahi mahi was exquisite with a sauce that I wanted to put in an IV and mainlined into me. There is a great martini menu and if it is busy the bar is a cool place to hang. They also have a take out menu!! And the desserts? Sinners paradise!. . Nice place for a date. Nice place for an excellent tantalizing flavored meal. You'll need to make reservations on the weekends. Yum
