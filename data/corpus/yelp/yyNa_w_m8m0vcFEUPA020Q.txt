All right, I'm getting concerned here. This is twice I've gone with Yelper picks on Chinese food and have been totally let down.. . We got Friendship delivery tonight with high hopes but alas, nuh-uh.  Me, I went with the champagne lemon chicken; the hubs, he went for sesame chicken.  Two dishes, $30.  Yikes.. . Both chicken dishes were overcooked to nuggets of gravel.  I think we're still trying to get it all out of our teeth.  Yeah, I know, floss.  The champagne lemon chicken had a horrible, sharp, almost chemical taste at first and there wasn't all that much chicken.  And the sesame chicken, while there was a lot in the box, was pretty flavorless.  I guess next time we get Chinese, we'll wing it.. . I will say, pretty clever to deliver the food in a cake box, hence the second star.
