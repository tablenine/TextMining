I live off their "monster" sandwich. It's sliced roast beef with carmelized onions, grilled mushrooms, tomato, spinach, cheese and horseradish. All this on top of a huge piece of flatbread. I usually eat 1/3 off the top off first, then I fold it into the world's biggest taco. U r gonna need both hands and it will be messy.
