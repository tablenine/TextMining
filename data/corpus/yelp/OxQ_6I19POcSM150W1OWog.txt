Their sausages..wow. A big WOW! That should sum it up. But the bartenders over there are huge A$$e$. They're freakin' rude as hell. They know business will keep on coming regardless, so they think it's OK to talk down on paying customers. The owner(s) probably know who I'm talking about too and should do something about it. Next time, I'm ordering my beer in the front entrance.
