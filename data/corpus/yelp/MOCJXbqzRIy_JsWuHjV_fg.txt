Once upon a time, a girl walked into a bar.  She saw that the drink special of the evening was a plum martini.  Intrigued, she ordered one.  It was as if it were made by a master artisan.  Then she had another and possibly another.  And the rest is not to be discussed according to the court order.. . The bartender, Tim, is just awesome.  Most people tending bar want to make the drink as quickly as possible, get their tip, and have me go away so they can take care of the next person.  But watching Tim make a martini really is like watching an artist at their craft, but not in an obnoxious way that makes you think he watched Cocktail a zillion times.. . I always seem to come to P'Cheens as Act II of Girls Night Out, so I have yet to come for dinner.  For me, it's just a great late night spot.  (Good enough to compensate for the part about needing a DD or a taxi to get home.). . The decor is lovely.  The service is fantastic.  They always seem to have DJs in, but I'm non-plussed there.  I've never tried the food, so I can't judge that.  If you come on a very busy night, it may be standing room only, and that sucks like a porn fluffer.
