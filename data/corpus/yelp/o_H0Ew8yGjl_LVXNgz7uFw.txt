I love that Veggie Grill has moved out of Irvine and is starting to conquer the LA area! This food is addicting. The fried chicken is pretty good but I love love love the veggie steak, especially a la carne asada. And you can order any sandwich without bun and have steamed kale instead?? Yes please! Oh Veggie Grill how I miss you.
