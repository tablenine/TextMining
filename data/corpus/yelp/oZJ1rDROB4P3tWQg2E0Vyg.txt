Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Depending on the time you go to Umami, you could end up waiting hours to get seated. I suggest if you do wait to go in at normal dinner/lunch time you should definately BYOB and drink while you wait. . . That's the lovely thing about Umami, they are more than happy with you bringing your own alcoholic beverages. They don't serve any and therefore if you bring your own bottle of wine or 6 pack of beer they have no issues. But they do have regular drinks such as diet coke &amp; they also serve Mexcian coke. . . Moving on, they have a good variation of burgers. I have to admit that the Hatch burger was probably one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. It has the green chiles that were spicy but not too much. The meat itself is top choice and is always cooked perfectly. I've also had the Truffle Burger which is something you could never find anywhere else. . . Their onion rings are battered in tempura mix so they are actually a little less greasy than the normal onion ring. They also are always the perfect circle and taste great with their ketchup and or their aiole sauce. Their fries are quite delicious as well. . . I definately recommend this place to whoever loves burgers.
