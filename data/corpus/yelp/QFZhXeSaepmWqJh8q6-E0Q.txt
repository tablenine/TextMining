great space.. good food.. beautiful patio.. . awful service.. . at least our server aja wasnt rockin it that night.. saw her only a few times while we were there.. she forgot to order our appetizer.. took her ages to get us out drinks.. some how our veggie friend got bacon on her order. (could have been a kitchen mistake.). . hoping she was just having a bad night because other than the slow service i liked the place.
