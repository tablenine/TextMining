Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Really really tasty fish taco Ensenada style. located on the same lot next to a car repair place. But don't let that deter you. Just walk in, never mind the decor, head straight to the cashier and place your order, Fish or Shrimp taco. Then order your drinks, pay up and bon appetite. The fish or shrimp are dumped in batter and then deep fried. Served with soft tortilla and you get to choose from tons of salsa options and don't forget the cabbage toppings. . . Happy Eating
