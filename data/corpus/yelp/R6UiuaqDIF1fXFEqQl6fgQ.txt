I like this place when I'm craving sushi and not looking to spend $80 + dollars at Sushi Wabi. It's a way better option than Tsuki or Sushi Pink. (sushi pink is terrible by the way) We can usually order takeout for less the $40 and the fish is consistently fresh and the service is quick. We really enjoyed the sunrise maki, the crunchy spicy tuna and the egg rolls are great. I'd stay away from the Godzilla roll it's $15 and way too much going.
