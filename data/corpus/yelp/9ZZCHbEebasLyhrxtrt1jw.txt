I've been going to place for over ten years, and not much has changed.  The prices didn't go up more than 50 cents on the subs since my first time so the value is as good as the quality of the food.    I've even had subs made for some parties and they are great.   If you don't want to stand in line call and place a pick up, although I've seen lines for pick up longer than the regular line : )    BTW, looking at the counter the left side is for placing orders, and the right side is for pick ups.. . YES the parking sucks around here
