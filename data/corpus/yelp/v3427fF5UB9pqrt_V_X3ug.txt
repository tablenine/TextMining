I've been here previously for a company party and occupied the private room on the 2nd floor.  That night we had more of a smorgasboard of food and everything was good.  Just becareful not to lock yourself in the bathroom, the locks are strange.. . Last night, some friends and I met up for dinner in the dining room.  I called in the afternoon to make a reservation.  I was put on hold for a good 5 minutes.  -1 star, but eventually made the reservation.. . The food was really good.  With 4 people, we opted for some hummus, babbaganoush,  labneh and chankleech to start.  The pitas mimick popovers by design--very airy with a nice bubble and accomodating to stuff any of the above.  Each appetizer had a well of extra virgin olive oil so nonfat it's not, but good for your ticker.. . Our entrees were the Tuna Kibbeh Naya, Branzini, and Chicken Shish Taouk.  We ordered the black cod at the suggestion of the waiter, but they had run out of it.  All the food was prepared very well and very tasty.  We added the Phoenician Fries and Dandelion Greens as sides.  Eh, they were OK, I'd rather had another dish of hummus.  The perfect bite of food would have been a little pita, a dash of hummus, and the chicken.. . We had 2 pitchers of sangria.  It was refreshing and came in a decorative decantor with plenty of fruit floating at the bottom.   But at $45 a pitcher I think a glass of wine or two would have been the way to go, but if you're splurging go right ahead. . The decor is nice also.  The front area has plenty of room to order some of the appetizers, drinks, and is socially active.   It's set up in a way that's conducive to speaking comfortably.  The dining room walls are downright funky.  I've never seen anything like that before.. . Overall an excellent meal and restaurant.
