Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
I don't think i'll ever give VEGGIE GRILL a bad review.  They are still by far, my most favorite veggie restaurant.  I ordered my "regular":  Carne Asada sandwich with Kale and a side of sweetheart (sweet potato) fries.  . . gosh, i love veggie grill....
