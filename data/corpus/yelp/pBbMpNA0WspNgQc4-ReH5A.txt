Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
God I love southern food.  Smoke Daddy does a great job of cooking meat, tea, sides and even provides a little attitude (hint, hint Erin.........that ones for you *wink*) even if she isn't from the South.. . I friend of mine and I were catching up and stopped by this place for a little food and drinks.  The place was PACKED at 8pm and stayed that way until around 10pm, then cleared out like it was no bodies business.  I didn't get to try any desserts, but it is a "to do" the next time around.  Live music was also in the joint during my visit and it wasn't too loud either...yea.. . Back to the Erin comment....she is the nice blonde bombshell bartender that did nothing but serve up drinks and smart remarks while serving us......of course all in good fun, she actually overheard us talking about Yelp and shared some stories about customers reviewing the site.. . Great little joint and one you should try should you get a hankerin for some good ol' southern food.
