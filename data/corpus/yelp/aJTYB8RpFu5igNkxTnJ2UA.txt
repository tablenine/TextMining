Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
This is the place where I take my dates before they start thinking I only know ghetto, kitschy, hole in the wall places. It adds a little class to my choice of dining - then they get to know me further and realize it was only a flash :). . Once you cross the little door, you're in a whole new world.  The place is one of the more romantic places I've been to without it really trying - meaning it seems natural not forced.  . . I've never been disappointed by the food and the whole dining experience is five star.  However, I need to reserve my five stars only for Sushi and Sake so 4 stars but 5 stars if I didn't have this OCD about sushi.
