I wanted to like Rodan, but I just wasn't feeling it.  . . We came here for drinks the other night, and everything was just a bit off.  Service was kind of slow, the drinks tasted kind of water-y, the music was way too loud, and everything seemed more expensive than it needed to be.  . . It's not an awful place, and I'd give it another shot to try the food.  But as a drinking destination?  Meh.
