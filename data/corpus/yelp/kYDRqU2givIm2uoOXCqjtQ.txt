Yum Yum! I totally enjoyed our brunch today at Gato Bizco. I had the garden omelet with the potatoes and a biscuit. The omelet was perfectly cooked and the biscuit was delicious, much more of a "southern biscuit" than the ones served at Flying Biscuit across the street. . The only down side was the wait. We ended up waiting 45 mins but it was worth it.
