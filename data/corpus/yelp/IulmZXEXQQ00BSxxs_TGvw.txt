Restaurant: Fado Irish Pub
Category: Pubs
The new Fado's is rather impressive, the rooftop bar being a major feature.   I must say, however, that I miss some of the character of the old digs.  . . I am always amused by chain restaurants who buy their authenticity from a pub building company in Dublin.  In this case, it was the Irish Pub Company.  I am sure they spent a fortune but does anybody else see the cynicism?. . For a chain, Fado's does many things right.  The food is consistently good-  the haddock taste fresh, good corned beef, Irish breakfast plus lots of American bar food. Irish and European sporting events are carried via satellite.  And, they have local Irish session musicians on Monday nights.   . . Lots of energy.  All in all, a good effort.. . I don't like the valet parking either!
