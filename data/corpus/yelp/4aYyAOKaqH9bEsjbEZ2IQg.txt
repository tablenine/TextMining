I found myself there on a late Wednesday evening. Up the stairs I went to the bar/ lounge area and kicked back. I tried the Leche Sangria which was very yummy and unique. The entrees were definitely okay, but didn't tickle my palette. I'd recommend it for the very cozy atmosphere upstairs, but I'd definitely try the other gems Chicago has to offer before coming back to dine.
