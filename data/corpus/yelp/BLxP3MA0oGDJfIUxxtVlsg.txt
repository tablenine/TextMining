I love shrimp, and am growing to love crawfish as well. But I'm not liking the long wait. My sisters and I have tried coming back here a couple times now and by 6PM there's already an hour long wait ahead us off. The parking lot is also packed, making me fear accidents at every turn.. . You eat right on the table. No forks, spoons, or plates! Kids will love it. There's a new sheet of cardboard covering the table for each party and an entire roll of paper towels. Yes, it's that messy. Beware of your purses ladies.. . Ordering is really cool. Pick your size, flavors, and spice level. I'm a Plain Jane when it comes to these types of things. Steamed shrimp and crawfish will do just fine for me.
