Restaurant: Sura Thai Bistro
Category: Thai
Sura is definitely one of my new favs. It also helps that is in my neighborhood. I've been a few times now and have not had a bad meal. The pad thai is amazing, not greasy like your average thai place. They have Thai "tapas". Our waiter the first time I went recommended anything that was fried or a dumpling. HA. We had the calamari which you definitely have to try. If you like fish, they have some great entrees like the salmon and the swordfish. Definitely give this place a try.
