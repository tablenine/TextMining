Came here for the Monday/Tuesday night sushi special.  I was only able to try the items off of that menu, including their shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna roll, bagel roll, and california roll.  For the price, it was okay, but the sushi is mediocre at best.  I'd say that the rice is a bit too try for sushi rice.  . . However, all in all, 3.5 stars given the fact that those 4 rolls only cost $10.  However, the rolls only include 4 pieces, so it's not exactly the deal of the century, but it will fill you up.  I may or may not come back again-- they do serve other types of food, and it is only a 5 minute walk from where I live.
