This place is really great, it has perfect location, it is right near wrigley field.  we wnt there right before the game and the area is full of proud cubs fans.  ok back to the food, we started off with Sangria, i think it costs 8 dollars, it was alright, a little too much ice.  the food was so good though, the thin crust roast chicken pizza was too die for, the crust was so tasty.  Also the mac and cheese was really good, the cheese sauce was a lil thin but had amzing flavour.  Its accompaniment was a bland coleslaw, they should have left that off of the plate.
