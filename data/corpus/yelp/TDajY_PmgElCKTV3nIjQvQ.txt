Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
I wanted to like this place. I read a short and seductive article about this restaurant in a travel magazine and thought my friends and I should give it a try. The article turned out to be just written very well. Wicker Park in the evening hours is not really my crowd, but I will ignore that because it doesn't really have to do with the establishment, its food, its service or its ambiance.. . We walked in and sat at a table. I think it was a Saturday night. Now, the two friends I were with are completely different. One, has the remarkable ability to have fun anywhere she goes. She could find a way to have a blast at a funeral. The other friend is a little more reserved and prefers loud, obnoxious punk music. However, we all had the same opinion of this particular joint. We were incredibly underwhelmed from the moment we sat down. I have a bit of an obsession with pulled pork, so I ordered that with sweet potato fries. The fries were heavy and gooey like a used tampon. The rest of the food lacked flavor, and quality. It was just bad. The fun loving friend ordered a margarita and it sent it back for being much too sweet. The bartender looked at her sinisterly and then made her another one...which tasted exactly the same. Â We all left feeling like we wasted our time and money. However, there is a reason for that...we did.
