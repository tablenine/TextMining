Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
I visited Dolce last week while I was in Atlanta, GA on a business trip.. . Good things first...The place looks very nice. The tables are set in a kind of intimate way with curtains around them, perfect for a date (too bad I didn't have one). It was Monday night and the place was comfortably crowded, enough people for a good vibe. The drinks were good and my Chicken Picatta was very tasty. I didn't have dessert, unfortunately :-(. . Bad things...Elizabeth, our waitress, was kind of slow taking into consideration that it was not a very busy night. We waited a while for the drinks even though the bar was not busy at all...meanwhile she was running back and forth to the back area. The food came promptly because it was not delivered by her (thank God!). Then she took her time to ask if everything was OK...I was almost done when she did, but at least she did.. . After dinner I sat at the bar for another glass of wine and the bartenders were very nice.. . Overall...it was a nice ambiance, perfect for Monday night when you're visiting another city and want to go somewhere. I wouldn't visit on a weekend and if I go back to Dolce I want another waitress...no offense Elizabeth.
