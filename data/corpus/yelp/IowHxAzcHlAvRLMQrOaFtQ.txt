Bossa Nova Ponche: Yummy sangria! Best thing was that it came in a big glass not those dinky little wine glasses. Â . . Bossa's Salad with Shrimp: Great salad. Fresh veggies and warm jumbo shrimp. Big portion. Could've just had this and my tummy would've been satisfied. . . Chicken Stragonoff: Honestly, not that great. Chicken was tough and their pink sauce tasted like warm Thousand Island dressing. Good rice though. . . Service: Excellent! Very attentive and efficient. . . Worm on the wall: This kinda ruined the night. I'm not even sure if it was a worm. It was fatter and shorter than a worm. After we finished eating and was finishing up our drinks, I was leaning against the wall when I saw, in my peripheral vision, the wall moving. It was this creepy crawler that camouflaged with the reddish wall. Eww eww eww! . . Could've been a five star...
