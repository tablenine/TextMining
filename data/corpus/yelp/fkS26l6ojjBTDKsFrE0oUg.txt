Five stars, I obviously love this place. The food is amazing, and the atmosphere is so laid-back. Sola lacks the pretension that accompanies a lot of restaurants in its caliber. I have been there for brunch and dinner, and both are great! . . Brunch: Try the banana macadamia nut pancakes with nutella cream sauce! Sounds heavy, but they are actually light and delicious. . . Dinner: While it is pricey, the dinner here is totally worth the money. My boyfriend took me here for a special occasion, and it was the perfect spot. The staff was attentive without being overbearing. The artichoke fritter appetizer was surprisingly light, and the accompanying truffle honey was a perfect dip. For my main course, I had a lamb chop special that came with mashed potatoes, carrots, and shaved fennel. The lamb was so tender and juicy, and it was stuffed with the perfect amount of gooey cheese. For dessert, I had caramel apple bread pudding, topped with vanilla soy ice cream. It is probably one of the top five desserts I've had EVER. I highly recommend it. . . Moral of the story: Go to Sola! You won't regret it!
