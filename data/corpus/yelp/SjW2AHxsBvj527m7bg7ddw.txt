This place has a nice outdoor seating area and the food was decent.  My boyfriend really enjoyed his Kentucky open face sandwich (think it was turkey or something), and I had the smoked salmon on a bagel.  It wasn't the best lox on a bagel I've had (for comparison, Einstein lox tastes no worse and is probably cheaper).  It was decent though.  The mimosa was fine.  I mostly enjoyed the atmosphere, the nice seating under a white canopy on a warm day.  The staff (hostess, waiter) could've been friendlier, but they did their job.  The only real negative was that they sat us outside at a table like 10 inches away from a table directly next to us inside.  I think the two tables are usually separated by a glass door or window when it's cooler out, but it was kind of awkward sitting right next to this other couple and hearing their conversation throughout the whole meal.  OH WELL.
