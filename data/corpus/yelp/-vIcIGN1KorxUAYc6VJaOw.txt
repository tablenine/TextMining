My friend took me here to eat. It's just another version of KFC but more pricey. I so do not like grit hehe (no mashed potato). . I'm giving them 4 stars because right after  we asked for the check, it took awhile for the waiter  to give us change! So we're like what's going on? SO basically, he just assumed that the change was his tip! We're like oh no sir! GIVE US OUR 10 dollar back har har. . I like the waffles though!
