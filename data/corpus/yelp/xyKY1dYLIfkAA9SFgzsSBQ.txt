I took my brother here for his birthday and b/c I had a gift certificate. The appetizers and sushi we had were nothing special and way overpriced. The goat cheese crab cakes sounded delicious but were bland and mushy. The softshell crab appetizer was ok, but the crab was very small, hardly any meat! . . We also got the lobster roll and the sesame crusted shrimp roll. Totally overpriced and really nothing unique about the roll. You could head up to St Mark's to get this stuff and it would taste the same.. . The entrees were delicious. We got the steak and lamb. Tasty and tender. We asked for the steak to be medium rare b/c we figured they would overcook it to be medium. Our theory was correct.. . I would say the star of the meal was the dessert. The bread pudding and lychee panna cotta were very good. I thoroughly enjoyed my lychee panna cotta and that would probably be the only reason I would go back (which I probably won't.). . It was really dark in the restaurant (it was only 7:30pm), so much so I kinda had a hard time seeing/reading the menu. . . Places like these make me wonder if we are really in a recession.
