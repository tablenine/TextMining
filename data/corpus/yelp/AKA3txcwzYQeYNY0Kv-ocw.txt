I really do love this place.  We used to go here after our late night classes let out on Thursday nights (yep, that's film school for ya - our class got out at 11pm).  It was a bit of a drive, and we usually had a big group so we had to wait, but once we got a seat...mmm.... . My favorite thing is the Cali California omelet.  I usually get it with egg whites.  It is an omelet with grilled onions, avocado, sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and the best chicken sausage I've ever had.  It is seriously so good.. . A close second is Alice's Egg Sandwich, which has basically the same elements at the Cal California (minus the sausage), only on a VERY buttery bun.  Yum.  My only issue is that it comes a la carte - with the omelet, you get hash browns, too, so it's a better deal.. . I'm also a fan of the Mac Daddy and Cheese balls.  Ask for marinara dipping sauce.  Fun to pass around!. . Parking seriously sucks - there is a metered lot a block away, but at peak times, it's full.  If you see a spot on the street, grab it!
