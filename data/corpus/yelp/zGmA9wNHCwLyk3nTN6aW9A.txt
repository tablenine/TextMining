Restaurant: Rock Bottom Restaurant &amp; Brewery
Category: Restaurants
Rock Bottom is awesome. Great microbrewed beers, and tasty delicious food. Our waiter, Josh, was one of the best waiters I've ever had. The rooftop deck provides a terrific skyscraper view on all sides. If I have to complain about anything, it's that the portions were relatively small. But I left the restaurant satisfied. Definitely will be going back here.. . And, deserving its own paragraph:. The Pint Glass Sundae dessert was one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life. It could be its own meal. If you do nothing else at Rock Bottom Brewery, order the Pint Glass Sundae.
