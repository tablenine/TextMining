"When are you going to have sex with Lane?!" was the question I wanted to ask Zack aka actor Todd Lowe when I saw him in line at Yuca's. However I realized that to the non-Gilmore Girls fan (seasons 1-4 being the bests), it would have been a wildly inappropriate question. I always leave actors alone. . . The little Yucatan Mexican food stand is a James Beard Foundation "American Classics" award winner. It's a winner for me because of their carne asada burrito. (The food is cooked with lard, a word of warning to the vegetarians out there).
