Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
my boyfriend and i were craving korean bbq so we decided to go to manna because my sister recommended it once. i was lucky to be able to find street parking. as i was walking to the restaurant, there was a lot of people screaming and laughing. i wasn't sure if i wanted to eat there since it was so loud, but my boyfriend said we should just try it. i actually liked the environment in there even though the music was a bit too loud for my ears. the meat was good. not bad for an ayce korean bbq restaurant. i would come back again and for 16.99, it can't get any better than this!
