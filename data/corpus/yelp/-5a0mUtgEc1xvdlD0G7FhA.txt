Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
First saw this place in a book listing "hot LA restaurants".  The décor looked interesting and simple.  Was really difficult to find.  Parking was limited in the lot and I feel I was lucky to find a spot.  Next to a Thai place and a Mongolian BBQ (next to try).. . Never would have believed I would become a Pho connoisseur.  Guess spending time in the OC and being so close to good Pho, has gotten me trying a lot.  Never had a Vietnamese restaurant give me a fortune cookie at the end of my meal, or deliver a bill for that matter.  A little different than I am used to and what is the norm in Little Saigon.  Also a shade more expensive.. . All in all, this is a good place for simple food.  Was I blown away, no.  But I will be back.  Had the Pho Tai Gan, which was pretty tasty.  They also have a good selection of beer and at least a couple that I hadn't tried before.  I'll probably try one of the bowls and the crunchy rolls next time.  And I have to try the Taiwan beer.  There aren't too many places that you can find authentic pho near downtown, so this is a good find.. . Planning on a follow up after my next visit.  Promise.
