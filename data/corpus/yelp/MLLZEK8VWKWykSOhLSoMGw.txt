Category: Japanese
absolutely overrated. the extremely long lines in front of daikokuya are very deceiving to the actual taste and experience of the place. the noodles are good and i wish there were more free toppings, but my biggest gripe with daikokuya is the broth. it was mediocre at best even after repeat visits when i asked for a stronger base. tonkotsu (pork based) ramen is my favorite and daikokuya definitely does tonkotsu a disservice.. . overall: long lines, mediocre ramen. . for better alternatives try shinsengumi or santouka
