This was a great spot! Not a real busy at lunch, but my first choice was not serving lunch, the next choice was CLOSED, so The Grange was the last choice. But, The Grange should have been first the "chips" were the real deal, fresh cut and made me think of time I spent in London. They were great! The sandwich was super yummy, and rich ( ham, Gueryer cheese, Bechamel on Challah) I was surprised at how good it was! My drink should have been beer, but never to have my meal dictated to me, I went for a refreshing drink. Cucumber, Pear Martini was most enjoyable! I would go back, and be prepared to take some food home!
