Restaurant: Ecco
Category: Modern European
Ecco was possibly one of the best and funnest dining experiences I have had in a long time. The bartender was plying us with drinks the minute we arrived. I had 14 clients reserved for the night and we all had a ball (the 12 bottles of wine didn't hurt either).. . We started with the most insanely delicious goat cheese ball coated in a honey glaze and deep fried. Out of this world. The pork and beef meatballs with saffron sauce were excellent as were the manchego cheese stuffed red peppers (They warned me they were spicy- not at all, but we're from Texas). Our waitress Liz was a spunky, well informed 21 year old spitfire who worked that table like a true professional. Her service and training were impeccable.. . I had perfectly grilled Atlantic char served on creamed parsnips ( at least i think that's what it was, either way it was fab) with an arugula and micro greens side that was tossed in a pickled vinaigrette which was heavenly. Several of my clients had the organic New york strip served with sweet potato hash and a reduction sauce. One of my clients who had been a cattle rancher for 25 years said that was hands down the finest steak he had ever eaten in his life. THAT is a compliment my friends as this guy knows his steak! Everyone at our table left raving about their food. If in Atlanta, give Ecco a try- you won't be disappointed.. . UPDATE!!!! I received a handwritten thank you note from our server Lizz. Now THAT my friends is good service. How do we get her down to Austin???
