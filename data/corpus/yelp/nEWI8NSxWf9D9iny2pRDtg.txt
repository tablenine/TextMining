Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Because I work just across the street, there are plenty of days where milk&amp;honey is my breakfast &amp; lunch. . . They brew Intelligensia coffee, which gets me through too-early weekend morning shifts. And the girls that work inside are wonderful. . . Try the yogurt parfait with their signature cafe granola or the portabello and goat cheese sandwich (a fall/winter regular).
