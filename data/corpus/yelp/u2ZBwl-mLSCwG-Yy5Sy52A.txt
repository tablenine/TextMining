I've been eating at Butterfly for several years.  The appraisers and non-sushi food was always excellent, but the sushi rather uninspired.  Over the past year things have changed and the sushi is now excellent !  the only downside is that it has become difficult to get into on the weekends without a reservation.  Ask nice and you can usually get the wobbly table in the corner in a pinch.
