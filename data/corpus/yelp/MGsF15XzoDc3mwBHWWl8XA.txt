One of the best dinners and steak I've had - The Raymond comes in 2nd place to this.. . We sat upstairs to catch the piano bar and had a great time and I loved the atmosphere . Being a Saturday night - there weren't any annoying kids around to ruin the mood.. . It was a little pricey - around $250 for the two of us, but definitely worth it and we had plenty of left over food for lunch and dinner the next day.
