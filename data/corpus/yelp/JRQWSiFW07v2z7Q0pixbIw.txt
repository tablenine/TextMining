Restaurant: Mi Barrio Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
I have lost all faith in my Grant Park residents.. . This food is aweful!! I tried it once, it was really, really, really bad. Went back after everyone still kept saying it was so good. Nope!. . The owners are nice, but that doesn't make the food any better. And authentic, only in a bad way. Â Come on, I challenge this next to any other Mexican restaurant food, and you prove to me it isn't frighteningly bad.
