Category: Japanese
Really great homestyle Japanese restaurants. I also prefer the smaller price, smaller dish idea as if you end up being hungrier you can order something else and it doesn't have to necessarily be the same dish (if you don't like it you can always get something else instead of being stuck with a big plate o' crap like at other restaurants).. . I thought it was really good, though very "homey." The presentation is like your mom decided to make the food a little pretty, but it's still not super pretty expensive restaurant quality presentation. I thought the food was pretty damn good though. Chicken was very crispy with no batter (I tried Carrie's dish). I also had soft-shelled crab (which is practically the same everywhere so that's not a great indicator... but I do love that pickled ginger/wasabi mix they put on my plate... I usually hate pickled ginger) and scallops with enoki. The latter was a little strong, as according to my friend, they cooked it with sake (I was wondering what that wierd yet familiar taste was... I personally don't like it when too much alcohol is added, it overpowers it.)... it was still pretty good though. I looked at other people's dishes and they looked really yummy too.. . So, if you're looking for some homestyle, no-frills traditional Japanese food, Furaibo is the place to go.
