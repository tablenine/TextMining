If you're looking for Shabu Shabu, you gotta check this joint out.  It's always busy and it's lacking in the creature comforts but hey know Shabu Shabu.  I prefer Mizu 212, just 'cus it's a little more polished on the presentation side, but Shabu Shabu House is the place to go if you want street cred.
