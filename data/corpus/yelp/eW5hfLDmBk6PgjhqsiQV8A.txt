I really wanted to give 4 stars, but had to knock one off because of the service. . . The seafood paella is good, but for something much for flavorful go for a pork dish (like suckling pig or smoked pork tenderloin). I also really enjoy the caribbean pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas. Nice atmosphere and very lively. . . As mentioned, I love the caribbean pumpkin croquetas so ordered some to share. Instead I was served the boniato &amp; sweet plantain ones. When I told the waitress about the mix up, she got snippy with me and said I asked for the plaintain ones. On top of that I ordered an El Corazon (their signature drink) and it took almost a half hour to arrive. That might be okay when you're at the bar, but not when you're seated for dinner.
