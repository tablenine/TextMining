I love, love, love this place! You can't go wrong with affordable (aka. cheap!) mexican fare! The pork belly tacos are to die for...pls order at least 3 for yourself. And be warned...the margaritas are potent (in a good way). Be prepared to wait in line though (hence the lack of that one additional star)...and forgo seating for standing. Super fun atmosphere for all you 'Walk the Line' fans...Johnny Cash songs galore. It gets loud, but lends to a fun, fun time. Great way to start off a night on the town!
