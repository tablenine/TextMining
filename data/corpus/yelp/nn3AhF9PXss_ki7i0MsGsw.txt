Restaurant: Nacional 27
Category: Latin American
Last night a friend of mine &amp; I were at a snooty art gallery party in the West Loop.  We decided that we wanted to leave the hipsters behind &amp; go out dancing.  She suggested Nacional 27 (I'd never been) so we hopped in a cab and headed in that direction.. . Kind of a neat place.  Feels sort of loungey up front and like a modern version of a 1930s-style Cuban supper club in the back - raised dinner tables offseting a sunken dance floor.  Very fun crowd with smoove dance moves.  We met a ton of people and salsa'd &amp; merenge'd the night away to everything from Tito Puente to Pitbull.  And, we even have plans to go out dancing again next weekend with a few of the people who asked us to dance.  Definitely a fun spot and worth the $10 cover.
