I only came here for the dessert. I didn't get the chance to try their food.. . The outside patio is adorable and the inside is quaint. It's not an extremely large cafe, but it's definitely cute.. . I tried their red velvet cupcake and their ooey gooey double chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was definitely ooey gooey. And oh so good. I inhaled it! I then moved on to the red velvet cupcake. I tried the mini one first. And the frosting on it was really good. Definitely had that cream cheese taste to it. Moreso than a sweetness. Too bad they don't cover the entire cupcake in the frosting. Instead, it sits on top of the cupcake. The thing in the middle of the frosting on the normal size cupcakes, what is that?? It wasn't good! Is it even edible? And to reiterate how good the chocolate chip cookie was, I was looking for more in my box thinking I still had some left. Then shortly realized I ate the whole thing so quick because it was so good!. . I definitely want to come back and try their other desserts. Maybe I'll rereview this place when I get the chance to try the other stuff on their menu!
