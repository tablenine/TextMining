Restaurant: Bar Celona
Category: Wine Bars
This place is split up into 3 different rooms but serves 2 different purposes.  One is a restaurant and the other is a bar/lounge.  I'm not a fan of the bar/lounge as it's small and crowded.  There's a DJ spinning but no dance floor, confusing, I know.. . However, the restaurant is actually pretty good.  The food is really good but I don't think it's worth the price.  I've had tapas just as good as the stuff from this place but for better prices.  If you're in Pasadena however,  I think this is your best bet if you're craving some spanish tapas... yum.
