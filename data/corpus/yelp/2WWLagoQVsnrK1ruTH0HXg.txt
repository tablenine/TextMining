I came here a couple of times because I'm such a garlic fan. However, this place is overrated- imho. The food was over-rated and just average. We had the lasagna and pasta dish but there wasn't anything OOOH LA LA about it. . . I tried the garlic ice cream. I love garlic, but i believe garlic should be put in certain foods and kept out of some. Ice cream was definitely NOT a place for garlic. . . Be sure to have a pack of chewing gum with you. Your breath will be a reminder of the meal you had here for many days
