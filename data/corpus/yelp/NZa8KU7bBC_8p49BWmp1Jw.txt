Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
There are a few things I love about Boiling Crab and a few things I hate.. . Things I love:. - shrimp with the whole shabang seasoning, medium spicy. - crawfish (in season only) with the whole shebang, mild. - sweet potato fries. . Things I hate:. - the line is absolutely ridiculous, especially for the Alhambra location...if you drive by here on a weekend around dinner time there's usually at least 50 people in the parking lot waiting for a table...definitely order to go if you live nearby, it only takes about 5 minutes for them to get your food ready, as opposed to 2 hours you'll spend waiting for a table. - 5 parking spots in the parking lot when there are a hundred people eating/waiting for a table is a really bad combination...there is street parking but you sometimes have to drive for a bit to find it. - 25 cents for water?? seriously?? i've never been charged for TAP water at a restaurant, EVER. - they use pretty low quality seafood, the shrimp isn't cleaned and is sometimes overcooked and mushy...be sure not to order the crawfish unless it is in season (march, april) because they use frozen crawfish at all other times and you can definitely taste the difference...do not order the king crab legs, they are frozen and don't taste good at all, def a waste of money Â . . Overall, a worthwhile experience because there really isn't another decent crawfish/shrimp boil place in the la area
