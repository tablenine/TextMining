Why this place is so popular baffles me. I live right next door to it and I have only been twice. Both times, it took 2 hours just to get our food when we did not even order appetizers. In addition, the food is nothing special. The presentation of the food is nice but when you eat it, there is no wow factor.. . The only thing I like about this place is the decor. Save your money and just go to Chinatown for a better and cheaper meal.
