We went with six people and had the omakase menu ($245 for 18 courses - that's just over $40 per person). Really good, nice service, outrageously reasonable prices. Food like this in Manhattan would cost at last three or four times as much.. . Tempura and homemade tofu were particularly good. Sashimi was decent (not the best), but for the price and for the atmosphere, you couldn't ask for more (you almost want to offer them more money for what you're getting).. . Only bad thing of the night: a dessert sake that was suggested as a $10 supplement to the dessert courses. It tasted like chinese cooking wine. Order some japanese whiskey instead.
