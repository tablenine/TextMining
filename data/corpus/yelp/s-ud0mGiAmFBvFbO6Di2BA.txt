Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Four stars for the dumplings and 1 extra star for their sesame bun for dessert.  I have not enjoyed such a bun for a really long time.  . . I've been to the Taiwan location and yes, it's better there, but this location is not bad either.  The XLB was really good.  The crab XLB was just ok.  Their noodles are good.  Tender and chewy, I just love it!. . Secretly, I think I only wanted to go down to LA just for this restaurant.. can't wait to be back!
