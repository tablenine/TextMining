Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
Did not like ribs... until Fat Matt's entered my life. If they have the power to convert me, then they deserve five stars. Ever since my happy discovery, I now gladly order and gnaw the bone to get at more deliciously tender meaty goodness. Except all the other ribs out there keep not exactly recreating my first Fat Matt's experience. That's their only downfall.
