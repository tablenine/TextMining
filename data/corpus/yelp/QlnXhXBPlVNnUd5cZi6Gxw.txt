I love me some Kogi tacos, but their burritos are where it's at. The Korean-Mexican fusion is intriguing and works really well. The downside is that you have to follow their blog to know where they are going to be, and there is always a MASSIVE line, so you need to be there early if you want to get your hands on some galbi-licious treats. I recommend the pork burrito. It's much more filling and tasty than anything else there.
