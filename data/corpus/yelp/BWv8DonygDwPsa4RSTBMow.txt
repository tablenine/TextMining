Holly hell.  Pancakes the size of a hubcap.  Not kidding.  If I lived in CA I would try every type of pancake offered here, but alas I usually only come to CA once a year.  So far I've had the original, and the blueberry.  Both are yummy goodness.  The mimosas are great too!  Can't wait for my next trip.  I will definitely be back!
