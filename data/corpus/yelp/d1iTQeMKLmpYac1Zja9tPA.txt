Want a quick fill of amazingly scrumptious and healthy food? Then make your way onto Division Street and drop by Mana! Don't miss it, as it is a hidden diamond in the rough. Just west of Alliance Bakery, you'll find this little food haven ... the menu is rather broad, which is pleasing to all taste buds. With food creations prepared with love and real interest in their consumer's pleasure, you'll find that every item has it's own pizzaz of appeal. . . If I may, and I will, suggest my favorite choices - 1) Pot Stickers AKA Gyoza 2) Baked Bree 3) Pear Salad 4) Sliders !!!!!!!!!!! These four items tend to be on my regular order. Don't forget to ask your always friendly and knowledgeable Â server what the specials of the day are, as they tend to be out of this world. ( Fiddle Head Fern Special = BREATH TAKING!!!!!! ) . . So if your afraid by the title , vegan , stop being so wound up, and give Mana a try. I guarantee that you will return !!! . . *** Thank you to the chef and all those that part take in this establishment, your hard work and dedication to creating outstanding food is greatly appreciated !!! ***
