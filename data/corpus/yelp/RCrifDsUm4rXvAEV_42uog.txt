Restaurant: Over Easy Café
Category: American (Traditional)
My wife and I have been trying out some new breakfast / brunch places recently.  After a disappointing meal at Uncommon Ground we decided to give Over Easy Cafe a try after reading and hearing many great things.. . After reading the reviews on Yelp is sounded like the Sassy Eggs was the preferred dish.  But, I was in the mood for something sweet so I chose the Banana Spiked French Toast which were very good.  But, I spent most the brunch sneaking bites of my wife's Sassy Eggs when she was not looking.  The Sassy Eggs are served over chorizo-potato hash with cheddar cheese, red peppers, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, &amp; ancho ketchup and are delightful.. . I look forward to visiting Over Easy Cafe again and will surely be giving the Sassy Eggs my full attention next time.
