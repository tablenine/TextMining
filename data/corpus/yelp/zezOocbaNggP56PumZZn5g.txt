The decor and the service was top notch. You should expect it from a place nestled in the heart of Beverly Hills. . . The food? ehhh - I honestly think I've had better steak back when Sizzler was the place to be circa 1989. It wasn't bad, but for an $80 piece of steak, I'd rather be at Maestro's down the street.. . Won't go back unless forced to.
