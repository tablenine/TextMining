Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I've heard all about the recent burger crave in Los Angeles since recently moving here from San Francisco and Umami Burger was one of the consistent restaurants coming up in conversations. I finally tried this joint out about 3 weeks ago (S. La Brea Location). I have to admit that I am the king at eying down other peoples food as it is brought through the restaurant and presented to the guests. So while we were waiting for a table to open up, I was checking out the burgers that were coming out of the kitchen. To be honest, at first sight, these things didn't look all that impressive! When I hear of great burger joints, I think of gigantic, condiments flowing out of the bun style burgers. To me, these looked just OK. . . We were seated after about a wait of 20min...not bad...and presented with a small front/back simple menu. I ordered a "Mexican Coke", coke in a glass bottle, tempura battered onion rings, sweet potato fries, and the Umami Burger (as is). Talk about a mouth watering meal....it was insanely delicious!!!! The portions were a bit small but to be honest, it was all I needed and filled me up. Of course I would recommend getting several sides to dip those fries in as they have a few different sides and they come in small quantities! The burger was so delicious and left me wanting more. . . Being that the portions were not overwhelmingly large, I had a little room for desert and I'm glad I did. They serve Ice Cream Sandwiches which are made by "MILK" on Beverly Blvd. Talk about a great way to end the meal! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that wants a simple, delicious, mouth watering meal at a reasonable price! I can't wait to go back.
