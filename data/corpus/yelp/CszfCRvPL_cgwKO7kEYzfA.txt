Aha, the oinkster.. With your sign covered up mysteriously so that the passer by only sees "slow fast food". With your delicious pastrami and Belgian fries......Oinkster, you are awesome. I bow down to the pulled pork sandwich, and although your meaty concoctions are a bit pricey, I appreciate the fact that I can enjoy all your pastrami goodness with a cold can of Boddington's. Oinkster, I love you.
