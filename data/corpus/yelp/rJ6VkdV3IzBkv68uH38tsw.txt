I ate here this past weekend. I purchased a pork sandwich with blue cheese and it was double dipped in dipping sauce and i put mustard on it that was spicy and then i ate it and it was good to eat. They were filming Man vs Food but i doubt they film it there everyday but if they do then thats bad because the host is a huge douche. I also had chili with beans.
