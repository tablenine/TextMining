This is probably one of our favorite places for dinner.  Everytime we eat there we do not go home disappointed.  We try to go out and find different places to eat for special occasions, but when we rotate back to Maison Akira's our stomach's and tastebuds come home happy.  . . One of my favorite dishes is the chilean seabass, which is one of their signature dishes.  But really everything that we have ordered there has always been delicious from the appetizers to the main course and through dessert.  This is one of the places we can easily recommend.
