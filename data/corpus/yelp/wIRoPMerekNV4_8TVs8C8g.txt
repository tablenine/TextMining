Pricey for what it is but really solid food.. . I have a hard time eating alot of the food in the south loop except for maybe 5 places and this is up there with the best.. . The Selections great. Waitstaff is friendly. GREEEAAT Matzo ball soup of course.. And the portions are great. . If your not on a super budget save yourself some time and just go here. You won't regret it.
