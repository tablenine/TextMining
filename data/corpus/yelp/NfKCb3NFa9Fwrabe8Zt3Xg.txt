Ok.  I didn't go here myself but my sister did.  I told her I wanted to be a pig and so I placed two orders for a pastrami sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich.  . . Honestly, the pastrami sandwich was definitely awesome.  Something about the red cabbage and the juice/broth that they drench the stuff in really makes it that good.  It was thick and had plenty of yummy pastrami goodness.  Each bite had me salivating and hurrying to finish that bite, so that I can bite into the sandwich and eat again.  Mmm.. . The pulled pork was good, but nothing like the pastrami sandwich though.  It was a little thick and a lil dry so I found myself having difficulty chewing and chomping through all that meat.  Again, the red cabbage was awesome and the onions that came with it also made it more enjoyable than ever.  I think a lil less meat (yes I'm complaining about too much meat :p) would be better.. . I definitely say come here and check it out.  Just make sure you are not on a diet of some sort. :p
