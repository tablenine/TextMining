Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
Been to Katsuya and other places similar to Geisha House.  My wife and I are in agreement that Geisha house is nothing special in terms of the food.  I've had better rolls at sushi joints on Ventura Blvd for less dough.  I did have the kobe beef and it was good, but I guess its hard to mess that up.  Wish they had more than just udon noodles and rice as sides.. . Service was  fine, staff was attentive, and the food came out rather quickly.  The setting is dark, and they were playing 80's music, which didn't bother me.  Didn't go to the bar so I can't comment on that. . . Overall I must say that I would not go back...it wasn't awful but we expected more from a place like this.
