Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I took my K-town virgin brother to have some KBBQ and we were duly impressed. First, even though this is the first time i've had all men wait staff (except the hostess), they were exceptionally polite, helpful, and attentive. They both cooked our kalbi to perfection as well as instructed us on the finer points of using the rice/daikon wraps and which meat went best with which sauce.. . The food was also awesome. We had the unseasoned marbled rib eye, which was melt in your mouth good. We also had the marinated kalbi, which was also awesome in its own way. The pan chan (appetizers) were also great. We liked the honey potatoes, the mini pancakes, the curried meats, and the fish cakes.. . All in all, another great kbbq place. I like this and Park's BBQ food about the same, but I'd give Soowon the service edge.
