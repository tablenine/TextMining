Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
My husband and I go on dates here. I know, I know, it is a garlic restaurant, but it is such a great place. I love the decor of the restaurant, although I was a bit disappointed in their bathrooms. Not as nice as the restaurant. . The food is really great, and loaded with garlic. I have gotten pasta dishes every time I go there, mainly because it is a bit pricey. My husband had about 200 garlic cloves, no joke. . You can bring your own bottle of wine for a corking fee of $10, which works out to be a pretty good deal if it is just two of you. . The best seats are the two-seater tables that have their own personal tent. So romantic. . Definitely make reservations, because it is packed during dinner time. . I would say go to this restaurant on a date when you are comfortable with someone and a little garlic breath doesn't bother you. . A strange thing is that their after dinner candies are not mint. What the heck Stinking Rose? I would think that would have been a given, not some small fruity candy.
