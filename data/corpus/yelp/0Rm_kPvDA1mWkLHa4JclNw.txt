Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Daikokuya is THE ramen house of Jtown. . . Timing is everything, come hungry but not too hungry lest starvation tempts you to veer off your intended destination. You'll have at least 15-45 minutes to work up that appetite. . They have 2 kinds of ramen. Daikokuya ramen, and a deconstructed Daikokuya ramen. That's it. No spice level novelty gimmicks, no variants. They just do their 1 thing, and its right. . . Slow cooked korabuta pork graces the soup - which is cooked for a day using pork bones. It's perfect, it's not too salty, it's rich without being overpowering. Don't come here if you don't like pork. . . Pair your ramen with 1/2 order of fried rice and prepare for a magical journey for your soul and taste buds as they lace their fried rice with opium. Ok maybe not but the fried rice really is quite good. Really, most everything here tastes great. I've tried just about every bowl in the house - avoid the shredded pork bowl, it's kind of boring. I'm not wild about their gyoza either. . . Oh and they have cheap beer. $10 for a pitcher of Kirin!. . I *heart* you Daikokuya.
