Restaurant: El Tesoro
Category: Mexican
I really love going to El Tesoro-- I dream about it, even. With fresh, authentic food, and really great service, what's not to love? . . My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the Mexican Pizza, but you have to have a bit of a love for spicy if you order it! It's not just the peppers, the radishes have a fantastically zesty bite to them that I just adore. The Duck Carnitas are a nice surprise, as well, very succulent and not too crispy (which duck can be if you're not careful). I also highly recommend trying the daily ceviche-- I had the shrimp ceviche and even though the inside of my mouth was pickled (obviously, ceviche should be shared, it's extremely acidic and I ate the entire thing) I wanted more! . . Even if you're not looking for a big meal, you can head in and have a seat at the beautiful handmade bar and get Bo or one of the other bartenders to serve you up a yummy house margarita.. . Can we tell I like this place? Now I'm craving ceviche...
