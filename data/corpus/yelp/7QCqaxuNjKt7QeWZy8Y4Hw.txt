I been to Daikokuya three times within the last 2 weeks.  First time there - sat at a table, LOVED their gyoza, and their ramen wasn't bad either.  I especially liked the soup, it's flavorful but not salty, but I prefer Shin Sen Gumi's pork.  Second time - sat at a table, ordered the same thing, no complaints.  Don't you just love the tons of green onions they give you?  Third time - sat at the bar, ordered the same thing, watched the chef prepare it, and almost threw up.  The guy was sweating profusely so he would wipe the sweat off his forehead w/ his hands, and with those same bare hands grab the green onions to finish off our ramen, gyoza, and whatever else that required a sprinkle of it.  While he was cooking fried rice, I could see his sweat drizzle down his face and perhaps into the wok?  Yum!  Whoever ordered that must've thought the rice was incredibly flavorful.  So all you white folks, think twice before you go back, and my fellow asians...I know you don't care.
