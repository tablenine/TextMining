Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
There's not much else to say about Father's Office that hasn't already been said.... it's hard being the 914th reviewer and coming up with something new.... . Although.. it was my first time here I really liked my Peach Framboise, and my dining companion enjoyed his Victory Golden Monkey (my recommendation based on the strength of the beer (9.5%ABV) and funky name). Turned out to be a REALLY good beer! :). Btw, they have water on their menu listed as "uber clean water". It comes out of a fire hydrant tap.. and it really IS uber clean! and freee! :). Also.... they have wine on tap! WINE.. . The Office Burger is quite tasty.. but its served on sandwich bread? why?? Side note: here, medium = medium rare. our burger came out a little bloody :(. Sweet potato fries live up to the hype. The dipping sauce makes a world of difference. F.O. has this blue cheese-garlic dip.. it's orgasmic I tell ya! I am a big fry whore.. and an even bigger sweet potato fry whore.. and I can say, they're daaaaamn good here!. . They have a co-ed sink area. This is interesting because while washing your hands, guys and girls can do it together.. or even couples that are in the middle of a break up. Not like it was my choice to eavesdrop! I was simply washing my hands!! haha the most interesting/awkward washing hands experience I've had.. definitely.. . Why not 5 stars? The fact that seating is a pain in the ass when it's busy and having to "line up" in front of a cash register to order isn't really my cup of tea. That, and prices are pretttyyy steep. Two beers, one Office Burger and one order of Sweet potato fries = $42 including tip for two. :\
