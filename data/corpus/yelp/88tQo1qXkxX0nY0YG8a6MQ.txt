Never been here as a brunch place, just as a regular bar.  It gets painted with the hipster brush a lot, but I didn't find it more so than anywhere else in the area that I could still stand to go to, and far less so than something like Rainbo.  The DJ was spinning great tunes of a wide variety, there's a nice little variety of beers on tap, the pours on the mixed drinks are decent enough, and I found the crowd to be friendly, chatty, and unpretentious..  Plus they project some weird stuff on the walls, clips of different movies I gather.  Only downside is that it's roaringly loud in there.  I'll be back for sure.
