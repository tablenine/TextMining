I had heard many bad reports regarding the food at this place. I also heard that it was a great place to drink (way cool atmosphere) in a new, chic up and coming neighborhood. True. I was also expected to be disappointed in the food but, in a way, I was pleasantly surprised. Â Don't get me wrong; the fried tilapia burrito with rice and beans was not great; however, it was not altogether horrible either. Not bad but not great. Just sorely lacking in something intangible.. . The thing is, the food here is slightly better than the typical corporate sanitized Mexican (Rio Bravo, On the Border, El Chico);however, given the cool neighborhood it is in, it should be a whole lot better than it is. I'm not saying that they should strive to be like Nuevo Laredo (perhaps the city's best) or Mi Barrio; however, I think they could easily pull off something along the lines of Uncle Julio's Casa Grande (given the similar interior layout / digs and above-average sanitized, corporate-concocted Mexican cuisine) or at the very least something along the lines of El Potro (for my money, Buford Highways best cheap authentic semi-authentic Mexican eatery). . . Bottom line: Great atmosphere: however, the food - not altogether lousy - is sorely in need of improvement.
