Mmmm Mmmm Panes, where have you been all my life?! Clearly not missing out on all the other Yelpin' bellies, that's for certain. Lemme just be thankful to say you have finally at last made your way into mine! . . Panes truly rocks it out on the lovely lunch tip... a quaint little 'order at the counter' type spot, the low key digs more than make up in terrific taste for what they lack in foofie style. Besides, I'm sure we can all admit going to lunch all comfy 'n stuff in your workout gear doesn't suck one bit (ain't that right, Robio??). . . The menu is comprised mainly of yummy fresh salads and sandwiches, but you can certainly glutton-out too if your baked macaroni and goat cheese pizza lovin' heart is desiring a more hearty fare!! My svelte group, however, opted for the former and went balls-to-the-weight-watchin-wall with a myriad of soups, sammies and my favorite, the feta chicken salad featuring a healthy barrage of romaine lettuce, artichokes heart, red peppers, grilled chicken, kalamata black olives, feta cheese and tangy greek dressing. Panes Perfection! . . Adored the slightly sweet - and utterly delicious - soft, freshly baked bread that came out with everyone's meals. Heck, it was enough to get this carb shy girl singing a bonafied challah chorus. Amen, it's not to be missed! . . Pick up a lovely (and generous) cookie sample on your way out for a positively sweet finish to a superb lunch. Thanks, Panes, you're tops in my lunch book!
