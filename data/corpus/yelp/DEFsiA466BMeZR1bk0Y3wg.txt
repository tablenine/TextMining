ugggh, i so wanted this to be good, but it just wasn't. i make better grilled cheese at home. here's a rundown from best to worst:. . 1. tator tots - these were actually pretty good. nice crunch and potato flavor without that oiliness you get from your elementary cafeteria tots. . 2. tomato soup - tasted like marinara sauce. it was weird. skratch has the best tomato soup. . 3. Cheesy Mac grilled cheese with pork - meh. it was really bland. i had to put ketchup on it to add salt. . 4. gruyere grilled cheese - meh, again really bland. . i love the concept but poorly executed
