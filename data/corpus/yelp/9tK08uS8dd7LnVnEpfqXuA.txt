Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Warning: Colorful language follows.... . Mutha'fukin'hellyeah! Roscoe's goes off! . Down home chicken and tasty waffles are the Sunday hangover cure you always wished your WASP parents prescribed. . This is by far the greatest marriage of total opposites since Ric Ocasek and that really pretty chick! . . Go. Stop reading and just go. You'll thank me later.. g'on now!
