Happened upon this place while walking around Melrose on a Sunday afternoon. First thought was: they must be understaffed. Wait for a table was nothing; the host was super attentive from the moment we stopped walking on the street to check out the menu. But we had to flag someone down to order, and water didn't even come until after we ordered. There wasn't even that many customers! On the plus side, service was courteous.. . They have a wide variety of foods: regular entree foods like steak and spaghetti, to sandwiches/wraps + soups, salads, and even breakfast foods all day long. I got a wrap &amp; soup combo. The wrap was exactly that, no garnishes. It tasted pretty good, or maybe I was too hungry at 4pm having skipped breakfast and lunch. The wild mushroom and herb soup looked like nothing but tasted like heaven. I could have had 5 bowls of that and called it good. My friend got the omelette which came with a side (she got mixed fruit) and 2 slices of toast. It looked really hearty and pretty good. Lastly we got triple chocolate cake which was set up really nicely and tasted sinfully rich. I couldn't stop eating that.. . I would go back to this place if I happened to be in the area. I'd like to try their omelette and/or a salad (and probably a french toast based on the reviews here). Or to check out the "bistro at night" scene. But I wouldn't go out of my way since I don't live exactly near it. I like the atmosphere of the place, but to be honest, it's pretty cliche and not much to tell a friend about. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars.
