This place is darn tasty!  Went here with a buddy after church.  Parking is scarce around that neighborhood, so we parked a few blocks away (look carefully at the signs - sometimes you have to pay on the weekend too) and walked.  The wait for a table was short and we got to sit outside as requested.. . Service was excellent - very attentive and fast.  We decided to get a salad and their famous mac n' cheese.  The one on the "specials" menu was mac n' cheese with lobster, wild mushrooms, and truffles.  Sure sounds delicious, but me and my buddy were trying to save a buck or two.  So, we asked if the regular mac n' cheese was available.  It was and we added bacon!. . Let's start off with the salad review.  It had golden nectarines, pickled red and white beets, cherries, green beans, yellow tomatoes, Verde Capra Italian blue goat's milk cheese, and candied pecan vinaigrette.  Wow, it was very nicely plated on a long rectangular dish!  The colors were scrumptious and the taste was something different and delicious.  The cheese was mildly flavored.  The fruits were ripe and packed with flavor.  It was steep at $14, considering the amount you get, but I thought it was a worthwhile treat.. . The mac n' cheese came out in a bowl with a handle.  It had a crunchy topping / crust that really gave it an added burst of flavor and great texture.  I thought the mac n' cheese was a tad salty, but likely due to the bacon.  Can't really ding them for that.  This dish was very decadent.  Not sure how anyone could finish the whole thing on their own, since it is just so dense!. . We were full after that, so we decided not to get dessert.  Overall, I would go here again, perhaps after saving up some more money.
