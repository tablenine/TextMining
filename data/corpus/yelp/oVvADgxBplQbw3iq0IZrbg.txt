Restaurant: Stanley&#39;s Kitchen and Tap
Category: Southern
Stanley's is my favorite local bar/restaurant!! I probably go to Stanley's at least 2-3 times per week. On Monday's they have $5 build your own burger night, Wednesdays they have $15 all you can eat pizza buffet, pasta and salad PLUS all you can drink bud light, Budweiser, and/or white or red wine. Thursdays always host a chef special which is amazing and all drafts $3. Friday and Saturday have a fun bar/night life, but it gets busy! And Sunday has live karaoke which is very popular. . . If you are looking for a fun place to grab dinner, Stanley's is my favorite local bar/restaurant in Lincoln Park! They also have a family restaurant past the bar and lots of families and young children eat here often. So weather you are younger looking for good food and booze or a family looking for southern hospitality, Stanley's is your place!!. . (Best buffalo chicken sandwich ever!!)
