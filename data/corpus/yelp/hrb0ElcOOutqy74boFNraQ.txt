mmm mmm good!  I've never had crawfish this good outside of New Orleans.  The crawfish were a good size and oh so spicy!  The touch of Siracha is the first thing I noticed when I bit into the juicy crawfish meat~  Siracha paired with creole seasoning is a match made in heaven =D  Take into consideration the cheap price and I don't know why you wouldn't want to go back? ;). . I also tried the shrimp, boiled in the same crawfish seasoning (so obviously it was great!). oh! and how could I forget~ the hush puppies!  Tiny but soooo goood.  A great crisp outside and soft onion-y inside~ if only they'd give you more with your combo meal :(
