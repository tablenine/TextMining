Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Apple Pan is delicious.  The apple relish/topping/magic stuff is incredible.  Combine that with the meat, cheese, and pickles to get  something unique and wonderful.. . And I don't even like pickles.. . I'm still searching for that perfect burger out here, though.  I'm from the school of thought that a nicely cooked patty made from quality meat is the show, and that all the toppings are just window dressing.  Out west, I guess the thinking is that it's a package deal, and of all of them, Apple Pan has the best example.. . The fries here range from good to great.  I think it depends on how busy they are.. . Seating is tricky.  It's just a U-shaped counter surrounding the kitchen, where one guy basically runs the whole show ordering and serving wise.  When you walk in, look around for people close to finishing then go stand near them.  . . Unless there's already a line; then custom dictates you wait in the line.  Otherwise, find a spot and settle in.. . A few more tips. People will be staring at you.  But that's okay.  You stared at the people sitting in your seats before you.  It's a natural thing; the circle of life...err, burgers.  Make your peace with it, and take your time.  Everyone else is.. . And be patient with the guy running the counter.  He's got to deal with a lot of people all at once, while doing many different things, and he doesn't have time to be polite.  He's gruff, but a cool gruff, like a tough-as-nails grandfather. . . Or Edward James Olmos.
