I am bumping this up to 4 stars. They catered lunch for us at work on Friday and I was in Chicken Tikka Masala heaven! I ate and ate and ate and ate some more. When I finally came up for air, I saw that the  business card from Cafe Bombay had been placed next to my plate. Uh yeah. Needless to say, I had to make sure that I updated my review accordingly...
