Went here for DineLA restaurant week as I'd been meaning to try out this place. Note the specialty here is fish, so if you don't enjoy fish, don't bother trying out the restaurant - there aren't really other options.. . - White chowder - delicious, especially with clams in the shell in it. - Tuna sashimi - not bad. The sauces it was served with were very good.. - Halibut - loved the lemon sauce and hot fruit that comes with it. Only wish there was more sauce.. - Rock fish - good. I love the way they crisped the skin.. - Cheesecake - probably one of the best cheesecakes I've had and the portion size was perfect. Too often dessert is far too big and filling after a large meal, but this hit the spot. It came with some amazing ice cream and delicious sauces.. - Carrot cake - pretty good. My husband really enjoyed it.. . Overall I enjoyed it, but considering the price of the regular menu, I'm not sure how often I would go back.
