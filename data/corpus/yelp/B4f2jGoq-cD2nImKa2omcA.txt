i went again and had the Gyro to make sure its consistent. It was the tziki sauce is great and the meat is the best flavored one i have had in LA yet.  The only thing i failed to mention in the last review is that they serve it with lettuce and tomato. I'm used to only getting onions and tomatoes so i just asked them no lettuce and add onion.  Also the puff pastries that are filled with cheese are really good, and the beef ones are okay.
