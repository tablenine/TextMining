Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
Had the pleasure of visiting during the friends and family week.  (four out of five stars because the menu was very limited due to it being an opening event)  Overall, great experience... and we already have a meal planned for Tuesday, their first day open to the general public.. . Food:  Wonderful.  Just what the Highlands needed.  Flavors are inventive, clean and fresh... its a rare occurrence to find great tex mex food that tastes fresh-made from start to finish.  We sampled the shrimp ceviche with habanero pepper (perfect, tender, light and fresh... only complaint was it is served with crackers - would have likes chips or tortilla strips instead), bacon taquittos with spicy bean dip (absolutely, hands down, one of the tastiest things Ive had in a while... I mean, crispy fried, bacon, cheese, bean dip and green chilies... does it get any better?). . .  Drink: We tried the frozen margarita and, our favorite, the frozen Mojitto.  Both were very tasty (and very strong... one of each and we were plastered). . Interior:  The redesign of the restaurant was handled very well... respect for open space was paid quite well and the restaurant has much more of a large communal feel.  Murals on the walls and light fixtures tie everything together just perfectly.. . Oh, another very cool aspect is the walk up window on the front patio, where you can place and pick up togo food orders, and chill on the patio with a margarita while you wait... very convenient.
