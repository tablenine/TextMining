Oh wow... I can't believe they serve dishes like this.  If you have a death wish, you may want to consider coming here.  Their dishes I'm sure offer up a caloric intake of 10,000.  Heck, just order the fried chicken and waffles.  Oh yeah, also get some gravy to go along with the fried chicken.  The fried chicken is damn good.  The waffles are just average, but somewhat crispy.  But man, when you add the gravy on top of the chicken, you have heaven.
