Love this place! Was recommended by a friend who can't pronounce it then just told me where it was! Sausage...A+ Fries.....A+ Cucumber Soda...Mmmm tasty! Am a bit confused though, as there website says "Purveyor of Exotic Sausage" yet they don't make their own.  They outsource them.  Anyone know who their "purveyor" is?  . I will also need to check a few of the brews on tap out next time.  Heading back on Saturday I believe.  . . Cheers to Wurstkuche!
