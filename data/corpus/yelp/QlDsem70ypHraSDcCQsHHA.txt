Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
This is the kind of place you love if you think a greasy fast food meal is delicious. It seriously is not better than Taco Bell. The tacos are hard tacos with a dried-out, flavorless mystery meat, and some unflavored shredded plain lettuce - that's it. I got a bean &amp; meat burrito with a whole lotta gooey mystery substance of a disturbing brown color oozing out. There were a few meat chunks in there that were very tender and nicely cooked, but overall the experience was of the "hate myself in the morning, and it wasn't even good" variety. I think they're probably just famous because they're famous. First and last visit ever.
