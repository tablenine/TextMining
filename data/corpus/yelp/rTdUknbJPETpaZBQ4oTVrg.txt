Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
This is one of those places that im glad I went to.  It is legendary and considered one of the premier taco places in LA.  I thought it was good.  The value was really good but overall it was just that good.  Not great. Definitly reminds me of Henry's Tacos in Studio City as they are both legendary but somewhat average on taste.  Could come back but wont rush.
