Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
We had a bad experience here with a server.  It is hard to imagine how she got hired.  She simply had none of the skills required to be a server at a nice restaurant.  She was almost certainly the same server another reviewer politely refered to as "awkward."  . . Chances are if you go here you'll have a fine time, and hopefully this server doesn't work there anymore.  But it was one of those experiences that kind of kills a restaurant for me-- especially a relatively expensive one like this where I don't expect or tolerate uncomfortable incidents.
