Okay so maybe I'm an idiot...or just highly inexperienced at knowing when to make reservations. My friend and I got here about 9 on a Friday night.  No line...we're thinking, "...awesome, no line!"  so, some self righteous asshole steps in front of us like we are invisible and tells the seater person he wants to sit outside.  My eyeballs still hurt from rolling them at him all night. (No sock, loafer wearing mother....) anyway, the seat assigner(?) tells us that the wait is 1 hour and 15 minutes....whaaa? but...but...there's no line.  He said he can take our cell numbers down or we can come back at 10:15, so by the time my friend and I debate on whether or not to wait it out or leave, an hour has passed by.  We went next door to buy a bottle of wine because they don't serve alcohol (no corkage fee!) and you can't drink outside.  So there were about 10 other parties outside waiting patiently with bottles under their arms.  Personally, I was debating on whether or not to crack that bitch open, stuff it in a paper bag and call it a night.  I would fit in with the other whinos around there.  Anyway, we sit order almost the whole menu because by this time we are ravenous.  Sweet potato fries with garlic mayo (yay!), skirt steak (yum!), baby octopus (eh?), something called lomo (uh huh!) and socca cakes with honey and goat cheese (pretty damn good!).  Everything was good besides the obscenly large man sitting behind me and bumping my chair every 30 seconds.  Go Cobras!!!
