Category: Sandwiches
There is a special little place in my heart and stomach for this place. I've had lunch here and taken out and I have had some of their bread as well. Their olive oil and garlic french bread needs nothing else, I will eat alone with nothing else. So mouth watering tasty. I got a loaf for a party, I should have ordered two because I nearly ate one of them all by myself. Sandwiches are a good size and their soups are good. Prices are fair and reasonable and the staff is friendly and approachable with questions and recommendations.
