Having gone and experienced tapas in Spain, I had high expectations for C&amp;M and wow - did they change my perspective on tapas forever! . . I left that evening with a full stomach that was not heavy or overly greasy. The food was delicious, good portions, and well cared for. The atmosphere was cozy (they really pack you in there!), busy, and loud ( not screaming over the food loud, but you really need to speak up kind of loud). . . We ordered: . + socca cakes w/ goat cheese and honey . + asparagus w/ manchego cheese . + spanish style bbq skirt steak ( the corn was a little difficult to eat...) . + risotto of the day (SOOO TENDER!) . + churros &amp; chocolate ( overly cinnamon-y and not as decadent as the ones in madrid). . . I'd definitely come back to try out more taps! The sandwich shop sells wine next door and the guy is actually really knowledgeable about the bottles he has for sale - make sure you get a receipt though to void the corkage fee!
