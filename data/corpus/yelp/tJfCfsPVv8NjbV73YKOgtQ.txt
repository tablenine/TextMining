Outstanding food, excellent prices, friendly staff, fresh ingredients...honestly, what else could you ask for?  Fresh baked bread, fresh cut meats and cheese...yummmm.  Some of the best pastas and omelets in town too.   $5 will pretty much get you anything on the menu, and that includes their salads, and the majority of their pastas.  Don't waste your time spending twice as much money at Clarks.
