cornish hen = amen.. hainan chicken = delish.. . ginger sauce = homaigod.. chrysanthemum = mmm mmm mmm.. . and i forget what the fish is called but that was good too. cheesy goodness.. . that's all i have to say. luckily i've never had to wait long. but i believe waits follow me. . . but i don't like their pizzas. the dough ain't too good :(
