I went down to LA to visit a friend and she took us to roscoes. the wait was horrible, plan to wait awhile. AND they skipped us but said they called our names, i think not we were standing right there the whole time.....once in i had to order the chicken and waffles...the waffles werent great but the chicken was! the chicken was perfectly fried to a nice thin crisp and the chicken didn't have all that nasty gunky fat under the fried skin that most friend chicken has. I would definitely come back for the chicken. my friends and i agreed that if we came back we would just order the chicken.
