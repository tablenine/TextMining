Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
I went here with a friend for lunch. She grew up in the neighborhood and this was the sushi place her family (from Japan) always came for Sunday dinner, so its authentic. We had to get there early because there's only a few seats and it fills up early. No credit cards so bring cash (and plenty of it because like most sushi places a few pieces then a few more add up quickly).  . . The sushi was good. Very traditional. No weird American fusion rolls here.  If you are looking for a hip sushi place with sakitinis go elsewhere. There's plenty of those in LA. If you are looking for an experience of the traditional Sawtelle Japanese neighborhood this is a real find.  . . They have valet parking for a nominal charge, which is a bonus along Sawtelle.
