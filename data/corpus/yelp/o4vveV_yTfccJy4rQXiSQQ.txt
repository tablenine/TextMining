I want to give this place one star so you don't go here, just so I don't have to wait in a longer line to eat the best ramen. Yes they use MSG and I get a headache from it,. but everything is so freakin' good. Do not miss the gyoza.. Yes its a dive, so don't go if you can't deal with that and some cheerful mouth breather baby huey guy making your ramen. . ...again stay away! Its for me only..not you!
