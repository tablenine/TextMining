urban belly is awesome! we went saturday afternoon around 2 and it wasnt too crowded at all. the wait staff was so great, and helped us navigate our first visit to make it a really fantastic experience. we ordered what the woman at the counter suggested and were so happy with the dishes. we ordered a noodle, a rice and a dumpling dish, and it was a perfect amount of food for two hungry people. we ended up sitting at a table by ourselves, and our food was brought out to us. the wait staff paid good attention to our water glasses, which was awesome.
