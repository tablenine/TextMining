Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Oh pinks how shall I rate thee. This is where half starts would come in handy. First off yes the spot is a total tourist spot so do not, I repeat do not wait in those long lines for the food. That's just ridicules and if you do so you'll be disappointed for sure. Most Los Angelinos know there are definite times you can get a hot dog and not have to wait in line. Obviously any prime tourist times are a bad time to go. .  So knowing when to go and not having to wait more then a few moments. I have enjoyed the times ive gone to pinks. I mean its fast food basically and though it's not the best I get fast food cravings as much as the next girl. The dogs are good though I have to say im much more of a classic hot dog lover then the assorted variety you much more adventurous dog eaters can get at pinks..  Though I think more of a 3 or 3 1/2, I give this place some what of a break because if the place wasn't so over hyped I think people would like it more as a little dive to go to on a late night. Sure there are other better dogs in la, but I think pinks is a good place to at least try once for everyone.
