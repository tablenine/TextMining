We brought our children and our friends with their children here in the evening around 6.  Not every restaurant would welcome the chaos into their establishment.  They seated outside with plenty of room for the extra noise.  Everyone was very accommodating and he food was delicious.  I had the special soup, creamy corn chowder with goat cheese.  REALLY good.  We also tried the sweet potato fries.  Loved them.  Got the BLT app.  Nice twist to the original.  For dinner, the salad with berries and pecans and goat cheese.  Great compliment to the soup.  The burger was excellent as well as the gnocchi.  My partner ordered the salmon special served with a stuffed banana pepper.  All very delicious.  We had a vegetarian with us who loved the veggie burger.  She just mentioned that the fries that came with the burger should have been cooked a little longer.  Great drinks list.  Tons of unusual beers and cocktails.  Liked the cucumber margarita a lot.  Can't wait to go back for breakfast.
