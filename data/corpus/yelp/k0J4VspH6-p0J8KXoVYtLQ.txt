Best restaurant ever!  I go here all the time for brunch and have never been disappointed.  The food is great. The staff is friendly. And, the outdoor patio is one of the nicest in the city!  Great for a group of girlfriends, taking parents or a first date.   My fav is the tomato garlic crepe - ask them to add swiss - yummy!!!
