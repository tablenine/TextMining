My husband and I had dinner here the other night.  I had the halibut and he had the salmon as main courses.  Both were on the cold side.  The clam chowder was good and my salad was fairly generic.  Service was. capable.  We both had one glass of wine and no dessert.  Skip the coffee. It tasted like cheap diner coffee.  Our bill came to just under $200. not counting tip.  This restaurant needs to pull it's act together.  I was totally underwhelmed by the food.  Not good.
