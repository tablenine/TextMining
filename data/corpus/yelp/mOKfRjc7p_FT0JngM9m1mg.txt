My friend kept raving about their banana cream pie..and I mean KEPT raving about it. After passing it by too many times, it was time to stop and try it once and for all. But I hadn't eaten dinner, so I had to put some food in my tummy before going all out for dessert. So my friend and I grabbed a couple burgers and a side of fries. I had their famous Hickory burger, while my friend had a simpler one. It was a solid great traditional burger. What a burger should be. It was delicious!! The guys manning bar were really old grandpas...it really completed the whole old school diner ambiance. . Somehow, I kept some room for pie...and guess what? They RAN OUT OF BANANA CREAM PIE!! WHY??!!! I came for pie and that was what I was going to have. So I got the pecan pie. With homemade whipped cream. I took a bite and was lost in all its sweet glory. Banana can wait. Pecan blew me away. I also have a new healthy relationship with homemade whipped cream. (my waistline doesn't) . But I will be back...fork in hand...ready for Banana!
