This is a trendy and cool place. The Meatball pizza was fantastic (great crust!), and the roasted beets with goat cheese is a "must" try! Â I can't give it 5 stars though because it's so dang loud! I guess they want that to make it feel lively and happening, but you really have to dial in to hear a friend / spouse talk over dinner.
