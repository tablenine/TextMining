My boyfriend and I spotted this beautiful restaurant on our way to Wokano. The set up is amazing with high ceilings, detailed moldings, and a large open space. We went at about 1:00pm and were offered their brunch menu (breakfast menu and salad and pizza choices). The farmer's market breakfast was divine! Every entree sounded delicious, and their ingredients are top quality and fresh. The service, ambience, and food made me think LARGE bill, but the prices were more than reasonable. It was a great experience and I will definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu. Also, the lemon brulee tart is exquisite!!
