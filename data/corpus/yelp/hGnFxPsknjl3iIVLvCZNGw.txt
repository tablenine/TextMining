Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
I just celebrated my birthday with my coworkers with lunch at Parker's on Ponce and it was an enjoyable experience. We started with the Calamari. It was perfectly fried with a aioli drizzled over it served over cannelloni beans and crispy sage. Yum!! I am a sucker for sage. I had the lunch special, a grilled cheese sandwich with Gouda, avocado, tomatoes and sugary, peppery bacon. It was slap your Mama good. All the flavors mixed together well. As a side I had their "steak" fries. Where I am from steak fries are thick cut fries with a crispy, golden brown outside and lava hot soft potato inside. These were not steak fries. They were a little too greasy and cut too thin. Next time I'll try another one of their sides. . . The lunch menu has a great choice of salads, sandwiches and something called "Pops". Their version of sliders with options like fried oyster, crab cake and BBQ pork. The desserts we very good. I Had the pecan pie with vanilla gelato and my coworkers had sorbet (mango and blackberry Cabernet) and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. I was way to stuff to try everyone's dessert but the cookies smell awesome. . . The waiter staff was very friendly but the lunch was long. The timing on the food with not quite right. We arrived at 12:30pm and didn't leave until 2 pm and we were not lingering. The manager did stop by twice, once to check on us and once to tell us of the 20% service charge for parties of six or more. She was rather humorless but was polite.. . All in all we had a great lunch and we are all looking forward to returning soon.
