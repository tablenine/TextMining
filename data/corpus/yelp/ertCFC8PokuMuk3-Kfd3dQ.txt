Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Was expecting to be more dazzled. Got the hatch burger, whose 4 types of chiles i had hoped would provide more of a spicy compliment to Â the richness of the burger. I'm not into thick and juicy and bloody so I tried to order on the well done side, but it didn't happen. The flavors they impart on the burgers though are great. I liked the garlic-y thing going on in mine, as well as the parmesan crisp on my companion's standard Umami burger. If I was the type of person that worshiped the juicy-thick-meaty aspect of burgers, then I'd probably give Umami 4 and 1/2 stars.
