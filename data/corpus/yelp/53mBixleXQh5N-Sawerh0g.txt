I love the SPACE.  It reminds me of the York in Highland park and then again a bar in Portland in the Pearl District or Chicago... This place/space left me in total deja vu.. Now for the Food: I don't eat meat nor do I like fake meat.  But I do appreciate places that offer vegetarian food.  And for the sake of sampling I had their fennel sausage.  2 stars. Beer selection was good and lots of high alchohol content beers so be careful not to have too many or it will be a bust getting home.. The Space, Crowd and Excellent Service are worth coming back for when in Downtown and across town.  A good destination spot in Downtown LA :)
