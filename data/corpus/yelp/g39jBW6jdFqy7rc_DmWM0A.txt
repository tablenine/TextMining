Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Step right up for a guaranteed bout of explosive, tear-jerking diarrhea. Somehow, too many things with a processed dog doesn't sit well with my delicate stomach. Tastewise, I don't see what the big fuss is about these hotdogs that people would stand in line for OVER an hour for. Just alot of toppings.. nothing worth waiting THAT long in line for... especially if you probably have to run home because of a stomach ache right after.
