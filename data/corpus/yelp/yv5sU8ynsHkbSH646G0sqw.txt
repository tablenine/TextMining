This review is of their brunch, I've been for dinner as well but haven't seen anyone else review brunch yet. We were the only people there when we arrived which was a bit awkward, but better than having to wait an hour.. . The waiter explained the brunch menu to us which had what she called breakfast pizzas, frittatas, and some other assorted more standard breakfast items. The boy and I both ordered frittata-type dishes and were surprised when we got eggs on a pizza crust (then what is the breakfast pizza?). This was fine just not what were expecting. Both of our meals were just very bland and boring, not a lot of flavor going on. Also we ordered a fruit bowl that cost $5 and it was almost all bananas, with literally one slice of grapefruit in the bottom and a few pieces of apple thrown in. I have never felt so screwed by a fruit bowl before!. . I would probably give this meal alone two starts, but I do like their regular pizza and their salads are fantastic so overall the place gets three. I will definitely not be back for brunch though.
