Interesting place....I love how the restaurant is decorated with their egg theme!  The place is pretty small and I can see how there would be a loooong wait during the weekends.  We still had to wait, but it wasn't that bad.  It would be much easier for a group of 2 to get a table.  They had some interesting items on the menu.  I ordered their retro omelette and french toast.  Potatoes were also included and they were great!  The french toast was delicious....mmmmmm.  The omelette was massive!  I could only finish half.  My boyfriend ordered an omelette with basil and sun-dried tomato...delicious!  I tried my friend's Sassy Eggs, which was quite unique; it comes with guacamole and chorizo!  Very tasty!!  And a nice thing was that the toast was not pre-buttered!!  I can't stand how restaurants always butter their toast.  I must come back again and get my own order of Sassy Eggs!!
