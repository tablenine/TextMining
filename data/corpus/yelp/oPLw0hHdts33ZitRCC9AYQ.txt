I previously dined at Yamashiro about 2 years ago and hadn't gone back sine recently. The first time i went, i could honestly say the food was not good at all. It was so sad i had to send the calamari back because i literally couldn't eat it - and I'm not a picky eater. I recall having the dark vader rolls and a few other- nothing that really stuck out as tasty. . . On my recent visit for a birthday dinner i would definitely say i had a much tastier experience! The food here can be good and bad - it really just depends on what you order. I was not curious so retry the calamari- but i did have the crab cake. The flavor were interesting and not in a good way. I ordered the seafood plate which had lobster yum), shrimp (yummy), prawns(yum), and scallops (eh). With that came with a large portabello mushroom hidden under a pile of couscous. In general, i'm not a fan of couscous, but the sides did not pair at all with the seafood. My friend had the black cod - WOW melts in your mouth!!! my other friend had the salmon- even though salmon to me is nothing special, i thought yamashiro sure cooked an amazing fish and served it perfectly with delicious garlic mash potatoes! . Lastly, how can i forget the warm chocolate cake! its honestly to die for if your sweet tooth is as big as mine!
