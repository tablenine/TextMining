this place is awesome. didnt even know it was a restaurant until i read this review ahha. went here 2 days after i turned 21 with my girls and had an amazing time, so many fun people and in a really trendy part of town. the margaritas are fabulous, and although the waitress' go around saying no flash photography when you take pictures, the bartenders were awesome.
