My brain tells me the rating should be lower, but my heart loves the atmosphere here. It's a truly stunning view, one of the best you'll ever find in a restaurant. The decor is really cool, the architecture feels special and the grounds are beautiful. Â In fact if I could come and drink here with more ease (it' s not the easiest access), I'd hang out all the time.. . The food is okay, it's such a shame it doesn't match the amazing venue. If it did, this would be one of the most amazing places ever but the food is just alright. It's not bad, but it just sits there on your plate making you wish for Nobu or Katsuya to pop into the kitchen and work some magic. Go for the cooked food, you'll be terribly disappointed in the sushi if you appreciate good sushi at all.. . Even with all that, I often think of this place with warm memories and wish to return soon.. . Food - B-. Ambience - A+. Service - A. Value - B
