i went here for brunch - the crab benedict and basil limeade were delicious (if pricy - thank goodness for generous corporate lawyer friends!), but the service here is very odd! the waiter was kinda pushy (in that mellow, aspiring actor sort of way) and for some reason, the kitchen just couldn't put the bacon on the side and had to put it on the crab benedict concoction. how hard is it to put some bacon on the side?
