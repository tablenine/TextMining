Oh...OHHHH...ooohhhh!!! OOHHHH!! MY GOD! roscoes! ROSCOES CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! OH GOODNESS! I heard about this place for years. And I finally tried it today. The waffles are the best waffles I've ever had in my life. SO moist!The chicken was soo crispy, steaming hot. I love it. Seriously, I felt my arteries clogging, and it was amazing.. . The staff was great, very homely feeling. Theyre so cheerful and it instantly put me in a great mood. My friend wanted water and the waitress said "water? how about some lemonade" I laughed and my friend said he just wanted water. She looked at him like alllriiight. When I couldnt finish my second waffle, she said "not gonna finish that waffle hunny?" I was tempted to say "no mama =[" hahaha I loved it. Def. eating here more often
