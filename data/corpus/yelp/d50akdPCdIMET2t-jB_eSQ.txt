Restaurant: Pozole

i just went to pozole for the first time last weekend. the food was really good and the drinks were excellent. however, the wait staff was something to reckon with. our waitress was really poor at her job and the hostess gave confusing information about the seating policies. Â it's been a long time since i've met a waitress so uninterested, so unhelpful and so unattentive. the seating policies, incidentally seemed really irrelevant. pozole's is very small and very loud. So if you like good food, mediocre waitstaff and loud drunk people all around you for dinner, this is the place. . i probably won't be back though.
