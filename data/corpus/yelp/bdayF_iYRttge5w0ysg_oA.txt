just doen't get any better . . .perfectly-seasoned, tender corned beef on toasted-yet-soft PERFECT crusty rye bread . . .there just isnt any better.  Period.  Order Canter's carrot cake to fall in love . . . and chase it down witha coconut macaroon for good measuer - just the BEST!. Slurp on PERFECT matzo ball soup to accompany.  It doesn't get any better than this.
