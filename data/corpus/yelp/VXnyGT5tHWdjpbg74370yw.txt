Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
a fish taco is $1.50.  they have nice toppings.  make sure you eat it while it's hot.  you can go in, buy 3 tacos, eat them and leave.  you will have absolutely no regrets.  don't drive out of the way to try them, but if you pass by, it won't hurt.
