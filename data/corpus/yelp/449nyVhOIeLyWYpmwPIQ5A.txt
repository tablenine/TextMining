Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Great burger place but not a burger joint.  you'll spend a pretty penny.  Don't get the umami burger but go for the pork, truffle or the one with bleu cheese (forget the name).. . The wait can be long and annoying and I wouldn't go here weekly, but the patty melts in your mouth and the bottled sodas are a nice touch.
