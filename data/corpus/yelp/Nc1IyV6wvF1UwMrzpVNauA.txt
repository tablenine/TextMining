Every time i visit Hell-A I have to go here and eat so much i can't move. The Thursday night meal is awesome (wear pants that expand or do not expect to sit comfortably after your meal) . . The gyros are big enough for two meals! But my favorite is the fried cheese (saganaki) and the bakalava (I have a friend who sends me a tray in exchange for my tax prep services....ummmm baklava). . This is one of the few things that makes me wish I still lived in LA.
