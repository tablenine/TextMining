I have been to this place a number of times and love it! The movie "Sex and The City" was filmed here. I love the short ribs and wasubi edanoyme(sp) dumplings are my favorite. The Drinks are great and would highly suggest this place. The best thing is that about this place is that they take large groups! They take upto 15ppl without a prefix menu.
