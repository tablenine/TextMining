Soooooooooo good. Service with a smile, reasonable prices, the wait was also reasonable, and I liked the general vibe of the place. I got the media noche; my guy got one of the omelettes and was culinarily transported back to his childhood. :) I cannot WAIT for this place to open up in the old Calvin's spot. Walking distance for me, woo-hoo!!
