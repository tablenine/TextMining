Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Ew! I've convinced many Palms fans that Palms really isn't all that great for Thai food. Sure they've got a Thai Elvis, sure it's clean and they accept credit cards...but I thought it was all about the FOOD!?! I say try the places up the street...you will be pleasantly surprised.
