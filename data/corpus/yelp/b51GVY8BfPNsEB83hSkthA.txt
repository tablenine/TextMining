So typical of so many new restaurants in Chicago: concept over execution. Who is tasting the food here? Better yet, who is making it? In the rush to be clever, someone forgot, you know, CARE: complex spicing patterns have been replaced by single, overwhelming notes--like the preponderance of mustard in the aloo paneer, an overwhelming amount of pepper in the samosa--and by salt, lots and lots of salt. The naan was undercooked, doughy; the papaya and mango in a salad under-ripe and tasteless. . . Of the six dishes we ordered, only the bindi chaat fry, with its nice melding of crunchy textures (stir fried okra and onions) and herbal/tangy (cilantro) notes, stood out; I'll confess that this version was better than the one I had at Rasika, a much higher rated restaurant in D.C.. . Two guesses: 1) lots of reviews, like this one, will pop up now that the Groupon for this restaurant has been dispersed (hey, that's why we went); 2) that Groupon ain't gonna help this restaurant--only better cooking will. . . Shocking, right?
