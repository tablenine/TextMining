This is a great treat for anyone searching for yummy desserts! Their cherry pie, raspberry red velvet cake, and tiramisu are all delicious.  I haven't found my favorite yet but I plan on making several more trips out there.  And if you're in the mood for lunch they have a great cheese sandwich in which you can choose from several different cheese varieties and combine a few as well. I haven't gotten around to trying any of their other lunch options but I definitely plan on visiting again.  It's a great place to stop at after shopping at the dekalb farmers market.
