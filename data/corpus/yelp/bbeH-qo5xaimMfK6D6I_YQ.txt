Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
Here's a great spot! I've been going here for years and the quality remains solid! First of all, check out the guy at the door seating everyone... He's like some kind of psychic guru who has an incredible memory! He greets you as you come in, never writes any names down, and remembers exactly who you came in after and gets the seating write. Every time! . I always order a tasty 20 oz. beer to get things rolling... Order one of their delicious salads (served in a big bowl perfect for a group)... Jump right into the Mediterranean Bread ( a delicious cooked pizza type dough covered with a perfect blend of spices and Romano cheese)... And finish things off with a half-pound-er Oven Grinder. Like the other reviews say, this is a unique pizza prepared upside down then cooked like a pot pie and served piping hot right on the spot. Where else but in Chicago will you find a place like this! Enjoy this place but leave your credit cards at home! Oven Grinder, like any other Greek style family run joint in Chicago, knows how much easier it is to only have to count CASH!!!!
