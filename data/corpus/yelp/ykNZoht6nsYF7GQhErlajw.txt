I'm going to be as blasphemous as Lisa right here on pretty much all points but one: I actually LOVE lamb, and the lamb here didn't really knock me out at ALL.. . In fact, the lamb was downright banal.  The bread was ok.  I like the pita at Cayanne better.  I like the pita at a lot of places better, actually,. . The salad was less than generic.  The pale hard parts of a head of iceberg lettuce, some hothouse tomatoes, crumbled feta and two poorly-brined olives do not a great side salad make.. . Iceberg lettuce is an abomination to me, anyway.  Especially on a $12 lunch on the east end of Pico Blvd.  Come ON now.  And the hard white part of the head of lettuce?  Really?. . And I'm a HUGE fan of olives.  I love olives.  I'll make a dinner out of olives and cornichons.  These olives were a step above the dyed black atrocities you see on cheap pizzas.  Again, I expected much better.. . My friend's beef kabob was tough.  Tough meat is a kiss of death to me.  It's unconscionable.  If I want tough meat I'll cook it myself. . . And for that price?  No sides?  Just some oily potatoes?. . The lemon potatoes at the Greek Cafe on Larchmont are more delicately flavored and FAR less greasy.. . For once I actually knew what the food should've tasted like.  There's a huge Greek community in Chicago and I'm very familiar with its best offerings, as well as what the mamas of my friends in school used to make.  I LOVE Greek food. . . This wasn't even close.  Maybe it was an off-day, but I wasn't so impressed.. . Too bad, because I was really excited to have some great lamb.
