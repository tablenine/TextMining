Never lets me down. . . I can't add much more to the reviews below about the food, except to say that yes, the sandwiches are delicious and HUGE. Easily enough corned beef or pastrami for 2 more big sandwiches.. . Their potato pancakes don't get enough love. they are delicious and come with the sandwiches..  Steam table items are a bit of a gamble. had some delicious chicken there, and the liver and onions yum - but I got some fish that was both dried out and soggy at the same time. The steam table veggies are....well, usually steam table veggies. . The soup - so good. I like matzo ball, but I LOVE kreplach (like a filled dumpling. a little deli potsticker!) and theirs are delicious and tender and more fun for me in the hot chickeny broth.. . try some different stuff - give the chopped liver a try. Try the lox. Â the cucumber salad is good, the pies are good, the bread is good. The mustard on the tables is good.. . It's a great people watching spot - this include the antics behind the counter making your sandwiches...those guys have skills.. Everybody eats at manny's. Cops, little old Jewish folk getting a bite, families, bikers, students, ven the president got some corned beef and pie there. . . Now I wish we'd gotten some extra soup to have at home.
