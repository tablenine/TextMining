Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The food was delicious, my boyfriend and I split the stuffed french toast and eggs Benedict. The reason for the two stars? Basically the rude management. Don't get me wrong the server was great but when we pulled out our groupon and credit card to pay, the owner came over and said "sorry their is a $9 limit" really? I've heard of a $5 limit but that is ridiculous. She then continually stared us down while we (had no cash) were deciding what to do. A minute later she rushed over and In the end decided to let us pay with the card but made sure to write a note saying groupon users should tip generously. She made us feel uncomfortable and like we were being rushed right out of there. She sure knows how to win her guests over.
