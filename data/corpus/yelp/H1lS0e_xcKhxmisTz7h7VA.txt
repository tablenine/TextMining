Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
I personally like this factory. Yeah it's touristy and pricey but it's nice and have great over porpotioned food. You have to get the desert and force the cheesecake down or you can simply take one home. i tend to try to force and pay for it after. There may be a wait with one of those vibrating buzzer things as it does get crazy at times.
