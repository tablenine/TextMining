Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
I can still smell the Cajun seasonings lodged under my fingernails. . . Perhaps if someone had not told me about the enduring wait, I had not been mentally prepared to bear the hard, wooden bench and partial shade in the waiting lobby outside the restaurant. . . The wait stretched even further, after pre-deciding on oysters, clams, a dungeness crab, a bag of shrimp, 4 cobs of corn, and a diet coke for the table.. . The dodgy area was in question, with a minuscule parking area accompanied by blinking neon lights of fellow vendors. After an hour wait, our table for four was called. We piled through the door quickly and hastily waited for our waitress to take our order.. . The food came quickly and arrived in large, steaming bags. We ordered the medium cajun spice with the sha-bang flavoring, which we thought was excellent -- right amount of spice and taste that complemented the seafood in all its glory.. . The meal was a memorable one - loved the crab and the shrimp, but would order less corn and no clams the next time around.. . Boiled last thoughts:. . Prepare for a minimum of a 60 minute wait - bring an iPod, a book, and/or a knitting needle with yarn to knit that scarf you've always wanted to give away at Christmas time in lieu of buying a real gift. Alas, it's worth the wait. Arrive at a non-peak time -- early afternoon (2pm-4pm) arrivals will help minimize the wait.. . If you have friends, coerce them into coming along. Although the pricing is reasonable for what you get, you can get the "shi-bang" for your buck if you share bags of shrimp with the ones you love.
