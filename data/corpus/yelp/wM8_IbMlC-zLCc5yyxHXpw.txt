Today I had a pretty nice brunch meeting here. The atmosphere was exactly what I was looking for- warm, good food, calm background music, and a table wide enough to accommodate all my files! For myself and a co-worker, service was good- not too 'in your face' to rush you to order, eat and leave. However another patron, dinning alone beside me, felt a bit forgotten since only one person was seating and taking orders.  If you come alone, you'd probably want to catch up on some email reading or internet news to make the wait not feel as long.. My food (shrimp and cheese grits-minus the sausage) was tasty and I loved the small glass infuser used to serve tea.. A bit pricey (my total $20.50 includes tax/tip) to become my weekly brunch spot but nice enough to be a monthly treat.. Bottom line, I like this little house and not only because this business is in a bungalow.  I'm looking forward to one like it coming to the West End.
