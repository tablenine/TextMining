I could eat their cheese fries every single day of my life and never ever get sick of them.. . They also happen to serve Metropolis coffee which is no doubt the best coffee anywhere.. . Other favorites = vegan tofu scram, humboldt county, pizzadillas, grilled veggie pita, vegan mac and cheese, veggie chili.. . This place is really chill. I've never felt awkward, or like I don't belong. Honestly, that's pretty rare for most places in Chicago, especially in this area. I do like the lighting, and I'm always amused or happy with the music as it's ever-changing. I love coming here weekday nights and Sunday nights just to read and drink coffee on my own.
