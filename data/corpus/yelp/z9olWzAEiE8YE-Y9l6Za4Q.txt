Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Amazing...We thought we were smart this morning getting to Din Tai Fung right when they open at 11am.  Not so smart after all, by the time we got there, the restaurant was already packed with a line out the door.  We ended up with a 60 minute wait to get a table!. . With that having been said, the food is quite delicious, we ordered:. . 1. Sauteed Broccoli w/ Garlic - very fresh, veggies cooked perfectly al dente.. 2. Dan Dan Mein - noodels drenched in sesame sauce and covered with chopped peanuts, it was just spicy and thick enough.  Noodles were al dente.. 3. Xiao Long Bao - handmade, soupy, hot and delicious - these were gobbled up in no time.. 4. Steamed Crab Dumplings - I didn't really like these much, they had a fishy taste, and the crab meat was overly shredded and tough.. 5. Shu Mai - I didn't really like these either - the shrimp was tough and the dumpling skin was too thick.. 6. Shrimp Fried Rice - this was just alright - the shrimp was not very plentiful, and it seemed more like an afterthought than an integral part of the dish.. 7. Pork Chop Fried Rice - same fried rice as above w/ a fried pork chop on top.  Again, not that great.. 8. Shanghai Rice Cakes w/ Pork - I loved this!. . All of this fed 5 adults and 1 toddler for about $85 (not including tax/tip), so not bad.. . The hour wait was quite excessive, but we were full and satisfied when we left, so can't really complain too much.
