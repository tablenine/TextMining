First of all.  It was my fault that I made the reservation on the same day that we wished to dine.  I was lucky to get a 930PM reservation.. . We arrived at the restaurant at 910 PM and were told that they were still honoring their 9 PM reservations.  It would have been less annoying if the bar was bigger and we didnt have to hang out in the 3x3 space near the stairs.  After almost 20 min of just standing there awkwardly with fellow diners staring at us, we were finally seated.. . We ordered the yuzu ceviche, seared scallops and the grilled octopus as apps.  Every single one was excellent.  Only problem, it took them 20 min to bring out the first dish (Ceviche) and about 15 min in between the other 2 appetizers.  By the time we were done with apps, it was already 1030...We shared the skate wing entree; and lucky for us, we shared.  The skate was super tasty and cooked just right.  Only problem, it was swimming in a deep pool of grease.  We had to wipe the grease off on our own plates before eating it.  . . We didn't make plans to go out that night.  We waited 20 min for the valet to come back.  Which, at that point, we just paid the parking and took the keys.  . . All and all, the appetizers were a bigger hit than the entree we ordered. The drinks ($12 Martinis) were fairly priced and decent pours.    Our bill was $150 with a 20% tip.  After all, our waiter was very nice and I am sure that the delays weren't his fault.  But for $150/2 people, I would have expected way more.
