Bacchanalia is the best restaurant in Atlanta. My husband and I delight in going here several times a year for special occasions. The service, food, presentation, and atmosphere are superb. The chef sends special treats between courses which is a nice touch. All I can say is that this is a gem not to be missed. I agree with another reviewer who called it gastronomical heaven!
