Someone said that the ideal time to come to this inauspicious restaurant would be when it's snowing outside, because the big front window as well as the dark-wood-and-white-curtained interior would make for a lovely and peaceful winter dining experience.  The service here is very good (they took a little bit of time to get to our table, but I'll forgive that) and the food is excellent.  The spicy yellowtail roll was one of the best I'd ever had, and I'm a big spicy yellowtail roll fan.. . The only problem?  I don't know what it was, but there were several really, really loud groups of people that really killed the atmosphere.  Personally, I think the folk at Bond St. ought to take a cue from Angel's Share and keep the volume down.  It's much spiffier that way.
