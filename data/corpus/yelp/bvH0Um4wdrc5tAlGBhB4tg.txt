i met some friends for drinks and a nosh early afternoon, midweek. . the space is cool, the coctails suffice, but really no frills. . . we ordered some food and sat on the faux patio... . . while over all there were no complaints all around, there were also no raves. . . straight three stars middle of the road sort of joint.
