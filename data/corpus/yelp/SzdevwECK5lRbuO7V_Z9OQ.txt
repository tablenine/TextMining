Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
My biggest beef (pun intended) with The Counter is the price, and how it doesn't match up with everything else. Ok, you have great burgers, you can build your own, and it's all free-range, humane, etc. That's good. But I dropped $20 at this place for a burger and a beer ($10.25 for the burger, I think $5 for the beer, plus tax and tip) - no "sides," no "pickle," no "lap dance.". . Twenty dollars. Burger and a beer. Unacceptable.. . If they were trying to pull off that sparse, modern decor, it would've helped to loosen the purse straps a little bit. The stools, which look from afar like neo-futuristic stainless steel, are cheap plastic. The countertops, ironically, are quite shitty. The flatware is comparable to what you would see in a high school cafeteria, and I'm pretty sure the silverware was purchased at Family Dollar. Seriously. I bought knives from there once and theirs looked like the same as mine. For a $20 burger and beer, you better bring your A-game and deliver that overpriced shit in extravagant style.. . They seemed busy, so evidently the yuppie crowd is picking up what they're putting down, but I sure as shit am not. If you want the same quality burger but with more and better beer, better prices, and sides, go to Hop Haus.
