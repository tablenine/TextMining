Ahhh my first Chitown review. So after landing around 9pm I was hungry and asked what I was tasting. I had no cravings other then somewhere we could sit immediately and have some options. We got to Hub 51 and were immediately seated in the middle of a packed floor. The space is low lit, LOUD, and filled with 20-30 somethings. A cute corn-fed midwestern gal quickly took our order and had the beers come "in a jiffy." . . The menu is diverse, a Mexican section, a burger/sandwich section, and then a nicer entree (chicken/fish/steaks) section. I went with a burger cause I couldn't really think and I saw one go by that looked good. Def a two-hander, that I needed to cut in half to really get a hold on. Cooked to a perfect medium with a pink center and loaded with lettuce, tom, onion, pickles, and condi's. Good crisp well done fries with lots of spices. 1 burger, 2 beers and tip ran me $25, not sure how that ranks in Chicago, but I def think you are paying a bit more for the trendy happening scene. Oh the music was of the crappy radio popular hip-hop variety, and it was loud. . . I noticed an area in the back with tons of people standing around and boozing. My buddy told me lots of places in Chicago offer deals on sepreate areas where if you can guarantee 20+ people will pay $30 a head you can have an open bar (sans top shelf) for anywhere between 2-4 hrs. He called it "The Blackout Special" Wow. We need something like that in NYC!
