Yes Please!. . I stumbled into this place as a result of a grumbling tummy... I saw the world "traveler" associated with food and jumped on it. I'm SO glad I did! This place satisfied many of my types of nerd: my foodie nerd, my coffee nerd, my wine nerd, my travel nerd, and my browsing/ shopping endlessly nerd... man this place was great.. . Even better is the fact that you can take their excellent coffee home with you! Woo hoo! There are global knick nacks, National Geographic covers, maps, world currency, travel books all over this place... really giving you the feeling of being transported. I will be going back to try one of everything on that menu. . . Oh also.. Wed, half priced wine! YES!
