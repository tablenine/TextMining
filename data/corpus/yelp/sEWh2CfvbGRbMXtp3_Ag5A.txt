First visit tonight - take-out.... . Staff: Acted like a bunch of pre-schoolers on a sugar high when interacting with each other. Rather subdued and unhelpful, uncommunicative to the non-Asians. A bunch of children who would rather be doing something else with their evenings I guess.. Someone else there had called ahead for a very large order for a party and freaked out when they screwed up the entire thing. I waited forever and a day for my order which was:. Korean spicy fried dumplings -- tasted like grease and nothing else. Not even a HINT of spicy.. and Korean spicy beef and tofu soup. Bland, boring and not even resembling the yook gae jang I was hoping for. There were two leathery beef pieces that reminded me of the Steak-ums I ate as a child. I guess they still make them because they threw a couple into the soup. Not a hint of spicy. I've had more interesting bottled waters than the soup broth. Completely boring and having to wait ages for it in a key-lime flourescent-lit playground for sugared-up children is something I will pass on in the future.
