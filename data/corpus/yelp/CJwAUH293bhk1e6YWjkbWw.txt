My boyfriend absolutely loves this place.. . I think it's just ok.. . The yakitori food is average, the only thing I found to be above average was their specialty chicken, which was super yummy. But that was about it food wise. Their decor is cutesy, and the staff is pretty nice. It's usually pretty busy, so don't be surprised if there's a wait for about 20 min. They don't take reservations, and your entire party has to be there for you to be seated. Prices are just ok, comparable to the rest of the area.
