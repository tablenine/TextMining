Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I dont know why this place is rated 4 stars. When it first opened they must have had a different cook, because I loved the penne arrabiatta. Then I ventured there a few months later, and the penne arrabiata was full Â of parsley, with a horrible horrible taste. I was pretty disgusted. I told the waiter, and the cook made me more sauce, full of parsley once again. I asked him if their was a new cook, and he said that it has always been the same recipe. The manager kindly took the food off the bill, but I have never returned due to constitency issues. This place lacks flavor, has a petty snobby hostess, and for a much better dinner/experience I would choose the less crowded and more neighborhoody Novecento just around the block on Main street.
