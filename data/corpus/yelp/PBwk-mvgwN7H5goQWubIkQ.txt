i was kind of skeptical when the boys decided on lunch here...MILK isn't all that impressive from the outside...but was i wrong. . . get the roast beef sandwich!! tender slices of roast beef, sliced mushrooms and melted cheese all in harmony in grilled ciabatta bread. i was almost sad i hadn't ordered the whole sandwich to myself. o_O. . on to dessert!! the red velvet cupcake...super moist and light and fluffy. its not as chocolaty as other red velvets...but the frosting had just the right amount of cream cheese tang to it with whip to fluff it up a bit (which is a rarity since most places dump so much sugar its this thick dense paste)...the only negative is the disgustingly bright red tint of the cake. i'm scared to ask how much artificial food coloring was added to this yummy goodness. BUT minus the color...this is probably one of my favorite light red velvet's i've had yet to date.
