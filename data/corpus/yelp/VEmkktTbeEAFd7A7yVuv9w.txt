Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I think my expectations were a little too high before I walked into the place. I didn't realize how much of a tourist spot Lawry's is.. . It reminded me a lot of House of Â Prime Rib in S.F. - the spinning salad, service from the carving cart - but scaled down and not as... nice. Maybe my memory of House of Prime Rib is better than it actually was.. . The food was all right, the service was great.
