Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
A couple of friends and I decided to try a new place and Toast looked like a good candidate for a quick, satisfying bite for an early sunny day. Seemed to have a nice atmosphere. food was alright, but I can say that it's not worth the prices. There are a few brunch spots I can think of at the top of my head that taste better for less. The biggest problem I had was the service. Â Awful. I think we only saw our server two separate times. one to take our order (after waiting for what seemed like eternity) and the second to drop our bill on the table. The busboy was more helpful than the waitress! Overpriced food and an ultra rude waitress is not my idea of starting out the day. Oh and screaming toddlers at the next table was a great bonus. No more Toast for me.
