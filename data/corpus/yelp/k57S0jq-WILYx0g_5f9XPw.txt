Food 5 Stars - I had the Tostada de Pescado and the Tostada de Pollo. Both were amazing but the fish one was more epic. I can't stop thinking about it and may go back again now (I was there last night). . . The margaritas were super strong. I like the idea of combining drinking and eating rather than having to go to one place to get dinner and then going to another place to get drinks. There is lots of energy here and it's super crowded. . . The one and only downside to this place is that's it's hard to get a place to set up camp. We managed to snag a seat at the bar after lurking for about 30 minutes. It was much more comfy after that. They are working on opening up the patio for the springtime. I can imagine that this place is going to be insanely successful.
