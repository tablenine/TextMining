OK . First, you gotta try really hard to get there before 9am if you go on the weekend for breakfast.  I know--it's pretty early.  Trust me though...you will totally end up with a choice shady table outside if you get there in/around 9am.  . . I had the lox and my boyfriend had the french toast.  The food is solid.  Not totally amazing, but good enough to get me going back.  Our bill was pretty small--less than $30.  We both got coffee with our meal--as well as a big ol' bottle of pelligrino.  That was the icing on the cake I must say.  If you go, split a big bottle of pelligrino with the person you go with.   . . Umm, there were lots of pigeons outside, but the staff tried really hard to keep them out of the seating area (it really didn't bug me too much) . I took two stars away because I gotta get my lazy ass up early to get a seat--and also because it does seem habitually crowded.  Not just regular crowded...stroller crowded.  I love little kids but...not so much when I want to get a good hangover fixing breakfast in me.
