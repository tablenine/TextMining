Just got back from Amy's UYE and we definitely had some. carcass galore to fill my wanna be Kobayashi appetite I brought with me ( I think I almost broke his coney island record). Nice meetin everyone!  Lamb chops, leg of lamb, filet mignon, top and bottom sirloin, pork loin, chicken, linguica (sausage), garlic steak, ribeye, picanha the house specialty beef, beef and pork ribs.....quite a large variety of meats served, with mashed potatoes, polenta, and fried plantains were served family style.. This is the third brazilian bbq joint I have tried....second for dinner.  By far this place had the best quality of meats, and the best salad bar and sides....at a cost, though--it is almost twice as expensive as the others.  A little disappointed that some of the more exotic meats I have seen served at other brazilian bbq joints weren't served here, but the quality of the meats served and the preparation made up for it, they pay attention to all the fine details, and the quality ingredients on the salad bar makes them stand out as well.. Don't think I can quite go 5 stars, but 4.5 would be fair.
