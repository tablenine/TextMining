The Special number 2... i vomited the first time i had it and a never had it agin. But, the reason why I'm giving this place 5 stars is because the soup is the best soup i ever had!! they put this special powder in it and there's a certain amount of powder per each level of spicyness. Aw I'm getting hungary thinking about it! Ow and there's rumors of a SPECIAL NUMBER 3!!!!!!
