This place is obscenely delicious. I've had: Saturday Morning Fever Pancakes: Yes, they're sweet, yes they're way too big, and no, never try to finish them alone. Seriously wonderful though... booze in my pancakes? Ok! . Strawberries and Cream Waffle: Perfection... and not so gigantic like the pancakes. . Tequila Sunrise Eggs: Awesome, though make sure you're in the mood to have chipotle... because there's a lot in here.. Poached y Papas Benedict: Whoever thought to put eggs benedict on potato skins, I want to shake your hand. This is delicious. . . I have never been in here when this place isn't ridiculously crowded (and I've only gone on weekdays). The parking is difficult sometimes, it can take awhile to get your food, and it is LOUD inside. However, that's because it's crowded... and for good reason. HUGE bonus points for them serving coffee french press (and for the free refills). . Perfect for hangover food, just take an painkiller before you go in because of the noise levels.
