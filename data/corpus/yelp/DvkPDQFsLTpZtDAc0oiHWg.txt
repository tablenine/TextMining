Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
I am biased - I could eat taco's for every meal but don't do to the fear of public rejection. This place has been consistently good in my mind and fairly priced for an in town, bar-esque joint. Nice wait staff, bar, etc. . . Beer - not the best menu around but most people are drinking margaritas instead. . . Tacos - good choices and all the ones I have had are good. I like Fish Taco's alot and find that this one is good but very different than some of the others around town.
