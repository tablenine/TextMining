the coffee is great.  a little pricey, but worth it.  whatever you do, don't order food.  it tastes good, but it's small, expensive and takes forf**kingever.  if i ever go back it will be for the coffee and only the coffee.  if you have a lot of money, a small stomach, a lot of free time and your A+ is my B-, you will love this place.  it took almost an hour for four cooks to make a nice looking salad, some slightly better than average eggs and two grilled cheese sandwiches that everyone in my family could make.  whatever.
