I went here with an East Coaster and he was pleased, so I say that's +1 for Chicago.  Those East Coasters, god love 'em, but damn! are they ever picky about their pizza and bagels!. . We went on a Saturday night, three days after Time Out featured them on the cover of their "best pizza" issue.  So, it was not surprising when one of the waiters took our name and told us it'd be an hour at least.  We asked if it was ok to leave and come back, then scampered across the way to Twisted Spoke for beers.  . . The place was PACKED, but our salad and 2 pizzas took less than 20 minutes from order to arrival.  That was impressive.  The waiter kept our water glasses filled,  also impressive in such a hopping pizza joint.  We ordered 2 pies, 1 with goat cheese and black olives and the other with fresh basil leaves and mozzarella.  YUM-Me. . The crust was the most satisfying part.  It was thin, flavorful, slightly charred on the bottom and edges to give crisp, but still chewy.  Finally, a REAL thin crust pizza in Chicago. Very nice indeed.
