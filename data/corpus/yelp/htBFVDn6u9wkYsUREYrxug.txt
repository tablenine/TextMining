This place HIT the SPOT! We had the Korean Spicy Pork, Chicken, Beef Short Ribs, &amp; Tofu tacos. All were Awesome with a capital "A" The meats were flavorful and the kimchi was fresh, tasty, and had the right amount of crunch and spiciness. After all that I wanted to try a quesadilla but had to refrain myself from over indulging on one meal. I will definitely come back when I am in LA. Also, my gf has to find them on twitter whenever they are having their Kogi cravings. I Love LA!
