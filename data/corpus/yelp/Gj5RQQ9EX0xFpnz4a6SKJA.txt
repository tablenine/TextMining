Okay, I admit it. I'm a huge fan of wood-fired Neapolitan pizzas. Places that do this RIGHT are hard to find, although there are several popping up in the Chicagoland area. Several years back I was introduced to Pizza D.O.C, just north of Lincoln Square. For years, that has been the gold standard to me. That place reminds me of a typical place in Rome. . . Coal Fire was written up as the best Neapolitan pizza in the area in Timeout Chicago magazine's November 8th, 2007 issue. Since then I made a mental note to try it out, which I actually didn't act on until recently. I'm sorry I waited so long. Pizza D.O.C has a serious contender! What makes this place different is that, as the name implies, they use coals instead of wood in their ovens. It makes their crust have a unique smoky flavor. Their crust has just the right amount of doughy-chewiness that I love. Their pizzas are out of this world!. . More about the place itself: they're located in an old, narrow, tin ceiling storefront close to The Matchbox (the ultimate dive bar) near Grand and Ogden. The atmosphere is very low key, relaxing and neighborhoody (if that's a word). They don't have home delivery....yet. Luckily for me I live close enough to pick up a pie quick when I'm so inspired. The owner is very attentive and personable. . . Coal Fire is on my pizza all-star list!
