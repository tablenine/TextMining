Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Great place to get down and dirty and knee high in crustacean shells.  No really, Boiling Crab is a great restaurant to visit with friends or even new acquaintances.  The food is ordered by the pound (i.e crawfish, shrimp etc).  The food is tasty but can get messy and a little unappetizing after awhile.  Also the food all seems to taste the same if you don't get different kind of sauces.  We ordered hot wings here but they came out just fried and sprinkled with hot pepper seasoning - not what I expected.  The cajun fries too were seasoned the same but they were good.  Overall the food here is only average at best.  The concept is great and appeals to a wide variety of people.  Seems to me like the return rate is the only business problem - I just don't picture people going back after their initial visit.  Parking is a ***** as well.
