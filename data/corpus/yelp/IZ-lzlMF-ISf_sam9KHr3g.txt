My boyfriend and I went here for lunch, and it was great.  The waiter was great, and the service was quite attentive. The wine recommendations were superb! . . I had the braised short ribs and they were great, perhaps a little too fatty for my liking, but still tasty.  . . He had the burger trio, and loved it.  Each burger was super yummy, and the flavors exploded. They forgot our salad, but made it up with two glasses of  a nice sparking Italian wine.  . . It was super pricey, but we had a gift certificate which always makes things better. I love enjoying a chic lunch when I can, and I would love to go back again soon, but I'm not sure if my wallet allows!
