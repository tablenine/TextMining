Went here with a few friends for a quick sushi bite. A friend had made reservations so we didn't have to wait for a table. We had a couple of beers and ordered dinner. Service was a little slow but if it's fresh rolled sushi I shouldn't be complaining. The sushi was too die for and I really enjoyed the outside seating. I think my review would be very differently if I had sat inside since it seemed a bit loud.. . I was a little shocked at the price of everything but the quality does back it up. My only tiff was the price because I would have tried a lot more if I felt it wouldn't have broken the bank. The next time I go back, I think it will definitely be during the half-price deals and specials.
