I'm not a huge steak guy - but this was the best I've had recently.  Got the opportunity to be taken by a company vendor.  Started with a spinach, egg and blue cheese salad.  Bone-in rib eye - flawless.  Top that off with some wasabi mashed potatoes - and someone curious enough to order the lobster mashed potatoes.  And no joke - the capper was butter cake.  I had no room to actually eat it - but somehow put up a good fight.  I highly recommend just ordering a steak and the butter cake - skip all the rest.  It's just filler - go for the killers on the menu.
