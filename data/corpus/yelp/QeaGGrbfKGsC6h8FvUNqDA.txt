Very very typical french bistro.  Places like this are a dime a dozen and I've been to tons of them located all over the states.  All the traditional french fare you'd expect.  The place itself is very nice, I liked the white plastic chairs and the monochromatic coloring inside.  We had a group of 10 which they easily accomodated which I also like for big parties.  Everything I had was delicious.  I'd definitely go with the moules frites, the beet salad, and the boullabaise.  Amazing.  I also had the profiteroles for dessert.  All food was above average but nothing I'd remember.  There are way too many places in LA to try and this one just didn't stand out.
