YUM!. . I heart their mash potatoes soo much and I don't even like mash potatoes that much! I dream about the fluppy, creamy white mash potatoes. I'm sure they add a good amount of butter / cream but it's blended so well. . . I usually get the tuna nicoise salad and mash potatoes on the side. Salad is always fresh. The seared tuna quality is good, too. You won't think it's the best, of course, if you've eaten a lot of fresh tuna at good sushi / seafood restaurants. . . I guess it's just a bit on the pricey side for a salad BUT quality over quantity!! I think the quantity is fair though. . . So sad I can only have tender greens when I'm visiting So. Cal. Wish they would open one in the bay area.
