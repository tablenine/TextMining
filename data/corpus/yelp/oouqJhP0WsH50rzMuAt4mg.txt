Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
This place has great sushi, and the wait is better than at most places with ridiculous waits because of their take-your-cell-number-and-call-you-when-the-table' s-ready system. So you can pretty much just walk around the neighborhood (which has a lot of shops and bars) until they're ready for you.. . Once you get inside, it's a pretty cozy atmosphere, not great for huge groups but fine for 3 or 4. Sitting at the bar is great, because you get to watch the chef prepare everything, and he'll probably even offer you a couple pieces free just to taste. He's also very cheerful and friendly. As for the rest of the service, they're friendly enough but oh-so slow.. . The sushi here is great, definitely the best I've ever had, but I have to warn you that I don't get out much for sushi. So it could be sub par, or Americanized, or whatever, but either way it tastes really good to me. I had the Oh My God, which a lot of people loved but wasn't my favorite. I really liked the Chad and the Tiffany, and also just the simple salmon and avocado (called the Alaskan maybe?).. . All in all a great place with a good atmosphere, and worth the wait if you have the time. But there will be waiting.
