Let's just say I hate not having meat in my meal and I rarely ever eat vegetables, but I have to say that this place is good.  I prefer their fried chicken burger, but I would say the main attraction has to be their fries.  You get a good portion of food in one order, but it also costs about $10 and up a plate.
