Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
El Tepeyac has the best wet burritos in the United States. Also, their heuvos ranchos, taquitos, amd menudo are the tops. I have coming here for 30 years and El Tepeyac's suaces, ingredients, and originality cannot be beaten. Also, is there a better owner/greeter than Manny, the owner? I haven't found one yet.
