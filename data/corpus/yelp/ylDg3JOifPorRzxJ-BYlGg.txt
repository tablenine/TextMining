Two words: BEST PASTRAMI.. . Parking might suck around this area. But don't let that factor or the "run-down"ness of the area prevent you from experiencing the best pastrami in L.A. (That might even be an understandment, althought I was told from a friend that Cats in NYC as the best pastrami in the states). . . #19 was what I had. It was screaming for my name the moment I sat down. It was like having the L.A. Xpress newspaper stand on your table. You can sense that standing there looking at you. Waiting for you to look right back. Then the moment you look back, it'll guarantee you the temption of ordering her, Ms. Pastrami. Â After confirming with myself with the #19, I topped it off with their chocolate malt.. . And how was #19? It was sweet, soft, creamy and packed with flavor. That was the premium of premium of pastrami. It was seductive. It was freakin' pornographically awesome. It WAS the Russian style and I totally savored it and loved every moment of it. I can't wait to go back again.
