I've been coming here for years with the family since this is my parents' favorite sushi place. Coming here is always a feast for us. Their prices are on the higher end of the scale but definitely worth it. I highly recommend just getting the sashimi combo for lunch or dinner. The fish is so fresh and the quality is pretty good that the fish just melt in your mouth. Their Unagi Bowl is good also if you like eel. . . However, as much as I love this place, I have to subtract one star due to the high price and some inconveniences with this place. Like mentioned in the other reviews, parking is painful and the wait is long. So painful that everytime I come here I ask myself why I endure this suffering and still come back. Make sure come here early when they open so you can line up and get in early to avoid the rush, or you have to be strategic and come here after the first round of crowd has finished eating and get in as part of the second round. They are really strict with their business hours, and they will turn you away and not put you on the waiting list if you arrive after their lunch time.
