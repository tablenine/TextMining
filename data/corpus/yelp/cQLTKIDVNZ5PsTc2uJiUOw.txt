It's local, it doesn't suck, the Bloody Marys are pretty good, and I really love the hashbrowns.  It's good for take out.  Friendly bartenders.. . With that said: it's too expensive for what it is.  They allow dogs on the patio which, I'm sorry, while I'm tying to eat is totally repulsive when they're licking themselves and drooling.  The service is always very, very spotty at best.  $4 for a burger on special is not special.  Not much personality.
