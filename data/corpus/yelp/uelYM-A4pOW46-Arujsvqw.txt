Definitely expected better quality meats from this place, especially for the price!   The only meats that stood out was the filet mignon wrapped bacon, the filet mignon with fat, and the beef ribs.  All the other meats were dry and had no taste.   All the meats just tasted salty to me, and everything tasted the same, there wasnt a great flavor distinction between the various meats.   .      The salad bar was a dissapointment, I expected a larger bar, but it was actually quite small.  The apple salad was decent and some of the roasted peppers were good..but then again, we didnt come here to eat salad did we?!?!  .      Surprisingly the plantains and bread, which they serve as unlimited appetizers, were good!  My friends went through 8 dishes of plantains, because the sweetness balances out the over-salty meats!  It's sad to say the highlight of the meal was the bananas!  But they were cooked pretty well, and came out hot!  .      The service here was excellent, all the servers refilled our drinks and appetizer frequently, and always checked to make sure we were satisfied.   They also served meats frequently, so you will never go hungry!  The price for dinner was $57 + tax + tip, which comes out to be well over $65!  At this price, it was definitely not worth it, the food quality was only mediocre at best, and they dont even include dessert with that price!  You have to order dessert off a seperate menu, which is around $10-15!  All-in-all, how much meat can you really eat?  If your just the average eater, you wont eat $60 worth of mediocre meats, so stick to a steakhouse!   .     I really dont know what the hype is about this place, why do people give this place 4-5 stars?
