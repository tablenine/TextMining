I have mixed feelings about this place. If I think about it I guess it's actually very simple and I can digest it in the following way.. .   The view:.   If I want to go there for a quick drink with friends at the lounge section, this is alright, especially when someone in your group has not yet been here before (Purpose? The visual wow factor experience i.e. nice view of the LA area all lit up)..   The experience can be rewarding or hollow depending on your mood. The city lights can look very different depending on who you're with (Friends? Lights look cool. Ex-wife? So sad looking lights..., Etc.). .   The food:.   For food this place don't come to mind and have not in the past either. .   I have lots of memories here though, came here with friends, groups, with visitors from Japan, etc.  .   But it can be hard to have intimate or quiet conversations as the atmosphere can be festive and loud which suits me fine because the only way I know how to act intimately is to blink and nod once in a while as I listen, my eye lids tire after a while (Mean? Sorry, half kidding actually).. .   This is a party place and I think it's good for it as long as you don't expect too much.
