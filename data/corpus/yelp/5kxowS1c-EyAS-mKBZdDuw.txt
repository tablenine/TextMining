Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
good place to go for lunch!!! FAST!!! The combo is just enough for lunch. It is my first time that someone will ask me " how do you want your noodle? How much oil you want? etc..... The ramen is different than the one you can get at the market. they are a lot thinner and the texture is softer as well. . . They have all these extra toppings you can order. or else your bowl of noodle will have nothing in it but two pieces of meat. some extra veggie will be nice!
