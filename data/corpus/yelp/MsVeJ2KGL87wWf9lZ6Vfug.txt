So my pseudo sistah calls and says...Hey! I found this place that we oughta try...there's a long line...(of course when there's a line...we get curious) and it seems to be a good spot to have lunch.... . So we trek to the "Alcove"  . . Here are my thoughts.... . Pros:  . ~Great food, some which I haven't seen anywhere (like the Chicken curry wrap, which I had).. ~Great clientele. ~Somewhat a speedy service -- there is a line but it goes by pretty fast.  . ~I love the whole outside dining experience; during the cold winter months, they do have a good amount of outside heaters.. . Cons:  . ~Its difficult to  find parking on the street in this area...but if your one those "Lucky in Parking" type then Kudos to you.... ~Valet is 3.50 and you only have 2 hours to eat and mingle...so hurry up buddy or the valet guy will charge you double.. ~The food and drinks are quite expensive for what they really are.... ~Last but not least...good luck finding a table during their busy hours.
