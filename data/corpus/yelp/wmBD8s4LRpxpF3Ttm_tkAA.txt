My friend, Bryan, introduced me to this place and I didn't have any idea what it was or what we were eating. He kept saying "It's SO good." Free food? Okay, why not?. . I LOVED it. The service was great, food was great. I'm not sure what size he ordered me, but I couldn't finish all of it. It was amazing, and I still dream about it to this day.
