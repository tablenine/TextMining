I really like Spring because of it's delicious food, and superb service.  . I had the halibut, and it was perfect.  The pork belly appetizer was also delicious.  My fiancee had the snapper special, and it wasn't as good as mine, but not terrible.   The snapper tasted a bit fishy, and maybe needed more flavors.  The service stood out too.  The hostess carried both of our cocktails to the table for us, and our waitress had the valet know we needed a cab.  I also enjoyed how the chef sent out some tastings which is how we got to try basil infused hot chocolate for the first time.
