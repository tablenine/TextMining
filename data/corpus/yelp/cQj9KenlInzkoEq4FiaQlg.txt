Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
In the span of four days, I've been here twice with my friends. That's how good it is!. . We've ordered the cajun fries (both regular and mild), the chicken wings, the sausages, the shrimp, crawfish, blue crab, and dungeness. Everything was awesome, especially the fries, wings, shrimp, and dungeness crab! The crawfish was Ehhh only because the meat on those suckers is this teensy tiny piece of morsel with a nasty vein on top. Trust me, get the mild, anything spicier than that will seriously kill! The service here is great btw. Efficient workers who come by your table constantly to ask how things are or we need refills. The waitress took my drink to get it refilled without me even noticing! And that is an amazing feat considering how I was constantly drinking because everything was so damned spicy.. . Some cons about this place is the wait on the weekends, the small parking lot, the one stall per gender bathroom.. . Btw, they serve their soda with crushed ice! That, my friend, is something wonderful.
