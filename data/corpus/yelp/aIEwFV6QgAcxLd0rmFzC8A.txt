My friend Connie took my sorority sisters and me here once for dinner and ever since then, we have been die hard fans of this place. I personally love the steak (#11 and #12) but I have numerous friends who are in love with their chicken. . . If you're ever craving a  delicious flavorful steak with grilled onions  then the bistec de sollomino and bistec de lomo are just for you. They come with black beans, rice and fried plantains on the side. Although I would rather have a double helping of the plantains and forgo the beans, they don't allow any substitutions here. . . Also parking is really cramped and large cars smash into compact spaces ALL THE TIME. Sad to say that a few of our cars have suffered minor casualties with a few extra dings and scratches that weren't there pre-dining.. . The place is pretty crowded at dinner time, even during the week! Loud rambunctious restaurant which is good for group dinners, just have to wait for a table.. . Minus one star for obnoxious creepy wait staff. They blatantly stare at all the girls and make you feel dirty. YUCK. Yum for the food though. Make that YUM YUM for the food. Sigh. My mouth is watering just writing this review. If only I lived in LA again, I would go for a visit.
