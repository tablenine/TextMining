Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
OK, so I go against popular consensus here, but man-oh-man, while the concept is good and kind of interesting, the Chix(the way they spell Chicken on the menu) &amp; Waffles was just not what I imagined it would be.. . Conceptually, I think the idea works, but the chicken was dry and over cooked and the waffles tasted like toaster waffles from the freezer section.. . I don't get how this place gets all the rave reviews and is on the travel shows from time-to-time.. . Yes, I am glad I tried it, since it is a LA institution, sort of. Â But once was definitely enough for me.
