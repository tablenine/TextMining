Busy Bee Cafe is just delicious.... . The meatloaf on Mondays is so melt in your mouth good. I think I have tried everything besides the liver and onions on the menu. It tastes like grandma is in the back cooking. The sides are always good but I feel like they can spare a liitle more in that department ( we are spending in upwards of $10 a plate).. .  The actual store is small and you will have a line but it is so worth the wait. Â The people are nice and welcome you. Just make sure you have your ID if you are paying with a CC...
