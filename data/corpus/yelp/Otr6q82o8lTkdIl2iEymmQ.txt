Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Contrary to their catchy song which advertises, "the only thing better than a Tito's tacos is two." I could have gone my whole life without ever eating one of these tacos. Do not get me wrong reader.....I've given Tito's Tacos the old college try at least five times and that's five times too many.. . So, if you are going to check it out, be aware that parking is limited. You should be able to find parking on Washington Place at the meters with not too much trouble. Be prepared to wait in a long line (like a ride shorter than Disneyland but longer than Knotts Berry Farm) to order your food. Also, be ready to wait for your food. People that eat at Tito's tend to buy tacos in bulk. Though, the food takes less time coming out than you spent waiting in line to order.. . Speaking of food - the tacos are tasteless. I've tried them time and time again (five times to be exact), hoping that I would see in them what is so amazing and I can't taste it at all. If they didn't have cheese on them, they would be miserable. The chips are just chips and I don't care for their salsa. On one occasion, I did venture out and had a chicken enchilada. Worst decision ever! I spent all day with a stomach ache.
