Restaurant: Bacchanalia
Category: American (New)
The food at Bacchanalia is some of the best in town. You really can't pick anything on their Prix Fixe menu that would be a disappointment. The vegetables come from their local farm and are scrumptious - as good as it gets!. . Here is a great secret about Bacchanalia - go sit at the bar and order a la carte! This would be a great option for a summer evening when it feels too hot for several courses. Plus, you will still be served the all the little "gifts from the chef". Amazing!
