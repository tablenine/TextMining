Flat out the best Ethiopian I have ever had. When you go to a place that serves something besides American food, it's always a good sign when the majority of the dinners are speaking the language of the country represented by the menu. . I had this red lentil stew thing that was out of this world, and the steak tibs were fantastic. . The waitstaff was attentive and friendly, and the prices were good too. . All in all an excellent experience.
