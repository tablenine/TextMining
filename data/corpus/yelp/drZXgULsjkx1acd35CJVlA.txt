okay, the easier part is over which is giving this place 5 stars.. . all the food is great. i've had a few different things the multiple times i've been here and its always very good. Â garlic rolls are amazing. they have some garlic-free dishes, but if you want those, don't go to this restaurant.. . try the garlic ice cream! (i know, i know, but just try it!!!). . =)
