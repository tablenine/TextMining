Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
I have mixed emotions after dining here.  I really liked the San Francisco Stinking Rose...but after eating at this location I was not so impressed.  I was really excited about the pesto argula gnocchi in SF but here it was different...no cherry tomatoes?!?  The ambience wasn't quite the same either...I felt like I was at the circus.  I did get to try the garlic ice cream here, which I was scared of at first, but once I took the plunge it was surprisinly tasty!  Oh, and my mojito was HUGE!
