I am going to have to find more excuses to visit LA (wait, did Ms. Norcal just say that?) - yup- it's THAT good- chocolate layer raspberry mousse, and yummy yummy salads!!! (yes, I ate a salad) - I only wish they had the potato balls without meat too....sigh.....wonder who I know from LA who can come and bring me pastries....was very jealous of the girl on the plane on the way back who brought a take out box to her friend....wait, no, jealous of the FRIEND!!!!!
