Finally!  Jeez, we've wanted to go check this place out for a while now and tonight was the night.  My folks came in and the four of us headed on over.  It was totally empty on an early Sunday evening, but that's fine.  Well, probably not for Feed though.. . Heh, love that they carved "eat Feed" and little chicken foot prints into the concrete sidewalk out front -- clearly these folks have a nice sense of humor.. . Totally cheep cheep eats and the 1/4 light chicken is mighty darn tasty.  As a matter of fact, I don't think I've have better chicken in a restaurant anywhere. Mom, who was derailed by all the tattoos, and the hubs had the fried chicken special which they both really enjoyed.  Dad had the BBQ chicken sandwich which he loved.  Think that'll be the way to go on my next visit. . . Everyone's right -- the sides are pretty so-so which was disappointing.  The mashed potatoes are indeed heavy on the pepper and are crumbly dry, not creamy at all.  The cole slaw looks kinda gross and unappetizing, is not mayo based but tasted eh, ok-ish.  The mac and cheese was all dried out, nothing gooey creamy about it at all.. . All in all, I'll go back but will probably limit my sides consumption.
