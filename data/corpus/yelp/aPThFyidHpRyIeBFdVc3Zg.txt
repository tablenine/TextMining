I would give this place 3 1/2 stars, just cause it really is good but at the same time, I have never suggested this place or think of this place in the late hours.. . So far, I have had the combination plate, where you pick one thing from three categories. All of it is good. . . I was a bit more adventurous last night and ordered something that I can't remember the name to. It was a pot with broth that tasted like udon broth but a little richer. It had rice, chicken, shrimp, egg and touch of boiled spinach on top. And let me tell you - YUM! It was the perfect meal at the end of a stressful, long day. Comfort food indeed!
