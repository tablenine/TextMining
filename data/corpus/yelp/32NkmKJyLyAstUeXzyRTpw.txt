Restaurant: Mr. Pizza
Category: Pizza
When you walk out of a restaurant full, but not greasy....that's a place to go back to. . . Mr. Pizza has been described to me mainly as, "what you would get if you were ordering pizza in korea" . . while describing it to my friend, i said that it is "korean baker decides to make pizza" . . but that also makes you wonder what the hell it is if you have never been to a korean bakery. . . As most of you know, the main korean distilled beverage is the soju, and is made from some kind of potato i wanna say sweet. Usually spirits are made from things of abundance in the country...ie cachaca and sugar in brazil, sake and rice in japan, and so on.... . That little blurb was to set up the sweet potato thing that Mr. Pizza does. They have a huge menu, but when you go to a placed "Mr. Pizza" you can't not buy pizza. . . They have normal pizza, one normal with bulgogi (korean marinated meat) and they have specialty pizzas. . . The specialty pizzas have interesting crusts...one that is my personal favorite is the one that has the sweet potato stuffing. That's the dessert to the slice of pizza. So you could be eating many tiny full 2 course meals...you could call it three if you eat the relish tasting pickles they bring out before you eat your pizza slice. I think they have other crusts too, but really I'm not gonna wait to write a review until after i eat everything....that'd be foolish and really unhealthy of me to do. Just saying that I liked it, and I think you will too. Go in with the right expectations though. It is not going to be the BEST pizza ever...probably not even close, but there are many different and contrasting flavors, and as always good company always makes food taste better.
