The wait....lllooonnnggg....still waiting....finally seated.. . My boyfriend and I went during a weekday night and once finally seated down realized they were closing soon. He and I had no idea on what to do so we watched the people next to us to see how they were preparing their food. We did as we watched but I don't think we did it all too correctly. The meat was tender but as a meal overall, it wasn't what I had imagined. My boyfriend is Asian so I expected him to know how to prepare it, but he's Vietnamese, not Japanese, duh me. Â We were halfway into our dinner when almost the entire restaurant disappeared. Everyone in the kitchen was running around because they wanted to get the heck outta there. I felt rushed, really rushed. I had my plates with food on them, half of my food, and was asked if they could clear the plates out, I said no. I had waited an hour and wanted my food. The staff was hurrying up cleaning the place out. One major negative comment- the staff kept on saying very vulgar things to each other, and very loud in Spanish. I'm Mexican and understood everything they were saying. That made me feel very uncomfortable. Note to self, don't go there again close to closing time.. . Like I said, I was probably not eating my food with the correct sauces so I will give Shabu Shabu another chance. Anyone wants to teach me how to correctly prepare it? I based my review mostly on the experience I had that night, not a very good one.
