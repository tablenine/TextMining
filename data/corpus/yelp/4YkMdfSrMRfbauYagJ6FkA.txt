Restaurant: Twist

I think I was a bit grumpy (as was the staff) the last time I went to twist. I went back and had a great experience. We were seated promptly, everyone was friendly and the people watching was top notch as usual. The food was great as well, good portion sizes and a lot of options. I really do love their tomato and mozzarella salad and would return just for that.
