Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Unexciting ramen.  Sure, they have super spicy stuff but I prefer to actually be able to taste and enjoy my food.. . I had basic ramen with a few additional toppings.  My ex-coworker had insisted on adding crazy things to her ramen like butter (eww).  She claimed this was the best ramen place.  Eh, there is one very notable place down the street (what I call the Big D).  . . Service as rather rushed but it was understandable during the heavy workday lunch rush.
