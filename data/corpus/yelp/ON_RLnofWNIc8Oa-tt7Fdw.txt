Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Finally had a chance to check this place out and for the most part it delivers on all the hype.  Won't make this a lengthy review because there's not much to say.  They make two things.  A fish and a shrimp taco.  Both are as good as it gets.  Salsas are excellent.  Only thing that would make this place a 5 star in my opinion would be to make their own tortillas but for $1.50 fish tacos and $2 shrimp tacos, who's to complain?  I don't know if I'd go out of my way to visit this place but if I was in Hollywood and craving taco's, there's no question where I'd go.
