We came here for dinner one balmy night last August. Although I was very piqued by the concept of a haute vegetarian restaurant in Chicago, I wasn't impressed by the execution at all. . . We had a reservation, but were made to wait well past our assigned time at the bar. They were nice enough to comp us for the drinks we had at the bar, though, which was nice of them. . . As for the food - we picked about 5 or 6 items off the menu and split them amongst ourselves. However, the food wasn't that memorable - while I felt like everything looked great, nothing tasted a-mazing. The service and the decor were both great, however, which is why I would be willing to give this place another shot someday.
