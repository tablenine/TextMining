f I were still 15 and eating five full meals a day, this would be a great place.  it's not very expensive, and the pizza is both ginormous and filling.  . . if huge slices of pizza is your thing, then you'll love this place.  I wasn't overly impressed with it though...found it pretty bland.. . pretty meh.
