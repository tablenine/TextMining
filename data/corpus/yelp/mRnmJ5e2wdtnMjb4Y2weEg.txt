I've only been there once for a date.... . I stayed on the safe side with my order as I had Pad Thai and California rolls. It was really good!! My friend had some kinda chicken dish and she liked it a lot. Another thing I love about this place is BYOB!! . . I did hear that it has a open bar before I went there. I was not impressed because it is right next to the entrance, when it gets crowded it literally blocks your way in and out. . . I would like to back and try some more stuff though.
