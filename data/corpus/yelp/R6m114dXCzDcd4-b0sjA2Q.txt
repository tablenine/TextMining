Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
so i was totally craving the chicken wing &amp; the seasoned fries! and it was already 9:20pm.. i live about 10 mins away from boiling crab.. i decided to call to see what time they were closing.. i call, they say: as long as u get here by 9:45 it would be fine. So, i get there at 9:36 and i walk in full of excitement about to share this experience with my little brother and his gf.. but to only be turned away! When they could of just told me over the phone 10 mins ago! Grrrr...!!!!
