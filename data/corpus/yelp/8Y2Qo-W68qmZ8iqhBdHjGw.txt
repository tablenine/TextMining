I LOVE the dumplings here! Best shanghai dumplings I have ever had! And I have lived in Shanghai LOL. I love how each one is filled half way up with 'soup', how the skin is so tender yet it doesn't break as soon as it's touched. The meat is not flavored sweet like most places, and they use lean pork. You don't get the nasy fatty bits that u can't chew. . I have been going here for YEARS! . I love the chicken soup, it's like how my nanna use to make it when I was a kid. The pork rice roll brings back childhood memories too. . I try to always save some room for the red bean dumplings, they r soooooooooooooooooooo good.. I can eat at this place over and over and over and over and over and over. Love it!
