Yummy yummy, friendly service, a LOT of meat but also a gigantomatic salad spread! with CAESAR included, yay!. . We came closer to closing but the meat was still rolling strong. It was very good - very rich, high in oil/fat, but the salad bar allows you to balance things.. . Ordered a drink from the bar, it was unbelievably strong so we only sipped and bore it (didn't want to send it back and get busted by the bartender).. . Note - Valets don't speak great English and we had some coordination issues. I couldn't tell if we had to get validation or not, considering the parking was for the restaurant. . . Then it turned out we were short on cash to tip the valets, and the restaurant was closed so we had to walk to an ATM. We asked the lead valet where to go to get cash, and he was like, 7 blocks to the right. Then we looked left, and there stood Le Meridien hotel, a block and a half to the left. So we took that route, got some cash, returned, and rescued our vehicle.. . Anyway, food was good, service was great, peeps were nice, there were lots of Xmas family dinner gatherings, and it was good times. . . And the meat is super juicy. Mmm.. . Oh, if you don't know about this place check out their website - it's basically meat on skewers brought to your table as you flag them. They have plantanos!! Yummy yummy. And jicama fries. Those are good, too.
