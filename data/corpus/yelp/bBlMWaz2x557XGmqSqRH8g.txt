I have only ever been here for drinks and snacks, and have always sat in the front at the bar, but it has always been fun.  The bartenders are very attentive and get our drinks quickly, we always get seats (eventually), and we are able to order form the late night tapas menu until we are completely filled up.  I like the chips and queso fundito, and the chicken and fish tacos, and the chicken empanadas, but they have a ton of other tapas options, too.  It is nice to have drinks here late because you know you can get good food, too.  There is also no line for the bathroom later in the evening which makes is infinitely better than many other places where I could be having drinks.
