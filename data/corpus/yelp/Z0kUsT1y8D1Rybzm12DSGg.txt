Restaurant: Tokyo Delve&#39;s Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
I never knew that this spot was so damn expensive.  The table next to us rolled HELLA deep and somehow managed to throw down $1500.  Who the EFF spends 1500 bucks at Tokyo Delve's???  Blasphemy.  It's so not swank enough to spend that much money.. . I guess I am jaded because my cousin works here and I know all the bartenders/performers/servers/owner.  Our entire meal was comped.  And when I say meal, I mean 3 rolls of sushi (for like 15 people) and the rest is sake bomb history.. . I have been to TD's a few times before, but never have I seen such pure MAYHEM.  At some point in my sake bomb drunken delirium I took a double take because I thought I was at 'da club.'. . All I have to say is, YOU PEOPLE ARE INSANE.  I'm surprised TD patrons don't make the cover of the LA times every Saturday and Sunday morning- headline as follows:. . "Scantily clad, inebriated girl with fake breasts, trips on 3-inch heels, breaks neck as she falls off TD chair from dancing.". . OR. . "Dumb ass drunk DUDE BRO crashes into Jack in the Crack drive-through window due to high volumes of sake bomb intake at TDs". . It's no wonder the bike police stand guard in front of this joint.  The copious amounts of raw fish and alcohol may lead to harmful situations.. . It's definitely a party.  Go for the experience, not for the sushi.  But come prepared.  Your liver will love you more if you prep it a bit beforehand.
