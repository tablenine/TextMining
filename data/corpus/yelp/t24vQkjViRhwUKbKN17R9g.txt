Hide..more like..Hype...that was lame.. . I really wanted to like this place..but alas... . I ordered a tiny smattering just to get an idea..and I'm glad I stopped where I did. I enjoyed the complimentary mug of matcha far more than the sushi.... . The albacore was tataki which was not mentioned on the menu, the salmon was flabby, weak textured, and flavorless, and the "special scallop" has been done far better at other places I have been (note*..just ask your sushi chef for spicy scallop nigiri..most places I have been totally understand). . . Thanks a lot, Sushi Zone. Your ridiculously amazing fish has destroyed all other sushi for me. Â . . Oh..if you do come here...remember it's cash only (they do have an ATM inside just incase).
