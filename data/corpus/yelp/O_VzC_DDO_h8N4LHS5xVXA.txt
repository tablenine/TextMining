WOW, all of these people, believing the hype, well, I say skip this one. Been there probably 20 times over the last 10 years, and I'm always hoping that I will go and finally see what others see, but I just don't get it.. . Your standard street cart is a 100 times better, but if you don't feel like risking that, hit Carney's, Skoobys or Vicious Dogs....
