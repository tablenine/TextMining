I have a bit of a problem with restaurants that are culturally confused, so I had some difficulty coming to terms with the lack of continuity between the Mexican- and Asian- inspired cuisine amongst that which strove to be contemporary American.  Not being blinded or biased by love or trendiness, it seemed to me as though the relationship was forced.. . My lobster ravioli, which was promised to be "a little creamy" was overwhelmingly so, which nearly suffocated the lobster flavor.  The chicken and gnocci, which was ordered without spinach came smothered in it, but was good depite this.  The bread n' spread was tasty, and our martini and wine selections kept us happy.
