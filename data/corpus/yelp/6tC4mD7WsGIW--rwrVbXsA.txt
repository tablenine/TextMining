Restaurant: Cooper 35 Asian Pub
Category: Bars
what's with the bad reviews??  i think people might've been expecting too much, cuz for me, Cooper 35 / Asian Pub gave us exactly what we were looking for.  $4 drinks really can't be beat -- especially when they're both tasty and strong.. . anyway, we had a few rounds and plenty of food and it came out to $22/person including tax and tip.  in my book, that's pretty awesome.  we also got to sit outside which made everything awesomer, and despite all the complaints of bad service, i thought our waiter was impressively attentive given how many tables he had to take care of.  if you're gonna be snotty then i s'pose this place might be too budget for you, but i've been pleased on every visit.  maybe i'm just cheap.
