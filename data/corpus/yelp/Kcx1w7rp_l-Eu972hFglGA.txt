OMG, just thinking of this place cracks me up.  They should put this place in GTA4 as it's that ghetto fabulous.  Late night madness is the theme here at this literal "shack" of an eatery.  You scream your order at the family run joint along with any defenses of your ethnicity at the same time.  I swear, if you ain't got game, you might not get served.  Get the burnt hot dog, literally smothered or should I say flooded cheese fries and the famous Milkshake and hope not to die in the process.  Drunk ppl galore show up here like flies attracted to a buglight after hours, then the real party begins...
