Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I went again to this branch of Shinsengumi for the third time yesterday, and I have to say...I still like it. Does the trick every time.. . The thing I love best about Shinsengumi is the options. I can decide the strength of my soup base, of the oil content, of the noodle hardness, and make whatever add-ins I want. Normally I find most ramen too salty, so it's great to have my options open. I love that. The ramen might not be the best ever, but it becomes just how I want it when I design my own order. And they're very giving with the extra ginger and onion. I also like that you can refill noodles for $1 each, so we always come here when we're super hungry. Service, too, is good.. . The singular complaint I might make is that there's always a line. I waited for an hour at 2:00 pm on a Sunday once. I waited for an hour at 9:00 pm on a Saturday before. There is always a line.. . Even with the detraction of wait, I still have to give this place my props. I'll come again, and again, and again.
