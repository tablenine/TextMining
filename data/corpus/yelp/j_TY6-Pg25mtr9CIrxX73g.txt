I love Korean bbq. There, I said it.  I am neither Korean, nor really like BBQ'ing, but put those two together and -- voila!  CSO is a good place and the closest Korean BBQ to me, so I've been a few times.  I tend to agree with the other reviews about the service; not very friendly if you're not of Korean descent.  Which, in other nationalities, is deplorable...so why would this be ok here?. . However, the dumplings, bulgogi and Korean pancake are somewhat too good to pass up. I'll deal with the hate crime to get my little chopsticks on that BBQ'd up meat.  I love the generous amount of sauce and garlic as well, and the kimchee is always nicely spicy.. . The major thing I think CSO is missing that other Korean BBQs around provide is the lettuce leaves to wrap the meat in along with the peanut "spread" and garlic.  Now THAT is heavenly.
