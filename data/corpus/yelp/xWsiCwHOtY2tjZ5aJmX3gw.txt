I have never been here for brunch as it seems many of the Yelpers have, but I have been here a few times for dinner.  Very surprising for a place that, before I ever went, I knew as a coffee house.  Both times I have had chicken, prepared different ways, but it was prepared flawlessly and the sides were delicious.  Good, very reasonably priced wine list also.
