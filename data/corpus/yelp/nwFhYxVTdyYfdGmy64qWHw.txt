Restaurant: Baohaus
Category: Taiwanese
New York's in a constant frenzy for more sources of animal fat.  Baohaus, which just opened a few weeks ago, aims to feed that desire with its contribution to the "Asian street food served in a clean, stylish location" sub-genre.    . . The basic building block of a meal at Baohaus is the bao -- steamed bun.  I had the beef because, let's be honest, another direct comparison to the Chang empire is needless.  It was quite good.  The bun and beef were both very tender and the beef was very flavorful.  Very satisfying.  I also had the boiled peanuts.  (One of the guys working there correctly guessed that I'm kinda from the south based on my peanut order.  That led to a discussion of the great places to eat in northern Virignia.  Gotta rep another local boy.)  These were a great contrast to the buns.  They were midly tart, really soft, and just really fun to eat.  . . My one strike against Baohaus is that maybe it's slightly more expensive than I'd like.  But the ingredients are top notch, so that may be a worthy expense.  Definitely worth a stop by next time you're in the neighborhood.
