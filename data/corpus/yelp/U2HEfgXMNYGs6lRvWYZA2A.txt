My favorite Cuban took me to Porto's for the proper experience. Apparently, I've been doing it all wrong. You have to order a mess of food and somewhere in that pile, you'll find the goodies.. . My new fave sandwich is now the Media Noche Preparada which is the media noche sandwich with croquettas in it. The smush of the croquettas provided excellent moisture to the sandwich although the lechon wasn't dry (yay!). I was however, too full Â to finish my entire sandwich so now I have half, a potato ball and a guava pastry to enjoy as leftovers.. . I also had a bite of the creme brulee which was definitely good. Next time, I'm trying the chocolate flourless cake. Mmm, chocolate.
