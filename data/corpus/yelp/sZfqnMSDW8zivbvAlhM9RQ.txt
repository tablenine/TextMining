Wow~!!  This place is amazing.  I am not from CA and have never seen such a small place get so much business.  We went on a Sunday (Christmas Eve) at 11am, just 1/2 hour after it opened and had to wait in line for well over 1 hour.  We went back 2 days later 15mins before opening and there was a line as well, but we got a table right away and saw the line grow.  It's amazing to me how this is possible.. . I can see why though, the dumblings are so yummy.  I can just sit there and eat 50 of them.  We ordered a variety of them and liked them all.  I also liked the pork and red bean buns and the steamed beef soup.  The only thing I didn't like was the red bean cake but my brother loved it.. . If I lived in CA, I would come here once every week.. . Update:  They expanded and have a new location just around the corner in the same plaza!  That makes me extremely happy!!
