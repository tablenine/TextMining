Went here after the Highlands festival for a quick and easy dinner. Not too sure that I'd go back, but it was a decent meal. The service was pretty lacking and slow. . . Sushi was good, but nothing to write home about. Prices were decent, but again, nothing special. Atmosphere is typical highlands style. Outdated, worn in, cozy sort of neighborhood feel to it. . . Without any other words to describe it I'll stick with mediocre.
