Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
update April 08:. . Ok, i was starving and there werent' many options. went to tender greens. got the chicken sandwhich again. honestly, i wouldn't touch anything else there. asked for it with no skin and with white meat and for them to make it extra well done (see previous post below about pink chicken meat).  got to my seat. opened up bun to inspect for pure white meat with no skin and fat....and what did i find......FATTY THIGH . with no skin and a few chunks of white meat!!!! I was livid. Gosh, can they get it right. I sent it back. It came back done correctly and it was delicious. However, it's too much stress and instruction to go to this place.  I give up. I have gone with friends who get the salad and they say the salads are just ok. i concur.   Oh, by the way, in the cooked chicken pan, i saw chunks of white meat for sandwhiches. and yes, I saw several pieces that still had blood in them or were pink.  Do this people understand the meaning of Samonella Poisioning????  I'm sorry Tender Greens, it's not worth it anymore. Lata.. . *****. . nice concept and interesting place. here's the deal.... 1. if you like chicken, you better make sure to tell them to throw yours back on the grill and burn it.  I have been here several times and the chicken (at least twice) was a little pink.  The last time i had to tell the manager about this and asked him to throw mine back on.  i remember reading somewhere else where someone else said the same thing about the pink chicken so watch it.. . 2. in the summer time, there are a lot of flies buzzing about and landing on the food back there. not really appetizing.. . 3. mash potatoes are the bessssssssssssstttttt!. . 4. lemonade is tart. . 5. chicken (if they actually cook it) is good but there's usually some element of fat still left on it that you have to cut off. GROSS
