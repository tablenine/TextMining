Category: Steakhouses
OH LAWRYS....You are the only generous portioned, succulent, rich, mouth-watering Â Prime Rib my allergic to meat stomach will suffer for! Why are you so amazing? If I could eat you alone I would, but your sides of creamed corn &amp; creamed spinach are like icing to my cake-and baby, you never eat cake without icing. You are such a rare treat because of how expensive you cost, I always break the bank when my hubby and I have finished paying the bill. You leave me extremely satisfied and full for days which is why I only indulge you on special occasions. You've sucked me in but I do believe you're worth it.
