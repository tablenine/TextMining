I was taken here for a fancy birthday dinner, and got to rub elbows with the Hollywood types.  This is definitely not my usual scene, but I cannot say no when there's a gun to my head.. . Our reservations were for something outrageous like 10pm, which is way too late for me on a school night.  We got there a bit early, and ordered a drink from the bar while they readied our table.  The bartender took maybe a minute too long, and gave us our first round of drinks free.  That was extremely nice of her, and completely unnecessary.  So we tipped her quite well.. . Once seated in the back room next to a bunch of B celebrities, the waiter apologized for our apparent "wait" as our table was prepared, and brought us a bunch of free appetizers.  I don't remember any of the specifics of what we ate, but it was all tasty.  Dinner was ordered in a family style-ish way, just so everyone could taste a bunch of other tiny dishes, and exchange saliva.  . . We had some wine too, and it was all tasty.  The meal took forever, and we didn't leave the restaurant until around 1am.  Way too late, I am no spring chicken.  . . I don't have anything else to add, the food was great, the service was better, and I didn't see the bill, but I bet it sucked.
