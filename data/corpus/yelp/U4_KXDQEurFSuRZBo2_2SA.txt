We came here for happy hour last week for their happy hour &amp; it's now definitely going to be on our book club happy hour rotation. Great happy hour deals 1/2 off apps - my fav are the irish nachos!. btw there is no real book club, my cousin and fellow yelper Jenn T just named it that one day &amp; it just stuck.. Happy Hour: 4 PM till 7 PM 50% off Appetizers &amp; great drink specials.
