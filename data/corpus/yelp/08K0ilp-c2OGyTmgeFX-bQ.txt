Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine

I appreciate that this place even exists, since late night food is so hard to find, but I wasn't too impressed with the quality.  Maybe I shouldn't have had a pasta, maybe I should've tried one of the Brazilian things, but I just wasn't too excited about the place.. . I liked the casual vibe, and I liked my white sangria.  My veggie lasagna came in a huge portion, but was bland and unmemorable.  If I lived in the area, I honestly probably would come here a lot just to peruse the huge menu and try to find tastier items.
