What can I say about this place?  HB is in my top 5 favorite restaurants in the city.  The atmosphere is intimate and lively at the same time - perfect for a date, to bring your parents or come with a group of friends (I've brought all of the above and they've loved it!).  . . As for the food, there a couple items on their menu that I crave on a routine basis.  The almond stuffed dates are amazing, LOVE the truffle fries, and their seasonal specials are great.  They served a rabbit stew / soup (I can't remember the name, something German) once that was so good I was practically licking my plate clean.  . . Just writing this review makes me want to go...
