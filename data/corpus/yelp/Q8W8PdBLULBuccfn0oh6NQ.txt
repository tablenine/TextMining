This is the best place to get ribs in the city. There's not much more to say. The place has a humble, nautical feel to it and it's tucked away next to the LaSalle School so you're not likely to just run into it walking down the street. Instead, you must follow the scent like a carnivore on the hunt. Then, only then, can you sink your teeth into the tastiest, juciest ribs in town. Toucan Sam say: Follow your nose!
