Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Apple Pan is so frickin good.  It's almost the as good as the 800 pounds I gain after eating a burger there.....almost.  The guys are super fast and really REALLY attentive.  They constantly refilled our soda and ketchup and even held out a napkin for me before I could reach for one!  Sadly, I must have looked like I badly needed one.  . . The burgers are amazing.  There's only two versions and they both make my fat cells beg for more.  Also, the little sno-cone cups that they put the soda in are weird, but kitschy.  I love this place.. . P.S.  Gotta get some pie too.....I really must employ a personal trainer....or at least a weight lifter to roll me out of Apple Pan after I'm done.
