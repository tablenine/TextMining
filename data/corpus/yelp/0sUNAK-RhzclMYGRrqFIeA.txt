My whole family came out for lunch here on Sunday. We arrived just bfore noon and thank goodness!  We just beat the huge crowd!  The food was excellent and so was the service.  I was craving a whole steamed fish but couldn't find it on the menu. When I asked the waiter he said they could make it even though it wasn't listed. It didn't take any longer then the rest of out orders and it was delicious!  It was steamed to perfection and had the most amazing light soy sauce with an essence of lemongrass. It was amazing.. . I can't give it 5 stats since ice only been there once but after another visit I may change my rating if it is consistently great.
