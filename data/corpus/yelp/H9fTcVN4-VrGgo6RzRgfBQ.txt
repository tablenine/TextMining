Restaurant: Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s Red Hot Stand
Category: Fast Food
Normally a health junkie, I make exceptions when it comes to Gene &amp; Jude's - can anything be better than their french fries?  Definitely not the meal to have regularly, but boy is this place a treat!  I've been coming to this hot dog stand since I was a kid.  My father is lucky enough (even still) to be able to eat whatever and whenever he wants to and not gain an ounce.  So midnight runs to Gene &amp; Jude's, living on the Northwest side of Chicago, were a regular occurence when I was a child.  I have fond memories of driving home from this place nursing a burning hot, greasy as hell bag of french fries, salted so much that you'd need a gallon drink to wash it down, and loving every minute of it!  Of course, once I hit puberty I was not lucky enough to inherit my dad's ability to gorge with gain; so these stops became more infrequent as I got more conscious about my body and boys and looking good.  And their hot dogs are delicious and very old school Chicago - no ketchup here!  It's amazing how many people will stand in line here on a hot summer night just for hot dogs!  If you are a french fry connoisseur, you must head here!
