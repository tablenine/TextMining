Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Roscoe's is good but not as good as before.  Most of the times I get #19 (chicken with rice &amp; gravy).  Their chicken liver is delicious but not really into their waffle.  I like the one in Hollywood the most but parking is a problem there.  The chicken is juice inside and crispy outside.  Add the rooster sauce and you are good to go.  I don't like their biscuit so I usually ask for corn bread instead.
