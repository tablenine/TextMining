i LOVE this place. im a huge crustacean fan so my bf and i ordered EVERYTHING. i love love love the shabang sauce. it tastes good on anything! i could have licked the bag. i recommend the crab legs and crab (kinda pricey but fresh and always worth it) with a side of fries and beeeer. . . service is great. bib is cute. wait is long. but tummy will be happy.
