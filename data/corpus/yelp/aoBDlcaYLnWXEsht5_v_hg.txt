This one, I cannot figure out...maybe someone else can?. . I'd been to this location several times before and thought it was well below the quality of what I'd had both at a couple 'burban locations and at Taste every year (I swear, it is the best I've had when at Taste, which seems odd...)  . . I was beginning to think I was crazy, but then we stopped here after a euchre game a few weeks ago, and it turns out, that again, it was definitely not as good here as at the other locations.  So I will just go to those locations and continue to finish off my Taste experience every year with a trip to the LM booth.  Still in my top three in Chicago, just won't go to the Wells location.
