Cheap, filling, tasty and delicious...the bread is crusty perfection.  I do wish they had more vegetarian options (even though I'm not a vegetarian).  I tried the bbq chicken sandwich, which was only $5 and I could hardly finish it. . . The actual restaurant is tiny (probably seats around 10 people), so its best to take your sandwich to go.
