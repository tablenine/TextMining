This was one of my favorite places when I lived in Cali.  How can you not love the beer selection! And I loved the outdoor area too on a nice cool night.  The food was awesome too, a lot more high brow than a standard pub-style place.  Gosh, I miss this place and hope they start building Yards on the East Coast!
