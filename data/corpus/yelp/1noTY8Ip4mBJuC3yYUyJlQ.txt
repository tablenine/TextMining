I came here with one of my BFFs on a whim - and I'm so glad I did.  Despite the general parking cluster $%^@ that is Los Feliz, we found a spot on a neighborhood side street and hoofed it a couple blocks to Fred's.. . After waiting a couple of minutes for a table to open up, we grabbed a booth and got down to the business of ordering dinner.  I had the Manhandler (appropriate on SOOOO many levels) and split a Chocolate Malt.. . Service was fantastic, the food was tasty, and the convenient hook ups for powering laptops or mobile phone chargers were an unexpected surprise.
