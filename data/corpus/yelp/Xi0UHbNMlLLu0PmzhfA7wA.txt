Restaurant: Sakura Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Sakura is great. Their fish is really fresh. They fly in their white fin tuna daily. The pieces of sashimi is huge too. You get your money's worth. The rolls they make are amazing too. They have all the classics. It can get a bit pricey though. Despite being a sushi restaurant, they do have a great wine selection, including Whitehall Lane Cabarnet. It's fanatastic. You should definitely try it if you can.. . The only bad things about Sakura is that they have no parking lot. It's all street parking on Centinela. It's a pain. Also, this place is TINY!!!! There's usually a line out the door during dinner rush... sometimes even lunch too. I recommend going early.. . If you're a fan of sushi like me, you should definitely try Sakura.
