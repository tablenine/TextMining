Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
No need to write a long review: this restaurant's reputation speaks for itself. Full bar, sophisticated spirits, latest top notch lounge music, well dressed 'hip' trendsetters with killer looks, real French chef... The staff is polite but doesn't try to sugar-coat anything. But they are impeccably polite and have great manners. We went there for St. Valentine's Day; got seated promptly, the food &amp; wine we got were simply fantastic. Of course, a perfect experience often carries also a signifficant price tag. Nevertheless, one of our best nights out. Merci, La Petite Porte- et a bientot!
