as cliche'd to death as it may be, thin is in, esp at Crust on Division.  i'm talking about the pizza variety though (or flatbread as it were) and Crust knows exactly how to do it right.  The perfect balance of crispy &amp; chewey crust (go figure) as they had better get that right due to their namesake.  The flatbreads come straight out of their wood burning oven which gives it a unique flavor that simply can't be matched in a regular oven.  we've been a few times and can comment on the following: Caesar is fantastic, a must to get you started.  Similarly, the Buffalo Mozzarella w peppers, pine nuts and vinaigrett is quite good.  for flatbreads i'd recommend the following: The Basilico, The Italian Boar (yep!) Sausage and the The Flammkuchen. so far, the only 3 we've tried but i'm inclined to think i'd give all their flatbreads a huge thumbs up.. . ok, so what about all this organic malark?  well, again, it's the trendy, predictable thing to do and say these days, and although i'm all for doing our individual part to save our ill-fated planet (and ourselves by the food we eat), didn't come here for that reason in anyway whatsoever.  I must say, though, that I think they might be on to something b/c this sort of organic goody-ness is beyond belief.  . . Bottom line, If your like an E Coast/New Haven style pizza, this is an absolute MUST try.
