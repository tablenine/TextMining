Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
People line up for anal bleaching in Los Angeles (okay, maybe in Reseda), so it should come as no surprise to anyone that they also line up for your standard, pork by-product.  Mmmm... advanced meat recovery!. . The fact is - if there is a line - there is 'buzz.'  If there is 'buzz', there will be a mile long train of sycophants willing to endure whatever soul-crushing punishment they have to endure for even the most paltry and fleeting reward (see: Reality T.V.). . If you wanna wait an hour for a hot dog, by all means, have at it.  Maybe some genius television executive will one day combine these two, not-dissimilar activities and make waiting in line at Pink's a Reality Show.  . . "The Line" - Coming this Spring to FOX Primetime...
