The only good thing about rainy days are $1 pints at Park Tavern! I've noticed some ppl hating on their dollar pints, but seriously, most places that do $1 beer do Natty Light, PBR, Bud Light, etc. I love that their dollar pints are brewed right there and they all taste way better than Natty Light.. . Also, 1/2 off sushi from 10pm-midnight is awesome. They have great sushi-- really awesome combinations of flavors. This is definitely a regularly visited spot for my friends and me.. . The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because once when we went, our server said the kitchen was closed at 11pm... She clearly just didn't want us staying much longer, probably because she wasn't closing and wanted to get out of there asap. However, she should have just given our table to another server instead of lying to us about the kitchen being closed and being rude to us. So that's why only 4 stars.. . Oh, and they have games!!!!! Last time we were there we played Apples to Apples and mini foosball. Yes!!
