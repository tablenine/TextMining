I saw this on the Food Network on Guy Fiero's Diner and Drive-ins. The episode was on the pulled pork sandwich. I had to try it. When I got there, the line was out the door and we waited about 35 minutes before even ordering. But while in line, the Â staff passed out menus so you know exactly what to order once you get to the front of the line. Of course after catching the show, I had to order the pork sandwich. It was good but it had a strong vinegar base and it was kinda hard to eat because it fell apart easily. But the Belgian fries were perfect and the garlic aioli were one of the best fries that I have ever had! . Great atmosphere being surrounded by happily eating people. The service was great as well.. Will definitely come back to try their pastrami sandwich which was also featured on the show. Only tip is not to go here too starved because there is a wait and the smell will drive you crazy
