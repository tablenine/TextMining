Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
We had a great time at Ugo.  We picked a perfect time to stop by ... just 10 minutes after opening (approx. 5:40pm on a Sunday), the place was all ours for awhile.  Happy Hour and complimentary snacks were at the bar.  Service was great ... I had a mishap at one of the spouts, and the server came right up and hooked me up with another taste for free, because she said that was their best white!. . We enjoyed all of the whites, and the Italian selection was nice.  I found myself doubling up on a few on my second round, because the tasting selection was ever so slightly lacking. . . Overall, we enjoyed the pay-as-you go concept and we can't wait to return!
