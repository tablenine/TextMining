Restaurant: Crustacean
Category: Vietnamese
My wife and I have always been huge fans/proponents of Crustacean.  Even had my birthday party their this year.  The food is fantastic!. . I had some of the worst service I have had in my life their this past weekend.  We were excited to introduce some good friends to the restaurant who had never been.  We were seated 25 minutes late and they put the four of us on a table in the corner that looked like it was made for two.  We asked to be seated and the hostess said "nothing avaiable".  I then asked the manager and got the proverbial "we will try" and never to be heard from again.  Then nobody came by for at least 15-20 minutes.  Someone finally came by to fill up the waters, etc..  We eventually ordered, mind you after the people that sat down after us seated right next to us had already began eating.  We still didn't have our food over an hour after ordering.  So we left (2 hours after our reservation time) hungry and without food.  . . Pretty sad experience for us, because we love the food.  Never have wrtiten a review for a restaurant, but felt compelled this time.
