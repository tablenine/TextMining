Only 496 reviews? Pfffffft.. . I'm not a big fan of crabs. They itch.. . I'm not a fan of crawfish either . There's nothing less satisfying than a big shell surrounding miniscule pieces of meat. . . The shrimp was not exactly the best (despite the "shebang sauce"), but it was better. Not sure if it was worth the stinky fingers either. If my fingers are going to stink, it better be a good f*cking reason...literally.. . The fried catfish, however, is so succulent and tender, I almost buttered myself. But I decided to butter up my sweet potato fries instead. And it was pretty damn tasty. Stinky fingers not necessary.
