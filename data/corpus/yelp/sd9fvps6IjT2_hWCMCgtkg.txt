Maybe I'm cheating, since - honestly - I got a sandwich delivered to my office. (I promise I will update when I can actually get my toosh over ther!). . I got a hot classic, and an iced viet coffee.. (Also ordered online I might add - and requested a change via email - silly me checked hot coffee... got a call immediately sayin' they can make it ice, and a good.. i don't know.. 10 mins? later. my sandwich and my perfect iced viet coffee arrived.). . The bread, was crisp at initial bite, but just the amount of squisssssh the filling, was yum yum, and yes the pork was minced and marinated hot, like i ordered - with crisp veggies, fresh fresh fresh. yum. $5? seriously, a good portion-sized sandwich, fast delivery (altho i did order after 2) and it was yum yum yum.. . new favorite - i have yet to find a decent viet sandwich in nyc. so this will more than suffice for now :)
