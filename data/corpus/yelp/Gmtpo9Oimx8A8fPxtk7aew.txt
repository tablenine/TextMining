Yummy :) this place is like a diamond in the rough...or an undigested corn kernel located in your shit...because lets be honest this area is kind of a shithole...one redeeming quality? PORTO'S POTATO balls lol.. so good..get the chicken ball thingys too...its right next to the potato balls..i don't remember what they're called...and their fruit tart is bomb...so are their cakes and delicious pastry which are all pieces of artwork that you can eat...:) . the gluttonous pig i am i got a whole array of stuff..i didn't want to miss anything delicious! lol...so if you're ever in the area...( meaning you were passing burbank on the freeway or going to IKEA) you should drive a little bit further and experience the deliciousness of this place...:) POTATO BALL yummy...wish i could get some chipotle sauce or a spicy cheese sauce to dip them in...that would be sooo good...AHH! i'm a genious...lol that sounds soo good...
