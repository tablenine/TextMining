cleo's is a nice place to hang out for a few drinks and good bar food. it's cool that they have cheap wings on mondays, but it seems like the rest of their menu is a little on the expensive side (the salad i had was tasty, but close to ten bucks!).. . if you like to go out late on weekends, you should make it here when they have the free buffet. sure, the food's not amazing or anything, but it beats peanuts (like many bars even do that anymore...) when you're drinking. like any night when they have really cheap or free food, good luck getting a table.. . the bar staff was friendly enough, and eager to get refills.
