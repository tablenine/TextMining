A friend told me about this place... he is a pizza snob.  He said, Hands down it is the best pizza in Atlanta.  I don't really live near by, but I decided to try it as I was having some friends over for the Braves game tonight.  All I can say is WOW, what great pie.  Everyone loved it!  I lived in Philly for 10 years and never thought I would get really good pizza again.   We got the Diavola and it was spicy goodness!. . The people inside were really nice and attentive.  I will be frequenting this place from now on.  The thought of getting another pie from Mellow or Fellini's is depressing.  Yes, it is that good.. . I just remebered what this place reminded me of and it's the pizza version of the crawfish shack!. . If you like pizza, run to this place.
