This was probably one of the best places for french onion soup I have ever had.  Unfortunately, it filled me up so much that I had to cancel the salmon.   . . I was traveling for business and decided to avoid the chains.  I am glad I did.  The bartenders were great and I learned that most of them have been there more than 10 years!  I also learned that Mario Andretti was sitting at table six.  If you are traveling, or just looking for a solid meal to make you smile I would highly recommend Bone's.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because I didnt make it to dinner!
