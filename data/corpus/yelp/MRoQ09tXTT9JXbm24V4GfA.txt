Category: Sandwiches
the french dip sandwiches here are good but nothing to write home about.  the thin sliced beef is generously packed in wet  buns dipped in beef juice...which may not be for all taste.  The cole slaw is excellent, cold and crisp like KFC's.  i went there because i saw it on Huell Howser's PBS show but probably would not go back.  I prefer the the Philly cheesestake with dry buns and yummy cheese  (the Grove old farmer's market has the BEST!)     p.s. do not park on street next to the shop or you'll get towed!  use the parking lot across the street.
