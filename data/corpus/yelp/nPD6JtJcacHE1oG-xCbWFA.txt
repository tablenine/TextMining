pasadena is the young yuppies scene....young fabulous people hang....it's cool and all...but little too snobby for me...but hey..if you have your own people to chill with...yardhouse has great beer selection and good food....if you feel like beer isn't your thing..just walk over to the bodega wine bar...this mall gets pretty crowded in the weekend nights
