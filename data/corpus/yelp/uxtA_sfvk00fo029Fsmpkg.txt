Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Been to Flo at least ten times by this point... and it never fails.  The later you go, the longer the wait, but usually it's worth it.. . The food won't knock your socks off, but it hits the spot.  Both the TexMex/Mexican and traditional American breakfast [hi pancakes] items are prepared well.  While I'm sure there are better Mexican type breakfast options out there in this city, Flo's doesn't disappoint and is easy (i.e. fear not white people! The place is filled with other white people!). . However, while I don't believe that Flo claims to feel and be authentic, let me be clear, it's not authentic in your typical, Pilsen or Little Village type way.  So while I like Flo and recommend Flo, there isn't much of an edge to the place.
