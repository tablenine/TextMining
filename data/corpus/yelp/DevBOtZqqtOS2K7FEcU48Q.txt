it was crowded and when i wait for food i want to be flipping cartwheels off the table when i get it. it didn't even inspire me to golf clap . the soup was lukewarm and pork broth should not be lukewarm. the egg was undercooked the gyoza was mushy and leaky. i squirted my friend when i bit into it. the flavors were tepid and the presentation was like diarrhea in a bowl. it just made me regret battling through downtown to get to lil tokyo. i could have just stayed home and made my bad version of sapporo ichiban ramen. i will give that the service was impeccable. i was never without ginger or water. my tongue just had a much better time at orochon and hanaichimonme
