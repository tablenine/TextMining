Limited menu with almost all of the meaty sandwiches you would want.  They also have a decent beer and wine selection which would have gone nice with the meal but we had a lot of things we wanted to get done and after one beer, all inspiration is usually lost.... . As usual, we didn't want to commit to just one sandwich so we split the Pastrami and Pulled Pork Sandwiches.  The Pulled Pork  was pretty good, it lacked a little flavor but was juicy and not light on the meat.  The pulled pork wasn't actually pulled but ground, I've never had a ground pork sandwich but surprisingly it wasn't dry.  When paired with their red cabbage slaw and southern style bbq sauce, which had a vinegar base, the sandwich jumped a few stars.  The pastrami sandwich was smokey and peppery with minimal fat.  The meat was still juicy and was perfect when paired with the Oinkster mustard.  This sandwich was our favorite, it even got us going on a discussion of the variety of procured meats since Oinkster actually cures and smokes their pastrami giving it a much better flavor than the other pastrami found in most places.. . We also got the fries which lacked a little seasoning but were perfectly fried to a nice crisp that didn't get soggy after 10 minutes.  They stayed a perfect crisp throughout our entire meal.. . I was dying to have one of their milkshakes, they were offering a pumpkin one at the time but I resisted since I didn't think I was going to fit in a workout.  I'll just have to go back!
