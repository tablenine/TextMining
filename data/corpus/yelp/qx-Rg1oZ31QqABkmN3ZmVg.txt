We have a winner! . . I've been searching manically day and night, for a place to hang my hat after a long day nowhere near an office and I found it! . . (Birds sing, clouds part, sunlight streams all over my face!). . Dark............................... Check. Friendly Staff................ Check. Great food..................... Check. Affordable.......................Check. Great drinks...................Check. Specials.........................Check. . I walked through the door and Gilbert... THE GILBERT actually greeted me, and that's "Greet" with a capitol "G"! . . He chatted me up, told me all about the neighborhood, and then hit me with some amazing specials! . . (Personally, that's how I'd run a place so I love it!). . Thursdays they have a wine tasting that's a total steal!. . You get three half glasses of hand picked wines, and whichever you like the the most, you'll get a full glass of! . This all comes with a rather substantial cheese plate, all for 19 bucks! . . Then a belly dancer came out! . . But wait! There's more! . . Fridays they have a DJ! (for a small place, I love it!). Saturdays they have a 11am to 4pm brunch! After dinner more DJ!. Sundays another brunch, and then at 6pm Karaoke.. Mondays (this is the big one!) Half Priced Entrees starting at 5pm! Â . Tuesdays Wii 10pm to 2:30. Wednesdays another Karaoke night! . . ... but I think Thursdays are going to be my favorite!. . (I'm so excited that I found a new spot that I almost forgot to tell you how comfortable the surroundings were! Laid back, but still nice! Mediterranean lamps with soft red lights... as my friend said... "sets the mood"!). . Can't wait to go back!. . erk... did you see that whole "streams all over your face" thing I wrote a second ago? That was a little weird wasn't it?. . Did it make you feel dirty? . . Weirdo.
