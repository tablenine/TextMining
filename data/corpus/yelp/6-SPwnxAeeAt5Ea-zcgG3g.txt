Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Over-rated and over-priced. I have definitely had better, and for much less. Â The dumplings and xiao long bao were ok, and we ordered a dish of fried rice and it was one dinky bowl placed upside down on a plate. Not satisfied and not willing to pay another $1 per dumpling, we finished and headed next door to Phoenix and had a real dinner. I often see crowds in front of this place and want to tell them it's not worth the wait, it doesn't live up to the hype.
