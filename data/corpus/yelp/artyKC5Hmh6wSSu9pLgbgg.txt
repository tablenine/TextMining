Yet another in a long line of disappointments in trying to find any actually good ramen anywhere in America.. . I'd seen this place about a year ago when visiting a friend in LA and decided to try it on my way from Temecula back to SF in the hopes that it would actually be good.. . What can I say? Terrible noodles, bland soup. Sorry, but this is not good ramen by any standard of ramen.. . I got to thinking, maybe one reason American ramen sucks is because they don't put MSG in it. I know there is a stigma against MSG in America. All I can say is "suck it!" Â Japanese live longer than pretty much any other 1st world country and all of them eat MSG every day!. . But, even if they put MSG in the soup so it wasn't so damn bland, though I doubt that's the missing ingredient, the noodles were still made from freeze dried noodles instead of fresh ones. Meh!
