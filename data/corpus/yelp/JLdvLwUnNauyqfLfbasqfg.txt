Restaurant: Noni&#39;s Bar &amp; Deli
Category: Italian
This is one of our favorite neighborhood spots! Whether you're in Poncey-Highlands, Old Fourth Ward, Inman Park or Edgewood/Downtown Noni's is a quick hop, skip &amp; jump. For those of us in the food &amp; beverage intdustry it's the perfect place for great food &amp; great drinks in an unpretentious, but interesting atmosphere. Matt is probably one of the most personable restaurant owners in Atlanta and pours his heart into those delicious meatballs and hand-made pastas. . Being creatures of habit, we order the meatballs everytime we're there, but the bolognese sauce on home-made tagliatelle is outstanding. The Risotto of the day is not to be missed...The antipasti (salads/veggies) are great! Even my veggie friends from New York enjoyed greatly! Go hungry...
