If you love magic, this is the place for you!  For a while, I was obsessed with this place... went there 5 times in a span of 2 months.  I just couldn't get enough!  I even had my birthday here.. . The food, I must say, is WAY overpriced so if you can skip the dinner, you're better off.. . The shows... I can't tell you that they're all good.  You can probably fit about 5 shows in an evening and each week, they have different magicians (some better than others) so it's hard to say if they're good or not.  For the most part, they're absolutely fantastic (like when Gazzo was there, my goodness!).  But then there was that one guy who did balloon animals... wtf?!  I mean, yeah it's cool and maybe nobody else can do them like you can but this isn't magic!  I wanted my time back!. . Also, I would, for the most part, skip the big stage performances... they're usually really cheesy.  The best ones are in the parlours and done in small groups.  Once you see all the scheduled performances, you can go down to the little hidden areas where magicians will hang out and do some tricks for you... those are usually the coolest!. . The place itself is pretty cool.  I wish it was a little bigger and had more "hidden" areas but still, it's fun to roam around.  Oh, go to the piano bar to meet their resident ghost pianist Irma.  Bring some dollar bills to offer her ghost bird and request a song... Irma wiill gladly play it!  We even got her to play Outkast's "Heya"!. . It really is a magical evening when you visit the Magic Castle!
