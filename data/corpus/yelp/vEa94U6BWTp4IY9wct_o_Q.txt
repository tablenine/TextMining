Sadness...the much-loved calamari is no longer on the menu. Says the bartender, "We have a new chef who's changed up the menu a bit, hopefully for the better." . . The "Sixes Ale" specially brewed for Concentrics is nice, similar to a brown ale like Newcastle. I had a couple of these while waiting for co-workers to arrive for dinner during a rain storm in rush hour. When they arrived and we migrated to our table, I must've read the menu over a half-dozen times, searching for sometting that would jump off the page at me. Nothing did.. . I did discover that the calamari isn't completely gone, however. Their fritto misto appetizer has some calamari along with other breaded and deepfried bits (onions, olives ((yes, deepfried olives)), thinly sliced lemons, etc.).. . I settled for the cheese burger. Meh! The bun was a bit dry, the burger didn't have a lot of flavor, but the fries were good. At $10, it's one of the least expensive items on the menu though (hopefully the boss will appreciate that on the expense report).
