Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
One Saturday morning, we got this great idea to drive up to the famous Pink's Hot Dogs for breakfast. I'd never been there before and the idea of trying it for the first time really excited me. I'd heard so many stories and watched more than a dozen food shows featuring this little hot dog stand in LA that attracts everyone from the rich and famous to the hobo down the street. We arrived promptly at 9:29am, right before Pink's opened at 9:30 and were the first ones to order. My mouth watered as I said the words, "Chili Cheese Fries...and...Chili Cheese Dog WITH BACON...onion rings on the side". . . I watched as they created my tasty meal and could already feel the grease in my arteries. 5 minutes later, a tray loaded with everything I wanted was presented before me.. . I took the first bite and all the stories I'd heard came true! Pink's hot dogs lived up to the hype! I devoured half of my chili dog and fries before finally feeling sick to my stomach, but it was still worth it.
