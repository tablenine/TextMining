160 blue has got it down! What an amazing culinary experience! . . Last night my mom was in town and we were trying to decide on where to go to dinner. . . My first choice was The Publican, after hearing about this new venture I was super excited to try it out. When we got there, we realized that the noise factor was going to annoy the hell out of my mother and decided to dine elsewhere. No hard feelings, I will be back some other time to see what the fuss is all about. . . My second try was at De Cero, I love their duck nachos, they are to DIE FOR and it was relatively close by! When we arrived we were informed that there was an hour wait... Not gonna do it, no matter how amazing the duck nachos are.. . So after 2 failed attempts at a Friday night restaurant my boyfriend suggested 160 blue. His friend used to work there and he had nothing but positive things to say. Since I had never been there, I was game.. . My first impression was that the decor and ambiance was very elegant, tasteful and up scale. They have an extensive wine list, which was a bit overwhelming and VERY pricey. . . The service was spectacular, the menu was simple yet caters to all tastes and again, pricey. . . When we received our first course we quickly realized how small yet tasty their portions were. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the Hamachi Carpacio wasn't the best I've had.... . The entrees soon followed and were pretty amazing. The Crab ravioli was fantastic as was the pork tenderloin. Yet my favorite item was the side of Pomme Frites. Addictive and extremely well made.. . Overall, we had great service, great food and wonderful wine, however I think the price points were a bit over the top.
