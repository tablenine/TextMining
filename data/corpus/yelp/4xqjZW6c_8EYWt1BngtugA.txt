Its funny that they say 'dressy' attire when the paint on the side of the building is fadding and the age of the restaurant is revealing itself.  I'm sure it looks better at night. (In the right lighting, we are all gorgeous.) Considering its zip code, you'd figure they could afford a little upkeep. The interior was a slight improvment since it had a clean comtemporary design with Asian motifs. Scrolls ran along the wall and there were bed-like cherrywood benches with Asian silk cushions. The most impressive feature was the little stream that ran through the restaurant under a glass floor. It made me feel like I was walking on water. . . The food was quite good and I'll say it- Overpriced. I ordered the Pasta de mer,  the famed garlic noodles topped with lobster, rock shrimp and mussels in a lobster reduction sauce.  My friend got the jumbo prawns which were in fact 'jumbo' with a fresh sweetness. Filling and very good but not worth the price.  . . The service was very good when our server actally came around. She was very sweet and knowledgeable but had us waiting several times. . . Overall, blah. Food was good. Restaurant was pretty. Service was slow. I can now say that I had the Crustacean experience and I won't be on that trip anytime soon.
