Quality food and drinks. . Might not be the best idea to come on weekends. Good luck trying find a table if you are in a big group. I'm not sure why they revel in chaos...if they can hire two people to check IDs, they could hire people to arrange seating. . . They do, however, have amazing garlic shoe-string fries and a wide selection of beers. . Parking wasn't too much of a hassle, and that's always a plus in LA.
