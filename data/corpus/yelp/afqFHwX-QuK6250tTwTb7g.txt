Restaurant: RuSan&#39;s
Category: Japanese
RuSan's is the ideal place for a celebration. One advantage is the colorful menu, which is likely to satisfy a variety of tastes. The food is appetizing, but it's certainly not the best Asian cuisine in Atlanta. I must admit what draws me to RuSan's is the atmosphere. The staff is very friendly --- someone often comes out to greet large parties upon that first round of sake bombs. Your waiter might even participate in the infamous chant: sake, sake, sake, BOMB! It's fun for a group birthday or going away party. Overall I would rate RuSan's as a three for the food, and a five for the ambiance. Where else can you and ten plus friends chant and pound the table without getting kicked out?
