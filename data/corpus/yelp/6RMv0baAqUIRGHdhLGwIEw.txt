Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
I've ordered delivery from Duckwalk numerous times. The food is decent, nothing to rave about, nothing to complain about. Tonight, however, the guy who delivered my food decided to bitch at me because he felt I didn't give him a big enough tip. I gave him $4.50 on a $12.50 meal. Yeah, let's just say that I will never order from them ever again. There's plenty of other equally decent Thai restaurants that deliver, politely.
