Really, really underwhelming and not very good.. . Everything was overly, unappetizingly sweet: my app had a salad on the side that tasted like it had a dressing of pure corn syrup, and the sauce on the tuna was also too sweet. Â My entree was the salmon: very dry and under-seasoned, and with another sickeningly sweet sauce!. . The only reason I didn't give it one star was because my boyfriend's steak was actually good.. . Please stop charging these prices for such mediocre food!
