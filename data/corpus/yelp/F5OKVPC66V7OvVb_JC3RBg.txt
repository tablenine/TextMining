Restaurant: Pizzeria Uno

I was in the Chi about 3 years ago and read in a magazine that to experience a good ol' Chicago style pizza, you have to go to Pizzeria Uno. So I did.. . If you decide to come here be careful of one thing. TIMING! Make sure you come at a time where there won't be a huge crowd. We came at dinner time and had to wait almost an hour. Praise the Lord for outside heaters, because it was early April in Chicago and it was still chilly!. . So after waiting all that time we finally got seated and ordered. The pizza was okay. I don't know if it was the wait that curbed my hunger or that massive pizza I got, but I was full after one slice. It was definitely a pizza pie!! The crust was really thick and can I say deep dish? I've never seen a pizza fit so many toppings on it. It seemed like the pizza was better looking that it actually was.. . All in all, it was alright. I guess I was expecting something a little more spectacular. Maybe I'm just used to the pizzas in Cali.
