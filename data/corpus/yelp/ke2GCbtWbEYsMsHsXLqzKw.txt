Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
For some of my friends, this place is a hit or miss.  They're biggest sell is the challenge to eat their special 2 in 30 minutes and you'll get your picture on their wall of fame.  . . For me is one of the best ramen in town even compared to the yellow awning restaurant on the other street nearby.  I usually get the soy sauce based ramen and not too spicy tho i'm asian.  I like to enjoy tasting my  food while I eat it.. not having numb tastebuds and pooping fire afterwards.  They also have an amazing spicy fried rice that compliments the ramen very well.  . . Sometimes, however the service can be spotty.  It seems when they are out of control busy, the servers get a little testy which is annoying.   Also, sometimes they forget to put in an order then when you ask for it even if you don't want it any more they put it in anyway and then you're stuck.  . . Overall, I still keep coming back to this place for ramen despite trying many other places.  Its likely a taste preference and this place is good enough for me.
