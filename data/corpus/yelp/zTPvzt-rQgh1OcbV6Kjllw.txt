This place is great for a late night dessert. I've never ordered their food, so I can't say anything about that, but their desserts are yummy! The blue velvet cake was good, although I got a very blue "surprise" the next day. They had a sign that said they had lychee ice cream sandwiches, but they were out, so that was disappointing. I will go back to try it out though. My boyfriend had the cherry float and he liked it. Their homemade ice cream bars were delicious too. The only thing that sucked was their parking and seating. Not much of either.
