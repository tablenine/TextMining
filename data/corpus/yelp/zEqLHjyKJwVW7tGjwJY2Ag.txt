Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Friends were raving about this place before I stepped foot in it, so I went in with high expectations. I think Toro is one of the better sushi restaurants in the city. I generally stick with simple maki rolls and nigiri when I eat at sushi restaurants - the specialty rolls with mayo and other weird ingredients aren't my thing. Plus, the simpler the roll, the better you can enjoy the fish in its fullest, unadulterated flavor. I was pleased at how fresh the fish was. If you are a fan of udon, you must try the seafood udon noodles! The bento boxes are pretty average - my suggestion to you is to stick with the sushi or noodles here to really enjoy the restaurant's strong suits.. . The staff is always friendly, and I've never had problems with service. The only thing is that the restaurant is small, and fills up quickly, so choose when you go wisely. Otherwise you'll be waiting in a line for a long time.
