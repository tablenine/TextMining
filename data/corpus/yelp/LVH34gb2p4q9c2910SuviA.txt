Pricey for what you get (including decor and service).  Reservations recommended. Would have given 3.5 stars on the food alone. However, the service and value brings the overall rating down to 2 stars. Would only come here if I'm going to be in the area and for a couple of small plate items.. . $16 pizza on thin burnt crust (2 stars).  When we mentioned it to the manager, we were told that we need to request for the crust to not get burned and they will have the pizza maker watch the pizza.  First time ever hearing that. You can request the half/half which means you can order 2 types of pizza. Despite the burnt crust, the pizza itself was flavorful but not worth $16. . . $9 Burrata and grape tomatoes:  Delicious burrata (4.5 stars).. . $9 Portebello fries: Delicious with the dip (4 stars).. . $9 Roasted beets w/ goat cheese: Portion too  small compared to most places at that price (3 stars).. . $7 Tomatoe bruschetta: No complaints but not praises either (3 stars). . . $25 King salmon in parchment paper: Wasn't impressed and the salmon tasted mediocre.  Again, not worth the price (2 stars).. . Valet Parking: $6
