I love coming here for a weekend lunch. This place gets so freaking packed that you have to come early. It opens at 10:30 on the weekend. Get there at 10:20 and start waiting in line if you want to have a shot at getting seated in the first round. For weekend lunch, you can get the mini dumplings - 20 to a basket instead of the usual 10. They are super small and super cute! They sell out a quarter way through the morning.. . There's 3 things I always get; the rest I leave up to my friends. In order of my favorites...1. original pork dumplings, 2. Shanghai rice cake, 3. shrimp fried rice.. . Go across the plaza to J&amp;J Bakery for dessert.. . Parking lot.
