I came for DineLA friday night. It was totally crowded, I didn't make reservations, and ended up sitting at the bar. It was 9pm. But the food was worth it! I ordered the mac n cheese, braised short ribs with parpadelle pasta, and chocolate brioche bread pudding. . The mac n cheese came out pipping hot. It was good and i love that it was shell pasta. Then it took them forever to bring out the main course. The bartender was really nice and went to check on my food like twice. The braised short rib with parpadelle pasta was good, but it wasn't mind-blowing. The short ribs were tender and I didn't need a knife at all. I can taste some of the wine that it was braised in. The pasta was cooked al dente, but it could've been cooked a bit longer. The dessert was AMAZING!! THE BEST part of my meal. I heard that they were out of the bread pudding while I was waiting for my main course, but the chef came out to the bartender and told her that he can save one for her (for me). The chocolate (melted+pieces) were soo good on the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream/gelato. . I've tried their other location in the Palisades, and their chocolate brioche bread pudding was NOTHING compared to the Melrose location. I got like 3 broken up pieces at the Palisades. On Melrose, they gave me this huge slice. I will definitely go back to this place, maybe try their happy hour specials and more dessert!
