Restaurant: Pure Taqueria - Inman Park
Category: Mexican
I went to Pure one week after it's private opening and the place was packed. It was lively and the hostesses and bar staff were attentive. Salsa was refreshed and new drinks appeared with no delay.. . My issue was with the noise level. It was so loud I had trouble hearing my friend at the bar stool next to me and it just got worse once we sat down at our table. We were at the restaurant on a Tuesday night around 7:30 and the music was cranked up to late night Saturday levels. Totally ridiculous. When our party got tired of having to scream across the table at each other, and took a quiet moment, we were assaulted by loud cheesy pop/techno or the overly loud conversations of the diners around us. . . Ok enough about the overly voluminous ambience. The tacos just aren't up to par. My friend had tried the fish tacos at the private opening and liked them but this time she ordered the chicken tacos and I ordered the carne asada tacos. It was just dry meat in a soft tortilla. No toppings. Just meat in a shell with a tiny bowl of sauce on the side. The winner at the table was the Torte Cubano sandwich. So freakin' delicious I stole half of my husband's. . . To sum up, service was great, the noise level Â was off the charts unpleasant, the tacos were three times the prices of Taqueria del Sol and not as good. The menu does have plenty of variety to explore but I will have to pop a soothing throat lozenge before daring another dinner there.
