Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Absolutely delicious. . . My friend took me here as a bribe to help her with a project in Burbank, and it worked. The food is amazingly good. . . The mash potato balls and the meat strudels are the best.  I can't decide which one is better, but I think I'm leaning towards the meat strudels because they are a tad bit lighter, so I can eat more of them in one sitting!  We also had the tuna melt, the steak sandwiches, and of course, the addicting banana chips. . . Next time I'm in Burbank, definitely hitting up Porto's Bakery again.
