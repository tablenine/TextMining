Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Awesome food but a word of warning....if you are planning on eating here on Tuesdays call ahead because yelp is helping to pack people in for Tuesday's $8.99 dinner.. . We almost left but a few friendly strangers said "stay it is worth the wait".  They were correct, very good food, good service for how busy they were, and $8.99 was a bonus (I didn't even realize we stopped by on Tuesday night).. . I still have to get used to BYOB at nice restaurants.  This place is BYOB and it seemed everyone had a bottle with them.  There is a liquor store on the corner but we decided not to bother because we did not want to loose our place in line.. . Highly recommended, and close to where I live!. I will definitely eat there again and there normal prices are reasonable given the quality of the food.
