Category: Italian
I went twice in one weekend-that's how amazing &amp; authentic this spot is! great for a family, or even a date.. just a bit loud, but a lot of fun. the servers are nice, love the bartender lady &amp; again the food is outstanding. this places oozes butter, wine, vinegar, olive oil, and lemon-yumm.. love the veal in white wine &amp; the shrimp &amp; scallops over angel hair. VERY inexpensive!! I'm from Brooklyn so my family had been looking for good Italian food for a minute. thanks to recommendations, we finally found it! make sure to reserve your table too
