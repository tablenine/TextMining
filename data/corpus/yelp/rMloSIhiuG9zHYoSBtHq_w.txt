This place is an amazing idea... gourmet fast food.  There needs to be more places like this.  Everything is always fresh and yummy.  Their steak and chicken are both really tender and well seasoned but not a huge fan of their fish.  They have fantastic mashed potatoes and soups. . . Some good advise, always get the daily specials...their are always amazing!  . . The prices are reasonable and there are many parking structures around the restaurant that are free for the first 2 hours.
