My favorite hot dog joint. I like the chargrilled dogs. I started going there when I was a teenager and had only been during the day until I was 25. Then I got the surprise of my life while there late at night when I saw my friend get belittled by the woman behind the counter for not knowing what he wanted to eat. It was great. I know a lot of people don't like their cheese fries, but I love them.
