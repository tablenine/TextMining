Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
In an effort to be a better Yelper, I'm going to start contributing instead of solely mooching.  But Father's Office already has overwhelming positive reviews, so I might as well jump on the bandwagon.. . Food is great.  I took a friend here from out of town last Saturday, advertising it as the best burger in town.  He agreed (though what does he know, really?).. . Beer selection is also good, although I always have a hard time reading those damn handles.  I usually ask the bartender to pick something for me, and I've never been disappointed.. . My big bone to pick is with the seating.  For a bar that's known for food and has a tremendous amount of table space, I'm not a fan of their "it's not our problem" attitude toward sitting down.  I'd rather know the wait going in than have to spend 45 minutes patrolling for a table.  Not fun.  Minus one star, Father's Office.  Otherwise, you're okay by me.
