I'm sadly disappointed by Milk, which kills me to admit.. . I thought the marriage of ice cream and macaron, my favorite dessert, would be amazing. The first time I ever encountered it was the Grasshopper at Umami Burger (mint chocolate chip ice cream dipped in chocolate). I felt it was a bit stale, but it was also the end of the day, and I thought maybe the transport somehow affected the taste.. . Then recently, we decided to go to the actual location for dessert after Umami Burger.. . Sadly disappointing. For $4.50, I would've expected more. The macaron was stale and chewy, which is understandable since it has to hold its shape to contain the ice cream. On top of that, the little ice cream bites are $1 (they look like Nestle dibs...and about the same size, too). I found this grossly overpriced.. . If I'm craving this dessert again, I'd just order it at Umami. Or rather. Give me Diddy Reese or a Costco ice cream sandwich anyday.
