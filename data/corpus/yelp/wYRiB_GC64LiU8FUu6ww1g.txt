Oh my goodness, this place was a treat!  Besides the having to reserve a month early, I cannot complain one bit.  The dining room was small, but that's the way I liked it.  We got the attention we deserved without being too crowded.  . . I came here with a bunch of friends and tried so many things.  Nothing by any means was just good- everything great.  But the mushroom pizza and buratta pizza were simply amazing.  The aroma of the mushroom pizza was so great.  The dough was chewy crust and had the perfect texture.  . . All in all, this place was great.  I highly recommend it for any occasion- weather its going out for a celebration or just to try this place. . . And don't forget to try the olive oil gelato.  I know, it sounds weird, but I couldn't stop thinking about how amazing it was!
