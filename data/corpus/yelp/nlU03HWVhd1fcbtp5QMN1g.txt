This is my FAVORITE shabu shabu place. Nothing else tops this! Validation is only for 1.5 hours, so parking is free!. . I don't know why their meat is SO TASY, but it's DELICIOUS! There is usually a long line to get in here, so put your name on the waiting list and just browse around the shops at lil tokyo. Their sauces are also very delicious.. . A large portion of meat, including tax and tip is around $20 a person. Service is attentive. You can order un-limited rice and veggies to go with your delicious meat!. . The room is small and always filled with people. If you're looking to eat good food, come here! Minus 1 star because it's inconvenient to drive here and to wait for the food. Also, if you want to come here with groups, it's not ideal. If you're looking for a nice ambiance, don't come here. Just come here for good food :)
