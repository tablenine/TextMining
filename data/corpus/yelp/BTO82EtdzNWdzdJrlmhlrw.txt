SOOOO YUM!  So old school and soooo inexpensive!   We went there on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed!  But it always is.  The line goes fast though be/ca the people working are so efficient!  I got a turkey dip, a side of coleslaw and potato salad and a miller lite - all for $11.52!   The Turkey was so moist.  The coleslaw and potato salad tasted EXACTLY the way they are supposed to.  Coleslaw is sweet and the potato salad had bits of  celery in it.   It's so casual with saw dust on the ground and seat yourself vibe that is such a throw back to days long past.  A great LA meal.  I love this place!
