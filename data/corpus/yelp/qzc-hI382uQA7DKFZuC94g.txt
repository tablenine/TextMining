Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I absolutely love this restaurant for several reasons.  . . While waiting for your table, you can eat complimentary Swedish meatballs and homemade potato chips.  The service is very hospitable and the food is just wonderful.. . The prime rib is amazing and you are served with salad, Yorkshire pudding and mashed potato.  This is unlike many other steakhouses where you have to pay for each side item.   . . Also, I highly recommend that you join the VIP membership because you are mailed random gift certificates bonuses, Lawrys salt &amp; pepper.  Also, you are often emailed about specials that the restaurant may have but will not advertise to patrons at the restaurant.
