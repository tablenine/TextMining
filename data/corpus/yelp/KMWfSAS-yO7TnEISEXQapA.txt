Very good, fresh and fast.  . . Noodles are great, meat is savory. Broth is delicious and unique here.  A delightful suprise!. . I liked the decor and that they DO NOT have a sign.  Why don't they have a sign?  They don't need one.  People come anyway.  Why bother?. . Their lemongrass beef is SOOO tasty!
