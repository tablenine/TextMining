I came to Chicago excited to try their deep dish pizzas and their hot dogs, but of course, coming with my mom, she wanted to try some asian food.... so what do we do? We hit up Chinatown and got some good ol' Chinese food.. . We came here because the day before, when Aileen V., my mom and I came walking by here, it was super crowded, so we assumed it was a must eat place!. . Boy was I wrong.  Maybe I came on a bad day, who knows, since everyone here experienced a great experience, but I sure didn't.. . We started off by each ordering a dish. (1 dish can be shared by 2 people).. . My mom got the schzwan string bean beef over rice.  It was ok, it was your typical beef with the dark sauce and some string beans over rice.. . I got the Thai green curry with chicken and that was horrible!  First off, they didn't use any type of milk what so ever!  Like ANY!  They seemed to have used some kind of powder, it was gross!. . Aileen V. got a calamari, shrimp kind of dish which was ok. It was your typical stirfried seafood with some vegtables.  . . I think this place is popular since it's opened till late at night but other than that, not my kind of place to eat.
