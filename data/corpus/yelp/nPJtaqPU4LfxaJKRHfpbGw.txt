Category: Sandwiches
Oh, Philippe's how much do I love thee?. . This is a delicious and wonderful sandwich, folks.  Slow cooked to be supernaturally tender, a great roll, and a fair price.  I realize that they are celebrated for the traditional French Dip, but the lamb here is delicious with a little bleu cheese on top and some of the peppers (pepperoncini?) make for a great meal.. . They claim to have invented the French Dip and I don't know how we'd ever prove that, but they've certainly mastered it.. . My only complaint is Philippe's proximity to Chinatown.  You can't make someone choose between a perfect French Dip and a whole town of dumplings.  I'm only a man, damn it.. . ONLY A MAN.
