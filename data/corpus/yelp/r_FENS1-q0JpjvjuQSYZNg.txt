Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
this place is pretty good. I think the broth is still much better at the Daikokuya in J-town, but seeing as I live in the vicinity of this Shin Sen, it's fine. I like all the options and choices on the menu. The staff is friendly and attentive. Overall always had good experinces... just... I wish for more flavor...
