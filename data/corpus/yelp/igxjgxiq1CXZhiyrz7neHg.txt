The Bar Crwal-A-Palooza, A-Thon, A-Rama. etc. didn't end yet. I didn't go to bed. I somehow ended up here.. . I didn't eat, 'cuz there was entirely too much al-kee-hol in my little system. But it was 2:30 in The morning and my drinking cohorts were in need of sustenance.. . I watched them eat, and I'm sure I would have love the food. I'm definitely sure of that. Yup... SURE.
