I've gotten lots of carry out there and actually celebrated my b-day there so I'm surprised I didn't write about it sooner.  Normally I love their peanut lovers dish, but this time it was just ok.  I would have given it three stars if I had just stuck to my meal, but I tried other peoples in the party.  WOAH nelly on the salt!  Geez.  They must have forgotten they salted already and did without realizing.  I figure this is a once in a blue moon mistake.  I have to give it two stars for my experience, but since I have had good experiences there before, I would check it out again.
