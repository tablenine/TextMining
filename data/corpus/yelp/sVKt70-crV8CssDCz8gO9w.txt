My experience is based on a dessert, cocktail trip here the night of my birthday.... . We got there late, after a lovely evening of birthday fun (Second City and Twin Anchors--YUM!)...craving something a little sweet.. . I had an expresso creme brule, which was divine (the perfect amount of sweetness) and my date had the chocolate ganache cake which was rich, super-sweet and super-delicious.  I also had a glass of moscato, upon the recommendation of our server, which tasted exactly like apple juice.  Furthermore, although the server had pointed to a $4 glass of wine when she recommended it to accompany my dessert, the one I had was $8.  Whatever, it was my birthday, I was gonna have whatever sounded good, but I thought that was a little shady.. . It was a nice experience, I'd like to go back and try their cheese flights (I am a cheese nut!) but overall a little expensive.
