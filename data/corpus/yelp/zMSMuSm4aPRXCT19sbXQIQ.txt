Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
We have had it with this place.  I don' t understand how this restaurant continues to survive with such consistently rude and lazy service.  I feel like I'm intruding as soon as I walk in the door, the staff acts like it's a burden on them to seat you.  Phone service is just as bad.  Yes the food is good - we've eaten here about 15 times since it's opened.  I think maybe on ONE occasion alone they were able to get our order correct.  Don't order take out because it takes them 25 minutes to put the order together and when you pick it up, it will be cold (and, oh, did I mention WRONG?).  Two sandwiches + two shakes + poor service = $35?!  Why does this establishment treat their customers with such disdain?  I'll never know because I'll never be back.
