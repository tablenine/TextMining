Restaurant: Devon Seafood Grill
Category: Seafood
Food: Good, but not great - especially for the higher-than-average price.  My lobster ravioli was rich but somewhat bland. The sauce was missing something. Husband had the seafood platter, which was generously portioned but again, nothing to write home about. . . Service: We were under-impressed with our waiter, who barely acknowledged our presence the whole night.  The bus boy was friendlier.. . Atmosphere: The restaurant being all downstairs (no windows) is an interesting choice. If they dimmed those annoying bright lights and added some ambiance, it would feel more like a hip speak-easy than a boring basement. A missed opportunity. . . Bathrooms: Worth mentioning because they were so well-designed and pretty. . . Bar: The bar upstairs was neat. We wished we would have just had the  $5 happy hour appetizers there instead. . . Overall: Go for the happy hour in the bar. Skip the restaurant.
