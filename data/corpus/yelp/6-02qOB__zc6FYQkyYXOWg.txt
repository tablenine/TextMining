I enjoyed food there. We planned on going to Pizzeria Mozza, but 2 hours wait time was a bit too long. So we end it up next door. With no reservations we only waited 30 minutes to be sited at the mozzarella bar (we could have been sited immediately but we were waiting for another couple). I have the best rabbit I've ever tasted! Calf's brain ravioli and duck confit gnocchi awesome. As far as appetizers - grilled octopus very tasty. I did not care for buratta though. It tasted like mozzarella, not burrata. Very disappointing! And than there was a dessert - olive oil rosemary cake with olive oil ice cream! I never thought that olive oil could taste soooooooo freaking good! It's a must. Go just for that - totally worth it!.
