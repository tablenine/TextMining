Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I've been looking forward to, nay, dreaming about my Griddle Cafe quest for ages.  And I'm sorry to report that it just didn't live up to the hype.. Yes, the pancakes are huge. colossal. But there must be more to pancakes than the size.  I ordered the blueberry ones and they were so dry. Like a desert in mah mouf.  Also, the cakes did not have much of a flavor to them. They were pretty darn bland.. I suppose I am being fairly severe because I was looking forward to Griddle Cafe so much.  Instead of saving my leftovers for many pancake mornings to come, I just threw them away.. . I am sure glad that I didn't have to deal with a wait, because the stars would have just gone down from there.
