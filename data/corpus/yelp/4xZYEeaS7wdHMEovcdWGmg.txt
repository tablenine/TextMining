Well, you know, I have heard great things about this place, not only from Yelpers, but from coworkers, since I work in the area..I went there one morning working, and maybe because I was working, but the quality of food just wasn't that impressive.  I was told to try the french toast and since I love french toast, I decided to order it.  There was two thick slices of bread, and lightly coated with powdered sugar.  The toast got soggy after I ate a bite or two.  And not from the syrup because I'm the one who puts just enough of syrup on the plate for one bite and adds some more for the next bite for fear of getting the toast soggy.  I liked the syrup, it tastes like the pure, thin consistency maple syrup.  I was disappointed.  Then I ordered a side of bacon which was really salty and well over done to the point that it was burnt on some parts.  My partner's toast came and that was pretty much burnt too.  I'll probably go back just because I can't believe that I had such a subpar experience when everyone is raving about it...and because there's so much other things to order..and I'll probably go when I'm NOT working...
