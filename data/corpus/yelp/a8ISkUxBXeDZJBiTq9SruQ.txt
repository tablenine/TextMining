Weekend brunch is overrated.  Brunching on weekdays is where it's at!  . No wait on a Friday morning--at like, 10-ish.  Does it get much better than that?  . . Yes!!. . Not only is Over Easy super adorable (I loved the dangly egg decorations), they whip up a fantastic french toast.  I stayed on the sweet side, while my man friend went savory with the BLT.  My only complaint was the soggy strawberries sandwiched in between the luscious, thick layers of golden brown french toast.  Perhaps keeping the menu more seasonal would work to their advantage--pears, apples, orange/Grand Marnier, anyone??  . . Service was swift.  No wait to get seated.  Cozy atmosphere.  Thumbs up!
