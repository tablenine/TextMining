Category: Latin American
*Begin scene*. . It's mid-afternoon on a gorgeous summer day.  Inside a busy day spa, clients check in with one of two pretty front desk girls and walk through the door that leads to the spa.. . Me: (walking out from the back and greeting front desk girls) Hey guys - I'm going home now.. . Pretty girl 1(grabs my wrist and pulls me behind the front desk): Shh!!  Come here!!  (sotto voce). . Pretty girl 2 (laughs): Lucy, quick, come back here!. . Me: What is it?  What is it??. . Pretty girls 1 &amp; 2 (pointing) simultaneously with !!!!! on their faces. . Camera zooms in to what they point at:  A large Porto's bakery box. Camera pans to my face: Though I am Asian, my eyes grow very large with extreme excitement. . Pretty girl 1 (opening box to reveal the remainder of a dozen cheese pastries): These are the best. things. EVER.  Eat one!  Eat one RIGHT NOW!!!. . Me (with full mouth and sugar on lips, chewing):  Oh. Ma. Gawd.. . *End scene*. . I think I'll be going to one of the Porto's locations sometime very, very soon!
