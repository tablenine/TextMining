So sad, so sad.  Or maybe it was more frustration.  . . Either way, this place did nothing for me.... . One of our friends was arriving late, so we got a table, ordered an appetizer and drank their special drinks.  I will admit that their drinks and the guac &amp; chips appetizer were tasty.... . So, we sat here for about 20 minutes ordering drinks and snacking when our friend arrived.  During this time, the server was short with us and didn't seem to know anything about the menu.  But, that's okay, because it was time to order.  After 20 minutes of looking over the menu, I was dead set to order the Pork Shoulder and that's what I did.  Well, I ordered it until the server told me that they had run out earlier in the day.  What?!  You're telling me I sat here this whole time and you couldn't mention you were out of a staple menu item before I ordered?? WTF?!. . So, I ordered the Veggie burger which she told me was very juicy and delicious.  Boy, was she wrong!  I love a good veggie burger, but it was the blandest thing ever!  . . Here's the low-down:. - Bad service all around. - Overpriced food for items that are not so good. - Very pretentious atmosphere though the servers/hostesses wear jeans (then take down the sign saying "Appropriate Attire Required"). - Tacos were the best part (from the others at the table). - Will not go there again or bring anyone else there!!!
