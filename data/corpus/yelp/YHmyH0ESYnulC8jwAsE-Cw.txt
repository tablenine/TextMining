Great place for the prix-fixed 3 course meal on Thursday!  It's anything from the menu...I love great deals!. . The pasta I had was exactly what it said it was - nothing fancy, but still a good tomato cream sauce.  My fiance's pork chop was delish: often times you'll find pork chops overcooked and therefore dry - this was not the case.. . Cute ambiance, too!
