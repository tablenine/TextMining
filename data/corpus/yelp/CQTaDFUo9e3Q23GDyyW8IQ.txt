Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Shinsengumi is definitely the best ramen house in the SGV...you get to pick how strong the soup base is, how oily it is, the texture of the noodle, etc.  It's the most customized ramen I've ever seen.. . The staff are very enthusiastic, and if you come right before they open to beat the dinner rush, you can see them huddled in a circle doing their pre-opening ritual that involves a lot of yelling and clapping and bowing.. . I guess they are praying to their Shinto Ramen Goddess to watch over them and make sure the soup is always hot and the noodles never soggy.. . Speaking of the staff, they are all Japanese, and I can't imagine how difficult it must be to have an all-Japanese staff in a part of town that is more known for its Chinese and Vietnamese population.. . The ramen is a good size, but I always leave a bit hungry still.  Something about ramen in general (even with the pork and other options) just doesnt fill the void.. . It would be nice to see them offer MORE options to put in the ramen, that is the one thing missing from an otherwise authentic bowl of noodles.  When you go to Tokyo and into a Ramen shop there are so many options for what's in your ramen it's staggering.  Shinsengumi's choices are all pretty basic and they could do well to expand the selection.
