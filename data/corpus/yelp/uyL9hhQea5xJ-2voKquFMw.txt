Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
Pick Me Up has never been a bad experience for me. Whether it's meeting for late-night coffee dates, or a sudden urge for a tofu scramble...you KNOW that Pick Me Up is the best place. My only complaints are that 1) I wish there were more places to park my bike right there (ha), and 2) that it was still 24hrs all the time. These two things don't affect my rating of the restaurant though...I love this place! . . ps. The milkshakes. THE MILKSHAKES!!!! So good.
