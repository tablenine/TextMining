Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Isn't brunch the new dinner? or is Brown the new black? Anyhow.....back to brunch. Toast is awesome. Whenever, I am in Chicago - Toast is near the top of my "I gotta do" list. The long narrow room provides a great illusion when looking from one end of the restaurant to the other. The food and atmosphere is well worth the wait. As previously stated the French Toast is to die for. One of the best brunch spots I've been to.
