Was visiting the area and my gf highly recommended this place. We ordered the Taiwanese sausage and the fried pork chop dishes over rice. Both came with some corn and broccoli. The fried pork chop dish was delicious but I wish they had some pepper/salt instead of just pepper and salt. The Taiwanese sausage was fantastic. It was very fresh and tasty. Not too salty and not too sweet. We ended up buying a couple of packs of sausage to take home. While walking around the shop, I saw many authentic Taiwanese dishes and I wanted to try them all.  Seems like a great place to have a quick, good meal.  . . The servers were very nice and we had a big party monopolizing the tables. The servers would occasionally glance at us but were never rude in trying to get us to leave. Very polite shop and I wish it was located closer to me. Would definitely visit again if I was in the area.
