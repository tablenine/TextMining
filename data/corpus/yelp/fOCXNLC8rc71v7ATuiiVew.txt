Stopped for breakfast on Sunday morning around 9:30. The cafe was busy but we were seated right away by the very conscientious host. The number of people waiting outside for a table when we left was daunting, so I'm glad we made it in under the wire. The seating is pretty tight and the servers are hustling, but even with the commotion, the waitstaff and general feel of the place is very friendly. We had the "Wholey Moley" whole wheat pancakes with brown sugar crumbles (comically huge stack of 3 cakes that I didn't make a dent in) French Toast with a side of sausage, and medium roast coffee - all of which were delicious. I'll definitely make a return trip.
