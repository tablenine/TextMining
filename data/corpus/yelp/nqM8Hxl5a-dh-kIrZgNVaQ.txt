I first found out about this place via my co-worker that lives in the area. This is one of the few ramen spots I've eaten where not only was I satisfied with the flavor I was actually full. That's rare for me when it comes to soups. There's something about the miso and the noodles... it totally does it for me.. . I usually do the miso soup, #4, with extra pork and garlic. For the price you really can't go wrong. Also, they were actually open on New Year's Day, which just elevates them in my eyes.
