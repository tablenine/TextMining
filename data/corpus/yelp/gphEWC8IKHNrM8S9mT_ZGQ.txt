Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Just a Fun Place: It's a fast paced restaurant with great service. They offer HUGE portions. They have the largest salads I have ever seen. The drinks are good, even if you prefer non- alcohol, but the best thing of all is the CHEESECAKE. The deserts are fresh and the variety seems to be endless. The service is great and the prices aren't bad either. One meal with appetizers for one comes to about ranges $20- $30
