Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Only one thing to say. . Overrated!. . Let me further divulge, there is always a wait here, I mean always! When you are a kid growing up/teenager and so forth you are always excited to go there, mob mentality I guess you could say. Kind of like Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, its just fried chicken and some waffles, but way overpriced. Â Anyhow, the tacos here are standard, the enchilidas are ok and the burritos aren't worth noting.. . This place would have gotten three stars if you didn't go into the place overhyped on expectations, but its such a let down that it gets two stars. . . Parking is a pain also.
