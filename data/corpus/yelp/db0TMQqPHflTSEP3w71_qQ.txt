Absolutely delicious! This place might not look like much, but inside lies a true gem. The staff is amazing. SO kind, SO friendly. . . I asked the waiter's recommendation on tamales - Mexican or Salvadorian? I followed his advice and got one of each, and thoroughly enjoyed both. It's probably a good idea to wear something with an elastic waist here, cos boy did I stuff my face. . . 2 large meals came out to under $20. The smiles came free :-) What a steal.
