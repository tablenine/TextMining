Restaurant: Fellini&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
The tip cup reads " In Lieu of Decent Wages" my question is where is  the tip jar for customers that says " In Lieu of Decent Service" where you can take your tip back if you are not treated well. Fellini's would have lost a lot of money last night if that was the case. The patio is nice, the pizza is usually pretty good. The place and food are no frills- hot, cheesy fresh pizza with the standard toppings- no gourmet foo foo toppings here....  But all of that is negated by the snarky girl taking the orders. My asking for 2 plain slices to go, being sure to use please and thank you, does not warrant snotty attitude- it wasnt the first time this has happened and I am sure it wont be the last. Food should not be slid across the counter to the customer either. Get it together, it is not rocket science girl
