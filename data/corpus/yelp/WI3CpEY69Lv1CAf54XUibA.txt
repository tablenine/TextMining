I went here for the first time on Thursday the 14th for some lunch. . Parking was a breeze (I used metered parking) on the street...just be sure to make it back before the hours up or your ass will have a ticket.. .  There were 3 of us who went and we all ordered #13.... a fried chicken breast and a waffle ($8.50) each...which is kind of pricey for 1 waffle and 1 piece of chicken. . The waffle was so damn GOOD. I was surprised as I'm not much of a waffle lover. The breast was tasty too.. 1 side of macaroni &amp; cheese was ordered....and 2 iced tea/lemonade drinks.. . The drinks were very sweet and good....and there was NO refills on them 8(. The Macaroni n Cheese was scrumptious....I didn't order it....but I tasted it.. Our waitress was SO friendly...I LOVED the experience I had dining here. I'll definitely be back sometime soon
