If you go early enough you will be seated right away.  Our group of 4 walked in at 10:30am on a Sunday morning and snagged seats right away at the last available table.  My friends who go there all the time told me horror stories of waiting outside for 2+ hours.  For brunch!. . The Crab Benedict was absolutely delish!  I tried my friend's french toast and it was really yummy as well.  Wish we had places like this closer to where I live!
