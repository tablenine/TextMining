After two bites of my chicken tacos I had the overwhelming urge to vomit. They didn't necessarily taste bad, but every time I tried to take a bite waves of nausea came over me. . . Any food that gives me the nearly uncontrollable urge to throw up is bad. BAD BAD BAD. . . And it was on my birthday. I felt fine the rest of the night.
