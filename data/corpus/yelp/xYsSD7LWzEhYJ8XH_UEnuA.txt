Do yourself a favor and plan ahead by booking a reservation one month ahead to get prime time Sat night times. I have been here a couple times and I really like it. My favorite dishes are mozza bar selections, the octopus salad, pasta and the mussels. I could do without a main entree after we ate all the other previous courses. Next time I go back I will probably load up on the apps, salad, mozza, and pasta and dessert. No main course for me!
