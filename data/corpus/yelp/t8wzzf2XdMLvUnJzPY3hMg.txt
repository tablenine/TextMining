Restaurant: Café Santorini
Category: Greek
What is there not to love about this place?  I used to be a regular at Cafe Santorini until I moved to the Bay Area.  Now, all I can do is drool on my memories of their delicious entrees.  I've tried many of their selections and have never been disappointed.  I think a sign of a good restaurant is the bread they serve you.  Cafe Santorini has some of the best breads ever.  . . The best spot to dine is on the balcony.  If you go during the day, you can people watch since it is situated above the bustling alley of Old Town Pasadena.  In the evening, the balcony is tranformed into a romantic bistro with its warm lighting....quite romantic.
