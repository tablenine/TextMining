Had a late breakfast here the other day. I got a 3 egg omelet w/ cheddar, and fruit and cinnamon rolls on the side. the cinnamon rolls were gorgeous...but turned out to be too dry for me to consider those calories worth finishing. The omelet was decent (and huge), but I've definitely had better.. . Overall, it was a pretty affordable breakfast for all I got, but I wouldn't go back. I like a more unique menu.
