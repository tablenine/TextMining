I have always had great sushi here.  It has always been fresh and melt-in-your-mouth tasty.  I could eat a whole side of the namasake and escolar...rich, buttery, and I need to make a conscious effort to stop from stuffing myself.  As for regular rolls I like the spider, Holy Mackerel and Passion.  The creamy scallop hand roll I sometimes eat for dessert, it's like an ice cream cone of creamy goodness.  I agree that the asparagus beef roll appetizer is really tasty, but I wish they would bring back the seared tuna in honey miso sauce.  I do like the hirame ponzu, but not as much.. . Table service is not great, but not bad either.  For better service, sit at the sushi bar, they will take great care of you.  I first went there on New Year's Eve when they had just opened.  Granted they were new, but we walked right in and sat at the sushi bar.  We were treated like rock stars.  I have been going there quite often ever since and have never had a bad experience, and the friends we have brought there keep begging us to take them back.
