To the first-date couple sitting on the leopard love seat: Sorry my party eventually drove you guys away, but really that was the only area that would accommodate us. There are plenty of other small nooks that you guys could hole yourselves up in, and I'm glad you finally figured that out and left so we could monopolize that spot. *shrug*. . To management: While I can say that I enjoy your music selections, I can't say I enjoy the deafening volume. Please just turn it down a notch. It's not cute yelling and screaming over the sound system to have a conversation. Less cute when I leave with a sore throat, ringing ears, and a raging headache.. . To the bartenders: If I actually appreciated liquor, you would be my favorite people. You guys pour some strong ones. The girls in my group could barely sip their martinis without their eyes widening each time and panicking. But the guys, they were your biggest fans. I was impressed by the large glasses of Glen, not overflowing with ice. I hope they tipped you generously.. . Lastly to my friends who came to wish me a happy birthday: "Love you, mean it!" xo
