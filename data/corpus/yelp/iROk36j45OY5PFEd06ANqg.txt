The vibe is definitely a bit quirky, which I enjoyed.. . However, I'm not so sure if I really enjoyed the food here.  First of all, there are way too many items on the menu, which for some, I guess, can be a good thing.  I sat there with my party for a good while to really decide on what I wanted to try.. . Nothing too special or out-of-the-ordinary on the menu.. and definitely over-priced!
