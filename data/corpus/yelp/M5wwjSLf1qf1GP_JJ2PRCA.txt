Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
my bf and i came here on a saturday afternoon after failing to get into the food festival because the line was long enough to circle los angeles three times!! so i pulled out my handy dandy blackberry and yelped some yummy spots around the area. Umami burger popped up as a close destination and next thing ya know! Here we were! the wait was about 15 minutes (not too shabby ) and we weren't quite sure what to expect. the thing that was going through both of our minds, was what is a umami burger anyway? unfortunately we still don't know! haha!! anyway we got seated in the middle of this tiny room (yes im claustrophobic) and I felt really awkward. our server was pretty nice though~ very attentive and a good sense of humor! i ordered the turkey miso burger, which was super juicy and filling but a tad too salty for my taste. My bf got the hatch burger, which was filled with green chilli peppers i think? and he said that it was possibly one of the best burgers he has ever had! wow!! We also got 2 orders of the skinny fries which kind of tasted like Mc donalds fries to me.. By the way, all the burgers are cooked medium rare! Overall I thought the food was A-OK! my boyfriend probably would have gave it 4-5 stars though maybe I should get him to sign up for a yelp account instead of being a freeloading yelper! haha just kidding
