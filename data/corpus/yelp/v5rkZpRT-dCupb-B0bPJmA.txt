Restaurant: Graveyard Tavern
Category: Bars
Graveyard has the perfect set-up. DJ's (sometimes... not so good) The bar is centralized. Â Big spaces for dancing, large leather couches for relaxing, giants booths, pool tables.. and the list goes on. . . This is a great place to get shithoused. The crowd here changes a lot, and it's not too uncommon to smell the green floating around. Lots of different people; definitely and eclectic crowd. . . The bartenders aren't toolbags- but when they say last call, they mean it. 2:30 begins to be such a drag when the DJ is just getting warmed up. Be prepared for a cover. I went to Friday night's Filthy and Famous party, and there wasn't a cover. Although, sometimes it's anywhere from 5-10 dollars. . . There's good parking and lots of other bars to go to around there. East Atlanta is a great spot to find somewhere to dance with some fantastic people just spreading the love. Aaaaaand go!
