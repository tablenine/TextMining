I've only been once, so I can't say too much about their other foods, but frick, are their pancakes amazing. Bigger than your face, 3 stacks high, loaded with heart attack goodness. Breakfast may get your day started, but don't expect to get a boost of energy after eating Griddle pancakes. It has quite the opposite effect, inducing food coma.. . I went with 4 buddies and we were way too ambitious in ordering 4 different kinds of pancakes and 1 kind of french toast (creme de la creme, Hello fanciest french toast i've ever had. Goodbye Burger King french toast dunks). We also "ate" oreo, blueberry, boysenberry, and golden ticket--rightfully named, my eyes pretty much lit up as if I'd just discovered Wonka's golden ticket, sweet, nutty, caramel goodness.. . Though they are large, the cakes are a bit pricey but worth it every once in a while. I'm excited to try other items on their menu.. . Parking and seating seem to be the biggest problem because it's understandably crowded. Service was good but a little slow. Try to go during down times, if there are any...
