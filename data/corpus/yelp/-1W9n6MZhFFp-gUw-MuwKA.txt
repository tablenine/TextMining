This is kinda close to my place and I am total German Food....well German anything Freak so I was super excited to try this place. . The sausage selection is amazing. The fries were so good our group ordered for 4 side orders of them. . The service was exceptional and the beer selection kept us there for hours. . They have flavors of sausage that I would never think of. I have been back a couple of times and always leave full and inebriated.
