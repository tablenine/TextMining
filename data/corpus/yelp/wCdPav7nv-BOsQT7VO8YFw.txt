Excellent for both food, service &amp; especially ambiance.. . I ordered the lamb sandwich with au jus dipping sauce and it was incredible. The lamb was extremely flavorful, the hoagie was soft but firm enough for the dipping sauce, and the sauce itself was scrumptious! I also tried the lamb w/ fried eggplant sandwich and enjoyed that as well, but between the two I enjoyed the first much more. . . The waiter was attentive, friendly &amp; helpful. He gave good suggestions and was quick to fill water glasses and check up on our table. But overall it seems to be one of those places where that is fairly standard.. . The atmosphere is amazing. It's large and open, but still intimate enough for a date or small group. However I went for a business lunch Â and it was also perfect for that type of occasion as well.. . Highly recommend and would definitely go back!
