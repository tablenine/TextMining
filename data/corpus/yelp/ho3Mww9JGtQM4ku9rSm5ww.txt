It's a quick ride to this Yardhouse from K-town so when you have the munchies on a Sunday night and looking for a chill happy hour (10pm-close) this spot isn't bad. . . .3.50-4.50 beers, half on pizzas, appetizers and sliders. . .everything thing was dank. . .quick friendly service and they never seem to mind when I build my munchies inside their restaurant. . . eclipse and snakebite are good beers. . . the spinach dip, sliders, jamaican wings, fries, chicken nachos, and bbq chicken pizza were very dankhizzle. . . enjoy this spot it gets super cracking sometimes! . . . so I had this review waiting to be finished so here it goes. . . I've gone back to the Yardhouse since I started this review and I think I've tasted a great majority of their beer- very dank. Â I dig their lobster dip and and guiness blend they have. . . Favorite drinking spot at LA Live. . .aight i'm done, ciao
