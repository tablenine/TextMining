fried egg on pizza? YES! believe it..it soo works. the fennel w/ fried egg pizza is TO DIE for.  we had the yummy side veggies which u cant really go wrong, tap water and amazing wine choices by the glasss.  yes, i said tap water! i love the unpretentious service that's not common around town.  we arrived w/ no reservations and they gave us a fantastic table. the best part were the prices!. the only thing that was bad was the pizza w/ clams. imean,really bad. the clams were chewy and salty..hence my 4-star rating.
