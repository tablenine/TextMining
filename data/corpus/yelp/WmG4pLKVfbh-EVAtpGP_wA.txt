I was underwhelmed by this place, and I think the problem is that I was expecting too much.  To me it felt very similar to a Panera, but less franchised.  I had a wrap and it was prettty good, but not good enough to make me want to go back anytime soon.  It was very 3 stars.  Not great, not bad.  Just good enough where I didn't feel like I wasted my money.
