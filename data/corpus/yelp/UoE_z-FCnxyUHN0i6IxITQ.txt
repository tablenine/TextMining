First off, the staff here is really friendly and accomidating to any requests you might have.  They even let me try a piece of the brisket before getting it!  Awesome.. . I got the beef brisket and pulled pork plate with two sides (mac and cheese and the brunswick stew), which rings in at $11.  They give you ample amounts of meat, and I'm eating the rest for dinner tonight, so yeah, lots of food.. . I thought the brisket was only OK, and would probably give it 3.5 stars, considering it wasn't as moist and tender as I would have liked it to be.  One of the chefs told me that today was a bit of an off day for the brisket, and I appreciated the honesty.  I'll probably have the brisket again at some point, since I love eating a good brisket.  You can also ask for more moist pieces if you want, but of course, it comes with more fat (I can't complain about that.). . The pulled pork was really good.  You can tell that this has been in the smoker for hours, as it basically falls apart when you stick a fork through it.  I would have liked a bit more moisture, but the BBQ sauce at the table provides for that part, and overall, this was very solid.. . I'm normally not a big fan of mac and cheese, but the M&amp;C here was awesome.  It is really rich and cheesy, but not too overwhelming, as some people have complained.  There is just the right amount of burnt/crispy cheese on some of the pieces, and they use large pieces of rigatoni or ziti, so it's not your typical small macaroni.  Really delicious.. . Brunswick stew was not my thing, I did not enjoy it.  The two pieces of toast were awesome -- I believe it was similar to Texas toast, just not overwhelmingly buttery.  . . I will come back here again and try some of the other meats, like the BBQ beef ribs.
