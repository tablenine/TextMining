3 1/2  really.  I used to like the beef w/ baby bok choy and tofu, and they would make it for me even after they took it off the menu.  That's about all I ordered because I didn't care for the menu offerings.. Today we went there with a Groupon for $13.00 per person 5 course Sea Bass dinner.  The restaurant has a nice, minimalist decor.  We started with Lobster Bisque with creamed corn.  It had a nice texture, but I could barley taste any lobster.  My friend loved it.  Next was avacado mouse with mango salsa on an asian chip.  The flavors combined well, but again my friend enjoyed it more than I did.  Next came sweet peppered beef, and that was my favorite.  The sauce was very tasty and not overly sweet, the portion was fine.  The Chilean sea bass was fresh tasting, in some sort of broth with alot of cilantro.  Hate to say it but it was flavorless, and a sad waste of a nice piece of fish.  I tried salt but it did not help.  My friend agreed.  The chocolate volcano cake was served warm with coconut ice cream and although not what I would think of as an Asian desert, it was very good, like a flourless chocolate cake.  There were only 3 other tables at the time.  Our water was refilled at least 10 times.  The waiter told us Tuesday night all regular entrees were $8.95 and that they were full portions.  Their entrees range from $10.95- $21.95 ( For steak) so that's a good deal. I recomend giving it a try.  Personally I can take it or leave it, but just can't give it 3 stars for some reason.
