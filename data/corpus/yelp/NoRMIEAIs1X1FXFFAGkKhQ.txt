Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I was there this morning for brunch, the food is decent, nothing amazing, the farmer's market breakfast was good, the coffee is OK and the apple tart was not very good, the prices are great though, for a place that looks as good as Bottega Louie you'd expect higher prices, the service was so so, i definitely do not recommend this place for parties bigger than 5, we waited an hour and a half to get a table, we were seven, i'd go back but it's not my favorite restaurtant in dowtown.
