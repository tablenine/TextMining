I went to the Oinkster thinking it was going to be a head to head battle between the Hat.  Pastrami versus Pastrami battle, let's get it on.  It's also gotten the Guy Fiori sign of approval as a spray paint picture of his face is tagged on the door saying, "Guy ate here."  (Speaking of Guy, does anyone watch 'Minute to Win It?'  I'm enjoying the show a lot.) Anyhow, pastrami battle, time to throw down, as I said.. . Well, what should have been a straight up fight, in fact, Oinkster 'cheats' and calls it 'friends' to help put down the Hat.  Because what started as a trip for pastrami turned into an order of a Pastrami Sandwich, piggy fries, Ube shake (filipino taro drink), and a peanut butter and jelly cupcake....ooooo, what the.  When I finished ordering, I couldn't believe what just happened.  Its as if my stomach took over my brain.  My brain read those items, my stomach said got to have it, and I got it.  Pretty much the akin to grocery shopping while your hungry I guess.  Heck, you can even get beer if you want to.. . And it is that diversity of items, that despite being a random assortment of items, make me want to come back to Oinkster more than the Hat.  All the items were delicious, pastrami juicy and 'strong', ube shake smooth and sweet, piggy fries heaping, and the peanut butter and jelly cupcake moist.  I still can't believe, but really, I'm pretty happy how this spot can be so diverse and tasty!
