I REALLY wish this place was better. It really has the makings to be an amazing place. I've gone back twice with the hope that would be Â better. I'm not saying that it's bad. There's just something about it that keeps bringing me back to try it. Their flatbreads are definite winners but their main dishes just lacked something. Don't know what it is but there was something missing. We (the group) sampled stuff from all over the menu. . . Started with the shrimp flat bread and meat plates. Was a pretty good way to start the meal. Meat selections they have were pretty good and ranged from all over. The shrimp flat bread was tasty. We had to ixnay on the cheese because of a lactard at the table but it didn't feel like we were missing anything. . We had the tandoori chicken, the lamb shank, the kobe cheek and the polenta. I say we because there was plate switching involved. The lamb shank was a little dry, there was no sauce that would really round out the dish. The tandoori chicken was pretty moist but again something, maybe a sauce? was missing from it. The polenta was pretty delicious although it was a little thick to really get the crispiness of it. The Kobe cheek was the winner of the night. Melt in your mouth tasty but again lacked some sort of something. . . I love bacon! so we got the ice cream with the candied bacon. Thought that it would be little candied bacon bits but they came in strips. Kinda made it hard to really enjoy both the bacon and the ice cream together . . Lots of drinks, which was great. but also made the bill that much more :) . . I think i would try the place one more time...
