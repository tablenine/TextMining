Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Had dinner here tonight to see what the hype was about -- everyone says it's the best pizza in town.  The pizza is similar to Petrillo's in SG but I think Petrillo's is way better.  And they give you free bread, whereas Casa charges.  I ordered the Deluxe (oily sausage, canned mushroom, boiled green pepper). The pizza was bland, needed a lot of chili peppers and was unsatisfying.  Don't waste your time.
