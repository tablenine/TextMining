Yes, K-o-r-e-a-n Taco rocks!!! . . Think of yummy juicy shredded Korean short rib meat in place of the carne asada garnished with some kim chi and lime/orange...Deeelicious. The only Mexican thing about this is the tortilla, the Mexicans cooking the food and the truck :). . Note: average wait in line is around 30-60 mins to have your order taken and then another 10-30 minutes for your food to be prepare.
