I was pyscho excited to come here... as an expat in HK, I would eat at Crystal Jade Xiao Long Bao restaurant 2-3 times a week for 4 mnths... so that's a lot of freaking soup dumplings!. . The two points of my roadtrip from AZ -- Disney and soup dumplings! Â These were very good, served in the same manner as in HK...the irony is you see Hispanics folding the dumplings in the window'd room...
