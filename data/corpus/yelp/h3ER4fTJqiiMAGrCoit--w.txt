Jesus... 133 reviews!  Ok, so no one needs to read the same descriptions of their delectable gravy and waffles over and over again... (just like I REALLY don't need to read anymore stories about first-time Brazilians!), but... I really really wanted to add this to my Soul Food list  :D . . 4 stars because I am not that impressed by the chicken... but who CARES when you smother it with gravy?!
