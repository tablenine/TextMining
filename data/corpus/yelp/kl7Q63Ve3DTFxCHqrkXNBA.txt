Let me think of a never-ending board game..MONOPOLY!. If you plan to dine in, please bring your Monopoly with you. By the time you get your red hotels in all of your properties you're probably half way in the waitlist. . .   As I waited and waited and waited, I witnessed a lot of take out bags, A LOT. But let me advice you that it does not taste the same. I had it to go the first time and let me tell you that bringing a board game is a better deal. Devouring a plastic bag of 4lbs (4 people) of freshly cooked sizzling and amazingly seasoned, delectable cajun shrimp soaked with the whole SHABAM on the spot is a memorable adventure. If you finished it and you're still hungry may as well eat the plastic bag, that's how tasty it is.. .   Please dont bring your first date here, this is nasty, hands-on eating (unless she's the nasty type- uknowwhatimean). Shrimps are in their shells and with their heads, so a lot sauce squirting will occur.  Don't wear your fancy clothes here or long sleeves... Long story short: go topless.. .   One thing that was quite uncomfortable to see was the amount of SNOT WIPING in the premises, I include myself in the previous clause. Granted, it is nasty eating but you won't be surprised if you're eating somebody's snot while digging in for your next shrimp in the bag. Cajun is tasty but quite HOT. Please get an individual spoon or fork when you dig in. .  Every seafood item is great, please dont get the others (chicken, etc) they just taste like frozen stuff.
