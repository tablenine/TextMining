Deliciousness on a platter. Smiling, attentive service. All served in pleasing, soothing, almost sophisticated surroundings (except for the overhead light that was hanging a little too close to my husband's head!). This was a great dining experience. The crab rangoon was an outstanding mix of creamy and crispy. The szechuan long beans were addictively good, and the tofu curry was tasty, even I had issues with the alien texture of tofu skin. A little out of the way, and slightly out of place in its surroundings, but definitely worth the trip.
