WOW!!! Where do I begin? I was completely blown away by the food and service here. There are some vegetarian options on the menu and our server also let us know that the kitchen can make many of the items on the menu vegetarian. The flavors were spot on. My favorite was the mushrooms with gnocchi, I couldn't get enough. I can't wait to go back.
