Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I got a recipe out of a magazine that said it was based on the "delicious Orecchiette with Italian Sausage from Ugo."  I liked the recipe very much so when I happened upon a chance to go to Ugo for an early supper yesterday, I took it.  I wish I hadn't.. . The place was pretty empty, but it was before 6pm, so I thought nothing of it.   The minestrone soup was tasteless.  They completely forgot to season the broth.  A fair amount of salt and pepper later, it was almost okay tasting.  I have gotten better from a can.. . The Orecchiette was also tasteless.  They seemed to forget to season almost everything.  The Italian Sausage was very strong on fennel seeds and you could taste little else.  The sauce was watery and tasteless.  My friend's lasagna was also watery and tasteless until she took a couple of bites into something horribly sour - possibly an unripe tomato.   The service was lacking.  The waitress spilled Parmesan cheese (also tasteless, BTW) on to my friend without apologies.  A waiter also spilled water on her, without apologies.  We avoided desert for fear it would be tasteless as well.. . I would not go back unless they get a new head chef.  The food does not seem fresh and I think their tomato sauce is out of a can.  It's not expensive, but there are plenty of places we can get better food for less.  A real disappointment.
