i came here with my family and some out of town friends last saturday for lunch. apparently this place is pretty famous, even though i'd never heard of it in my 5+ years living in this area.  we were lucky that we did not have to wait for a table, and got seated right away. the entrance way is a little crowded with some giant crab/lobster/fish tanks that were incredible-looking. . . we ordered the french beef which was pretty good. the meat was very tender and well flavored. the house special lobster (which they recommended we get the "medium" size) was about 4-5 pounds at about $15 per pound. i recommend getting a smaller size, especially if you intend to order a lot of other dishes. we also ordered a fried fish special with a sweet/spicy sauce, which was only ok.  the clam with basil sauce was very good. the waiter we got was pretty knowledgeable and was able to recommend dishes to us. we also ordered a crab asparagus soup that was good, though not as hearty as the seafood soups i see posted on this site.  the pea sprouts were also good, a simple vegetable dish to go along with the rest of the meal. for 6 dishes (including a $80+ lobster) and a soup, the check for 6 adults one child ran about $180 not including tip. i think with a smaller size lobster, the orders and check would have been more proportional to the amount of people we had there and food we actually needed.. . a good experience, i will definitely go back.
