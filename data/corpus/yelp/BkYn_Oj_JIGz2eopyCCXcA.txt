Restaurant: Spoon
Category: Thai
Spoon is my favorite Thai restaurant.  Spoon was started by a young couple with a shoestring budget and the whole family pitches in.  I've been going there since it opened and only had two customers at a time.  It was pretty bleak early on.  Slowly, word spread about their fantastic food and now the place is rocking every night.  Food is authentic, but updated.  Presentation is always clean and simple.  The space is rustic and hip.  I am always treated well by the wait staff.  Lunch is busy, but they seem to speed up service so you can get in/out quickly.  Dinner menu covers a lot of ground without giving too many choices.  The specials are always amazing, but typically they are a lot more than normal entrees.  Did I mention full bar?
