My husband and I have eaten here about four times. We always go on a Sunday afternoon and the place is packed with large families. We have been a little bummed, as it's kinda hard to try a bunch of stuff, when it's just the two of you. . . This past Saturday night, we went back with two other couples and had a great meal! We tried a bunch of new dishes, but me favorite is still the Shaken Beef. Oh yeah, and the spring rolls, the Singapore noodles,and well you get the picture. They have great food and the prices are so reasonable! We ate family style, brought our own wine, and left stuffed for $45.00 w/tip. I can't wait to come back!!
