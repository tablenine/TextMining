Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Seeing as I am on my french dip craze at the moment and that I spend quite a bit of time dreaming of Philippe's and LC's (Lion's Choice) sandwiches, I thought I should add this to my reviewed restaurants list.. . Philippes is a gem. It's always hustle'n bustle inside, and the sandwiches, though not a hands down favorite, are pretty damn good. The place has been around for forever. It has character, and the crowd is diverse. The last time I stopped through, there were Dodger's fans everywhere. It's really tough to repeat this experience in other cities, so in my mind, this place kind of is LA. ...That is, the LA without the maddening glamour and glitz. . . A little bit on Philippe's can be found in wikipedia.... . Expect to wait in line at least 15 minutes. I've never seen this place empty. . . Phillippe's is cheap. Don't go in there expecting some fancy meal. Your Â food is served on paper plates. It's also important to note that everyone orders the french dip sandwiches. It's their specialty. . . If you're not a fan of french dip sandwiches, you'll probably dislike this place. And worse yet... You'll be like my friend who hates cheese but sometimes suggests pizza for lunch. ...her search to fulfill her appetite is destined to failure, if you ask me.. . You should know what you're going to order before you get to the cashier, b/c you're in and out with your order very fast. ...It's all business when you're 1st in line.. . Park across the street in the lot on the south/ west side. Or be a little healthy and walk from a few blocks away. It's def. worth it.. . Out of 10 (10 being the best, 5 average). Decor: 8 (it's a blast to the past). Food: 8. Service: 4
