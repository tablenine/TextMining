Some of the best Margaritas and Guac I have ever had.  If you eat in the resto they mix the guac right in front of you at your table and you can say how spicy you want it!!  If outside, they don't :(  But overall, food better than most mexican restos I have tried in Chicago.  I could go just for their ritas if need be!!!
