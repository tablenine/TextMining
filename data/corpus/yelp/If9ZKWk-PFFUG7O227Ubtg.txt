Awesome purple picked eggs and hot mustard!  It's so good I wish I could bring some home.  The mustard basically made the sandwich.. . They were famous for years, always have lines; but the service was so quick that the line practically does not sustain.  So don't get scared just by looking at the lines.. . I just want to point out that the rave has nothing to do with food network.
