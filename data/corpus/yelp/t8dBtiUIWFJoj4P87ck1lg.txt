Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
Parker's on Ponce is a great restaurant in Decatur (where Mick's used to be). Total decor redo is very pleasing with stack stone fireplace, walls and many candles. The tuna entree was incredibly generous for the reasonable price --and the presentation said the chef was no neophyte.  We all have those moments when we just randomly decide to try a place when we have not done any review checking on Yelp etc. and feel like we are doing a gamble.. . Well, this visit to Parker's was one of those times--and we left saying we would definitely return because the dinner was a pleasant surprise. Very efficient staff-- always there, but never obtrusive (a'la Houston's).  . . Good value for a new experience in the great town of Decatur.
