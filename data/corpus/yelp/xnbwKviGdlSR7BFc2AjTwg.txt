wilson and i went to eat here for our early valentines day. we had read mixed reviews about it and we knew we were gonna have to shell out some mad cash (well at least he did) so we dressed up because we had heard we had to be a bit more dressy only to arrive and find some people with jeans and converses. wilson made reservations a couple of days before we went because we had heard it gets full fast and really busy. . . our waiter was very nice, sweet and helpful. he asked us if we had been there before and when we said no, he made a quick run on what is good, what they are known for and what we should consider ordering according to him. he was very friendly and nice and its unfortunate that i forgot his name. as for their "famous spinning salad" waitress, GESH!! put a smile on your face and be a bit more happy. she seemed like she did not want to be there at all, much less help us out. . . our food was OK. totally not what i was expecting (flavor wise). we went for the prime rib cause that is what they are known for and a side of spinach, bread pudding and smash potatoes. the wine was pretty good. im just really disappointed with the food. the salad was alright and the meat extremely flavorless. what was actually really good was the meat balls in the waiting room were AWESOME!! hahaha i would take a whole plate of that rather than the meat. . will we go there again: no! the meat is not that great, too much money for the flavor of the food. i think this place is just over hyped. its all just about the name. if it wasnt for the nice waiter, i would give this place two stars
