Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
I've been to David Burke's Primehouse twice, and both experiences have been wonderful. The food alone is superb; the quality and selection of the meats are excellent. Our steaks were cooked to our satisfaction, and were mouth-watering, even without the sauces (they have an ample selection of sauces to accompany the steaks). The sides good - nothing particularly fancy or unique, but very tasty. And the deserts are simple, but delicious. I highly recommend the cheesecake lollipops! The ambiance was warm and inviting, but nice enough to entertain clients or bring a significant other for a date.  My second time here we actually went during Chicago Kids Restaurant Week, and we felt very at ease seeing all the other families at the restaurant.  I don't think I would bring a child here for dinner, unless I was staying at the hotel, but it appears as though kids are welcome.  One thing that is unique is that they even have steaks for purchase to bring home.  The quality of the meat was very good; had I not spent a pretty penny on dinner, I would consider buying some steaks to bring home!  I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back again.
