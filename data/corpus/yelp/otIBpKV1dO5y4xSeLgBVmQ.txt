I've heard about this place for years and finally I was in the area so I had to stop by. Â I arrived around 3:30 on a Sunday and the line looked reasonable, not quite near the door.. . I got in line and seriously, not even 5 minutes later, I looked back and saw it had gone out the door! Considering the line, the wait wasn't all that bad and the staff was pretty quick to get the line moving. It Gave me chance to get one last glance at Yelp reviews, look in the pastry window, and even review their menu.. . I was bit saddened when they said they were out of the Guava and cheese danish's and would take about 20 minutes before they have a fresh batch. But not to worry, there was still so much to choose from. . Two words POTATO BALLS!! OMG, ok, to know me, I am not a huge potato person unless its french fries with lots of ketchup, I even would rather have my mashed potatoes with Ranch dressing than with gravy, but these were just delicious and mouth watering. Talk about orgasmic!! I'm usually not wow'd by meet and potatoes in one, but this definltey hit that WOW factor! . . So can't wait to go back and try that guave and cream cheese danish.
