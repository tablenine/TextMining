Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Being more of a breakfast fan, I prefer the waffles over the chicken.  Now I'm not saying the chicken isn't good, because it is, especially when you dunk it in a side of their gravy and onions.  But their waffles w/ a touch of cinnamon and a lot of syrup just hits the spot for me.. If you've never heard of this place (how have you not heard of this place?!), don't dismiss it just because it sounds strange.  Simply put, the combination of sweet and salty works.  It's the yin and the yang for food.. And it's always fun to run into celebrities (usually at this Gower location).
