Best ramen ever. I've been all around southern california looking for the best ramen, and the award goes to Daikokuya. Santouka and Shin-Sen-Gumi are good, but not nearly as great.. . This place makes me happy every time I come here. Seriously, a big bowl of ramen will cure any ailment you have. Well, except for the blistering heat. Girl problems? Boy problems? Explosive diarrhea? Daikokuya Ramen is a panacea, no joke.. . So lets start off with the ambiance. I love the old-fashioned ambiance of this place. It's like a legit small ramen shop in Japan, not that I've ever been. The only problem is its hott as balls in there. You sweat right when you walk in, and its even worse when they bring a giant bowl of ramen in front of you. Seriously, I think i sweat into my soup, but I guess it makes it all the tastier.. . The ramen is simply, the tastiest broth that will ever touch your lips. The pork is super fatty and very delicious, and the freakin egg. Soft boiled and soaked in a soy broth? It's serious an orgasm, I kid you not. If I didnt eat the egg, it would probably end up being fertilized before I left the restaurant. ew, half chicken half man. gross.. . anyway, everything here is good. I usually get the combo cause its like 4 bucks more for a bowl of rice + a decent amount of meat. PLUS, you get this salad/coleslaw thing that has this dressing on it. LOOKS like thousand island, and my friends think it is, but i think its like 3.2 times better. There's like a slight sesame tinge to it or something but its freakin delicious.. . Anyway, long story short, this place is my favorite ramen restaurant. Everytime one of my friends is in LA, i force them to try it. Apparently they think that all ramen is like top ramen, and oh em gee i wanna slap them when i hear that. This ramen is seriously life changing. SO GO TRY ITTT!
