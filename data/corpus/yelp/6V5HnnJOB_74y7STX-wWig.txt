Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
If I lived in LA I'd be morbidly obese, thanks to Johnnie's.  . I stepped off a plane, coming home from France, and all i wanted was Johnnie's.  Nothing more could have been better.  Johnnie's has the best pastrami, period.  Nothing, I mean nothing, is wrong with it.  Perfectly fatty, savory without being too salty, tender as can be.... And the pickles!  Garlic pickles! I swear I could write poetry about them.  The fries are crinkle-cut, as any good fry should be.  . the English language lacks the capacity to describe this place adequately.  it can not be described-only experienced.  sitting in the booth with the best dang pastrami you've ever had and surrounded by people who know the very same.  Mmm.
