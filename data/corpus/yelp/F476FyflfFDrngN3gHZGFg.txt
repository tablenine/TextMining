Calm down everyone. It's not that awesome.. . The burgers are really good... tried three of them. But everything else was lame. I saw some people get the pickles -- man I would have been pissed if I paid three bucks for a few slices of pickle. It's a freaking condiment for goodness sake. And you don't even need all your fingers to count the fries in one order. Is this the Weight Watcher's menu? Can we get some more fries please? Potatoes are cheap! And the space is terrible -- on a busy night, you might think it's a night club with the all the people standing outside trying to get in. There's like 5 tables in there and 5 parking spaces.. . Tips: If there's no parking, then just keep on driving. You can come back in a couple months when the hype dies.
