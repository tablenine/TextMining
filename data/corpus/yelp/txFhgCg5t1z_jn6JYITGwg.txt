This place is too hyped up.  The garlic noodles are SUPER salty, oily, buttery; the flavor is just way too strong..... the appetizers weren't bad which is why I'm giving this place a 3 star instead of 2.  . . Only go if you have lots of money to spend .... and don't mind eating salty noodles.. . Also, our waitress asked if we wanted wine and we said no.  THen she asked what kind of water we wanted ... ???  She said there's Evian and Evian Sparkling.... we didn't know tap was a choice.... and got suckered into ordering Evian water which was $7 a bottle..... *sigh.
