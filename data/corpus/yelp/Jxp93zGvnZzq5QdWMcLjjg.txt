3.5 stars for overall experience.. 3 for ambiance.. 4 for service.. 5 for amount of food.. . I'm actually not sure I get the hype - or maybe I was just expecting too much, but I really wasn't overly impressed when I took my bf to Brazzaz for his birthday.  . . Overall the service was pretty good and the food was ok.  The caveat here is that I am not a pork eater and thus, some of the meats had to pass me by.  That said, I liked the salad bar (though it's not really a salad bar) but thought it would be bigger.  The bf liked the meat (and he ate the pork).  It gets a little overwhelming after awhile.  When I looked down and had a pile of chicken and beef covering my entire plate I knew I had had enough.  I should have turned the "more meat token" over a lot sooner, but I liked the garlic steak guy and I felt bad saying no.  Seriously, he was really nice in a "makes you want to eat more red meat" kind of way.. . I definitely recommend this place for the meat lover in your life.  I just don't plan to go back.  Or maybe I will, next time I need a garlic steak fix - we'll see.
