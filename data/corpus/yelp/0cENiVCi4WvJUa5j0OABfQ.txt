Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
Lala's is a great place to enjoy a pitcher of sangria after a day of shopping on Melrose. Â The food is not memorable, however the chimichurri and bread is delicious.. . Skip the indoor seating and sit on the patio. If you looooooooove people watching, this is the place!
