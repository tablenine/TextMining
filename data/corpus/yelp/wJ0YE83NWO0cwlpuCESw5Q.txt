Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
This place is far and away the best Thai food I've ever eaten (and I've tried at least a dozen in Chicago). What was so good? The flavors zinged in my mouth. Almost every adventurous menu decision was rewarded with a taste adventure. The duck curry with lychee gets two enthusiastic thumbs up, as does the shrimp with on sugar cane skewers. Even old standards tasted fresh and exciting (pad see ew and pad Thai). This place is also BYOB and all the entrees are between five and seven bucks. The only gaffe? The fried quail appetizer was like deep-fired baby fetuses- greasy, leathery, and unsubstantial.. . But I'm thankful to Sticky Rice for reinvigorating my interested in Thai cuisine, which I was finding recently to be a bit blah. Ant egg omelet? Maybe next time.
