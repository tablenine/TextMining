I haven't eaten a whole lot of pastrami since I've moved to LA, but this place might have the best I've had in the city yet. I stumbled into this place while waiting for my car to get fixed with no idea what I was in store for. Not only is their pastrami good, but so far it's the only place I know of that serves good quality beers along with it, which makes it all that much better.
