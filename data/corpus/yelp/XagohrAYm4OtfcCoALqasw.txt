The saying sharing is caring is certainly reinforced in this place...the portions are sooooooo HUGE that if you don't share you might have to be wheeled out. Can someone say food coma? . . The french toast is pretty damn good...fluffy interior with a nicely grilled exterior, not overly indulgent and a lot to go around. The Bailey's and Kahlua pancakes were certainly not your conventional pancakes (like most of their menu). Better eat quickly otherwise the Bailey's and Kahlua will overwhelm the dish...it was like eating alcohol! . . Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and definitely going back to try the cabrello (its the giant breakfast burrito) CANT WAIT!
