This is my latest obsession. I've always got at least half a dozen frozen bon-bons from here in my fridge. YUMMY!!!.  Although I would LOVE IT if they made more fruity flavored ones (like mango and lychee), but i''m pretty happy with their strawberry, mint, coffee, and black and white flavored ones.  They're 3 for a $1. Not bad for a really fresh dessert.  (they make them daily!). . I've also bought their Drumsticks! (huge but not that great); Ice cream sandwiches (was a little soggy) and Ice Cream Bars (oh so good - Banana ice cream with Butterscotch and Roasted Almond crunchy coating - my fav!!!).. . They've got cakes too, but haven't tried them yet. Enjoy!! and have bon-bon for me!! xoxox
