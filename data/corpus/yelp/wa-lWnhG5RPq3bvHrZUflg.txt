Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: Bars
The food here is a little pricy, but it's great!  This coffee shop gone restaurant offers some pretty interesting dishes.  All the food is organic there, which I like.  My only complaint is atmosphere.  I was there for lunch the other day, and ended up sitting by a table to screaming kids.  I suffered through my food while I watched the two (obviously rich) mothers completely ignore the fact that their children were bothering everyone!  I guess they gave the nanny the day off.  . . Anyway, the best part of going there is the great service.  Everyone there is very knowledgeable and attentive to your needs.  I will go back, but not until school is back in!
