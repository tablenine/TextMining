Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
I love this place. The food is simple, yet amazingly good. The "Grill" part of the restaurant name is there for a reason- don't go expecting some hoity-toitie, coat &amp; tie exotic cuisine affair. You don't need to coat or the tie. Hell, probably don't even need pants. What matters is the food, which is authentic and fresh. And the pre-meal bread plate with Chimichurri sauce doesn't hurt either.. . Oh, and then there's the Sangria.
