Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Talk about living up to your name!  Best Fish Taco in Ensenada is a small walk-in taco joint at Hillhurst Ave. and Prospect Ave. in Los Feliz that has exactly 2 menu items: Fish Tacos and Shrimp Tacos.  You'd think the lack of variety would be a turn-off, but holy crap are these things good!  The fish and shrimp are fresh and prepared before your eyes, and the owner, Joseph, recommends a variety of home-made salsas and condiments to add on.  The hot mango salsa and avocado salsa are just unreal.  . . The decor is cool and indoor seating is provided while you chow down.  The prices are just $1.50 for fish tacos and $2.00 for shrimp tacos.  Keeping in mind that these are bigger and fresher than your average taco truck and this makes B.F.T.I.E. my new favorite place.  Seriously.. . This place just opened up a few days ago, so stop in for unparalleled food and unparalleled friendly service.  I can see this place blowing up in the months to come, it is a great addition to a neighborhood already packed with great, cheap eats.. . The first fish taco is one the house, so there's absolutely nothing to lose, and everything to gain.
