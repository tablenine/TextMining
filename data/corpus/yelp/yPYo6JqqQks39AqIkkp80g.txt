I'm giving them 4 stars for their yummy and reasonably priced little cakes and croissants(guava and cream cheese is my favorite), but as a vegetarian, there isn't much else. The potato balls and media noche sandwiches all have meat. The one time I tried a veggie sandwich, I wasn't impressed...at all. The ice blended coffee drinks are tasteless, the bread is dry and the banana chips are so-so.. Edit: I have to add cheese rolls to the list of things that are absolutely delicious here. They are buttery, sweet, flaky and cheesy...yum.
