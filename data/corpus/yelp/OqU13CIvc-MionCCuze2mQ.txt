OK, for starters, I totally thought this place was brand new to my neighborhood! I even told my friend it maybe was open 6 months. So, I asked the staff and he told me 4 years, where have I been?. . When I arrived I was a bit confused because they told me I could wait in the bar. Well, when you walk in you do not see the bar, it is in a room adjacent to the main dining room! The staff was very nice and when my party arrived, the host actually remembered my name and used it when addressing me. I thought it was a nice touch. They did sit us at this very strange table for 2 in the middle of the dining room and it felt like we were on stage or something. We did ask to move and they were accommodating. . . I am a huge fan of Mexican food, just love it (which is another reason why this is so crazy that I didn't know about this place in my neighborhood). At first I wasn't sure if I should get the enchiladas or tacos. Since I always order enchiladas I went for the tacos and what a list to choose from! I finally decided on skirt steak, battered shrimp and beef tenderloin tips. My favorite was probably the skirt steak because the chipotle mayo was delicious. The battered shrimp was just as good with the avocado crema! I should also mention they made me a delicious mojito to go with my tacos! . . Couldn't even fit any desert into my tummy, so that just means I have to go back!
