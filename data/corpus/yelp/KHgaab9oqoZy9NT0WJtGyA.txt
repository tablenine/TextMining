Alright it was good, I can't deny that one, Â but was it the best...Well we went here last night before seeing a show at the El Rey. I ordered the Port &amp; Stilton Burger, which has bleu cheese &amp; onion cooked in Port. Meat was cooked perfect slightly rare and the buns were great, however it wasn't the best. Hubby had the Unami Burger, which had a Parmesan Crisp on top, great touch, also cooked perfect. Fries sucked, we ordered their signature fries, that are cooked 3 times, flavorless. I washed mine down with a Grape Crush &amp; hubby had Orange Crush, all for $33. Would I go back, maybe, I wouldn't mind trying the Manly Burger. Honestly The Counter &amp; Slaters reign supreme in my book
