I came here on a date once.  Great date, she picked this place out.  It was obvious she knew what was up!  This place was really very good.  They have a large menu with a large variety of selections.  I mean, Brazilian Denny's anyone?  That's what it reminds me of.  . . The chicken stroganoff was to die for, if not exactly 'Brazilian.'  . . Their sangria is good, too, but not amazing.  Make sense?
