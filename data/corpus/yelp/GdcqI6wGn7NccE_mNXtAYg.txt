Restaurant: Apres Diem
Category: French
The current bartender at Apres Diem has totally messed up the Pimm's Cup recipe. I convened with some girls there last night, excited to sip what I used to consider the best Pimm's Cup in the city: a fizzy libation swimming in lemon pulp. However, the drink I received was flat and accented with middle-aged julienned cucumber. . . Sorry, Apres, but Parish now has overtaken your Number One title. . . We were supposed to catch the new Sex and the City flick at the Midtown Art Cinema next door but ended up talking at the table instead. Apres was advertising a pretty sweet Sex and the City-themed deal. For just $20, patrons receive a movie pass, a martini and an appetizer.. . I noticed a herd of drunken women screaming and stumbling from their outdoor table toward the movie theater. I suppose they had more than just one cocktail...
