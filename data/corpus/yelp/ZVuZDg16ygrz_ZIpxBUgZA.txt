the burgers are amazing, the slaw is amazing, the chili and soups are completely transcendent. its a great place to sit and chow down on good, yummy, comfy food. . . also, the staff is completely rad. super nice dudes, all around. . . if you dont feel like dropping a ton of cash at blue ribbon next door (or jostling for a table), this is a much cozier, equally tasty alternative.
