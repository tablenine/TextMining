Yum.  I love grilled cheese passionately and this was a solid grilled cheese - the bread was thick and the cheese mixture tasty.  Also, it comes with perfectly creamy tomato soup?  You can't beat that.. . On Monday night,  martini's are $5, which was a great deal.  The atmosphere was laid back and the service was solid.. . My only complaint is that the tater tots were a bit cold and not exactly as dreamy as i had hoped.  I was hoping for some crispy fried tots...and these were cold and just a bit too soft.
