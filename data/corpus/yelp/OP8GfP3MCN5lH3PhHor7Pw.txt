Very "Hollywood" and trendy. I like the red decor. I went with a group of friends and had a good time but when it came to the food.... bleh!. . It was expensive and not even good! I bet most people don't even come here for the food but just to be "seen"... If you want that, then just stay downstairs at the bar. A word of advice for "real sushi lovers" like me... (I'm talking about sashimi and sushi; salmon, tuna, yellowtail, unagi, etc.) and I'm not talking Â to you California roll fanatics (that's fake sushi btw), DO NOT COME HERE FOR GOOD SUSHI!
