I have recently started frequenting the Brookhaven area due to being at a new office near there.  My co-worker and I really like the Hudson Grille when we don't know what else we're in the mood for because it's just good, standard (tiny bit upscale) bar food.  The place is huge with tons of flat-screen TVs for your sports-watching pleasure.  It reminds me of Taco Mac but is a little darker with heavy, dark wood walls and other decor.  Both times I've been I've had excellent waiter service from two different waiters.  . . As for food, I've had the ahi tuna wrap which was a delicious, healthy option.  It had lots of veggies in it with a light, tasty sauce.  I've also had one of their burgers (philly burger with sauteed peppers and onions) which was cooked the way I ordered it and was just a great burger that I devoured every bit of (that was on a not-so-healthy day!).  My only complaint was that there weren't alot of sauteed peppers/onions on it like I had expected from the description on the menu.  The fries were crisp and well-seasoned.  My co-worker took me here on my birthday so we shared a brownie sundae which was completely awesome, although we both agreed we felt sick afterward from sugar and ice cream overload.  I'm sure it had something to do with the entire burger and fries I had just eaten, too :). . I've never been to Hudson Grille at night but I've seen where they have good martini specials every night for $6 and my co-worker claims that they're pretty good.
