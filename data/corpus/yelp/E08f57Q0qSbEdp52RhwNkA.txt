I love, love, love....Daikokuya. After sampling Mr. Ramen (right next door to Daikokuya), Orochan &amp; Kouraku (J-Town), Foo Foo Tei (Monterey Park), Shin Sen Gumi (Rosemead) and I can say that nothing really compares to Daikokuya. The quality of their pork broth, density of their noodles, tender pork slices and bamboo shoots and has got me hooked. I Â also like how they add a lot of chopped green onions. My 2nd favorite dish is the shredded pork bowl. AHHH. It's hard to describe its tender goodness. Sometimes I crave it. . . Despite the 45-60 minute wait time and raised prices -- I am a committed patron.
