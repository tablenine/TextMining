Hands down probably the most authentic Thai restaurant in Chicago. Trust me, I am asian and I've been to Thailand a few times to know. I love all their dishes, but when you eat here it's all about the Northern Thai dishes. There's nothing like it offered anywhere else. If you're looking for a more Americanized Thai meal, then this place is not for you. I think that's why some of the reviews are spotty. You can't come here expecting to eat the same boring pad thai that you can order everywhere else. Though they do offer the standard Thai food like pad thai, curries, etc., which are also good and executed pretty well too. But the main attraction here really are the Northern Thai dishes, especially if you're an adventurous foodie like me. . . Things to try: northern thai sausage, northern thai larb, gang hung lay, kua kai. pad hed poa, gang heart of palm, stuffed fried tofu, somtum salad, young banana blossom salad, tom kha and tom yum soups, sticky rice and mango dessert, and rambutan fresh fruit dessert. Try the fresh coconut drink too, so refreshing.. . Decor: It is pretty casual, bright, and airy. No frills.. . Service: Can be slow at times and it may seem that they have forgotten about a dish, Â but they know what they are doing. It really varies, some days they're spot on and other days they're not. Just depends on how busy the place is, and it always seems to be.
