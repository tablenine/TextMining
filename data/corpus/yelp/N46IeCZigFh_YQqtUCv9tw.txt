Fantastic experience from the minute we walked in the door! We parked with the valet on Linden, walked around the corner to Dogwood, and were immediately greeted at the door. We arrived a few minutes early, so stopped by the bar for a Manhattan and a vodka martini. Perfect classic cocktails from a friendly bartender. We then went to the dining room, where we started with the grits bar (mine with pork belly and chow-chow, hers with crawfish butter). We then moved to appetizers, where I had the sweetbreads and she had the foie gras. So far, we were really digging the place. Our entrees arrived next. I had the scallops with rice, and my wife had the bacon-wrapped halibut. Both were excellent. . . We know where we're bringing out-of-town guests when we want to spoil them with something different!
