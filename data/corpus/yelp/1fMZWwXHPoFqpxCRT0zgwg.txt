Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
It's always an interesting experience every time I come to Pink's, especially when you go late.  Somehow I always get lucky and find parking, yet there is always a huge line.  I prefer to get a hot dog with mustard only with a light spread of their chili.  It's nice that they have an impressive selection of soft drinks as well.  I usually end up getting a cream soda and will split an order of cheese fries with someone too.   It's definitely pig out food but whatever.
