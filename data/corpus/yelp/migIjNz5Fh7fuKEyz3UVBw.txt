Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Fantastic dumplings!  We got the juicy pork (a specialty), the vegetarian, and the red bean for dessert.     The pork dumplings explode in the mouth with juice, and the pork has a great flavor.  The vegetarian dumplimgas were a bit heavy for me - lots of spinach and not as much moisture as the pork.  The red bean was sweet, but not too sweet.. . One thing I would change in the future is to stick to the dumplings... the chicken soup was reminiscent of what I ate in China - a whole chicken cut into pieces and served in the dish as-is, bones and all.  Authentic, but not my taste.
