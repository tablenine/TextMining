Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
I came here for a friend's birthday and had an interesting experience.. The way the restaurant is laid out is pretty chic and Hollywood.  The place actually does remind you of a geisha house.  They have their own dj playing in the back.  So the ambiance is pretty good.. The food.. that's another story.  For very average tasting sushi, I felt it was a bit overpriced.  We ordered some fried calamari rings and various rolls.  Their desserts tasted pretty good though.. If you're willing to overlook quality of good sushi for a great ambiance and a Japanese/Hollywood place, this place could be good for you.  As for me, I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.
