Grossest restaurant bathroom.  Ever.  Last time I ate here, I got sick.  After seeing the ladies' room on my most recent visit, last night, I can only imagine what the kitchen is like.  (I shudder at the thought.  Ew.)  . . My boyfriend got corned beef and pickles to go.  (Thank God.)  Both were really, really good: tender meat and slightly spicy, crisp dill pickles.  But, sorry, I still can't get over that dirty restroom.
