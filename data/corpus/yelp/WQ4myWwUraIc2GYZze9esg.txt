Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
"OMG...Manna is sooo good." At least that's what I heard during my college years and post-graduation from friends and acquaintances. Of course, if people say it's good, my love and I will try it....and so we did.. . We were seated in a communal table with a big party on our left and a smaller party on our right. We had the all-you-can-eat meat for dinner. There was a variety of banchan, which made me satisfied. I love it that our table had a buzzer to call the servers' attention whenever we needed something. . . The meats were okay. I just prefer Soot Bul Gui Rim 2 over this place since the former is smaller and has seafood in their AYCE selection.. . In sum, this place isn't really good for a couple type of Korean bbq dinner; it's more so for big parties as evidenced by the loud and fun atmosphere of this place. Just note that the last time we were here, there was a big yellow sign up that says that big parties can't stay there longer than a certain amount of time due to neighbors complaining about the noise.
