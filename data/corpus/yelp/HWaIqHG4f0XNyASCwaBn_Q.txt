Fresh review.  So fresh that my hands smell strongly of the meat and veggies juice that spills all over your hand as you attempt to pick up the taco.. . First impression:  I expected it to be much more meaty.  I would say the veggies dominate it, but not overpower it.  I had one spicy chicken, 1 short rib, and 1 spicy pork.  By far, the spicy pork was the best, because the flavor of the pork balanced nicely with the toppings.. . I always am a little skeptical of fusion food, but this one just seems to naturally work.  In addition, the flavor sticks with you for a long time.  One hour later after my first taco consumption and the flavor is still bursting in my mouth.. . They ran out of kimchi quesadillas within the first 30 minutes they were at the location, unfortunately...but I guess i'll have to try those some other time.. .
