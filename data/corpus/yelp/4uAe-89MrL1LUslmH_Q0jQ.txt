Relatively good ramen, nice decor, but definitely overpriced.  For a few dollars less, you can get your fix at Ramenya (if you don't mind the possibility of getting a stomach ache).  The broth here is decent, and everything tastes fresh.  There is no crazy wait, but I came at a non-peak time.    . . For a pretty place with slightly above average noodles, I wouldn't come back (mainly due to cost) unless I'm in the area and can't risk getting raging waters (at Ramenya).
