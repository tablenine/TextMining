The salads here are the best, not to mention the amazing carrot-tahini dressing that's drizzled on top.  The burgers are pretty legit as well and I usually get them with the pita bread.  The place itself is nothing too fancy, but I guess decor isn't the real aim here.  The great thing is, everything here is cheap cheap cheap so it's a suitable place to grab something quick and inexpensive to eat.  Plus, it's like a block away from my classes so I'm always there meeting up with people for lunch.
