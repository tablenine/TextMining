I went to Fat Cat for lunch Saturday before heading to Market Days.  The drinks were great  but the food was... meh. . . The Peanut Butter Chocolate Martini was amazing, I can't stop thinking about the peanut butter foam!  I never wanted it to end.. . The Corn Dog Trio was a good idea with a great presentation, but still kinda weak.  There were two skewer each of vienna hot dog, polish sausage, and spicy sausage, but there was only one chunk of meat battered on each skewer.  So it was six bites of food with three huge cups of sauce.. . The chicken skewers were a complete waste of time. There were three tiny pieces of chicken, each the size of my finger, for $7.95. The sauces that came with them were totally incompatible, one yogurt sauce and one soy sauce.  Weird.. . Fat Cat's idea of portions are way off.  The basket of fries could feed a small army, yet the apps were a few bites of food at best.  . . Awesome beer selection and drink list, but on second thought, we should have eaten at Market Days.
