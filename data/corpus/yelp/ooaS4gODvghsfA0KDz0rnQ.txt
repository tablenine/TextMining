Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
This place is definitely pretty good, and the ambience is very old world pub (the menus even have leather covers and wooden backs!). The food is pretty resonably priced, and the cod tenders are pretty good. The french fries are the real winner here, as they are awesome. The brunswick stew is spicy, and you should definitely order it in a bread bowl... yummy. Other than that, they have a lot of good beers on tap, friendly servers, and a cool atmosphere. If you are in Decatur Square, and aren't driving there, this place is definitely worth eating at.
