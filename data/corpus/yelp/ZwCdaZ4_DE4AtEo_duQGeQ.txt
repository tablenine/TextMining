I was unbelievably impressed with Dunlay's!  I got the recommendation from a guy at my barber shop...Bucktown Barber, thanks for the Trim Norm ;-).  So I had my sister coming into town with her husband and my 2 nieces for the weekend 7 and 4 years old.  I needed a place that was kid friendly yet still a good meal and was racking my brain trying to come up with someplace that won't be super busy and that will still serve a good meal.  Dunlay's was perfect!  . . Very Nice environment.  The wait staff was extremely accomidating when I called asking if they could have a table for 5 in 20 minutes...they even offered a booster chair for my youngest niece.  The Food was very good, though my brother-in-law complained about his grilled artichoke appetizer he was elated with his Jambalya.  Everyone else had a great meal.  My sister fell in LOVE with the mashed potatos and my pork chop's were perfect.  They had a kids menu, Which I have found hard to find any place that isn't a chain, it was simple and only had 5 or 6 items but honestly how adventurous are kids with food?  My nieces split a cheese pizza and had IBC root beers.  Did I mention this was on a Saturday night at 6:45.  Seated right away, Great service, nice atmosphere, wonderful food, and kid friendly... Great dinner spot KUDO's to you Dunlay's On The Square!
