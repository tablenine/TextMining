The gist--. 1. Overpriced. 2. No parking lot; only street parking.. 3. Super tiny.. 4. Steady stream of patrons, so if you're looking for a quiet place to study this would not be it.. . The joint is a slight throwback to the '50s, of white hats and thick malt shakes; except catering to those seeking a trendy spot with overpriced fare.. . My friend had the tortilla soup, flavorful with a kick to it; however, considering the current unemployment rate in CA as well as the recovering economy, the prices seem un-American.. . I ordered the hot chocolate, which wasn't hot enough, yet looked pretty with it heaping foam covering the top.  It doesn't hold a candle to xocolata calenta.  It was creamy and sweet but not hot enough.. . Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Hmm.
