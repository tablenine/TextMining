Great place for rolls, mediocre place for sushi, not the place for sashimi.  This place is a hype machine, you even need a number to confirm your reservation when you arrive.  The lack of parking and the forced usage of the valet "since there is no where else to park" is annoying.  All that said I like their rolls, and it's a fun atmosphere.  I may go back, but only if someone else really wants to go.
