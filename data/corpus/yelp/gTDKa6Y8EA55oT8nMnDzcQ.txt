Ambiance, good prices and decent food might just be one reason why this hip Vietnamese joint is popping off every night of the week. Many a hazy stumble across the street to and from ChaCha Lounge have I noticed this lovable date spot.. . I was finally able to check it out and was delighted with the service and interior space. The food is probably not the most traditional but served up nicely. The vegetarian pho was stocked full of all the fixins and the tofu was also quite delish.
