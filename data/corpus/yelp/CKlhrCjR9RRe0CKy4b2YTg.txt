I am a huge fan of this place.  Not only is their beer and wine selection phenomenal, but there food is wonderful too.  The cheese plate is the perfect way to start off the evening.  Their flat breads are great to share with a group of friends and really are excellent.  I have only tried the steak entree, but thought it was very good and I would order again.. . Its true that when crowded the restaurant can get quite loud and you are usually seated very close to the other tables.  But I go more often then I care to admit during the week and always get privacy.  I would highly recommend for a date or a night out with some friends!!
