Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
Came here because I had heard so much hype about it and just had to see for myself. The decor and overall atmosphere of the restaurant is so neat! We were seated on the second floor right above the bar and it was fun seeing all the people mill about and the people dressed as geishas walking around.. . As for the food, it is expensive (but no surprise here), and it was actually pretty decent. We also ordered some drink specials that were pretty good as well.. . Overall, had a great experience...don't know if I'd become a regular here, but I think it's worth trying at least once!
