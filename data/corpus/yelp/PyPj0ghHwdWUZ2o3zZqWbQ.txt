i had the pistachio crusted rack of lamb and my date had the roasted chicken, both were phenomenal. service was fantastic, the best part was the ambiance and mood of the place. the candles, dim lights, romantic and amazing. guys take your dates here, the ladies will love it. make a reservation and while waiting have a glass of wine at the little next door...well next door.
