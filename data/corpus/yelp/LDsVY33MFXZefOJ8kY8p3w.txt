Friends took us out here for my husbands birthday. The second floor feels as if you are in Italy sipping wine on the balcony :) Even though the food we ordered such as the kebab and hummus is things I have grown up with-they were still yummy (almost as good as mom makes, but if your mom doesn't make it you won't know the difference). . So check it out!
