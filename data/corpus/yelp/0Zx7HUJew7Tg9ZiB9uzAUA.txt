Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
When the doors open at Dolce you are going to swear you stepped into an L.A. inspired lounge. Laced with leather tables, draping curtains and even a shimmering chandelier, Dolce takes Atlanta to new heights when it comes to restaurants to rival those in Hollywood and South Beach.. . What did I love about Dolce? The service was to die for. Larissa was an excellent hostess and server for the evening. I enjoyed a succulent lobster and pasta dish that has my mouth watering as I type this review. The timing of the appetizers, Â main course, and dessert was perfect, allowing just enough time to soak up the ambience and the Washington Apple martini shots. . . Rumor has it that investor and That 70s Show cutie Wilmer Valderrama has been spending some time rubbing elbows with guests during the week. The food and atmosphere are enough to get me back in a seat at this sexy new spot for Italian cuisine, but a little celebrity siting never hurts.
