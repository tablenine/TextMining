I'll start with the positives. Good location; the layout, look and feel was great. Gives off the appearance of openness in a relative small space.. . The downsides. Parking is interesting. Valet is really the only option unless you want to walk a few blocks. The deck is pretty much for valet only. . . As with most restaurants, service can make or break a place. Service here was slow and it wasn't even crowded. Not sure why, but to turn people off, having sucky service even before tasting the food is not good.. . Which leads to the food. I think the presentation was nice. I got the beef kabob. The meat varied in taste from bland to over spiced (mostly too much salt). I know this is odd, how can you over season some parts and not get any on others. So after the slow service, the food was barely impressive.. . Two dinners and 2 glasses of wine, $60+ with tip. Based on the food and the service, that is way overpriced IMO.
