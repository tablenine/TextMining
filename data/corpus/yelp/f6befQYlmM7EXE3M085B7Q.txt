We came down to LA with great expectations.. The sausage was very good - authentic. The oyster pancake was okay - the sauce too thin/watery.. The salty crispy chicken was quite good - though note - they 1st fry chicken pieces then cut them into smaller pieces. Some of my favorite places 1st cut the chicken into smaller piece, marinate then fry - more batter!. The shaved ice was wonderful.. The pudding it a MUST!
