Category: American (New)
OK. broken record much??. holeman &amp; finch = sweet nectary goodness.. the dude and i went for a leisurely late-night dinner, and aaaaalmost everything was perfect.... i snagged a couple stools against the wall in the bar area when i walked in--nice peek into the kitchen, but who likes facing a wall?? luckily, a bar table opened up and we made a lightning-quick dash for some better seats.. . our server, Evan, was awesome all night. many props to him, and the rest of the H+F crew that stopped by. drinks were imaginative, and more importantly, delicious. . we stuffed ourselves silly! note to self: next time, bring a couple more people to share all the irresistible items on the menu.. . so the food:. fried oysters were fantastic, and the fried pickles that snuck their way in were very, very welcome.. the steak tartare?? HEAVENLY. seriously. fold a french fry in half, fork some raw meat up on that thang and mmmm mmmm mmmm.. and of course, the 10o'clock burger. it was wonderful. i give the burger five stars. (that being said, i also give the Five Guys burger 5 stars. so...do with that what you will.) THE BUN IS AMAZING. like medianoche bread.. . the only un-perfect parts of this experience??. the chicken liver pat√© was silky and luscious, but it lacked ANY of that wonderful, earthy intensity that i love about chicken livers! it just tasted like whipped butter with a tasty jelly on top. boo.. . and the music. it was obnoxious. when the food and the drinks are that intense, that decadent...i want music that lets me sit and savor and relish in the awesomeness going in to my mouth. the tunes on this particular wednesday night were reminiscent of Ru San's sushi disco. yikes.. . overall...you have no idea how glad i am that i can walk to this place.
