Category: Seafood
Hungry Cat I love you so! HC consistently leaves me content and ready to return. . . Their raw seafood bar has an incredible selection of oysters. You can order just one or two if you like, or a half to a full dozen if you're in the mood for the freshness of the sea. Their peel and eat shrimp, so lightly sprinkled with sea salt and olive oil, are also great for a starter. I recommend paying the extra $2 to have them peeled because once they arrive, you won't want to waste any time. . . HC main dishes are creative and well proportioned, usually building off seasonal ingredients from the nearby farmers market. They leave me feeling healthy and like I've stretch my foodie legs for the day. This is a great place to share dishes because there's so much to explore that you'll want to try one of everything.. . The cocktails are always incredible with fresh fruit juices and unique infusions. Wine lovers have a great range to choose from.. . The location surprised me at first, but I've grown to like it. The ambiance is fresh, friendly, modern, and lively. You can stroll down the street to Arclight or Amoeba if you're looking for something nearby to do afterward.. . Sunday seems to be the best for the brunch crowd, but be sure to make a reservation. Weeknights are more mellow, but still have a warm buzz of people of all ages.
