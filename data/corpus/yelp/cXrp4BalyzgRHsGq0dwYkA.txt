Talk about chow-down. . . Expect to eat with your hands. Be warned, your hands will get MESSY. Piece of advice, take your hand jewelry off (rings, watches, bracelets and etc...) unless you want to get those yummy sauces on them. . . This place was still packed when we arrived at 9:15pm on a Sunday night (they close at 10pm BTW). We still have to wait for our table (about 10 minutes). Can't imagine if we've gotten there during dinner rush hours. . . The food was OK to my standard being it was my first time there and I have not tried most of the menu. The sauces was good though, it did have the Cajun spices PUNCH. I will go back but would seriously consider ordering to-go to avoid long wait.
