Well, dinner is a full experience for me with a combination of great conversation, great food, and great atmosphere. I went there for lunch on a Saturday with my friends - so had the great conversation part. But other two were unfortunately missing. The menu is excellent - you feel like eating everything! I started with a bisque, and it was good. However, my entree, shrimp ravioli, as good as it sounded on the menu, was not good at all - too much sauce that you can't even taste the ravioli (or visually observe it:) ). Wine menu is quite good though! Atmosphere - I just don't do this office-like, Â hip but boring, almost-too-modern-that-character-is-gone type of places. It feels like being in a high class prison cafeteria! . Overall - I don't think I'd go again unless required.
