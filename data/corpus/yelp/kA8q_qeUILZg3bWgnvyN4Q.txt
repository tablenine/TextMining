Three stars for the food, and an extra imaginary star for the dog-friendly patio seating, extra friendly staff and for the vegetarian-friendly offerings (even though I'm obviously not a vegetarian now, I use to be and appreciate the options).  Total: 4 stars. . The Pho is a bit faux, but I anticipated that it wouldn't be the "real" deal before having a seat, so it was fine. . . My friends and I stopped by for lunch on Sunday after a walk around the reservoir.  I skipped on ordering my own bowl of Pho (but sampled some of my friend's Pho) and went straight for going halfsies on a pork sandwich and beef noodle bowl with another friend.  I was curious what "chips" would taste like with what I assumed would be a Vietnamese sandwich. Low and behold, the chips weren't Lays or Doritos, but round, crispy and tasty shrimp chips! A great combo with an Asian-inspired baguette sandwich.  Again, the sandwich wasn't your authentic $3.50 Vietnamese sandwich with mystery meat, but it was good and I would come back just for that combo alone (I believe it was $8.50 for the sandwich, chips and coleslaw combo).. . So, in short, pass on the faux Pho, come for lunch and head straight for the sandwich.
