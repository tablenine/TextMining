Rated as one of Zagat's best steak houses in the U.S. (and certainly Atlanta), it was an amazing meal. My son thought the food was so good that he asked for the Chef's autograph (seriously). And guess what? He got it! We all got steaks, and I also got lamb and pheasant sausage, and it was incredible. The waiter suggested a petite sirah, and it was incredible.. . The broccoli was perfect, and the corn pudding was incredible. . . Overall, the meal was expensive, but the food was divine. I wholeheartedly recommend this place. . . On our way out the manager gave the kids free boxes of shortbreak cookies, another waiter gave my son a stack of notepads, and we got autographs from Leonard, the chef. It was an awesome meal with incredible customer service.
