Restaurant: Hackney&#39;s Printers&#39; Row
Category: Burgers
Unfortunately, Hackney's is not all it's cracked up to be.. . The fries were amazing, and the beer aplenty, but the burger left a little to be desired.  I ordered the Inside Out Burger which has bacon and cheese cooked into the patty.  First off, the bun was like something that I could have purchased from my local Jewel; small, mediocre tasting, and all in all low quality.  The patty was good, but again, something I was not expecting from Hackney's.  . . I'd say this would be a a go-to joint for if you are already in the area and needed a quick meal fix.  Add in a few more points for the unique atmosphere.
