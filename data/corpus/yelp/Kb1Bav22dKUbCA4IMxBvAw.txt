Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
I recently became acquainted with Porto's and I'm in food heaven :) The bakery is amazing with their custom cakes, empanadas, and vast array of other tastey treats BUT the food is equally amazing! . . I took some of their tortilla soup home yesterday and it is among the top of the list of tortilla soups I have had anywhere. Still yet, I am taken back by the deliciousness of the potato balls. They are absolutely delicious. A must try!. . I have a feeling that there will be many more trips to this delicious eatery.
