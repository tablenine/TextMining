WHERE'S THE BEEF?? at LAWRY's.. =). . Ok so I get to this place.. and Im like UHHH I didnt dress for it.. not that you need too.. As soon as I get there we are seated! Taken to this lil room (mini-ballroom style) private and cozy.. . Im not much of a beef eater, so Im thinking what the hell did I come here for? As I take my first bite.. I start thinking OH MY....soo soft, so tender, sooooooooooo delicious!!!! the portions are not too small not to big, there just RIGHT!!! the sides even better! . . Come to think of it.. I dont remember if the hostess was polite or not! Guess it didnt matter with great food like that.. I still came out with a BIG SMILE on FACE!!!. . GREAT, GREAT BEEF!!!
