Restaurant: Francesca&#39;s Forno
Category: Italian
This place is solid and certainly carries on the quality and value I have always associated with the other Francesca's restauarants. Brunch and dinner are very reliable.  The regular menu and specials always have something for everyone.  The service is solid but not spectacular.  The dinner service always seems to be much better than the brunch service.  This place moves people much better than the other Francesca's restauarants I have been too and doesn't have the long waits (that I specifically associate with their Lincoln Park location).
