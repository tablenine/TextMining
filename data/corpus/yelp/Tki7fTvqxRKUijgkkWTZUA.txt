Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
For all the Chicago Steak Lovers out there, its time to add a new name to the usual repertoire.  Being the diligent researcher I am, I stumbled across David Burke's while looking for good restaurants to visit during Chicago Restaurant Week.  Even though I had never heard of them, they had a great menu and are owned by the same group that introduced Bluewater Grill (as well as a slew of NY eateries).  I decided to give them a shot- I'm glad I did.  . . David Burke's Primehouse has both a great menu and staff without the pretentiousness or noise of some 'other' local joints.. . With minimal signage, the restaurant is easy to miss.   The big red leather booths were spacious and comfy enough to sit and gorge for hours.  The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable about the aging process.  They were also upfront and honest about the hits and misses of the restaurant week menu. . . My husband and I shared the the pretzel crusted crab cake and the steak carpaccio served atop a block of Himalayan rock salt.  For the main course, I suggest the 55 day aged rib-eye.  If you are up for an education in steak aging, any staff member can tell you about the giant salt wall and how the length of time changes the flavor of meat. (We were pointed to the 55 day aged as opposed to the 70 day age based on our preferences in flavor/texture).  Another interesting fact: All steaks served are sired by the same bull.  . . I haven't made it here for brunch yet and I definitely plan on coming back.
