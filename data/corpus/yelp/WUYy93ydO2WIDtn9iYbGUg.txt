I didnt eat here and i didnt get any specialty drinks. I stuck with beer and enjoyed hanging with old friends and some new friends. The place is nice, and has a neat atmosphere. No dancing and nothing special. The only really cool thing is the entrance which mimics a japanese corridor like the one in Memoirs of a Geisha
