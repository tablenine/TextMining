This is one of my favorite restaurants in the whole city.  I think. . . See, every time I go to this restaurant, I get very, very drunk.  This is because there is always a wait for a table here.  Which means you end up at the bar, drinking mojitos.  The mojito is one of the most magical cocktails ever and it's easy to drink, oh, I don't know..... 5 or 6 or 7 of them?  (I should note that this can be an expensive endeavor since their mojitos are $7 a pop and go down your throat like sweet glasses of ice water.). . Still, drunk or not, the food is very, very good.  My favorite dish here is the ropa vieja (which translates into 'old clothes'): it's a plate of shredded beef, simmered in a tomato sauce, served with black bleans, rice and boiled plaintains.  Delicious!  Their fish dishes are also quite good, and I'm a huge fan of their crema de elote soup (when they have it, anyway.... it's usually a special).  Also, the chipotle butter that comes with the bread basket is incredible.  I could eat it without bread, even.. . For dessert I'm all about a couple more mojitos and some coconut and passionfruit sorbet.  Or if I'm feeling really adventurous and self-loathing (because I know if I keep it up I'm headed for a hangover), I'll order one of the best-made caipirinhas in the city.. . The restaurant itself is very attractive...... exposed brick, candles and white tablecloths, funky art on the walls.  My girlfriends and I love to go here before a night of debauchery, but it's a good date restaurant too.. . Definitely check this place out!
