Home of my favorite servers in the city.. When I know I'm going to Sotto Sotto, I spend the night before planning what I am going to eat.  My 7 year old nephew wants to buy the place so he can live in it and eat there every day.  . It's that delicious.  . It's usually busy, but I've never felt rushed.  . It's got Amarone and Prosecco by the glass, heaven!. It's not a huge place and tables are close together, so it's not the place to go if you want to sprawl.  . . There's free valet around the corner, use it.
