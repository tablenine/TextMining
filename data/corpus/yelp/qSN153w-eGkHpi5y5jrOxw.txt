The food at Craft is absolutely delicious. Great flavors that are simple and to the point.  The roasted Wagyu beef was to die for (the marrow was an added extra delight).   The Sonoma lamb - yum!  To top it off you must have the Salty Chocolate Tart (whenever it appears on their menu;  Menu changes often).  Servings were larger than I thought they would be.   Everything is ordered a la carte, so if you are eating family style, it might not be necessary for everyone in your party to order a main course item.. . The atmosphere may seem a little intimidating, but the staff is very friendly and service is top notch.   . . They even gave us a little gift to walk away with - a yummy blueberry muffin to have for breakfast the next day!
