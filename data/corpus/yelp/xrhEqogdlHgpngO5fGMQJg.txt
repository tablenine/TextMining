So this is probably going to be a somewhat biased review, as the only time I have eaten here was on the day of my wedding when my husband and I eloped. Since we didn't really think ahead of time to make a reservation somewhere and we didn't want to wander around Chicago all night, we somehow ended up here.. . Truth be told, I think this place is a little confusing. When you come in, it's all swanky piano bar-ish and you think you're going to be dining with that feel, but then they take you to an area with a bunch of packed in tables that you can hardly maneuver through if you need to use the bathroom. . . Overall, I'd say the food and service are well worth a little careful planning before taking a leak. (Speaking of taking a leak, they have someone in the bathroom to get a hand towel for you. I think you're supposed to tip them, so take a couple bucks with you to the can. Also, the lady who got my hand towel for me was eating some greasy chicken wings. Again with the confusion at this place.). .  My steak was a cooked well and my husband's seafood was delicious. The waitress was super nice and available without being overbearing. She also brought us some champaign when she found out we'd just gotten married and hooked us up with some free dessert as well. Although this place was tasty, I don't know if I'd pay the money for what it is on a normal day.
