The salad box is a wonderful idea, although it's a total wolf in sheep's clothing. Between the falafel, fried eggplant, fried cauliflower, coleslaw, fried broccoli, and assortment of sauces, this "salad" is definitely not healthy. Must they fry everything?!. . But it's cheap... and who hasn't drooled at a falafel shop's toppings bar, wishing you could have a bucket rather than a skimpy pita pocket? Meet your bucket: the salad box. Certainly a good meal when you feel low energy, low fuss, and no frills.
