They don't know the difference between a shake and a malt! Every time I order a malt, they give me a chocolate shake. The service is also very slow. The pastries are OK. I had a lemon bar, it wasn't great. I made a comment on Twitter about not getting malt in my chocolate malt. @themilkshop responded to me asking about my experience saying they "wanted to make it up 2" me. I responded and they ignored my response. The next day I reminded them that I responded, per their request, about my experience. They respond saying "sorry to hear that. We are working on improving our shakes... Thank you for bringing it to our attention." Wow. How does that make it up to me?? And, I didn't have a problem with a shake, it was a malt. That's just poor customer service. They asked me about my experience and then do nothing about it. They stopped following me on twitter and even blocked me from following them... Talk about childish. I'll never go there again. They don't have malts, the chocolate shake wasn't good and they certainly lack customer service.
