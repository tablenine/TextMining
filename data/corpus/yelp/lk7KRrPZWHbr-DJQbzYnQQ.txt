I love sushi. This place seemed authentic. The nigiri was awesome, I tried for some new types of fish and loved them all. . . BUT when I ordered the tuna sashimi, I was unpleasantly surprised with the strong taste characteristic of unfresh fish. It was even a bit beyond that, even a heavy dousing of soy sauce could not tame this putrid sting. PLUS the salmon was cut too think and had a bit more "chew" that I appreciate in good raw salmon. . . From the reviews, I felt deceived because people seem to love this place. I have had better fish from Americanized sushi places at cheaper prices, which to me seems pathetic. This place is in what feels like a mini-Japan/Tokyo town for crying out loud! I was expecting much more than this place delivered. . . I am scarred and will not return. And cash only is eff-ing annoying, get a card machine, it's 2010!
