this place has been around for over 20 years and the reason is the food. very authentic, especially the kimchees, with no "americanized" dishes. i went here as a child, moved away for 10 yrs, and returned, but food hasn't changed thank god. favorites are chadolbaegi, yookgaejang, moolnaengmyun, sollungtang. some dishes that are popular with my american friends include japchae, manduguk, ojinguh bokum, and of course galbi. place has no ambience whatsoever, wait svc is always rushed during peak hours 6:00-9:00 (even if you're korean, which i am). tip for the newbies: if you want to cook at the table, order the non-marinated meats, or order at least 3 portions of the marinated meats. otherwise they will cook it for you. they only do the tableside post-meat rice saute if you order a non-marinated meat. also if you like your roasted fish, but prefer not to have it staring at you while you eat, ask them to cut the head off for you before serving.. .     * Pros: REAL Korean food like mom makes, fresh side dishes, great kimchees, tableside kimchee fried rice.     * Cons: service can be rushed, wait staff not fluent in English although getting better about this in the last few years
