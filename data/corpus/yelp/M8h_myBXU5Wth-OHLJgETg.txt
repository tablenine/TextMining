one star is for the burger.  yes, it's a Father's Office knockoff at a much higher price, but what gourmet burger in LA these days doesn't try to aspire to grow up to be the excellent FO burger?  . . the other star, for the terrific wine rec.  . . the three MISSING stars, however, are for the following:. - tough, dry fried clams. - flatbreads were just "eh". - blah tomato soup. - the grease-coated, acid indigestion feeling that i and two of my friends were left with afterward.  we couldn't even work - i just had to go home early, lie down, stare miserably at the ceiling, and mentally shake my fist at ben ford.  . . is it any wonder that when i saw him on a food network competition, i was actively rooting for him to lose?  (wonder of wonders, he actually won the whole damn thing.)
