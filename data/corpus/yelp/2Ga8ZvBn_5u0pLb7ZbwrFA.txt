Ventured out early pre-Cubs game on Saturday for breakfast.  I had treated myself to a cookie or two now and then, but never ate in their dining area.  Thought we would have to wait a bit on a Saturday morning, but we were seated pretty quickly.. . Breakfast menu was good - all the staples (eggs, pancakes, gourmet french toast) and the waiter informed us of the chef's special.  Coffee/espresso was perfect.  My breakfast burrito was huge and delicious and my husband had a yummy omelet with all sorts of veggies inside.  . . All in all a good experience and would return for breakfast or dinner.  Also price was reasonable - comparable to any other breakfast/brunch place in town.
