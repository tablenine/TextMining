Great food.  Mediocre service.  The dumplings are truly fantastic but I have to bring my rating down to a 3 star because the service is so lacking.  I've been here 2 dozen times and I'm never quite happy with the service.  They also don't clean up the tables quickly when people leave so there are always dirty tables when you get seated.  HOWEVER, it is WELL WORTH your time to experience the incredible dumplings.  . . .  Lastly, there is almost always a line even though they have opened another full restaurant next door with the same exact food.
