I wanted to hate this truck. I really did. So I went out to find this truck to try it at least once because it usually isn't fair to deride something until you try it.. . The wait is horrendous, from getting in line to getting the food in my mouth...it took more than 2.5 hours.. . The tacos were sadly disappointing. However, the burritos, kimchee quesadilla and sliders were ridiculously good. . . Also, the owner was really cool.. . My bottom line is that for tacos and burritos....try it once if you have to but the Calbi truck does better tacos and arguably equivalent burritos. However, the Kogi truck does have a lot of culinary creativity that makes them exceptional. Hopefully, after the initial rush has died down and the imitators start to whittle their lines down , the Kogi truck can have more interesting culinary adventures.
