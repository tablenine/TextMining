I like Do Jo, and I used to be a regular (when I was down at NYU all the time).  I think Zagat gave it something ridiculous...like an 8 for food or something.  I think the food is pretty good and consistent.  I mean, it's a cheap NYU hang...what does Zagat expect?  I like the turkey burgers, grilled chicken salads, sesame noodles, soba noodles, etc., etc.  It's filling, it's fast (for the most part), it's cheap.  Full bar.  Recommended.
