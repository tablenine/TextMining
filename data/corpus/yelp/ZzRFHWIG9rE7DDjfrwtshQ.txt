5 stars to the ambiance. This place really is a surprise after you pass the small entry. This is a definite romantic little spot. . . 3.5 stars for the food. It had good presentation and tasted alright, but was somewhat over priced for the quality. I've definitely tasted better for the same price. Also, our appetizer and main course were barely luke warm.
