It's always exciting when I drag my butt up to this part of town to over-eat here. It's a little pricy but I never feel ripped-off because I always bring home leftovers. The milkshakes, cheese fries, french toast, and gnocchi are MUSTS, so go with lots of people so you can share!. . The atmosphere is really cozy and they always play great music (Lemuria and Pavement!). They are also open late, so this place makes a great visit after the bar, which are quite common in the area. But don't go in here plastered, I've seen them kick out obnoxious drunks before!
