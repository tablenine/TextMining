I have Â to agree with a previous yelper. Their Pomegranate Lemonade is a glass full of heavenly goodness!!. . Pork carnitas were soooo good. Melted in my mouth. Not your run of the mill restaurant carnitas. They paired it with yummy white cheddar grits, an odd but perfect match. We all shared, so I also had a chance to sample their steak, ceviche, and spinach empanadas which were a treat to say the least.. . With dinner being such a hit, we could not resist ordering dessert. Shared the Torta de Tres Leches with yummy pear and passion fruit sauces...OMG to DIE for!! We could not get enough of it.. . Will definitely make the long drive out again. My husband will love this place. Although the portions will be a bit too small for him, lol.
