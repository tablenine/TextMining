Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
Great service and go mostly for ambience; well-sized portions of standard fare. Â Been there 3 times and ordered a so-so linguini with clam sauce each time. On the salty side, but let the waitress know, and she rectified the problem. Thin crust Calo pizza is the way to go.
