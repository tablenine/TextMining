Can someone say Potato Ball's? Who would have thought that a fried ball of mashed potatoes with meat inside good be so tasty? Well..it is! I was introduced to Porto's through their potato balls and I enjoyed an entire meal for the first time today. The place was very busy , but the service didn't suffer. They have unique menu items and many Cuban influenced dishes. My new favorite treat was a plantain stuffed with black beans... savory and sweet mixed together!
