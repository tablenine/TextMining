Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
Since steak was not in heavy rotation in my household growing up, I have always been afraid to order a steak anything less than medium well (travesty, I know).  I am somewhat happy to say that my last experience at Parkers has made me a convert.  Though we ordered the same cut, Big Hungry's steak was thick, juicy and a pretty red hue while mine much thinner and not more than a shade lighter away from well done.  One bite of mine followed by one bite of his - I am now a medium rare steak girl.  While the steaks were flavored and cooked perfectly, we both could not figure out how they were getting away with their sides.  The mushrooms were good, but nowhere near great.  The creamed spinach was essentially sautéed spinach then some cream thrown in - just "so-so" to say the least.  What would be four stars is down to three.
