hell fucking yes!!!!!!! this place is off the hook! the chicken was hella good. i got the 22 with 2 tighs, greens, mac and cheese and cornbread. "itis" set in almost immediately. i couldnt even pay my bill before i started nodding off. the rice and gravy were ok... but i wish they had one in the bay area!
