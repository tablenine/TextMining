Totally and utterly forgettable. The only thing that tasted really garlicky was the garlic oil for the bread! Meatloaf was subpar, lamb was dry. Very disappointing for a $70 meal. Ordered the mini pizza as an appetizer.. let's put it this way - a frozen one would have tasted about the same. I'm super bummed because I had really looked forward to trying this place. Don't waste your money.. and if you do, bring your own garlic!
