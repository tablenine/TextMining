absolutely delicious. had the chipotle bbq sandwhich and my lady friend had the santa fe crispy chickin', both with the sweetheart (sweet potato) fries. probably could have done with one side of fries because they're pretty rich. . . it's on the high side of 1 "$", but totally worth it for some fast food grub done veg, and done right.
