Oh man. Whether your vegan, vegetarian, or omnivore, you will love this place. It's so nice to be able to enter a restaurant and not have to ask, "is this vegetarian? For real?". . Most of the food is fantastic. My favorite is The Club. The tempeh bacon is sensual and arousing. For omnivores, or those not well versed in vegan flavors, some of the fare is "to taste," in that someone who orders certain foods expecting it to taste like "the real thing" might be disappointed.. . That being said, I'm not a fan of carob, but their mint carob chip cookie...oh gosh. Never mind, I've gotta go now. I have to go get one of those cookies!
