The bakery up front has black and white cookies. This is one of the first things I check when I go to Jewish Deli's. The decor is old school. I had corned beef on rye, not much of a pastrami guy so I don't know. The corned beef seemed like it was boiled a bit too long and so it didn't have that meaty texture, but maybe it was an off night. I almost always get a corned beef on rye and a potato pancake when I go to these places. I liked the corned beef at Junior's better.
