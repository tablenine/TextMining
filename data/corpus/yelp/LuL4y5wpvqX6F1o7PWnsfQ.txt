Restaurant: Fontaine&#39;s Oyster House
Category: Seafood
Fontaine's is a solid spot to stop for a drink when out in the Highlands, but I'd never really make a night of it. It can be kind of a mixed bag, sometimes the crowd's quite a bit older than the typical Highlands demographic. There are not tons of super cute boys here.. . I think it's really pretty inside, I love the clusters of glass lights hanging from the ceiling and the aesthetic is generally nice and pretty classic, with lots of dark wood and fun quotes on chalkboards.. . They have 2.50 Sam Adams drafts here, and other cheap beer specials, and the bartenders make pretty good mixed drinks and are generally nice.. . I've only eaten here once; we sat on the back patio and split french fries and tater tots, and I was in fried potato, post-drinking heaven.
