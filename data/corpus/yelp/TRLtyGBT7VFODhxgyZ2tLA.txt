I work right by this and rarely go here... They have $5 personal stuffed pizzas for lunch... They're "OK" but not even close to as good as the real deal full size stuffed pizza.  And if you ask me, their real deal stuffed pizza isn't that exciting.   And BTW,  Giordano's does NOT have deep dish pizza, they have stuffed pizza.  It's not the same...  Though I actually think I prefer stuffed pizza to deep dish, I don't like  Giordano's  Crust... I much prefer nearby Pizano's.  . . I've never understood why this location can't work something out with Pru Plaza to have a few tables outside...that would make it a cooler place to hang out during or after work if nothing else.. . It's OK in a pinch though.  Their non-pizza food isn't anything to write home about either, but again is OK.
