Cheap movie prices, cheap but good food, drinks served throughout the movie, what's not to like? I always enjoy going here and since the remodel, the service and food have greatly improved. If you don't realize what type of theater this is, an eating and drinking group, then you might be unsettled. Otherwise, great place to unwind, especially on the weeknights!
