Macaron ice cream sandwiches....are you kidding me.... . i love, i love! got the grasshopper which was mint choco. chip ice cream that was dipped in chocolate. mmmmm. although, the chocolate melted all over my fingers, I did not care.. . Also had to get the famous blue velvet cake, because my absolute favorite is anything blueberry! I ate this the next day and it was still very moist &amp; good.. . Note: the place is smaller than I expected but very busy &amp; cute.. . TMI: but, after eating the blue velvet don't be surprised when something else turns blue....in the bathroom.
