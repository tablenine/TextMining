A couple of friends went here due to a groupon coupon and found it just okay. I personally don't think the food is worth the full price if we paid it. We had the lemon and coconut soup which was good and for the entrees, we had the NY steak, ravioli and roasted chicken. We just found the food mediocre and one of my friends was still hungry afterwards so I offered to take him to Flash taco around the corner. One of the desserts was really delish. It was a sampler trio of munchkins, fudge and cookies. The cookies were the first ones to go. Its a definitely a date restaurant with its intimate booths.
