one of your typical trendy "hollywood" spots...  you'd love to hate it, but you can't help going back.  . . now, for me, i'm going back because they sell sugar and dairy laden products.  PERIOD.  . . what can i say?  i love sugar and milk like MJ loves little boys.  I can't keep my hands off them!  their strawberry ice cream sandwich is actually strawberry sorbet in between 2 strawberry macaroons.  whoever invented that  combo is forever in my bestest people EVER list.  . . and their list of shakes, ice cream, gelato, etc....  was extensive.  i am thoroughly excited to explore this list one by one..... . now, what i WASN'T excited about was the baked good section.  the pastries looked like they were made in a middle school baking class.  i thought they should have kept their concept a little tighter.  it wouldn't hurt to get rid of all that unnecessary pastry gobligook and keep it nice and simple...
