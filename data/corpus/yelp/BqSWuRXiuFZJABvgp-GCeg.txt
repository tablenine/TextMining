Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
What a terrific place with a huge selection of drinks and other assorted cafe menu items such as sandwiches, baked goods, etc.  Also, quite a cosy atmosphere.  Only bad part is it is a little bit of a distance from "The El" and from Clark street which makes it a little bit of a hike to get to.  But don't let this stop you, Bourgeois Pig definitely deserves a visit!
