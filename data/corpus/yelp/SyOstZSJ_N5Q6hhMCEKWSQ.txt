#500. . I can't remember a time when I didn't know about Yamashiro's although it was probably sometime in college the desire to go started.  I had one of those snotty roommates who name/label/trend dropped all the time.  "My boyfriend is taking me to Yamashiro's...maybe when you have a boyfriend, he'll take you too!". . Yeah, snotty bitch.. . Fast forward an indeterminate number of years and I finally arrived last night in high style with a beautiful man.  Of course, he's my gay boyfriend but you know, he's better looking that said snotty bitch roomie's boyfriend of the past.  Yeah, yeah, bitter much?. . So, the  hype is the view and not so much the food.  I concur.  Despite the rain, the view was definitely beautiful.  I'm a city girl, I love the city's lights!  . . Yelpers have a habit of spying food and gobbling it all down when the pricetag is $0.00 so I did manage to carry off a couple of little plates worth of sushi when a fresh supply of raw goodies was placed before us.  . . The spicy tuna rolls were interesting with the whole-ish pieces of tuna, rather than finely minced.  The carrot roll was pretty good though I think I may have stabbed myself in the throat internally when I inhaled it.  The yellowtail, salmon and tuna nigiri were fine.  But the quality?  Not the best but with the price tag, fantastic!  Until I ate my last roll and could not swallow it.  Hey!  There's a tiny bit of paper in here.  Hmm.. . The bartenders and staff were super nice which is the fourth star.  I'd come by but perhaps not on a rainy night.  And maybe next time it'll be with a beautiful man who is straight!  Hah!
