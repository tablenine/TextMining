Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
As I took my first bite into the famous father's office burger with carmellized onions and bleu cheese, and as I soaked in the deliciousness of the meat, one thought ran through my head: Ya know what would make this burger even better?  Ketchup.. . There, I said it.  I'm not sure why they insist on their no-ketchup policy.  Even the best burger needs ketchup.  Period.  This is not something that should ever be up for debate.  A burger without ketchup is like Jordan Knight trying a solo career without the rest of the NKOTB.  Okay, maybe that's not a good analogy but you get my point.  Honestly, I am so irritated with their lack of ketchup that I'd probably give the place 3 stars if their incredible beer selection didn't bring them back up a notch.  . Next time I go I'm bringing my own ketchup, and we'll see if there's any redemption.
