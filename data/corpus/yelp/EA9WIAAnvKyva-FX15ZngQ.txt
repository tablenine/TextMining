Been here several times in the last couple years, and only now have I decided to get off my butt and write a review LOL. Anyway, I find that Sushi Gen is best value and best priced Sushi joint in all of downtown LA. I definitely recommend the Sashimi Deluxe for either lunch or dinner; you just can't go wrong with that meal. Of course you do have to be a fan of sashimi to appreciate it hehehe.. . If you're looking for rolls you've come to the wrong place; however, if you have a passion for sashimi/raw fish than this is the perfect place for you.
