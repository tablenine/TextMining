I wanted to try a new Thai food place. I felt bad for cheating on Jim Thai Noodle but I figured...what the heck? There are hundreds of Thai places in Chicago and this one seemed to have pretty steady reviews on yelp so I gave it a shot.. . First plus: they have Pepsi AND Coke. Of course I ordered Pepsi because it is far superior to its ugly step sibling.. . The service was zippy and friendly. They were OK with making my Pad Kee Mow WITHOUT carrots. So that was bomb.. . However, the Pad Kee Mao was just OK. The tofu seemed burnt, which was odd. And there just wasn't enough yummy sauce. Too many shallots, too. I LOVED the Tom Kau soup though. Loved it! Best I've ever had. Perfect little soup to warm the soul and clear the sinuses. Would highly recommend.. . My dinner partner was not so impressed with his Shanghai noodles, calling them overcooked and mushy. Gross.. . I would give this place another shot only because I loved my soup so much. Chances are they make a mean pad thai because, honestly, who doesn't these days?. . Give em' a whirl...everyone else on Yelp seems to love them indicated by its 4 solid stars.
