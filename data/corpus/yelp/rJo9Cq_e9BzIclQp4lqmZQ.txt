Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Definitely thee best dumpling house!!!. . Went here for lunch.  The wait is a little much (1 hour) for any size party.  This is perfect for you light eaters.. . Service here is ok.  There are several waiters running around and you can ask any of them for anything, so getting something shouldn't be hard.. . Dumplings are definitely perfect, super tasty and prepared healthy (steamed!).. . Pricing is just right, after all, it's a dumpling house.  The more you eat the more you pay.. . Loved it!
