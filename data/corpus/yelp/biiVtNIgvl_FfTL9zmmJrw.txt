Every time I go to this place it gets better. Headed down a couple days ago as I wanted some kohada, unfortunately they were out (tuesdays and fridays, I was informed), but the chef suggested some sanma, this was the beginning of the finest sushi experience I've had. While it wasn't omakase, it certainly felt like it, with each serving uniquely prepared, amazing, we truly got the treatment.
