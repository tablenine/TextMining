I had the pastrami sandwich and I liked how they made it, to me a good  pastrami sandwich consists of the meat being 80% and  the bread 20%, that means just enough bread so that your fingers won't get messy from the pastrami and its juicy goodness. Whatever Belgian Fries are, I like it! Someone told me that Belgian Fries, are fries that are fried twice, I don't know about that but I do like the fires here and what was that thing I dipped my fries in? Was that mayonnaise? It didn't look like mayonnaise but I could tell you that there was mayonnaise in it, it sure was good and it beats plan old ketchup any day.  . . If you serve comfort food, then you are my friend and you won't get a crappy review from me, especially if the comfort food is quality and well made like it is here, add to that a  good beer selection of both import and domestic, then its "Yay! I'm a Fan!".....4 stars.. . I been officially retired from eating corporate fast food for sometime now, and if I do go and eat comfort food once in a blue moon, I'd like to have quality food versus quantity. I'm far more willing to pay more for comfort food that I enjoy only once in a while, versus going daily and buying cheap, "dollar menu" food items at some big corporate fast food joint. I say quality over quantity every time.
