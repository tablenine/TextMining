Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm with you Larry, Pink's is a historic icon and gets tons of LA hype, as many of the old-school establishments do around here.  But, the hot dogs are nothing spectacular.  I've been here twice and was wowed neither time, especially since I had to wait an hour the second time.  They do have a crazy variety of toppings for your dog, but still nothing worth waiting so long for.  If by some miracle there is no line, then by all means hit it up, but if there's a line of people wrapped into the parking lot, skip it and track down one of those carts that serves bacon wrapped dogs with onions and peppers...mmmm.
