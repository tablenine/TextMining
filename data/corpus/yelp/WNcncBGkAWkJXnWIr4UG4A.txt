i'll make this quick: lunch is great, dinner is only "good."  by good, i mean it's also great, but not quite 5 stars memorable/consistent.. . the spago burger for lunch is incredible.  better than nook, morton's, and anywhere else that claims to have the best burger in town.  it's exceptional. order it.  salads are good also, but whatever, they are salads.. . dinner is good.  fish, steak, chicken... whatever.  everything has been good, nothing has been mind blowing.  worth the price tag?  maybe.. . wolfgang is occasionally here.  he comes out and says hello.  last time i was lunching he came over to ask how everything was.  i was eating the burger so, naturally, i reported everything was wonderful.. . fantastic service. great food. lovely seating.  prompt valet.
