Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
I am no expert at ramen.  That being said, every time I'm anywhere near little Tokyo in LA I have to find a noodle restaurant.  Daikokuya is a cool little place that is always crowded.  I usually go by myself so there's room at the bar where you also get an up close view of the cooks doing their magic.  I do have to recommend you get the salad with the ramen.  You will not be disappointed.  I really can't describe the flavors of the food but you will like all of it.  Try it out if you get a chance!
