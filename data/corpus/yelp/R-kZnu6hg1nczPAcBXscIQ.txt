Restaurant: Nava
Category: Tex-Mex
It's been 3 years since I've been to Nava.  I'm new to . http://yelp.com.  so, I'm going backwards in time with my reviews.. . I've heard of Nava for some time.  It's a Southwestern restaurant that's right in the heart of Buckhead.  This guy I knew said the food was great and that it was his favorite restaurant, blah, blah, blah... He was a fan of Moe's so, I totally ignored him.   A few months later, a friend suggest for us to dine at Nava before heading over to see Joan Jett at The Roxy (the show was the shit!).  I agreed and met up with her around 7pm.. . The dining room looked too stuffy and full of conservative people.  So, we decided to sit at the bar.  The first thing we order... ALCOHOL!  The bartender was amazing!  His name was either John or Josh.  My drink was the guava caiparinha!  Delicious!  The night was going to be good.... . The barbecued rabbit tostada with black bean refritos and mango vinegar was so good!  I dreamt about this plate for months and still talk about it to this day.  The masa crusted oyster chalupas with chile remoulade and jimaca mango slaw was tasty!   My main entrée was the suncorn crusted snapper with roasted corn jalapeño whipped potatoes and tomato masa broth. AMAZING!  I fell in love with Nava.  But I wasn't done with my dinner!  I had to finish it off with dessert.  Banana enchiladas.  Great concept, but I didn't care for it.. . I had a great dinner at Nava and surprised that I haven't been there since.  I had heard that they took the rabbit tostada off the menu.   I guess its because of that that I haven't gone back.  If anyone can get them to bring the item back on the menu, my ass will make reservations and eat the shit out of the bunny!
