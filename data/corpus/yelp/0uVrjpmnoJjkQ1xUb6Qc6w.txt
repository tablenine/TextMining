I'm bumping Roy's up to four stars. I received a call from the General Manager within 2 days and he asked for more details on my experience. He then sent me a gift card for $50 so I would give them another chance to make things right.. . That is the correct managerial response to a customer complaint. I would have been cool just him asking about my experience but he went the extra mile.
