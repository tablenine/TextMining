Geez.... EVERYONE raves about this place... (Everyone meaning all those non Asian friends of mine!) Well...even the Asian ones.... Anyhow, Facts and reasonable reason why I gave 2stars:. . Be Prepared .... 1. For SUPER Noise. It's a Lounge... where you are SUPPOSED to talk... but won't even hear yourself.. 2. For Perverts chasing after Asian Looking girls.. 3. For NO Dance Floor. . 4. For Non-Asian Geisha strolling around in their Fancy non-traditional Kimono with super white powder and red lipstick on their face. . 5. To have overpriced Sushi and Japanese food made by Non-Japanese...as usual. . 6. To get lost while finding their restroom... I literally was stopped by couple blondies.."OMG an ASIAN GIRL! Can you help us? What is the ladies room in Japanese?".... 7. To be ripped off. Oh well, it's popular for a reason though... I haven't figure out yet. . 8. To stand outside for over 45mins waiting for your car. 20 dollar valet ( depends on days, but usually 15-20). 9. To Complain ...DUDE! WHERE IS MY CAR?!?! . 10. To RUN across the street to get to your car...because these valet guys will HONKs your car to tell you to J walk in your heels and slutty dress. Who cares if you paid them 20 dollars...it's HOLLYWOOD...
