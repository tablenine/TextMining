My sister brings in 30 at the new Loca Luna. NOW I've had the pleasure (for lack of a better word) of trying both locations and the old one was about 99.999% better than the new one.. . For starters parking is INSANE. Maybe it was just me, but I didn't see any signs pointing out this place and with the way it's positioned you can easily pass it by.. . Finally we park about a block or so away (in the opposite direction), we get inside and this place is PACKED!! We had a table for about 20 people but you couldn't even get to your seat without ramming someone with your chair, the people standing around your table reaches over you to sit their glasses down on the table, they're leaning on your chair (it's just chaos). I decide I'd try to make it to the restroom while the floor looked a little empty, by the time I got up the floor had become so packed that just to get through my friend and I had to use all our strength to push through the crowd.. . About an hour later I decide I can't take anymore and get my things to leave, as I'm making my way through the crowd some random guy grabs my arm, salsa spins me into some other guys chest (seriously my face was in some guys man boobs) it was so crowded that as I tried to push away from this guy I kept losing my balance and falling right back in (d@mn Sangrias), thank God for the person that pulled me to my feet (I may have suffocated).. . To me Loca Luna has lost it's flair. It's no longer one of the first places I reccomend for a guaranteed good time out, with strongs drinks and hot guys. I'm a little disappointed because what other club/lounge can I visit and have the bartender give me a straw shaped like a penis?!?
