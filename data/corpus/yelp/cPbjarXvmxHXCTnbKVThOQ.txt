Yep...I lose a bet to my Nascar marketing friends... during a race weekend... and because my non carb eating yet booty packing petite self NEVER eats waffles, let alone HAS never, YEP NEVER had fried chicken..NEVER.. not even KFC... they decide to BET me that if a certain NASCAR driver that one of them represents came in the top 10 that day, that I had to not only devour a plate of chicken &amp; waffles, but I had to pick up the tab for all 6 of us... seriously, I had this one in the chicken coop.. well, you get me... ummm .. yeah.. so I write this review.. because I lost.. but I won.. sort of.. So my first time eating fried chicken is in a not so great neighborhood of LA.. but Im with some great friends and guys of Nascar..how bad is that..not bad... but tell me how and why it needs a waffle, with maple syrup or gravy..well, I guess its a soul food southern thing, I just dont get as a California girl that grew up on granola and vines and fog... it was booty smacking good... service..eeh.. I mean, I was dressed in Jimmy Choos and Burberry... I asked for not friendly service in a run down area of LA.. my bad... I didnt think Id lose.. And for all of us...under $70 .... try it.. and then go work out.. a bunch...
