I saw about 500 reviews for the Hainan Chicken, so many that I almost didn't want to order it; the way some people resisted seeing "The Dark Knight" because of all of the hype. But then I remembered, that if there were THAT many reviews, it must be good, so I should give it a shot. It was very nice, albeit a bit on the simple side for me. Sometimes I like complexity. Ingredients mixed in a creative, unique, think-outside-the-box manner. This was poached chicken served with rice cooked in chicken stock, with some nice sauces on the side. I mean, don't get me wrong. It was good. But not something that would give me cravings, the way I went to "Hash House a Go Go" in San Diego for three meals within a thirty hour time span last weekend. Just didn't "grab" me.. . Similarly, the spring rolls were tasty, piping hot... but nothing magical. Just good.. . I wish there was a 3.5 star option. Three sounds more blase than I really felt, but it's not QUITE a four to me. Oh well, I'll round up (clicks)...
