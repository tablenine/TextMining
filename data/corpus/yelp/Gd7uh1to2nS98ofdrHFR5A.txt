Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Simplicty.  Here it's all about the simplicity.  All you need to do is choose your broth, your spicy level and toppings.  And quite honestly, you don't really need any toppings.  There is enough veggies and meat in there to make a nice, well-balanced ramen food pyramid.  Spiciness and broth truly dictate the awesomeness of your ramen, resulting in a very hearty and satisfying lunch.. . The true satisfaction from Orochon comes from the "texture" of the ramen.  I'm a true lover of the al dente ramen, if you know what I mean.
