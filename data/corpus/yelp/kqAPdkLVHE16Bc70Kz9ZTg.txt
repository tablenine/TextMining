Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
Lola's is able to remind me of how much of a drinking featherweight I am with ease. They don't mess around with the drinks, people. I went during Happy Hour when the drinks were cheap and had the (unadventurous) apple martini and it was delicious. Plus, the ambience of the whole place is fabulous. It's really cute &amp; cozy.. . Sometimes you can luck out with street parking in the area or valet is $5. However, walking, taking a cab, or making sure you have a reliable DD are all highly recommended because the odds of you coming out of Lola's in good condition to operate a motor vehicle are slim to none.
