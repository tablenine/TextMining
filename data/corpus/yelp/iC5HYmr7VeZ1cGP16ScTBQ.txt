Great place with authentic Japanese cuisine. The place is also beautifully decorated, lots of interesting ornaments, even the soy-disk was impressive. . . Very friendly wait-staff. The sushi was very good, I ordered a Yum yum rolls, which was very unique. It had a white bread covering the outside instead of rice (this is actually the quintessential American sushi roll) then deep fried. The beef tataki roll was also very different, it had beef tataki on the outside with asparagus, carrots, and cream chese inside, bathed in its own ponzu sauce with scallions. . . The nigiri was very fresh also. I had some uni and mirugai. Both were very fresh. . . The wait staff was very well versed in the menu.. . Will definitely visit again to try the hibachi, I've heard wonderful things about it.
