Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
So I've heard about this place forever but to be honest I'm not sure what the fuss is all about. I've heard about my friends driving down from the bay just to get some Roscoes which is craaaazzzyyy!!! . . Granted the chicken is pretty good but I guess I'm just not a big fan of the whole chicken and waffles idea. Maple syrup on my fried chicken along with the waffles is definitely not my ideal meal; however its definitely worth it to just say you've had Roscoe's before. . . Also, chicken and waffles for $14+ is not my idea of the best way to indulge and get a great meal. I think I would rather spend my $14 somewhere else. . . Plus parking sucks!
