Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
Consistently impresses me!. . Another trip to Hungry Cat today for lunch. As we walked up the smoker was working away and a gentle waft of mesquite invited you in. Yay.. . It was lunch time, so kept it light: the Hungry Cat Cobb Salad. shrimp, tuna, crab and all the other cobb goodness, including bacon from the smoker on the patio. Complex and flavourful, I had my fork loaded up for the next bite before the previous one was even consumed. Others order the Fish Sandwich (as it appears on the menu) and we also decided to share the heirloom tomato and watermelon salad.. . It's a difficult undertaking to incorporate so many flavours and not have them compete, or have one stand-out. Hungry Cat however, achieves this--both aesthetically and for the taste buds.. . My light salad left room for Peach Crisp with the standout: lemon zest &amp; rosemary barely whipped cream. Outstanding even on a hot 95Â° summer day.. . I wish I had a reason to be in that part of town for lunch more often!
