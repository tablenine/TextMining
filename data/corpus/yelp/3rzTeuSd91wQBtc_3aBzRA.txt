Juicy Pork Dumplings = Delicious. . Even thought they are made by Hispanics they are still delicious.  Maybe a small part of them are Asian.  Either way this is one of my favorite places to go.  I have yet to find a place in SF that can duplicate this place, example Shanghai Dumpling in Milbrea.  If you are in New York I highly recommend going to Joe's Shanghai's.. . Definitely get the Juicy Pork Dumplings, the crab/pork ones are good too and then get a veggie plate.  Do not get the Veggie Pork dumplings as the veggie over powers the pork and the juice, not a fan.  I had the wanton soup, which is ok.  The dumpling skin is just the right thickness making it soft and tender.  Make sure you ask for extra ginger to put in your soy sauce and eat with the dumpling.. . Lines are long (up to 30 mins if not more depending on the day but you get a menu and mark what you want in the mean time) and parking is a bear in the shopping plaza (I got lucky &amp; found one right away).  If you get hungry go to the life book store or the Taiwanese bakery across the way.  If you can't find parking go over to the other plaza right next door.. . Oh yeah don't forget to go to Sin Bala at the next plaza for some kick @$$ shaved ice.
