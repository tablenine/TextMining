The prices are kinda steep for what it offers. I paid $5 for tress leche cake which was good, but it was $5. I also got an ice cream cone for. $3.25, which shouldn't be considered a bargain. Not to mention you just can't find parking in this area. If it were cheaper and they had their own parking lot, I'd give this place 5 stars easily.
