Its okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here - but the menu is cool - from chicken wings to burgers, salads and even some meatloaf - its a nice variety.. . Our waitress was a little wacked - she would ask questions and walk away before we could answer, I ate a salad - it was OK.. . All in all if you want to hang with some friends and you need a place to meet up where everyone can find something to eat/drink then this might be your spot - just don't expect to be blown away by awesomeness.
