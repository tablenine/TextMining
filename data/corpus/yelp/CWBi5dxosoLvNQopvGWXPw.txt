Wait, there's a bar in wicker park that's crowded due to hype?! Wait, there's gambling in this casino?!. . This place rules...I've yet to find another place where I can consume INSANELY DELICIOUS food, Top Shelf bourbon, and make a fucking spectacle of myself for under 30 dollars. . . People need to learn how to be patient. It makes life so much easier.
