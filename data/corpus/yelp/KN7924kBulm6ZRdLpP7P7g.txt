steak was good, maybe it was the knife but had a bit of effort to cut through it even though i had medium rare. the sauce that it was in was awesome and complimentary. . sweet potato fries were crispy and soft... wanted more.. . had some russian beer, that was good.. . bone marrow....eh. . . the regular fries are too damn skinny.. . bouncer dude was chill.. . one of the bartenders had an attitude, a bit much considering it was a guy.. . a bit pricey for what the flavor is.... . go here if you're trying to look cool. haha
