Restaurant: Lola&#39;s

lola's was a defining moment in my yelping career. this place was cool, in a hollywood, snooty sort of way. their martinis were super stiff and sweet and it sort of made me sick and drunk. i dunno how many times my butt got violated by female and probably even some male hands. i had their food, it was pretty good, i went with an uber date, which was good, and i had fun with yelpers. this like the blue goose lounge is a regular spot for yelpers, parking sucks but its next to oki's dogs and i think i have 12 new fans cuz of that place.
