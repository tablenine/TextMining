Father's Office has the best burgers and sweet potato fries.  This is coming from someone who's not big on burgers or red meat in general - F.O.'s burgers are one of the best I've had, yet.  Not sure if it was the sauce they use in the burger or that the patty was naturally juicy itself - definitely delish.  I thought it was weird at first that they used a french roll instead of burger buns but you know what, it worked. Only downside was the wait.  Friends and I went on a Friday/Saturday night and had to stake out a table fora group of 6
