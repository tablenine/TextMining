Juuuuuuuuuuuuuust finished my food from this place.  Ordered a cheeseburger, belgian fries, and a coconut cupcake.  My boyfriend got a hamburger.. . I didn't get a chance to taste the burger b/c I forgot to tell them that I didn't want thousand island or onions on it.  I hate hate hate thousand island, so I couldn't bring myself to even attempt to eat this.  My fault; not theirs.. . My boyfriend said his burger was terrible.  The meat patty was so small and it was smothered in thousand island that didn't even taste like thousand island.  He said that it tasted sort of like a weak mustard.  . . The belgian fries are strange.  I wanted to like them as they had an interesting texture, but most of them were so freaking hard that it hurt my teeth.  I spent the entire time squeezing fries so that I would know which ones were safe to eat.  Also, I think a combination of their strange ketchup and the texture of the fries made my tongue hurt.  Boo-urns!. . I decided to try to find a chunk of the meat that was untouched on my burger and I did...it was terrible.  It was lukewarm, greasy (which I would expect, but it bothered me b/c it was just nasty), and flavorless!  Learn how to season your meat, people!!!!. . Oh..and let us not forget about the coconut cupcake.  Smelled heavenly, but that was about it.  The frosting was super greasy and dense.  The flavor was OK but I had a hard time getting past the greasy coating in my mouth.  The cupcake itself is dense but not moist.  Was not worth finishing.. . Overall, not a positive experience. will NOT be back.. . If you want great food with a similar menu, try The Hat.
