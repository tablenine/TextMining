Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I've been to Roscoe's a few times but this was the first time visiting  the Pasadena location.. . I ordered quarter chicken with waffles.  Food here is great.  I have never been disappointed with the food but I think it's a bit over-priced.  . . PROS:  Great tasting food.  Parking is great at the Pasadena location.. . CONS:  Service can be sub-par.  Not the cleanest restaurant around.  Bit over-priced.
