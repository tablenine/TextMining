Came here one evening to eat with friends and family.  This place was super crowded.  It felt very cramp even when waiting.  Luckily for me, I already started drinking and I kinda stopped paying attention after awhile.  . . We ordered a wide variety of makimonos and temaki and some of the fish was fresh, and some were so so.  I can say that one of the rolls reminded me of the target sushi that's usually available everyday at super target.  BOGUS...   The Bob San and the Giant Roll made up for the previous rolls.  . . Maybe I'll have to try it again when it's a bit less busy.  I'm going to excuse them this time since it was pretty busy that evening.
