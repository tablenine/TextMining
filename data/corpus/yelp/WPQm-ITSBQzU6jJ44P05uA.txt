yum! Maybe it was because we were starving after 11 hours.. or maybe it was the fast service. Or hey, maybe it was because they were open late! After driving around endlessly looking for a place to get our grub on, ApplePan happened to be open. We ordered and next thing we know, our food is right in front of us. How the hell did that happen so quickly?! We got in and out within 20 minutes. Scoooooore.
