This is a great place for a date. Intimate, cande-lit, great toonage provided by East Village radio just next door and the food is DELICIOUS. . The service has been great. They seem to be a very easy going bunch and very knowledgable of the menu and what goes into every dish.. On our last visit we started with the calamari. It was perfectly done. Crispy, chewy but not greasy and served with a slightly spicy marinara. For our main course we shared the Penne with Marinara and Ravioli al Forno (I believe). It was stuffed with spinach and ricotta and was very good. Also on a previous visit I have had the beet ravioli and it was also delicious. You don't expect ravioli to be sweet! The roasted whole eggplant is also very good and is served up with a spicy oil to be drizzled onto it.. The portions are pretty generous so we have been too stuffed to try the desserts yet.. Keep in mind they only accept cash.
