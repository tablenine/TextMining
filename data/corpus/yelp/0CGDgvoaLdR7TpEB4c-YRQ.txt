Choose the cajeta flan or chocolate Barcelona cake for dessert.  I had the Argentine and spinach empanadas for appetizers then the Bolivian corn tamale.  The host checks up on you but in the dimness when you need a waiter it isn't easy to call them over.  The quality of service is meh.  The staff is friendly but not so professional.
