Great concept and awesome food. Its a bit cramped  but that's all part of the charm of this place. It reminded me of my Aunt and Uncle's row house in the city. The ordered the chicken parm panini. We went upstairs and got a great seat by the window in the red room. The food arrived quickly and consumed ever quicker.  The sandwich tasted great though for me a bit more sauce would have made it perfect. I completely enjoyed the atmosphere of this cozy sandwich shop and will be back in better weather to enjoy the outdoor seating.
