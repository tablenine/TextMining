Dear Yelp,. . Please increase your rating system to 6 stars: 5 normal stars and one Bari Star, reserved entirely for Bari Foods.  Only in this way can justice truly prevail.  Thank you.. . Signed,. Dan. . Seriously, though, I can't say anything more than has been said already, so allow me to describe my love for Bari subs:. . I would take a bullet for a Bari sub.. I would vandalize Wikipedia for a Bari sub.. I would let a Bari sub father my children.. If instead of serving a whopping 12" sub, Bari charged $5 just to let people lick the fingers of the workers, I would still gladly pay it.. . That is all.. Oh, and Bari/D'Amato 2012.
