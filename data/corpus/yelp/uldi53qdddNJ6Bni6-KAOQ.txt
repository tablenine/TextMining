I love the Veggie Grill!  I've tried every item on the menu and each and every one makes my tastebuds scream "MORE, MORE!"   . The entrees: delicious.... The desserts: delectable. The staff: Uber-friendly. The ambience: Up-beat, hip, enjoyable to both a savvy college student or a fun family.. . 5 stars!
