Restaurant: Gibsons Bar &amp; Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
OK, it had been a while since I had been here the last time I reviewed Gibsons. Having just gone back within the last couple of days I figured it would be good to update my review.. . The decor of the place is great, I generally like the atmosphere of these kinds of steak places and Gibsons is the king of steak house decor. The bar is fun but minus points for no draft beers at all...really?. . The dining room we sat in is really crowded, my seat was in essentially an asile and I kept getting nailed by waiters flying by. The whole steak showcase that has been talked about on here happened once again, even though everyone I was with had already been there. Its cool and all seeing steaks that are a hell of a lot bigger than you actually get to eat but any moron from the midwest knows what a rib-eye looks like. Even up close the meat looked great by why do they feel the need to prove it to me????. . We had the seafood platter as an appatizer. The shrip was great, but the lobster salad is something left to be desired, there is not enough of it! You get more on a lobster roll. . . The soup of the day was split pea which was a hair too hot for me, but overall it was good.. . I had the Porterhouse and a twice baked potato. I asked for my meat medium well but of course it came out barely medium. I'm not that picky about how my meat is cooked as long as its in the same ballpark. The meat itself was great but just too plain for an "upscale" steak house...there wasn't enough flavor. The twice baked potato was huge and tased like a twice baked potato.. . I think the whole thing with beers cost about $70 or so which was fine, but I could think of better ways to spend $60-$100 at a restaurant in Chicago.
