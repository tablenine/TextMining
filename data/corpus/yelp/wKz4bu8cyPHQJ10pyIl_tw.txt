Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
I was here, while on business, about 4 years ago.  Firstly, I enjoyed the atmosphere.  Rustic and down to earth, no pretense at all.  Secondly, the service was very good and this was while the place was packed.  Thrid and final, the pizza was great.  I will be back, whenever I am in Chi-Town again.
