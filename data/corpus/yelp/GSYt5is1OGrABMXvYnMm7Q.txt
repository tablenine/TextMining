I'll add more later, but right now it's late, I'm hungry and the thought of potato balls, cheese rolls and ridiculously tasty sandwiches are dancing in my head and it's torture.. . For now, I will just say that this place is possibly my favorite place to eat, period. Oh the sandwiches. Ohhhh, the potato balls.. . Ok, that's it. I'm drooling on the keyboard. I have to go.
