I picked up their Green Goddess Steak Salad - and it was good enough to put me on a kick for it for a solid week. Upon returning home after my week in Chicago, I whipped up my own Green Goddess dressing and replicated that Steak Salad every night for a week. It was that good. Simple, tasty, totally satisfying. Silver Cloud is on my "go back to this place" list when I hit CHi again.
