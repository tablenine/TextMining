I've eaten here several times, and loved everything I ordered. I also like that they have started to serve more raw food dishes lately. But I was truly sold when I came here and ordered the "meat"loaf and mashed potatoes comfort food, and vegan chocolate cake for dessert. I was needing good old fashioned comfort food and was kind of expecting to be disappointed, this being a "good-for-you" food place and all that. But it hit the spot -- delicious and guilt-free, too!
