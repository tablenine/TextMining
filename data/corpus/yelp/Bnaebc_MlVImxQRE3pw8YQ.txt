Cheap, amazing, spicy and delicious.  Wow... I think i found the best mexican food in Atlanta!  The line is long a lot of the time, but it seems to move pretty briskly.  . . I'm going to order everything on the menu eventually... but for now:. . The Yum:. . The refried beans have a KICK to em... very spicy!. The queso dip is the most addicting on the planet.. The enchiladas have plenty of pep to them (cheese being the best.... so melty!!)
