Can I mention it again? The view is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!  . The place overall is quite enjoyable, from location to decor detail in the restaurant.  I had my birthday there and I must say, I had a very good birthday!!. This is an excellent place to entertain friends and guests from out of town, or if you want to have a great time with friends.  . Although, I must say I've had better japanese food before in a less fancier place.  . . Check out their virtual tour:  . http://www.yamashirore.... . . Enjoy!
