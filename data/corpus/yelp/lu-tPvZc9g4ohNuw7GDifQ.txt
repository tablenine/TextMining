Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
900 reviews. You know its good when it even warrants that many reviews. Dumplings. Get them. Xiao Long Bao. Eat them. Slurp it. Ginger it. Vinegar it. Do whatever but get these dumplings! This place is really weird cause now even half the diners aren't asian. So the non-asianers need not fear, for you won't feel like you're in Chinatown or Rowland. I see them eating typical rice, meat, noodle dishes (which I haven't tried cause I'm stuffing my face full of 20 dumplings and beef noodle soup) but it shows the entire menu is heaven in the belly!
