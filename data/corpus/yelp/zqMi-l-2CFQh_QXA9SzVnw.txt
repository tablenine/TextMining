The next time a New Yorker tells you that you can't get a good deli sandwich in Los Angeles... . . First,  them to go back to their soot filled &amp; rat infested island of stink &amp; filth, while we pick fruit from our trees, surf &amp; golf in the winter. . . OK, I feel much better now.   Anyway, then take them to Langer's and order the hot pastrami with swiss and extra russian dressing on the side.
