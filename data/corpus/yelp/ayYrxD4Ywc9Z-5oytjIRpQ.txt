A friend and I just stopped in for some wine and cheese, not dinner. Vinum Populi up the street put us in the mood, so we wanted to get all the wine and cheese we could out of Culver before heading out.. . I drank the only Shiraz they sell by the glass and loved it. Peppery and delicious. We opted for the five cheese plate, but embarrassingly didn't really know what any of the cheese on the selection list were. So, we asked the helpful waitress to make up our mind.. . What resulted was four deliciously creamy cheeses and one absolutely disgustingly stinky cheese. I can still smell it. (Is it still on me? Get it off!!). I'm sure if you're a cheese connoisseur, you'd love it. But it wasn't for our bland palates.. . So the lesson is: some of the cheeses aren't for the faint of heart, so be specific if you're asking the waiter to choose for you.. . Oh, and try the Shiraz.
