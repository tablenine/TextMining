Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Really a high-end steakhouse. Can be expensive depending on what you order. Great wine list. We had the 24oz. Porterhouse, garlic mashed, and crab stuffed mushrooms. Steak was so tender like butter. I would get it medium rare because it cooks on your hot plate. They sear it at a very high temp. . . The service is amazing there as well as the atmosphere. Its like having 3 waiters. The table next to us broke a glass and 4 people cleaned it up immediately.. . We loved it, everything was perfect. One of best restaurants i have eaten at for sure. Will go back again next time in LA.. . Service- excellent (jason is a great waiter). Food- everything perfectly cooked and big portions including the Steaks.. Atmosphere -Really cool, No rude douche bags, priceless!
