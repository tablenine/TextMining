My friend and I went to Stats to watch a football game.  They made him take off his Colts hat.  I know they want to be upscale but they forgot that they are supposed to be a sports bar.  I like the idea of an upscale sports bar but they need to adjust their policy.  It's very nice inside.  It's worth checking out.  This place just isn't for me.
