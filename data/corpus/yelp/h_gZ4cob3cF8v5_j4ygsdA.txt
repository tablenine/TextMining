Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
On Vacation in Chicago I had my list of places that I wanted to experince from the Food Network and the Travel Channel. . My friend was at work and I took the the 65 bus from Grand and I went the wrong way to the Navy Pier which was a great experience. I decided to take the bus the other way after hitting the Beer Garden at the Navy Pier. I go off the bus on 3 blocks east or North Av. and I had to walk to Cemitas. I came in and I noticed how dirty the or should I say how old and broken the tile floor was. That gave a sense that maybe the place was going to be kinda dirty? Not at all but before I ordered I went to the restroom. After ridding myself of all the beer... The toilet over overflowed...... Also no toilet paper for the customers that followed me.... I told the server which only spoke spanish shich is great. After I took a seat I looked at the menu and order a Taco Arabe and a Torta Atomica. The papalo herb not in season which was a bummer ; - ( .... I could of just ordered a torta de carne enchilada ... The milaneza was burned and the ham had no flavor. If it would of been the carne enchilada ... I would of been really happy... I ate half of the cemita and took it home.... The taco arabe was not on a pita like the owner said on tv. It was a over cooked store made flour tortilla. The pork meat was nothing memorable. I had a great orchata that had natural canela flavor and made from scratch with the rice still fresh. I also had a cidral mundet and no dessert. Â . The thing that stands out is the most is how great the owner son is. He was truly a nice guy and very proper. He was outstanding with the customers and would go back and give good reviews for great service.
