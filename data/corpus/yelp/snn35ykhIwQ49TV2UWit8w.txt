Everyone seems to go nuts over this place. I wasn't that impressed. I mean, it was OK. In fact, the piece of cake I had was pretty good. However, I don't think it lives up to its hype. If a place is famous for its dessert, then it better be amazing. I'm talking knock my socks off amazing. . . I hate to say it but, House of Pies is better.
