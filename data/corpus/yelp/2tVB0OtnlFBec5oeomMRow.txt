Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I love Tito' Tacos, you love Titos' too.. I love Tito's Tacos, what else can you do?. The only thing better than a Tito's Taco is two!!. . Good tacos.  2 bucks for a beef taco with cheese.  Salsa is super yummy but on the watery side.  The chips are good.  There's something about the beef that is just really, really delicious and distinct. . . Parking is tough in the little lot so your best bet is to try to find metered parking on the street.  There are plenty of spaces right under the freeway.  . . The line is super long, but it's quick.  And you get your meal relatively fast too.  Outdoor seating on the patio tables is the best, but there are only 3 tables, and they're usually packed.  You kind of have to be one of those table vultures and swoop in immediately after someone leaves.  The indoor seating isn't as nice.  . . I recommend it.  I would imagine this place would be particularly yummy after a night or afternoon of drinking.  It's nothing fancy, but surely hits the spot.
