It's okay.  The baked goods are good, the fruit bowl is very good.  The eggs are a little gross, though.  And the service.  Well, I guess that's the point. There really isn't any.  Which is annoying, are we supposed to tip in this kind of place?  I dunno.  Only one refill of coffee, and you have to struggle at the cashier among tons of people ordering to get it.  The place is just a tad too haphazard.
