the food is awesome as long as you dont already have diabetes or high blood pressure. . and i suggest you bring a bag of chips or something because after standing in line for days at a time your stomach might just say EFF THIS and leave you to go find a Mcdonalds. . you can pay 10$ to park right next to the building where there are lights and its easier to see that your car is safe OR you can live life on the  edge and park right behind the restaurant where the parking is free and you get a complimentary adrenaline rush from leaving your car in the super sketch parking lot  but i guess for free what more can you ask for. . i dont have any complaints about the service because it was pretty good the past couple times that ive gone to eat there . . there isnt a lot of seating inside for the people waiting for a table but a lot of them manage to squeez in there like its going to help them get there name called faster (yeah right) so its kind of akward sitting there eatting while you have all these hungry restless people staring at you waiting for you to finish your meal so they can grab your table . . other than that i do love this place and i also love that they stay open so late
