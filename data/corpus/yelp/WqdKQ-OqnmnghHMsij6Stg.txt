It'll do.... . I had been here once before for restaurant week last year and was not disappointed; however, my lushy ways leave me blank on what I actually ate (don't judge me!).. . Fast forward to last night.  I met a coworker there for happy hour.  1/2 off beers, $5 wells and select wines...not bad.. . We both had the polenta cakes.  Mmmmmmmmm, mama!  Me likey.  It should be bigger since it's an "entreé," or bit cheaper because it's f'n small would've been good too.. . Although an expensive evening, I'd go back.  Good group or date spot.
