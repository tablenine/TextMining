Really fine place.  Not perfect, but very very fine.. . My favorite sandwich is a variation of something they offer.  On the menu, they have pastrami on rye with cream cheese and tomato.  I like to switch the pastrami out for corned beef... and man is that switch awesome.  Call me crazy, but I think Langer's has better corned beef than pastrami.  Both are awesome, but the corned beef just always strikes me as a bit awesomer.. . Also, if you want to cheap it out, the fried fish sandwich is a good sandwich.  Despite being described by one of langer's waitresses as "McDonald's style" it's a pretty tasty little thing for not much money.  Other things that are awesome are the blintzes, the beef stew, and desserts.
