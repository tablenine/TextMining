Really, more like 4 1/2 stars.  Went to Terroni for the first time last night, and loved it.  It was surprisingly crowded for late on a weeknight, but we were able to get a drink at the bar while we waited for a table.  The crown jewel of the meal was for sure the mixed meat/cheese plate that we started with.  I consider myself a bit of a cheese plate 'conissieur,' and that might have been the best cheese plate I've ever had.  The fact that it's just a few blocks from my house likely means I won't fit into any of my jeans in a few months... We both had pasta, which was tasty but stay away from the sun-dried tomatoes - way too salty.  The service was totally adequate, especially given how busy they were.  I'll be back here fo' sho, even if it's just for wine and cheese.  In fact, especially just for wine and cheese...
