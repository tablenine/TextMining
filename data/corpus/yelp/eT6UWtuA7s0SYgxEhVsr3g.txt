This place is so yummy!  I came here because I was in the area and went on Yelp to look for a good place to hang out with my friend and grab some food.  I saw that this place had almost 600 reviews so we decided to come here.  I ordered most of the stuff that the reviews said were good, including the Cheese Rolls, the Guava Cheese Strudel, the Potato Balls, some fruit pastries, the Meat Pie, a mango smoothie, and my friend had a chai latte.  . . My favorites were the Cheese Rolls and the potato balls.  They were soooo good!  The guava cheese strudel was just okay and so was the meat pie.  The fruit pastries and drinks were good but there wasn't  anything special about them.  I would come back here just to have the cheese rolls and the potato balls again though.  Very yummy and I've never had anything similar.. . Also, the line is really long but the service is quick.  There are a lot of people working behind the counter and they are all really efficient so you get served really fast.  There is also ample seating and even though we went on a busy Sunday afternoon, we were able to find seating very quickly.  It was really nice to sit on the patio and chill.
