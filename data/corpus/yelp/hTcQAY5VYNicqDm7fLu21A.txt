Mozza has been blasted for being overhyped and a 'place for celebs' but I've never had a bad meal here.  I try to vary it up when I go but my faves are the Crispy Pigs Trotter with Mustard and  the Pasta Bavette Caci e Pepe (cheese &amp; pepper) soooo simple &amp; sooo goood, yet surprisingly most LA places can't dish it out as well as this.  I also love the fresh mozzarella cheese from the bar and mozza lovers are bound to like the Burrata plate whether its the regular, smoked, or very light laden in olive oil version.   Last time out I tried the Ribollita which is a "boiled" veggie soup.  It looks like it was dehydrated as it contains no broth until you start to split apart the vegetables.  It's interesting and pretty tasty, not overly done yet chock full of vegetables. . . Avoid the basil brandy on the sweet wines menu as it tasted horrible.  All their dessert wines are pretty cloying and simple, I have yet to find a really nice Italian dessert wine.  Espresso is top-notch but I still like Cecconi's more.  . . Only downside of the last dinner:  brotha-man-waiter had breath that was kicking!!  I was leaned over my menu and I could still tell when he was speaking even though I could barely hear him over the crowd noise.  Wow, he was nice and great all-around otherwise but dude take a tic-tac!
