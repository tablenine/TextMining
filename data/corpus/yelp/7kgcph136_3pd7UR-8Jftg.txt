Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
Simply the best pizza, hands down. My wife and I shared a small deep dish and we still had 2 slices left over. It is filling stuff. We ate at a lot of nice upscale restaurants while in Chicago and the $15 pizza at Giordano's may have been our most memorable meal. I simply did not want to quit eating. Much better than Malnati's, which I also had while in town.
