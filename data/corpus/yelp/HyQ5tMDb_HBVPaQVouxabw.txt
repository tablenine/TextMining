Not worth it.  Doesn't live up to the hype.. . Yes, it was a trendy restaurant.  The atmosphere and decor were nice.  But you sit close enough to the people next to you to smell their food and join in their conversations.  That wouldn't bother me if the food lived up to its reputation.. . We asked the server for recommendations, and I had already read the reviews on yelp.  I wanted to try the bone marrow, but they were out.  They were also out of the wine I wanted.  We ordered the fried squash blossoms and the meatballs to start.  The squash blossoms were like oily fried mush.  I couldn't taste or feel the squash and I couldn't taste the ricotta.  Neither of us wanted to finish this appetizer.  The meatballs were better, but still not superb.  I've had better.. . We ordered the fungi misti pizza and the salume salami pizza.  Yes, the crust is good, but not out of this world.  The toppings were fine.  Together, it was just pizza.  And not the best pizza I've ever had.  Not even close.  I'd rather have a slice or 2 from Lamonica's in Westwood.  I didn't ooh or aah over this pizza even once, and only ate 2 slices.  It just wasn't worth it.  . . Everyone said to get the buttersotch budino, but we passed since everything else had been sub par.  I wouldn't go back.  It wasn't worth the drive, the wait, or the money.. . If you go, park on the street and save yourself the $10 valet charge.
