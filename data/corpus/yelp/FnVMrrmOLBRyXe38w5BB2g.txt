I came here last night (Monday) for Jane's Bday celebration for my very first time. Thanks to yelp, I made sure I ate before I went (the reviews on the food seem to be not so great). So I ate enchiladas at home (my absolute FAVE!) &amp; headed out..      Upon my arrival- I was asked for my I.D. and  a pink bracelet was placed around my wrist- LET the DrINKING BEGIN!. So I ordered some hot sake &amp; tried 2 pieces from my friend's sushi roll- it was not the best tasting sushi, but I was already full so I didn't really care. When I saw the prices for sushi, I really thought "HELL NO!" can anyone say OVERPRICED! Anyway- the waiters were pretty cool- I just had to get there attention every time  wanted to order because they didn't really come around to make sure we were ok. &amp; for some reason, the sake was not getting me buzzed- probably because I just got back from Vegas on Sunday and alcohol was still in my system....whoops.       Anyway, our party was pretty big &amp; the bill was divided among two groups. The first group consisted of 10 people and their bill came out around $450. The second group of about 8- the bill was $350.... . So.....this place is cool for drinks &amp; to get a kick off the show that the waiters put on- they performed N-Sync's song- Bye Bye Bye...   haha it was good
