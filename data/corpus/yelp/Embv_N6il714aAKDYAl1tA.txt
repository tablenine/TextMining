Stopped in the marketplace (downstairs) the other night to get some soup and sandwiches to go. It's really a lovely space. I don't know my interior design, but I'd say it was distressed (worn, but clearly on purpose) and well thought out. An attractive place.. . The food was pretty dynamite. We had a meatloaf sandwich that was perfectly filling and so wonderfully flavorful. It came with bacon (unnoted on the menu) and some sweet tomato relish which complimented the hearty meatloaf so well. Shrimp po'boy looked like your run-of-the-mill, better than average one and the gumbo really hit the spot. . . The marketplace really reminds me of Provisions to Go, with a bit less of a selection. Prices are not cheap, but not completely unfair. You pay $9-$10 for a sandwich with no sides. Fancy, overpriced trinkets adorn the shop from baby clothes to wine bottles to $4 greeting cards made with seeds. The desserts/pastries also look delectable but run on the pricey side as well.
