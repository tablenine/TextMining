Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
This is simply the most authentic and reasonably priced Thai food I've ever had. My family, all from Thailand, have been coming here for over 5 years, and we've never had a bad meal here. There are items on this menu that you can't get at any other restaurant other than in Thailand. Even though I've moved away to the bay area, every time I come we have to come here to get my fix of 'real' Thai food (other than my mom's cooking ofcourse). . Some dishes for the adventurous: Larb (ground chicken with limes, ground rice, basil and chili powder), Yum nor mai (pickled bamboo shoots) get either of these dishes with sticky rice and you will be eating like a real Thai :)
