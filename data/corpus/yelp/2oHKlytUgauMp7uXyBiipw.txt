So my friend kept telling me about this amazing spot for Thai food where there was a Thai Elvis. . . Thai Elvis huh... well I do love Thai food and sort of like Elvis so why not.. . We went there on a Friday night and it was a madhouse. One thing I will say is the place is LARGE. They can 100% accommodate a large party as I noticed at least 2 birthday parties going on with at least 15 people at each table. And just as advertised Thai Elvis was on stage rocking out.. . If you like beer at all make sure to order a few "Singhas", a beer brewed in Thailand. Â It's good stuff. Crisp, refreshing, and STRONG.. . With a good buzz going and an appetite building we got our table and began ordering our Thai feast. We started out with the Beef Jerky and Shrimp cakes. Ironically Thai Elvis was singing "Love me Tender" when our Beef Jerky came out. While not tender, the jerky was tasty.. . The shrimp cakes were actually a little fishy. I think that they must deep fry everything in the same oil. But the sweet plum sauce they came with was FANTASTIC. It was sweet and syrupy. I was dipping everything in it. Make sure to ask for extra. . . I ordered the Pad See Ew with Pork for my entree: flat rice noodles, pan fried with soy sauce, chinese broccoli, and egg. The noodles were good but I like them spicy so I definitely needed to add some hot sauce to kick it up.. . I will say the service is mediocre at best. The place is ginormous and when busy, there are tons of waitstaff with ear pieces running around like crazy people. It's also loud between Thai Elvis and the masses eating around you. . . Just as Thai Elvis sang, "Don't be cruel" I won't be. The Palms is a fun place for groups with solid Thai Food. Just don't bring a date here for intimate conversation unless she happens to LOVE Elvis.
