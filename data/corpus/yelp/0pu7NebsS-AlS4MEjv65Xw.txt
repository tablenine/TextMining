Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I don't know if I've had bad Korean BBQ.  No I don't think I've had.  So... the Korean BBQ here wasn't bad either.  There's valet right outside or you can   park your car on the street instead.  Their restroom only supports single occupancy.  And their combos seemed to underestimate the amount of mouths it would feed, at least for the group I went with.  I did like that they kept bringing us more salad, though.  This place is also quite expensive.
