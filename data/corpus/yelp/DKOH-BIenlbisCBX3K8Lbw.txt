My opinion is that this restaurant is definitely for someone who enjoys that hearty, woodsy, outdoor like prepared food.  This woodsy theme that they have goin on there is all about food that comes out in cast iron skilets, nice sized portions, VERY RICH, VERY BUTTERY, simple flavoring, many different kinds of Greens, and nothing prepared in any extravagent manners.  Very basic.  So if you like very rich tasting foods with just some basic flavorings, bring a heart monitor and dig in.  If you don't, then don't be surprised if you feel sick.  Best way to describe it is when you eat a ginormous box of very buttery popcorn, finish it, and then hurl.  Thats why I gave 4 stars.  4 for the great service, nice portions, good food (braised ribs &amp; brussel sprouts), tasty  "to go" cake given to each guest after the meal, and 1 non star for the hurl.
