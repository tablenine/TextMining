My first visit, I fell in love with the competent way the skeleton crew bangs out noodles like maniacs. The rich salty broth and perfectly seasoned egg made it the best ramen I'd had in L.A. The second time I went, it was a little earlier, and they hadn't run out of kotteri flavor. Just, WOW! Flavor explosion. Best ramen I've ever had. I'm a big guy and I ride my bike a lot which can make me pretty hungry; a big bowl of noodles with a side of eel is enough to tame even my epic appetite.
