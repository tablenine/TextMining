Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
Vegan food is usually bland, or just veggies and bread. Or so I thought. I was happy to be proven wrong. I've now been here three times and I am a big fan. I mean it's not as good as meat, but the sauces and flavors of everything here are amazing. Ive now had four different items. The V-burger, the carne asada, the corn chowder and the kale salad. All were delicious. Oh and they have organic beer wine and sodas available too.. . Really impressive and unexpected. I plan on going back any time I'm out that way.
