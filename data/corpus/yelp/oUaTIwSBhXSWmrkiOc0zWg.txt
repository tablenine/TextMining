Don't be deceived by the exterior look of this place...or the name......the burgers are freakin' awesome!  The patties are prepared fresh and cooked just the way you like it.  I remember taking my very first bite and  it was absolutely orgasmic!  I thought - this is how a real burger should taste like!!!  I was floored to think that I would ever feel so passionate about burgers...but the Oinster has made me a convert and a lover of good ol' american burgers!  I'm completely sold........and you better believe I'm holla-ing for it everytime I'm in Eagle Rock.  It may not be cheap as In-N-Out...but in my opinion, it's definitely better and well worth the extra money.
