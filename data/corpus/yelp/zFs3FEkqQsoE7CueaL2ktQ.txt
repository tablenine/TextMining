Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
Fred 62 is what it is: a diner in Los Feliz. So the patronage and the fare are exactly what you'd expect: hipsters paying a little too much for diner food with some Southern California variations (read: vegan/vegetarian options). Parking can be a bitch, as well as the wait to sit inside. But sometimes the craving for Mac Daddy &amp; Cheese Balls at 1am is just irresistible...
