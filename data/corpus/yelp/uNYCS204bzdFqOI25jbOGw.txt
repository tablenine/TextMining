Restaurant: Trader Vic&#39;s
Category: Hawaiian
This was our first time out to Trader Vic's and I have to say it was great. We had the Mai Tai after hearing such great reviews and it was just as good as everyone said. All the food was better than I expected. We both had the steak and lobster. The meat that comes out of that smoker is to die for and the lobster was sweet and had plenty of taste. Service was fast and very good. I cannot think of anyway it could have been better. The pricing is a bit expensive, but it is not someplace I am going to eat there every day, more of on special occasions.
