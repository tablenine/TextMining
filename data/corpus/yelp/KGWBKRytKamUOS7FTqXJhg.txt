I read a lot of good reviews about this place so one day I decided to give it a try. I went in alone, got seated immediately (6:30PM Wednesday night), and started on a sushi binge. Within 20 minutes, I finished their uni, hamachi, albacore tuna, and salmon nigiri then topped it off with a spicy tuna handroll (i'm such a sucker for these). Oh, their fish were all cut so precisely that they'd just melt in your mouth. And price? not bad. I don't remember exactly how much I spent but it must have been less than $30 including tips. What a way to have a dinner date with yourself? Needless to say, I left completely satisfied! And what else is great? they have free valet parking!
