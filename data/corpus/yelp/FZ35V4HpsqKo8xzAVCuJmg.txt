I'm just going to let Kit F. pick all my restaurants from here in out. . . Lets see, root veggie chips, a Japanese Caesar salad with smoked salmon, potato mochi dango, bacon and scallop skewers, calamari, octopus balls, deluxe sashimi - we rolled out of there last night.. . Fish was fresh, nothing knock your socks off like Sushi House Hayakawa, but we also didn't have to make a reservation and we didn't crack a C-note, which is a good thing.  We got close though!. . If you like Japanese food other than sushi (or in addition to) or something other than the Americanized version of Japanese food, this place is very authentic yet accessible. This is what I consider to be Japanese bar food.. . Service was attentive.  Place was packed but the waitress was on it enough to notice when I ate my amaebi so she could whisk the little heads off for a deep fry treatment.  Neither of us wanted for beer or beverage.  . . We tried to eat on Saturday, but a 45 minute wait and a previous engagement made us reschedule till Sunday.  It was worth it.  Get there early and wish they were open for lunch!
