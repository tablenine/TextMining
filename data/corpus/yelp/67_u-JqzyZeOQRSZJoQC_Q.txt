Restaurant: Toast Bakery Cafe
Category: American (New)
Horribly overrated. I really can't figure out why this place always has such a long wait on weekends. Is the prospect of seeing Heidi Montag (not) eat a wrap that big a draw?. . I've eaten at Toast a few times and have consistently been underwhelmed. The Corner Wrap is oddly flavorless, the cupcakes are dry and on the small side.. . With all of the fantastic restaurants that you could be trying on 3rd Street (Joan's, A.O.C), why bother with Toast?
