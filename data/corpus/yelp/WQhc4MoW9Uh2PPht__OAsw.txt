I was really torn between a one and a two star review for Radial. I err-ed on the side of two stars because it was edible and i didn't find a hair in my food. outside of that, my recent lunch at Radial is one of the worst restaurant experiences i've had in Atlanta in a long, long time.. . the food was amateurish at best. i ordered a chicken pesto sandwich, which should be very flavorful. only a dunk in the sludge they call balsamic dressing (which came with my salad) added any taste to the sandwich. bread was flimsy and not toasted enough. the salad, which i chose as my side, was romaine cut in huge pieces which required cutting. some of the greens had brown/slimy parts on them. . . the food was the highlight of my visit. this is the worst service i think i have ever had. aloof, uncaring, slow. being called "miss lady" was not endearing, either. i felt compelled to hurry out of there...despite the fact that it took my server forever to do anything. the capper? when i asked for a cup of coffee to drink while finishing up some work - which i saw people having mugs of with their meal - mine was brought to me in a to-go cup (why don't you just TELL me to get out rather than hint at it?)...and then it took 20 more minutes to pay my check.. . i want to support local places - and this one is 2 minutes from my new place - but i'll never ever go back.
