I'm not objective, unfortunately. I used to work for a restaurant delivery service that used another FPN location, &amp; they offered great service. So my impression started at five stars. . . I hear what the preceding reviews say, but have two devil's advocate points. (1) One person representing a company makes a HUGE impression. I've been to this location a few times, &amp; the last time, the server had us smiling from ear to ear. (2) Their hummus kicks serious booty. Serious enough that I go to get the veggie burger topped with hummus &amp; do not care that their beer selection lacks. That speaks volumes.
