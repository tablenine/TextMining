These folks know how to put a restaurant together. I'm an omnivore, but my sis is a vegitarian. So, when she came to the city, we took her here. Pricey, but worth it. Their bar menu and drink execution is second only to Violet Hour. Clever usage of veggies and flavors abound here, but I have to admit that, if a highly lovable vegitarian weren't in town, I would probably opt for Spring. The flavors, while carefully handled, just lacked that zip that can only come from animals and their delicious fat. If you like to waltz with tomatoes, this is the place for you...but if you dig on swine and the like, perhaps this could be skipped. It was $200 I didn't mind spending, though. And the decor is to die for...
