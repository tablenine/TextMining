Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
This my favorite restuarant hands down! My grandparents have been taking me to this place since I was a teenager. The lobster (my favorite) is what I get everytime. I love how they put the little screens on the lemons, so when you sqeeze them they don't shoot out everywhere, lol. Next up would be the prime rib, Best we have ever had. Others have come close, but just didn't make it. I really couldn't tell you about any other dishes, because our family has only ever ordered the two dishes. . . The side dishes, appitizers, salads and drinks.....All good! If you have never had bread pudding, please try it here first. Don't be fooled, it is not pudding as us americans know it. It is somewhat of a mushy type beard. Not sure how to discribe it, but it is good, just give it a try. Shoestring potatoes are good, much better and classier then normal fat fries. oh lala! You can order a sampler plate for the appitizer and share it with the whole party. Same with the desserts. Â I have only had a cocktail or two here and they have always been good, but I am told by my husband that the Jack and cokes are the best ever there! My husband orders this drink everywhere we go and still says Lawrys is the best. He said he is not sure why, maybe it is the glasses they use, easy to handle. lol, he is funny. . . All in all, great place to eat! You can book a reservation on . http://opentable.com.
