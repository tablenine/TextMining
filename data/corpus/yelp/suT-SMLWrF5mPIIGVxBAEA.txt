Had dinner and drinks with friends at Market last night and came away impressed on all accounts.  The building/aesthetics are beautiful and you can tell that alot of effort was put in to make this place look unique.. . I had a Billy Goat's Curse salad (spinach based) and have to say it was one of the best salads I have ever eaten!  Goat cheese truffles, marinated onions, little bits of bacon...delicious.  After that I had their South Side burger.  What's not to like about a burger made from Angus beef that has a fried egg on top?  Nothing!  . . The service was quick and attentive, tons of TVs playing Monday Night Football, and even though the outdoor seating (rooftop included) were closed b/c it was so cold, security staff took my group up to the roof just to check out the view.  I was very impressed and would definetly come back!. . Oh, and the Mac 'n Cheese Muffins were fantastic too!
