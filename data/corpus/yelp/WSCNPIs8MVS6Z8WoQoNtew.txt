Thank you Spitz. Thank you for coming to Eagle Rock and allowing me to rediscover my faith in the doner kebab.  . . For those of you who have never been drunk late at night in England, the doner kebab is a greasy meat filled, quasi-sandwich set in a pita bread that you spill down the front of your shirt, as you struggle to find your way home in the early hours of the morning. Whereas in L.A. you might eat some ill-advised Mexican food under similar circumstances, in the UK we have the doner kebab.  . . Spitz's offerings couldn't have been further from those nightmarish pockets of oozing fat had the very lives of the owner-operators depended on it. These kebabs are choc full o' flavorful, moist, paper-thin lean meat (beef or chicken) and accompanied by fresh lettuce/tomato/onion, but instead of using pita bread Spitz serves it in a tasty Panini-toasted focaccia. You can also top off your superlative sandwich with one of their great sauces - cooling Tzatsiki or spicy chili. It is hands down the best thing bewteen two slices of bread in Eagle Rock, and for $6 it's a no-brainer. They also offer falafel and veggie alternatives and 4 different sides - the thin-cut seasoned fries are YUM!  . . The name Spitz refers to the fact that the meat is cooked on a spit. Only they've pluralized it. With a 'z'. How very urban. . . . http://www.eatatspitz.com.
