Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
The food is great at this place. My hubby and I split the taco platter. The steak and battered shrimp are my personal favorites, though they have a zillion. Traditional Mexican food with a fun twist. Rasberry basil dacqueri and guacamole are also must-haves.. . The one downfall to this place is that the location is small, so you're eating on top of your neighbor. If you want a place to have a cozy conversation, this is not it.. . But come for the tacos.
