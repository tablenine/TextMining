Recently I visited LA with a mission to find a taco truck.  Well, I didn't find a taco truck but I did find Loteria by chance and was pleasantly surprised.. . Granted I was only here once, but after walked through the Farmer's Market for a good 15 minutes before deciding on what I wanted to eat, Loteria stook out.  Maybe it was the crowd of people salivating over the menu, or maybe it was the plates of burritos, huevos rancheros, tacos, etc., right outside of their window teasing me to steal a bite... . . Thankfully, by the time I went back, the line had died down but I could not choose for the life of me.  I went for the Taco platter to just try them all, as well as a cup of Tortilla soup and an order of limeade - all for under $20.  Yes, the taco platter was around $15 but I know that if I had actually known what I wanted, most tacos were only a couple bucks each or less.. . Order came within ten minutes, not bad considering they had to make 12 individual mini-tacos.  Even though I could not tell you which taco was what, those 12  bite-sized mini-tacos were the best things I had on my whole trip and actually filled me up.  I think my favorites were the spicy chicken tacos and mushroom, but really all had a unique flavor and would get any one of them again.  If I am back in the area, I will definitely be hitting up Loteria again.
