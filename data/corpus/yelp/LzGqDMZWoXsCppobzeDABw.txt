Now i'd like to say, the food is OK here. Nothing really spectacular, and it's extremely crowded and stuffy (hot). Â The main reason I dislike this place is because the service STINKS. . .  Our group had 8 people, so first, they had to separate us into two groups (of 4). That wasn't the deal breaker. Next, they forced us to hurry up and order, or they'd KICK US OUT then and there.. .  My brother got there about 15 mins late due to traffic on the 10/405. (You know how that is!)...and upon getting here "late," they told him that he wasn't allowed to order AT ALL. No If's/ands/or buts. . . Then the lady offended someone in my group by being rude to her and ignoring all of her requests (which includes refilling her tea). My family friend decided not to give her a decent tip, and as we walked out of the restaurant, the same obnoxious waitress came out and harrassed her w/out shame. She asked for a 20% tip. . . EXCUSE ME , WOMAN.. 1. FIrst of all--you separate us.. 2. Then you rush us to order and threaten to kick us out if we don't.. 3. Then you don't let my brother order. . 4. Then you treat our party with disrespect.. 5. Then you run up from behind us when we're in front of the restaurant &amp; demand a 20% tip when you don't deserve it. . . HECK NO!. . Oh and P.S. did I tell you that it normally takes from 30-60 mins to get seated?! It's only because it's a small place. HORRIBLE.
