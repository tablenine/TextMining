I went there with my parents while waiting between appointments at House Ear Clinic. It was a bit of a walk from the clinic, but it was worth it. we all had the same thing, the famous #19, a very tall pastrami sandwich. The quality, according to my Staten Island raised Brooklyn breded mother, is one of the best.. . It was a bittersweet moment for me because that day I realized I not like pastrami. I hated them! Also it cost my poor step-dad $57 bucks! That includes the sandwiches, the drinks, and a cheese fries my mother wanted so bad.. . I would have given it a 5 starts but the price made it unworthy of going back.. . Oh screw the price, I'm going back to try their matzo ball soup with a sandwich that's not pastrami!
