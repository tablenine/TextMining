Restaurant: Panes Bread Cafe
Category: Sandwiches
Best place to get a sandwich in the Lincoln Park/Lakeview area!. . Their sandwiches are so good!  Fresh soft bread and the perfect amount of meat/fixings!  My favorite is the Chicken club (they use real chicken, not deli chicken), but I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered!  Their tortilla salad is also tasty.. . If you are in the area and looking for lunch - hit up Panes!  They only accept cash though, so make sure you have a few bucks in your wallet before ordering (sandwiches are usually $5.50).
