No frills, just awesome food. I wouldn't even call this place pricey -- the last time I was there, I ate my fill of sashimi and was out for about $25-$30, which seems pretty reasonable for a top-notch sushi spot. I mean, even crappy sushi will set you back a minimum of $20/person.. . Don't waste your time with rolls -- just go straight for the sashimi. It's all killer, so just order what you like.. . Atmosphere is terrible, so I wouldn't recommend it as a date place unless you are out with a major foodie.
