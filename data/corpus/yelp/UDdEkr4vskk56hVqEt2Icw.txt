Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Took a group of co-workers here the other night.  A few folks had been asking about chicago pizza and what came to mind was the stuffed pizza at Giordano's.  We had a wait but that was ok since we found spots at the bar area.  The food did not disappoint and people were talking about the pizza then next 2 days.  The place gets really busy so I would order my pizza ahead of time and take it out.  They do not accept reservations.. . Service was ok noit great and could have turned out really bad - some of the hostesses were not that friendly but it could have been that they were really busy.
