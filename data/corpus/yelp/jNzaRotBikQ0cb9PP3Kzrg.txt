You will only love this place if you love Garlic. I mean, REALLY love garlic. If you are like me and you smile at the thought of roasting some garlic in the oven in foil and then spreading it on some thick crusty bread and you don't care when others complain that you smell like garlic for 2 days, then, like me, you will LOVE this restaurant.. . I have had only one dining experience here when I was visiting CA for work and I would fly all the way back to Los Angeles just to eat here again. The decor was VERY fun (comparable to Mie N Yu in Washington, DC) and our service was fantastic.. . I went with a co-worker and we really enjoyed reading the entire menu and talking about the food. I mean, this place is a real foodie joint and really highlights the fun that people can have with food with just a little imagination.. . Definitely good for groups and dates. There's some novelty to the locale AND the food is tasty.
