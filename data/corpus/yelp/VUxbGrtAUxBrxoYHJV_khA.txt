REVIEW BASED ON: DINNER. . Oh. My. God... I had quite a surprise for dinner at the Hungry Cat. . . This is a great place for a group dinner or date. . . I had the King Crab with a mustard garlic dip and two grilled pieces of buttered bread. It may not sound like much, but the combined ingredients makes you savor the flavor. I topped off my meal with an nice cold glass of Amber Ale &amp; for dessert - French press coffee. . . My friend had a tomato dish that she continued to rave over by the end of our night. . . Dinner can get pricey, Â but it's worth it because the food is that damn good! Brunch at The Hungry Cat is next on my list.
