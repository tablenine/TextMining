THE ORDER:. All their pastries are pretty &amp; they taste as good as they look. . YIPPEEE:. My ultimate favorites - Ham Croquettes. . BOOO:. Pastries are amazing - Cuban sandwiches are disappointing. This place is mad crazy scary busy - at all hours. They close early 7p. . HINT:. If your like me &amp; you don't have the patience or the strength to wait for Portos.           - Go to Paradise Bakery  - 5 mins away.           - Their pastries are just as beautiful, just as yummy, just as vast.             of a selection &amp; just as reasonably priced.           - And, they stay open till 10p for those late night sweet tooths
