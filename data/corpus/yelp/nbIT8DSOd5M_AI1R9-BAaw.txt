M.T. and I went here on her visit to Southern California.  We were talking about breakfast all weekend and finally on a Monday morning we decided we should finally fulfill our breakfast cravings.  . . For a Monday morning it wasn't too bad of a wait, but it was still pretty packed.   M.T. ordered the golden ticket and I got the strawberry creme waffles.  While waiting for our food we realized, perhaps we should have shared an order since it seemed like we were in a giant land of pancakes and breakfast items.  The pancakes were HUGE!! I swear the size of offical sized frizebees.  And decently stacked too! (3). . We obviously did not finish our meal.  The pancakes definately a huge golden ticket that M.T. enjoyed, and my waffles were SO delicious!  The waffels were light, and the strawberries and sauce were yum.  They also had this sour creamish like topping that complimented the sweet dish overall.  It was muy delisioso!!. . Similar to Toast, it can definately be a scene to be here.  I swear we saw Lo from the Hills, but M.T. begged to differ.  Perhaps I was so hungry, I was delusional and was seeing mirages?  Who knows, but I know for sure the Griddle Cafe hit my breakfast spot for that weekend!
