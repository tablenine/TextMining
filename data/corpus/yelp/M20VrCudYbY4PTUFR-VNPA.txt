Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
This is Hot Dog heaven hands down. This is where one can find the dog of their dreams. You can order the simple hot dog to the outrageous burrito dog.. . This place is notorious for being creative and boy was it ever!! I had their foot long chilli cheese dogs and wow!! The hot dog was bursting with flavor! I love the fact that the condiments were chopped fresh...tomato, onions etc.... . You will see why the line stretches a good quarter of a block on a busy night and you will never go and not see something/one interesting.. . The variety is amazing, the service is first rate, the prices aren't terribly bad. This is a place where one can escape the city life and enjoy a few pieces of heaven wrapped in a bun, or tortilla or? who knows? Heck, it's Pink's, you know it's going to be good!!!!. . I love this place!!
