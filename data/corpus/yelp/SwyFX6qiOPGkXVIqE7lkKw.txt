Nice atmosphere.  A bit too loud for me to enjoy a nice dinner but I understand there is a bar and it is a place to lounge.  I don't particularly like looking for parking around this area so it makes me not want to go to places like this.  Food was good but the waitress that served us didn't seem to pay much attention to my table.  I would think that if they are expecting to be tipped they would at least try to seem attentive.  Would probably go back if I wanted to go to a bar.
