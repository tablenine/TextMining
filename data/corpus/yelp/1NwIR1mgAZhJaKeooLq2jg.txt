This is the type of place I'd like to have in my neighborhood.  A place that you can spend 40 or 60 and still get a good meal for 2.. . I stopped by for lunch the other day, and started with the roasted chestnut soup -- excellent.  My pan-seared trout with tomato-caper chow-chow and grits was good, as well; the grits weren't too creamy nor too crunchy.  Was it an exciting dish?  No, but it was well-executed and didn't try too hard to be something it wasn't.  Too many restaurants go too far to be creative, and end up disappointing.  Rosebud just sources well (which is well-explained on the back of the menu) and executes it.. . They have a good beer selection, and the bar looks great.  I didn't have a chance to sample what looked like house-infused liquors, but that's for next time.  The same goes for the desserts; the list looked very tempting, but that's for next time, as well.
