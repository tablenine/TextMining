this is a great late night spot in J town. there is usually street parking in the wee hours of the evening, or there are lots as well. they have all kinds of tasty combo meal sets as well as smaller things like udon, chicken kare age, tempura, spam musubi, oyako donburi, etc.  the good here is pretty cheap and for that reason, i think it attracts a very diverse crowd.  sometimes service can be a lil slow. however, they are really nice ladies.
