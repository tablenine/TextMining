i love you~. . dduk bo sam, martha fockers. sure, there are better places to get dduk bo sam, but you can't beat the price. what is it....$15 for the all you can eat? stick to the ribeye cuts. . . come and eat till you can't function properly. every time i go, towards the end of the meal, i always here, "what? you're not going to eat any more? come on, we barely started..." to which i reply, "were the last four plates i polished off myself because you penis mongers eat too slowly not enough? are you not amused?! fine, one more for the ladies...". . i am fully aware that "penis monger" doesn't make any sense (or does it?), but i say it anyway.
