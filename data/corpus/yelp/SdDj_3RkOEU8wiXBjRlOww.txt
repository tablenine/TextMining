Sorry to disappoint the fans out there who thought this was an original idea. It's the same as the Fado in Austin and the same as the one in Chicago. It's nothing new, really, except that this Fado is not in the middle of a bustling downtown area. It's in the middle of a construction pit!  The Buckhead location is convenient for me, so I'll be here all the time.  Needless to say, I still love it.  Love love love the 3 levels, the roof (except there is no view) and the decor.  Everything is new, even the crowd.  It's nice to see new faces out and about.  Bartenders are friendly, too.   I never went to the old Fado's, but this one does have good parking. Oh, and the best thing? It's smoke-free!
