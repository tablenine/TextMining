This place was good, not as good as the other Mia Francescas, but still good. Its in a great location for people watching and the staff was really nice. My lasagna was tasty as was the bread they bring out before your meal with delicious butter. I pretty sure I would have eaten more of my entree had I not inhaled that buttery bread goodness.
