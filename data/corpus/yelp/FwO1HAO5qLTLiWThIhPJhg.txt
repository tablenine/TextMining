because it's so desperately needed, I'll just go ahead and add the 432nd review to this fine establishment... . . FOOD . lots of choices for breakfast and lunch -- we showed up after Noon, but had breakfast anyway. I put away the crab cake benedict and Mrs. Bear downed some kind of seafood omelet. we saw some people plowing through the steak benedict, which also looked quite tasty. BUT HEAVY. the dishes can be characterized as large quantity, good quality and fine taste. Definitely save a bit of room for dessert. We shared a chocolate cupcake and a slice of strawberry cream cake -- both excellent. Chocolate wasn't too rich or overly sweet and the cake was fresh, cream smooth and lite. Easy going down. I guzzled some coffee to wash it down, but it was benign flavored -- however, i'm used to Peets and Kona and all kinds of dark, strong coffees that make weaker blends forgivable. OJ was good tho. Water with multiple fruit slices maybe a little strange. . . PATIO . Is awesome. Great place to sit outside and relax with friends or the Mrs... Oh, and don't freak out about the order line being long; the friendly Alcove staff will find you a table AFTER you've placed your order. Plenty of seating for everyone who's about ready to eat... . . CROWD . Hip, trendy, chic -- very much L.A. Felt like I was hanging among a group of post-Hollywood-party-into-the-next-morning diners. Or simply an episode of Entourage that they didn't film at Urth. . . PARKING . Plenty of free street parking in the neighborhood. . . OVERALL . Solid. We'd definitely go back and recommend you try if you haven't already.
