time to update my bluebird review. it's still a solid 4 stars, and a great stand-by (meaning it's always easy to get a table here) - but i've tried a few more things on the menu that i must mention. . . 1. the mac and cheese, with BACON on top. oh yes. what could be better. nothing.. . 2. the other flatbread that has a bunch or arugula on top. fantastic.. . 3. the sloppy joe (according to george) is good.. . lastly, beer list is really great - even though i don't drink beer, my dad and george do, and the waiters/bartenders are knowledgeable and excited about all the beers they serve.. . in conclusion, i (still) love the bluebird.
