After months of curiosity, I finally tracked down the Kogi taco truck last friday night. I made my way to Silver Lake and found the truck with about 50 people milling about...20 in line and another 30 eating on the bridge on Sunset. I waited about 20 minutes in the cold air along with a line of others to order. I finally made it to the truck, at which point, the cook, told me the truck was now closed and that I would have to go to Fairfax and Melrose, their next location, if I wanted a taco. When I suggested that, as a courtesy, it would be nice to let people who are waiting in line know that they have closed and are moving on, he blurted out, "I'm a taco truck, I'm a taco truck, I DON'T CARE!" I said, well couldn't you let people know, so they wouldn't have to wait in line unnecessarily?  He said "Twenty minutes ago he told the last person in line to let the people behind her know that we were closing".  Didn't it occur to him that she might not take that responsibility seriously. When I suggested he consider putting up a CLOSED sign at the window when they decided to stop serving, he became agitated and rude.  Ok, I get that the truck lives by no rules but its own, is free as the wind 'n stuff...but that it is just lame, in my opinion.  I think I will hold of on the Kogi taco truck until another truck comes along that is not so full of itself.
