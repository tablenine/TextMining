Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
After 2 and 1/2 years of living in Chicago and listening to people go ape shit on how great Lou Malnati's pizza is, I finally made it there last week.  Curiosity of all the hype started getting to me and wanted to know what I was really missing out on...I just HAD to know. . . I told the waiter it was my first trip to Lou's and he somewhat shared the joy with me.  Once again, I was going back on the hype of everyone else and trying to create my own hype...the waiter was somewhat on board with my joyous moment.  The order took 45 minutes, which seems normal for Stuffed Pizza.  If you want to know, I had sausage and spinach on my pizza, which makes for a savory blend of tastes.   So, the pie comes up and I prepare myself for my first taste.  The waiter starts to leave and I told him he's not going anywhere until he witnesses my first bite of Lou's famous pizza.  My first taste of Lou's pizza should be celebrated by their staff.   Yes, I actually did make him wait for until I took my first bite.  MMMM MMMMM MMMMM... it was wonderful and made just right.  I love stuffed pizza with cornbread crust.  I topped off 3 slices and had to push for the forth slice.  It's up the lines of Gino's.  Please don't get me started on Gino's vs Lou Malnati's debates.  They are both great pizzas.  . . Go there and try it yourself if you haven't been.  For such a wonderful pizza pie experience, Lou you earned 5 slices on the 5 slice star rating.  You'll see me back again...I promise you won't have to watch me take my first bites for now on.
