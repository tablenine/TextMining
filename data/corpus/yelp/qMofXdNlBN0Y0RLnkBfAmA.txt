Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
A couple of friends and I hit up Milk on Friday night for dessert. The place was PACKED!! It's pretty tiny and a bit narrow so it can be a bit claustrophobic. . . Needless to say they have some good eats so it's worth it to be squished amongst other Milk fans.. . This time around I got a custom ice cream sandwich. YUMMMMM! Your choice of two of their cookies and ice cream. I chose one of their ginger molasses cookies and one chocolate chip which they used to smoosh a large heaping scoop of their soy vanilla ice cream. I loved it...the only down side? The cookies were a bit over cooked so they weren't as soft and chewy as last time and the edges were a bit hard to break through. But I got over that quickly. While it's not as cheap as Diddy Riese (Milk: $4 and Diddy: $1.50) it was DELISH! . Love Milk!
