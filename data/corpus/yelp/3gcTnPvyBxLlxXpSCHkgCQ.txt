All of you - you're right.. . Those of you who say this is a really good dog, you're right. It has a nice "snap", the chili is good, and the whole thing is definitely far better than those steamed dogs you'll get elsewhere.. . If their chili-cheese dog were available in the Bay Area with a 5-10 minute wait, I'd be a regular. But when the wait ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours, no, it is no longer worth it....so all of you who gave it 1-2 stars because of the wait are also right.. . Group hug, everybody!
