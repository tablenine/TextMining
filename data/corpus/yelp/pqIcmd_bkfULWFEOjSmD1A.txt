Mozza doesn't really need my review.  You can see the rest and know that you'll have an amazing time (assuming you can get a reservation).  However, I feel compelled to give one because it was such a fantastic experience for me.. . My wife took me there for my birthday last night and every dish was fantastic.  We started with a crostini of fresh ricotta, black olive tapenade, and basil from the chef which set the tone of the meal.  It was light and opened the palate for the meal to come.. . We shared an salad with endive, leeks, reggiano, and a light citrus dressing that all blended nicely.  We also shared a treat from the mozzerella bar:  a burracotta cheese crostini with minto pesto, artichoke hearts and pine nuts and currants.  It was a truly wonderful blend of flavors that all came together for a wonderful taste.. . I then had the pleasure of the Bucatini pasta.  A traditional spaghetti sized tube pasta, it held its structure and the flavor of the sauce (tomatoey, carmelized leeky, charred pork goodness).  My wife had a dish called Gnudi which where the raw elements of a ravioli (ricotta, flour, etc) rolled into balls that were poached and served with sauce.  Both were amazing and were clearly prepared with flavor and texture in mind.. . Then I went onto the hangar steak as my main course. Marinated in 25 year old balsamic, it made the outside charred with a sweetness that I wouldn't have expected.. . We finished with a very nice melon sorbetto in a pool of creme fraiche and surrounded by berries and figs.. . One note:  highly recommend asking the sommelier for a wine pairing for the meal.  We didn't have the tasting menu but he picked an amazing dry rose for the bucatini and a full-bodied red for the meat and they were perfect.. . Can't say enough nice things about the restaurant and the experience in general!
