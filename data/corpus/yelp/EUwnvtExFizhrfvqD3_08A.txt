The Los Angeles location is not as spectacular as the Chicago restaurant, but i LOVE me some Churrascurria! I'm not going to lie - I felt the service  was horrible when I dined with my boyfriend. They do group service, but the "head waiters" were snobby douchebags. Fortunately, the other times I dined there the service was top notch. I try to stay away from the sides so that I can over-indulge in the meat...hhmmmmm....filet mignon wrapped in bacon, yes please!  I do wish they could have some more rare options...
