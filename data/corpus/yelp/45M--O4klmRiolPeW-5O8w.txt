Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
I am ALWAYS ordering Joy's (seriously!) delivery.  While I'm not a huge fan of Thai, I really love this place.  Their prices are great, and they are very prompt both dining in, as well as delivery.  I'm a huge fan of their cucumber salad and their shrimp shu-mai.  Yum!  They just renovated their facade (maybe even the whole restaurant come to think of it), and now they have collapsible window fronts so you can enjoy the breeze on nice days/nights.
