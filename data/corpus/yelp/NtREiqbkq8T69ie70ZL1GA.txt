I'm just looking out for my health-conscious brothas and sistats. My sis got the famous ramen bowl and loved it and wants to come back blabla. And I had a sip and realized why everyone's addicted to it: the PORK FAT! the back fat of the pork to be exact lol I love fat, but that one sip was more than I could handle! So health-conscious people, be careful. It tasted like ramen with heavy bacon broth. And of course people are gonna love that, so I'm not hating on all the other rave reviews on the ramen. But I ordered the tuna sashimi bowl and it wasn't worth my $11. Although the tuna was deliciously fresh and cut thin..it was just a bunch of tuna slices on top of a bowl of rice (with a little sesame seeds and nori). I did like their homemade salad dressing a whole lot! Very creamy, mayo-based, and probably some yummy miso dressing too. . . Parking sucks! And I was there on a slow Thursday afternoon. It's either overpriced metered street parking OR ridiculously expensive parking structures. I recommend taking a bus lol jk Just carpool people it'll make for a better hang out time anyway!. . It's a small humble place where you would bring one or two friends to kick it with. Sweet fast customer service.
