Dined here for Restaurant Week recently and it was a mediocre experience at best.  Due to a last minute change of restaurant, we were unable to secure reservations so my friend and I tried our luck by walking in at 9pm.  The wait was about 40 min, but since the downstairs bar was overcrowded, we decided to head on upstairs to see if we can grab a table to sit and chat.  Just as soon as we made our way upstairs, the hostess informed us they were unable to seat us on the inside lounge upstairs because they were "very busy." Naturally since her comment was "very busy," I informed her that we did not need to be served, as we only wanted a place to sit.  Not sure if there was a language barrier but after a couple iterations back and forth, we decided to forgo chilling out upstairs and went back down to the main dining bar.  For restaurant week, I have to say I was not impressed by their choice of dishes.  To me, restaurant week presents the most opportune time for a restaurant to display their culinary excellence.  The selections should provide patrons with a good sampling of their specialty and leave us wanting more.  Their appetizers had creativity with the tuna sashimi pizza, which was quite good, but the entrees were all generic and nothing spectacular.  I ordered the salmon for the entrée, which was dry and overly salted.  As for the dessert, the chocolate cake was either over or under baked depending on whether it was meant to be a "molten lava" cake of some sort, or just plain cake.  Lastly, the bread roll that they serve at the beginning of the course tasted like it had been sitting on the counter drying out since the morning, trying to tear a piece off was a struggle.
