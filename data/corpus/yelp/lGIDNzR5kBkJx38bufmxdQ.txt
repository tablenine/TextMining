I'd recommend coming here for their large German and Belgium beer selection. They offer small samples if you ask. I enjoyed every beer we ordered.. . The rattle snake &amp; rabbit and alligator sausages were what I actually went got me interested in the place. They were alright but nothing special. Don't get me wrong they were tasty but they didn't actually taste like what they were supposed to at all. Its flavored so much that its more like a mystery meat. The regular bratswurst was a lot better tasting.. . It is hard to describe the place, kind of like a bar dressed with picnic tables lined up, with a dj spinning and its a pay before eating. I'd definitely recommend the place over any standard bars out there.
