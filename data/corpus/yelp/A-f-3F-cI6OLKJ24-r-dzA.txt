Overall, The Couter was okay. For about 15 dollars (burger and fries, no drink) I thought I could get a much better burger somewhere else. . . I had a wheat bun, 1/3 pound beef, jalepeno jack, guacamole, corn/blackbean salsa, tomato, and onion burger. My first impression of the burger was that the meat was not the same size as my bun. If they're crafting their own meat, they should at least shape it. I hate when my bun to beef ratio is off. Also, the bun wasn't toasted hot enough, it was a little warm, but could have ben toastier. This happened with the rest of my table. Â Also, the temperature of the entire burger seemed lukewarm. I know it's supposed to be medium rare, and the meat was cooked fine, but it just seemed like the food temp was a little too cool for me. Maybe it was sitting around too long while they were waiting for all the orders to go out.. . Fries were good for skinny fries, but again, tempterature was okay. We had cheddar and parmesan fries, and I felt that both could have been meltier. I didn't like the rosemary flavor in the parm fries, too strong. The dipping sauces were good.. . All in all, I just felt the burgers weren't a whole lot different from, say... Fuddruckers. And at least I get unlimited dipping cheese there.
