Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
The burger was pretty decent although I was expecting more due to all the hype about Father's Office and the $12 price tag!  Had a dark ale which went pretty good and came recommended by the bartender serving me.. . The sweet potato fries were average but I did like the blue cheese dressing served me for the fries.. . It's a cool space in a revamped Helms Bakery area of Culver City.  Great to see the revitalization going one and all the cool eateries popping up in this area of town!  Very hip and trendy!. . Okay experience overall but I could have done without the chick sitting next to me at the bar who was annoying.
