Black clad waiters efficiently weave in and out of a posh, underlit wooden bar -- which looks over an array of outdoor seating.  The food is competent and flavourful -- although my steak was overcooked (I ordered rare).  Portions are sizable and the wine list reasonably extensive.. . The desserts are _well_ proportioned and creative.  Of note is a fudge/ice cream/oreo cookie melange served over a dry ice bath.  Billowing plumes of visible water vapour add a playful accent to an indulgent dessert.. . Why a 3?.   I'm in for the food.  :).   The setting, decor and service are solid --  Location is also quite favourable.  But the food doesn't make me simply feverish to return...  I wouldn't mind going back -- not at all!  I enjoyed every bite.  But it hasn't the flair that I'm expecting at this price point.
