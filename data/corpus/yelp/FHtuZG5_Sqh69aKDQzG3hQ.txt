HUGE portions... I wish I could have known a bit more... . . I ordered the oreo pancakes, a side of ham, and a mexican type scamble served w/ tortilla chips.. . Luckily, we got there around 2pm on a weekday, so there was no wait for us.  . . Parking: Easy for us. Found a meter spot right away, but it wasn't during peak hours.. . Service: Good. Our waiter was attentive and did not mess up a thing.. . Food: portions are HUGE. The ham was the size of a dinner plate. The pancakes could feed a starving country.  . . Drinks: We got the Mochas with a bit of alcohol in them. I forget the name.  They were a bit lukewarm which was disappointing.  . . Although there were no major issues, I wan't completely impressed by the food or the place in general.
