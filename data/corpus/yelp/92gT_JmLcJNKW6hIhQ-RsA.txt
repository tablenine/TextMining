I went to Radial on a date, and you better believe I ordered the breakfast burrito. A big-as-my-head, smothered-in-beans, food-baby-for-the-rest-of-the-day breakfast burrito. On a first date. I'm that kind of girl. . . And it didn't let me down. Slampacked with goodies, heavy on the black beans (love), and with a delicious sauce that made me want to eat more than what would be considered ladylike in proper culture. Had no qualms with service: given the lazy, rainy morning she was happy to let us sit and chat a spell, refilling our drinks on the regular. Prices were totally reasonable for what you got, making this a place I'll be sure to re-visit in the future, especially during the week when I'm in no mood to wait around for breakfast foodstuffs to be delivered directly to my mouth.
