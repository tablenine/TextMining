i'll be honest - i was dying to eat here because it always smelled so nice from the cool nail joint across the street. maybe that was a case of a girl's best accessory being her ugly friend, though. anything smells better than acetone. the actual food was kind of ... boring... . if you get the chance, don't bother.
