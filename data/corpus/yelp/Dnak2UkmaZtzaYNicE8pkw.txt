Restaurant: Across the Street
Category: Mexican
Across Street is worthy of FOUR stars, but they get only THREE from me because I have never in my life been to a restaurant that charges you more to make your entree vegetarian.  Seriously ppl, you save money by replacing the carnitas with freakin' tofu or TVP.  Because you charged me $2 extra, not only should you be ashamed, but you also lose a star and let's face it - 3 stars ain't good. . . With that said, the food is really good and the patio is nice.  I've only been for lunch so I cannot attest to the dinner wait or service.  I also didn't try any of the spirits.  I enjoyed my quesadillas and may be back to try the goat cheese enchiladas.  They are supposedly all the rage.
