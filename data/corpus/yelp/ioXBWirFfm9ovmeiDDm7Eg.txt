Here's the thing about asian restaurants (and i mean REAL asian restaurants), service is crap. Like the customers don't exist unless you kick them in the shin to show that you are real, crap. . . Anybody knows if you are going to an asian restaurant, you aren't going for the service. You're going for the food!. . Now let's talk about the food. There's like over 100 items you can choose from to fake korean to somewhat real chinese.. . I usually get the thai shrimp baked rice, korean gyoza, and something random to switch up. But I dunno, most items on the menu are fairly decent. It's cheap, and you get a GOOD portion.. . The drinks are another plus, too. I usually get the strawberry mango...mmmmm.. . It's a real bustlin' place, so if you are want peace and quiet this ain't it.
