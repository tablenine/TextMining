Ok, I don't know where to begin. It has been a long time since I had food this amazing. I never ever ever order Duck as I had too much of it when I was growing up and I thought you know what, Wolfgang probably knows how to make it so I ordered Duck. The waiter asked how I wanted it cooked and I said "What?" He said it comes out rare and I said well I usually only eat fish raw and fish don't fly so make it medium rare.(Amazing!!! Next time I will try it rare). Each of us ordered different dishes and shared bites and everyone's dish was amazing and delightful on the tongue....so much so I think I actually chewed my food more than 24 bites just so I could get every bit of flavor out...and then sent it to my stomach whom was probably not happy as there wasn't any flavor left!  I did see a couple stars...WOW!!!...that's not why I went there though as I'm 'not a star watcher...if Steven Hawking was there you would see a new photo for me on my profile doing bunny ears with Mr. Hawking. Anyway the wine selection is vast o' so vast and expensive $70 is a cheap bottle and goes well into the hundreds but they are well above average wine so you would pay the same if you bought it at a store. Spago also has a full bar so if you want beer or a mixed drink you'll be happy. Spago changes the menu daily so chances are you will not see the same options twice in the same week which is also nice. I live in Denver so I will probably never see the same food choices in my life. : ) The desserts we also shared and were all soul food for the palate. Dress is mostly dressy but who know if you wear jeans like I did people might think your a star to which they did not with me. ; )  Expect approx $80-$100/person and then add the tip.  Excellent wait staff, excellent food, excellent decor and yes I will go there again when I visit CA again.
