Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
It was good, but I thought there would be more to the "Toast".   For example, it would be cool if they had crazy good breads for toast and a larger selection of french toast.  (I'd take the Bongo's Room stuffed french toast over this restaurant's version any day.). . However, the lemon poppyseed pancakes were so delicious!
