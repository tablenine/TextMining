Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Growing up eating cheap hotdogs, the kind that you buy in bulk, usually eight squished in a plastic bag, I was not prepared for these REAL hotdogs.  I wasn't particularlyl fond of the way the hotdog popped in my mouth and had this thick cover over the meat.  Soon I found out that's how real hotdogs are supposed to taste.  After a few more long queue adventures, I still couldn't adjust to like these authentic to-die-for hotdogs.  To my pauper palette, Pink's is just a-ok and not worth the long wait.
