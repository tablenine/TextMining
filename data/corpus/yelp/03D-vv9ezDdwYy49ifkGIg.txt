Awesome breakfast at Griddle Cafe.  We arrived on a Sunday at about 10:15am and were told the wait for two would be about 15 mins.  We ended up waiting about 25 minutes or so, but it was no big deal. (Note: when we left at 11:30a, the wait was quoted as 45 mins and there were about 3 or 4x the people waiting outside - I'd get there early to avoid long waits).. . The guy seating us along with our server (do all the servers have to look like Ashton Kutcher? Not that I'm complaining...) were awesome. Attentive and with personality - yay!. . We ordered right away. I got the cheesecake french toast and he got the banana/walnut/carmel pancakes. We knew it would be way too much food, but we decided to over-order to try a few different things.. . Both dishes were awesome. The french toast wasn't fluffy or big (kind of flat) but the cheesecake and graham cracker topping was awesome. The pancakes were huge! Lots of banana and crumbled topping.  Super tasty. We were hungry and ate only about 40% of the french toast and literally 20% of the pancakes. The portions are just crazy. . . I left with a sugar rush and later crashed. We'll be back, but this can't be a 'regular breakfast'.
