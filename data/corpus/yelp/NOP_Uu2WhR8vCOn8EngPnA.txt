Let's dig in.. I don't eat meat so I ordered the italian veggie sausage with sweet peppers and grilled onions.  It was just ok.  The flavor was fine but the texture was off.  To boot, the sweet peppers and onions were super bland and didn't contribute a thing to the sausage.  The mustards could be better labeled so I know which type I'm squeezing on my sandwich.  They have such a simple and limited menu, how did they get both of my dipping sauces wrong?  . The beer and fries are good though.    . I like the communal seating arrangement but the butcher paper on the table tops is infrequently changed and it is very unappetizing eating on someone else's grease stains.  . I wanted to eat here once before but the awkward and SLOW cashier arrangement keeps guests standing outside in the cold.  It can become very frustrating so I left.  I barely had the patience to wait the second time around.     . I would only come back if I was with a group who insisted on it.
