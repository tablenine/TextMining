I've been to Serpas on several occasions, but am only now getting around to writing a review.. . My first visit was when the place first opened. I went with a friend to the bar for drinks and appetizers and to check the place out. The staff was friendly, the space and lighting pleasant, and the food (flash-fried oysters and mushroom bruschetta) was awesome!. . The second visit was for their first crawfish boil. The patio was packed and owner/chef Scott kept the food coming until everyone was stuffed. If I could give this place 12 stars, I would for that day.. . Since then, I have been back a few times to the bar (strangely I have never eaten a meal at Serpas, but I have no reason to think it would not be excellent). The bartenders are engaging and attentive. The specialty drinks are delicious, and the appetizers are fresh and filling.. . I'm looking forward to my first meal.
