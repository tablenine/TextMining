I went here for brunch this morning, so this review is fresh.. . I was ready to not like this place. The menu looked good and everyone inside looked like they were enjoying their food, but it's hard to be excited about your meal when you're waiting outside in the cold.. . After an hour and a half wait, I was thinking this place better be damn good. The free coffee was decent, but there's only so much hot coffee can make up for when you're hungry and cold. My party of four finally got a seat, but unfortunately it was by the door, where other people waiting didn't seem to realize how discourteous it is to crack open the door while they waited.. . Despite the bad beginning, Over Easy redeemed itself with the service and the food. I ordered the Nuevo Mexicano omelet. Holy crap, it was so good. Food came out pretty quickly too and the waitress was great. Everyone at my table loved their food. That's not rhetoric. Everyone in my 4-person party said their dishes were super, including one of us who had the highly touted sassy eggs.. . Decor was cute, vibe was fun. With the excellent food and great service, I want to give this place five stars, but it's seven hours later and my toes are still defrosting. I know it's not the fault of the owners, but it factored into my rating. I'll definitely be going back, but probably not until the temperature gets warmer.
