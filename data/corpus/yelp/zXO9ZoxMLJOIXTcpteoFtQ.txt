If you want steak in Chicago, you can't do much better. My advice: throw whatever self-control you've got out the window while you dine here. Don't debate on appetizers between the dumplings, the pretzel-crusted crab cake, and the kobe beef sashimi - get them all. Eat your entire asagio cheese popover. Get the most aged, largest steak you can afford (aged in their Himalayan salt room - tell me that's not cool). And do not skimp on the sides - I love both the tempura green beans and the old-style hash browns. For desert, think in multiples - the cheesecake lollipop tree, the sorbets (including watermelon mint!), the pear tart with basil ice cream.. . We ordered it all and I could not have been happier. Excess has never been done so well.
