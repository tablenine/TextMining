Breakfast is pretty good here - if that's all they served I might've given it 3 stars.  The crabcake benefit is excellent, and I've never had a problem getting seated and never had bad service.  That's why I gave it a shot for dinner.  But that wasn't good at all.  . . We tried two appetizers - some kind of sushi tower and their mac &amp; cheese.  Both sounded like they'd be great from the menu but turned out to be completely underwhelming.  Also had their short-rib and a red snapper special.  Not good either.  . . The food was cooked well, but the flavors were just off and poorly seasoned.  The dishes looked like they were trying to be fine dining but really just tasted like they were thrown together, like the chef didn't know what they were doing or never had any formal training.  All show and no go.  Maybe a little harsh... I won't be back for dinner but I'd come back for breakfast.
