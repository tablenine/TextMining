WTF?  How is this place only at 3 and a half stars? It's a 5 all the way.  I went for my first time last Friday night and was blown away.  The specialty drinks are so original...you'll never get one like it anywhere else.  For dinner I had the California white sea bass, wild mushroom and dungeness crab raviolis, spinach and corn.  I can't wait to go back.  Make reservations.
