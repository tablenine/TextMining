Delicious food: this is as close to fresh, simplistic high cuisine as I have had in Chicago.  Fresh ingredients, constrained portions, refined presentation.  Sometimes delicate flavors (foam garnishes), sometimes robust (lobster soup).  But nothing too fussy nor overdone.  . . Of course, it all comes in a dressier type of environment. Service is excellent and befits this upscale establishment.  Prices are rather high.
