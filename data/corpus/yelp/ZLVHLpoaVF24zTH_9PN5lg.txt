Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Went to Ford's this week for lunch. The service was ok. Friendly staff but it seemed like they had too many tables to wait, so lunch took a little longer than expected. In my opinion this was made up for by the quality of the food. . We tried the whitefish sandwich and the pulled pork panini. Both very good. I'm not normally a huge fan for french fries but I sometimes try them since it's always a good base item to compare restaurants with. Ford's fries were great. Fresh and crispy but also soft inside with just the right amount of salt. The sandwiches were good but it really was the little side items that set this lunch above average. Fresh/homemade pickles, unique tasting baked beans all nice touches and examples of what I think Ford's is all about. Simple foods done well.
