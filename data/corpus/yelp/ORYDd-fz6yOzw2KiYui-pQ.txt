This is a must-see attraction for any out of town guests, but I don't go there otherwise. The Country Boy (3 wings &amp; a waffle) is a personal fav, and seems to work for all first-timers. The staff is super slow, though. And the people peddling things outside can be quite annoying as you try to get inside.
