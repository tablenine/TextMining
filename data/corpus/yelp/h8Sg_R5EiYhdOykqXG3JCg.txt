Hands down, best bakery and cafe in the greater los angeles area.  . . If it's so good than why do people go anywhere else?. 1., it's in Glendale, and people don't realize Glendale is 5 minutes away from down town (sounds like the valley to me). 2., the line is always ridiculous, even at 7am. . This place makes AMAZING cakes at THE MOST reasonable prices.  The best ones are the Italian Cheesecake Mousse (not like cheesecake at all, but a light mascarpone mousse topped with fresh fruit), the Tripe Chocolate Mousse, and the Mango Mousse (did someone say Mousse?).. . The sandwiches and savory foods are equally AMAZING.  The potato balls (ground meat stuffed in mashed taters, breaded and lightly fried) are legendary.  The various meat pies are mouth watering.  The sandwiches are around $4-5 and really worth writing about, with the steak torta, medianoche preparada, pan con lechon, being my favorites.  But even better than the lunch sandwiches are their breakfast concoctions.  If you can wake up before 10 am and head over there, you are golden.. . TIP: This is my best tip ever.  You can actually order food and everything but large cakes at the cafe line (which states for cafe only, but this sign is a LIE!).  The line for the cafe is a fraction of the size of the other lines.
