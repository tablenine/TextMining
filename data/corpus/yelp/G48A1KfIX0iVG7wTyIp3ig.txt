Went on a Friday  night and had to wait a bit for seats. We were a big group, so all divided up and although there were many people waiting, the actual wait time wasn't that long. They move people in and out pretty quickly.. . I ordered the Hickory Burger. I thought the sauce was good, but kind of overwhelming - too much of it. The burger was good, nothing that impressive. But what killed me was the fries.  Hands down the best fries I have ever had.  I could get over the burger, but the fries were incredible.  Slightly overcooked and greasy as hell - but so tasty.. . I stopped by to chat with friends at the opposite end of the place. I mentioned that the fries were the best I'd ever had. My friend thought I said "pie was the best I'd ever had"...so he ordered pie and was disappointed.  He then went out to his car to find two parking tickets.  So his night sucked.. . Ah well. Knocked another place off my list. It was good. The entertainment was the grill behind the counter and the gruff servers. Don't know why but I had a crush on our 60-something waiter.  I've got issues.. . Anyways.  If it weren't for the fries, it would probably be a 2-star rating, but overall a solid 3-star rating.
