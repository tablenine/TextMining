Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Being from out of town, my friend insisted this would be the climax of our eating experience in LA.  I think he was right.  Everything stood out in its excellence.  Nothing ever beats a damn good pizza and Pizzeria Mozza does it just right.. . We started with the eggplant antipasti and the caprese.  All were quite tasty.  We shared three pizzas between four people and it was just the right amount of food.  The margherita pizza was easily the best (and the most traditional).  The sauce was tangy and creamy at the same time and the cheese was phenomenal.  The mushroom pizza had the freshest mushrooms I've ever had on a pizza.  Finally, the squash blossom pizza had a big dollop of cheese in the middle of each slice that I was scared would weigh down the pizza but instead was light and flavorful.. . So, why did I only give it four stars?  The waiter was a bit of a numbskull, being a bit of a smart ass.  Maybe he was trying to be funny, but without the patrons first being a bit smart alecky with you first, being a smart ass right off the start does not earn you big brownie points.. . I'll definitely go back again (and hopefully get a better waiter who can sense the mood of the person speaking to them).
