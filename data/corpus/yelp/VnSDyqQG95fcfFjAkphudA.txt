my boyfriend and i came here over the summer and i remember it was SOOOOOO hot. it was one of those days when it was almost 100 degrees at the beach, so i don't know why we thought a hot breakfast would be a good idea. anyhow, we shared the enormous blueberry pancakes. i thought the blueberry sour cream on top would be weird but it was way good. and, like everyone has said, the pancakes are HUGE. like giant monster huge. like me and my boyfriend barely made a dent in our shared order of pancakes. . . it wasn't horribly crowded when we went mid-morning, but for some reason the service was sub-par. my boyfriend ordered a side of bacon which never came. when we reminded our server, he came back 15 minutes later...with eggs. what's that all about? . . so while the pancakes are quite good, i'll probably stick to my neighborhood since it wasn't mind-blowingly amazing enough for me to make the drive. but if i'm ever in the area to begin with, i'll definitely stop in if i'm in the mood for something sweet, huge, or both!
