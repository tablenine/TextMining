I came here for an early lunch around 11ish on a Thursday and had no trouble finding parking. I got the Turkey meatloaf which I HIGHLY recommend!! It was very moist and full of flavor. My sister got the pressed chicken, bacon, and brie. I got a bite of it and thought it was okay but next to the amazing flavor of the Turkey meatloaf, the meatloaf is really worth the hour drive i had to make. . . For dessert, I got the Hazelnut Torte with Apricot cream. When I saw the $7 price tag, I was a little wary but the first bite was divine! It has a slightly crunchy outer layer but the inside is soft and melts in you mouth... Also the apricot cream filling was not sweet at all! It was creamy and made a great compliment to the torte!! My sister got the raspberry cupcake and thought it was ok. It was kinda dry, there was alot of frosting and the frosting was a bit too sweet.. Overall I really enjoyed my lunch and look forward to my next visit there!
