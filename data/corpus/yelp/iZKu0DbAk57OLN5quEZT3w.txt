Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
NOTE: this is one of the few less-than-favorable reviews.. . After reading about the much-hyped restaurant, my husband and I foot the bill for a big table of 8 for a Christmas Eve dinner. OUCH! PLUS a $30 parking violation ticket outside. You suck, Office Love (no kidding, that's his last name) for the generous Christmas spirit.. . Here's a demographic of the diners at our table -- 2 Caucasians, 1 African-American, 5 Asians. Guess who didn't enjoy Friendship dishes? All the Chinese! We felt the flavors were either very sweet or very salty. . . The seafood hot and sour soup was brothy and peppery, and lacked the thickness. However, the seafood was plentiful and fresh.. . In my ongoing quest for beef chow fun, I had to order that. It was sorely disappointing. The noodles were doused in sweet black soy sauce and flavorless. The beef, though salty, was tender, a slight saving grace.. . The duck in Grand Marnier sauce would have been the best dish at our table if it weren't for the excessively sweet sauce.. . One big star for the service, however. The poor waitress had to pick sides over who to hand the check to, and she was gracious enough to substitute almonds for cashew for a particular dish. And they called me the day before to confirm my reservation, which I placed 2 weeks ago.. . While the decor is classy and warm, I agree with one reviewer who said she'd rather go for good food than good decor.
