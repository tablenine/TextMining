Let me break it down quickly. The food is top notch, the service is just so-so, and the drinks are strong. What more could you ask for in a mexican restaurant?. . I just wish that the servers were a little more friendly - but I am reviewing my over-all experience. The food and drinks make this place a must go-to place. As long as you can handle the wait.
