went for the weekend lunch buffet on sunday afternoon.. not. a. fan. sadly, I don't think i'll be trying this place again :(. +1 star bc the waiter was very nice and attentive to my water cup.. . That sunday, i called a few diff indian restaurants that offer buffest and decided on this one (bc my friend said she wanted chicken 65--mighta been my mistake to go somewhere other than zyka for chicken 65!!).. . The place is a little hard to find--behind/near/around the corner/under the bridge/through the woods next to target/taco bell/tin roof--basically, the first right on briarcliff after your pass N Druid (away from Emory).. . basicallllly, nothing was THAT good or stood out here. flavors were just ok, curries and chicken were just ok. the chicken 65 was HORRIBLE--like a bad chinese restaurant breaded sweet n sour chicken type. all the dishes were so syrupy and slightly sweet...EVERYTHING!!! I had to drench everything in the cilantro chutney to make it taste decent.. . sorry to say, i wont be back!
