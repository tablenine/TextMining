Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Went to Din Tai Fung on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm.  Still had to wait for 30 minutes for a table.  I like their juicy pork dumplings and chicken soup.  But thought the food was a little more expansive than other Chinese restaurant.  A small bowl of chicken soup is $6!  But it sure was delicious.
