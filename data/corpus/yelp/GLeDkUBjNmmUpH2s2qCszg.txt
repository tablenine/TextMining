Restaurant: Veerasway
Category: Indian
Veerasway is a nice modern-Indian addition to the Randolph restaurant row.  It's adequately delicious (not overwhelmingly memorable, however), casual-chic, and fun.  Sure, you do sort of have to scream across the table to communicate with your dining partners - a restaurant trait I don't typically care for.  But it is good times.  . . The mussels in spicy curry sauce (on the specials menu) was pretty fantastic.  Spicy.  But oh-so-good!
