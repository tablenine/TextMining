Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
had my birthday here a few years back. portions are huge and the staff was very attentive and accomodating. the steak was marbled and cooked perfectly. every bite melted in your mouth and all the sides were so decadent. there was nothing that i did not enjoy at mastro's. i love love the food here!
