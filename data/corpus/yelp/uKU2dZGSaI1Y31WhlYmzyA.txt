I've only been to Toast for breakfast/brunce but am absolutely in love with their omelettes.  The wait can be a little long because it is such a hip LA spot but since our whole party (of 3) was there when we put our name in we got seated MUCH faster.  There is a mix of overly dressed LA people but also regular people who just want to eat.  On the down side, they just changed the meter laws so you have to pay on Sundays too. . . I get an egg white "favorite" omelette and find it so filling and they don't skimp on the goat cheese.  They are quick to refill your coffee too!. . I wouldn't go to Toast on a regular basis just because it is busy and sometimes tough to access but it's definitely on my treat list!
