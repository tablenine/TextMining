Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
heard great things about this place. too bad me and my peoples were let down. overrated and over priced burgers. we all ordered different burgers and none of them were memorable. i suppose this place would be great if you had money growing off trees or had a big fat hole burning in your pocket.
