Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
Yamashiro is a great place to take a date. If you're looking for ambiance, great view of Hollywood, or just a great way to impress your loved one, they Yamashiro has it. They have a nice Japanese garden in the middle of the restaurant and the food is not all that bad. It may seem pricey for the portion you receive, but it is definitely worth the price depending your your date. LoL.
