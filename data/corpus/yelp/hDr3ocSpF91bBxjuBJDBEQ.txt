Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Food: WTF. Though not a huge fan, I can appreciate americanized tacos. But not dogified tacos.. . Also, what's up with the cardboard shoeboxes - they couldn't offer re-usable trays? Not only is the food awful, they need to fck up the environment as well?!
