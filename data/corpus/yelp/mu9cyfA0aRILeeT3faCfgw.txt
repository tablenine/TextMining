Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
I lived in Chicago for 3 years so I have had some great steak.  Mastro's is definitely up there in the top 5.  The bread basket is ok - it's nice and warm - the parmasean crusted bread is nice and crunchy but I dont' like to use up my stomach space on bread :)  The bone in rib eye is nice for those who prefer their meat cooked through a little more.  I like their fillet - I order it rare - it is the tenderest most flavorful piece of meat...  The seafood tower is tasty and impressive presentation with the dry ice.  The sides are pretty traditional - creamed spinach, creamed corn, mashed potato, etc.  The dessert left a little to be desired - it tasted fine but nothing special.  Ruth Chris has great cheesecake - it's a mini cheesecake vs Mastro's - which is a wedge.
