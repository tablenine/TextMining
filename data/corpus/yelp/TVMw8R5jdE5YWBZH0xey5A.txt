Adding yet another review to this not-so-hidden gem seems pointless, but I want to bring to your attention how awesome the Porto's house salad is. Greens, beans, onions, and...wait for it...MANGO VINAIGRETTE. With their banana chips on top, of course. Good Lord. I'm trying(-ish) to watch what I eat, so I was worried I'd be eating yet another boring salad. But, nope! Porto's brought it. Again.. . Also, get the potato balls, pastries, sandwiches, etc.
