Restaurant: Alfredo&#39;s Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
Most italian restaurants either are dial it in red sauce places that have chicken parm, lasagna, etc. or are upscale with small portions and more inventive dishes.  alfredo's has the traditional american italian dishes but does it very well.  i took my parents there for their birthdays last night and had a great experience.  the atmosphere was just as expected from all the reviews i've read over the years.  the (very italian) waiter was wonderful.  no problems with really anything.  the food was very good but not great.  the overall experience was great
