Kudos to the hostess for initially recommending the large rectangle table, though we chose the round booth to allow everyone (10) in our party to engage freely in conversation. Our server started a bit listless as we had to prod him about drink / food specials but once the ball was rolling he was on top of it. The Pig Smorgas and the Mussels we started with were very popular and interestingly flavored. You can't go wrong with Benton's bacon!  I appreciate that the mussels were  served in a lemongrass broth( not a Sherry) and that the portion was  big enough to share with the table. The scallops we ordered were lightly browned and plated very well with tasty Oyster Mushrooms and red wine mustard, yum. Following dinner we were treated to crepes and cobbler which were an excellent finish to an excellent meal.  On a side note, the staff was not impeded by our Super Hero inspired birthday balloons! Hooray!
