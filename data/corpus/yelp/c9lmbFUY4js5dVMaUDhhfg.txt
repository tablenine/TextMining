I know this place does not need another 4 star review.. But I still have to put my 2 cents.. . Almost got sat in the Blue Room....good thing I'm difficult and asked to be moved.. The blue room is very stuffy and dark.. The music is louder in this room as well b/c it's enclosed.. So we sat next to the patio.. . I had the Couscous Royale lamb stew with lamb chop and sausage.. It was really delicious, but this was more middle eastern than French.. But this is my fault for not ordering something Frenchier.. . Not sure if I'll ever visit again, but if I do I would try something more seafoody, like the Loup de mer.. . Valet parking is highly recommended.
