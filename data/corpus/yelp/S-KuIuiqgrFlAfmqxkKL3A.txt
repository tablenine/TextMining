About a year ago they discontinued their muffins, so every time I went in I begged them to bring the muffins back. I think other people complained as well, because a few months ago they finally brought back their blueberry muffins! I think these muffins are the best on the planet. Perfect crumb-sugar crust on the top, not oily like most places, and they even make mini muffins for .50 now! .  (EDIT... now muffins are .75, grrrr, even I can't bring myself to pay .75 for a muffin bite). . Now, to convince them to bring back the strawberry cream cheese turnover...
