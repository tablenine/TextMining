I was prepped for a mediocre meal based on some of the reviews here, and they were dead on.  To start, my wife and I shared a mixed green salad with soy ginger dressing - this may have been the best part of the meal.  We ordered some Veggie and Chicken Gyoza.  They tasted very much like the frozen ones from trader joe's, but slightly fried.  Not bad, but not amazing. . . For the main course, my wife had the Veggie Skewers and I had the Short Ribs.  The veggies were very basic and plain.  Tons of sauce needed and the asparagus seemed a little undercooked.  The short ribs looked really good - they melted with the touch of the fork.  But they tasted awful.  Even with a little dab of hot mustard, nothing could save these ribs.  . . I was concerned that the service would be an issue, but our server was on top of things and very helpful.  No attitude or anything.  He was easily the good thing at the restaurant.  . . The atmosphere was a bit too much.  We were hoping to have a nice night out together, but this is not the right spot for that kind of date.  The music was way too loud and it was too dark.  They're definitely aiming for a scene-y vibe, but my wife described it as cheesy.  If you're going for just drinks, I'm sure it's a bit better, but for a meal, it just doesn't work.. . Luckily, we had a gift certificate and were covered for the meal, but if I had paid for this, I would've been seriously pissed and probably would've only given one star.  But I'm only mildly bummed, so two stars.
