Been here a few times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. French toast is great and the food overall is good but it is over priced especially for a "deli". Chicken sandwich and burgers are very good but again, over priced. Atmosphere is very comfortable and the decor is well done. It's a nice place to meet with friends and enjoy a decent meal but be prepared for the tab.
