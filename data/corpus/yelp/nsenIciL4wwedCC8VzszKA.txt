Restaurant: Gobo Restaurant
Category: Vegetarian
This carnivore loves Gobo - vegetarian with an asian twist. If you come here for anything, come for the smoky and luscious Grilled Oyster Mushrooms and Asparagus. The menu is comprised of small bites ($5-$6), small plates ($8-$11) and full entrees ($12-$19), excellently cooked dishes that make you forget that what you're indulging in is healthy and wholesome food.  Unless you're eating seitan -- not sure if I can ever get fully on board the seitan train.. . All desserts are vegan.  But stay away from the dry and uninspired apple &amp; pear crisp.  For $7, I'd rather get dessert elsewhere.. . Service is smooth and quick, and I found myself surprised that I didn't even notice that my water glass was refilled. Gobo is a little loud, a little scene-y, and has several servers who are total eye candy.  Good food and beautiful surroundings -- what's not to love?
