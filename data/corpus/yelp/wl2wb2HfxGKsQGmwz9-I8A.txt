Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
This is a combo of several visits. Across the board: overpriced, plain and simple. $3.50 for a three-bite cupcake?!? My butt to your face, Alcove. Auntie Em's in Eagle Rock kicks Alcove's (and almost everyone except Bluebird Cafe's) ass in the cupcake category (and the food!) on price and taste.. . Still, they seem to get away with the exorbitant prices. People still eat there.. . Friendly staff takes it out of the "Urth Cafe wannabe" stratosphere, so that's redeeming. But not worth the extra duckets.. . Boo-hisser: I had to valet there once and the valet broke off my key in the ignition. Three hours later, I was home. They were apologetic and they paid for it (as well they should've), but it was an afternoon sent down the pisser.. . Even though I can walk to Alcove (which I clearly should've that day-dumbass), I'd rather drive to Auntie Em's or Coffee Table for better food and much better prices.
