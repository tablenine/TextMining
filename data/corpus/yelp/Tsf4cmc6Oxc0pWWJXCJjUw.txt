Restaurant: Varasano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
With Atlanta pizza wars in full swing, we decided to try Varasano's to really get a firm grasp on the debate.  . . We ordered the Nucci and the Margarita pizzas for takeout.  . . First off, take out and parking was quite a challenge.  It took 10 minutes for the hostess to take my order and another 5 minutes for her to tell me how long it would be (30 mins).  Upon arrival, the valet was quite annoyed that i wanted to run in and pick up my pizzas.. . (Once inside, the bar is very nice and would be a great place for a quick dinner and cocktail- of which i failed to partake but hoped I had.). . My order was already on the bar for me to pick up.  It took 10 minutes for me to get the proper attention to pay.  By now my pizzas are stone cold.  I am not sure of the reason for the arrogance of the front staff- but they should lose it.. . Now the reason for the stars- after REHEATING our order at home- the Nucci pizza was delicious.  (Note- The Margarita is no where near as good as any pizza from Antico, Peros, Fellini's or anywhere in NY.  Those comparisons are highly inaccurate and just plain WRONG.)  Back to the positive, the structure of the Nucci pizza was firm, the balance of arugula, cheese and olives  were perfect.  (Note: We did add balsamic and olive oil drizzle on top.). . The bottom-line, if you want to eat at the bar, for a quick, expensive, non traditional pizza and a drink- go to Varasano's.  If you want authentic  pizza that tastes great and you want to take out or eat in-- Go to Antico!
