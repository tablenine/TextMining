I believe this is the best Italian restaurant in Los Angeles and I will explain why. . . . If you look at every Italian restaurant in LA you will see they all have very similiar menus with the same tired LA/Italian food. Why Italians come here and think they have to cook to American tastes is beyond me. For instance Angelini Ost while often quite good at times can infuriate me. They serve with fish mashed potatoes and broccoli...HUH? That's Italian??. And if you want Tiramisu go to Louise's or Maggiano's. Plus everytime you see Caesar Salad on the menu at an Italian restaurant just walk out. The salad was invented by a Mexican chef in Mexico. WAKE UP PEOPLE. . But Mozza breaks away from the pack. Tripe, Testa, Pig Trotters, Calf's' brains ravioli, ricotta and egg raviolo. I could go on. . . My favs in no certain order:. . Tripe alla Parmigiana - this is deserted isle shit man. Sweetbreads. Tag Verde with lamb ragu. red endive salad with date/anchovie dressing. mussels. basically anything on the mozzarella menu (notice how many restaurants now have burrata on their menus - they should all thank Nancy). Linguine with clams. . Oh the hell with it I like everything just about... I should just list the stuff I don't like which is rare. . . Finally go to the contorni section of the meun and what you have is stuff that not one other restaurant offers:. cavelo nero with crispy garlic (ok besides AOC - which I love). broccolini with vinegar and chiles. roasted cauliflower with greek yogurt.. . It's the best restaurant in LA IMHO.
