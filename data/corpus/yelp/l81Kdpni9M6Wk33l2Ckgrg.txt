Mmm Joy Yees.  I feel like I might sound like Homer Simpson just now.  The shrimp with lobster sauce is my favorite and I recently discovered they have a lunch portion of it that comes with miso soup.  Score.  I also love the spring rolls and the chicken, shrimp, pineapple, and lychee that comes in half a pineapple.  Mmm lychees.  I can't wait to try a new boba freeze with each trip.  The only thing that sucks about Joy Yees is the crowds and for some reason, one time I went they said they were closing even though it was over an hour before their posted closing time.  Whatever.  Still love it.
