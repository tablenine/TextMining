Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
I had never heard about this place until my boyfriend who is from TEXAS mentioned it to me.  As a native to Chicago, I was ashamed I hadn't been the one to recommend it myself.  We arrived on a Saturday night, late, waited less than 10 minutes to sit down to one of the quickest, most fabulous meals ever.  I enjoyed the small, dim, crowded atmosphere as it gave the feeling of a real Italian restaurant.  With the history of it being a hideout for the St. Valentine's Day Massacre shootings - it also has quite the history.  I highly recommend going here and ordering the pizza pot pie - so delicious!. . Few suggestions: . -Bring out of towners here - as stated in one of the other responses - it will leave them with a great experience and story to tell. -Go in a smaller group. -Bring cash
