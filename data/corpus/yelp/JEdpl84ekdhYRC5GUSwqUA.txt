This time I went to Sola for dinner- my previous review was for lunch.  The place has a wonderful friendly warm and cozy atmosphere.  I went with a few friends for my birthday.. . Everyone had a different dish- lab chops, wagu beef, beef short fibs, seared tuna, salmon, pork, etc.  I had the pot-sticker appetizer which well.. tasted like your regular pot-stickers so i might not order that again.   The lamb chops 9my dish) was very good although it is their signature dish and stuffed with Gorgonzola cheese.  The Gorgonzola was a little over powering but the presentation was very nice and the lam chops were perfectly cooked.  I think everyone enjoyed their selections except the wagu beef was supposedly somewhat tough.. . The desserts were very good and there were many different options.  I had the molten chocolate cake which was good but pretty standard.  The peanut brittle ice cream that accompanied it was very delicious.  . . The service was very good and they had the table for my party reserved well in advance (some of my friends accidentally got there 30 minutes early).  The only caveat is that if you have reservations for 5+ people they require a credit card number.
