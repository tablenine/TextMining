Once was enough, but I've been dragged here six or seven times for birthdays and the like.  This place is terribly overrated.  The food is overpriced for the flavor and portion, and while the sidewalk patio is nice in the summertime, so is every other sidewalk patio in the city when you only get a few good months of summer.  . . Service has never been great, and the only dishes that aren't terrible are the edamame and crab rangoon, but it's difficult to mess up nature or fried dough/cheese.  . . There is nothing special about this place, and with the high price/low quality strategy, there's no reason to go.
