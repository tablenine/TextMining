Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
While their famous world-wide for their "xiao lung bao"  I personally think that their food is over priced as compared to other Chinese restaurants, their bun is good and juicy, however, their beef noodle soup at times does taste somewhat bland and beef is not that tender.  I do not like to wait over 1hour to be seated. other than that it is a okay restaurant.
