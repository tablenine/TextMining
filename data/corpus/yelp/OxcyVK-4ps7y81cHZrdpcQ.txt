Dude.. . I ate at a place called The Oinkster.. . They serve pork products in relation to meals.. . Pork sounds like a dirty word right now.. . As if I was to say, "Hey man, I totally wanna pork that oinkster over there.". . Along the same lines, I guess I could say, "I totally wanna milk that cow right now.". . Sure, both sound dirty.. . Oh, and I enjoyed my burger at Oinkster.  . . see how I worked a cow and pig into this review?  There's a nursery rhyme in here somewhere, I know it.
