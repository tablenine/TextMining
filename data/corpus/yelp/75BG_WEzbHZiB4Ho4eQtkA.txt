This is one of the best fusion sushi restaurants in Los Angeles.  Things to get:  Foie gras with seared scallops, Crispy rice spicy tuna, ankimo, Yellowtail sampler and  o-toro (probably best I've had).  Lots of great fusion appetizers and Japan-specific sushi on their roving special menu.  There's always a wait for this small and popular restaurant, and you're bound to have a star sighting and rub elbows with someone famous at the bar.  The only negative about this place is ambience and location - cramp and nondescript in a typical Ventura Blvd strip mall.  However fusion sushi is king here, don't miss it!
