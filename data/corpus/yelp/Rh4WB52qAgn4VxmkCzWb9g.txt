Seeing as this wonderful place is around the corner from where I live, I've gotten takeout roughly a billion times from Sticky Rice.... . My boyfriend and I have this thing where we're seeing how many times we order food here and NOT order the same thing twice, and so far we've stuck with it! That's how ridiculously large and awesome their menu is.. . If you're one of those people who gets Pad-See-Ew and Crab Rangoon every time you order Thai, I strongly encourage you to try something different here. They offer a lot of authentic northern Thai that is really good and fresh and not scary. Well maybe the fried worms are scary, but whatevs. Come on, I know you can do it!. . By the way, if you order something "spicy" -- you'd better mean it. They do not F around here with the hotness, that's for sure. I always say "medium" (meaning between mild and spicy) and they get it.  . . Appetizers are not their strong point, but I do recommend the Moo Ping, Shrimp in Blanket or the Eastern Sausage.. . For entrees, all their curry dishes are excellent, especially the Coconut Green Curry Shrimp-- comes with a real coconut, how cute!  When I think of the Red Curry w/ Pork, my mouth literally starts salivating. The Gang Hung Lay is delish, so is the Mango Chicken. . . The people who work here are so cute and nice - always a plus. . . I obviously love this place, and I'm trying to spread the love! Good to see so many positive comments here.
