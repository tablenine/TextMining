Don't wear any nice clothes! You eat with your hands and it gets super messy. The wait for a table is long (20+ min) but you can grab some appetizers and drinks at the bar. Also, the sauces are super spicy! Mild still burns, so beware! . The Alaskan King Crab (17.99/lb) was so meaty and good with the "whole shebang" sauce, mild spiciness. . The Crawfish (7.99/lb) was okay. Not that much meat after you peel the head and body. I definitely prefer the shrimp ($8.99/lb). . The CORN is KING! $.75 for half a cob and it's great with the "shebang" sauce. . Red potatoes (3/$1.50), just plain with no sauces, are the ultimate equalizer for all the buttery, oily, salty, garlic, spicy sauces. White rice also is good to counteract all the powerful flavors.. First, you pick a seafood meat/side order; then pick a sauce: lemon pepper, garlic butter, Cajun, or "the whole shebang" sauce; last pick a spiciness: no spice, mild, spicy, or super spicy. Even the mild was burning my lips so be warned! . Your hands will be drenched in sauce, you might injure yourself cracking shells, and you might splatter sauce all over your bib, clothes, neighbor, eyes and face!. But it's interesting to count the number of people dancing in their seats because the food is so good!
