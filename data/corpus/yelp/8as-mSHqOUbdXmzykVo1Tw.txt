So I guess from all the reviews I was expecting a lot..... . I was super impressed with the Belgian fries + aoili garlic sauce....wow!  That tasted amazing!  I alternated dipping my fries in the aoili and chipotle ketchup! YuM.. . So I ordered the Oinkster pastrami since apparently it made it to Food Network and since everyone in front of me was ordering the "Oinkster Pastrami combo"....I had a hard time deciding between the pastrami and pulled pork sammie actually....this is one of the few times I have gave into peer pressure! ;). . Anyways, honestly I thought my Oinkster pastrami was soggy and little greasy that I am used to.  Also, being NOT a mustard fan but only in my pastrami sammies, I instantly noticed the Oinkster DEFINITELY was missing mustard! I know they had it with the other condiments, but seriously?  A pastrami sandwich is a pastrami sandwich with mustard!. . However, the thin pieces of pastrami tasted good, but still a little too greasy...greasy enough to make my bread soggy.. . I only ate half and saving the other half for dinner or for tomorrow.  But those fries and the garlic aoli....phenomenal.  The fries were golden and crispy AND a good size (not too thin and not too big).. . I think I still need to find the Yummy pastrami sammie.....Langer's is next! ;). . I think what made my meal (besides the Belgian fries and that amazing aoili garlic sauce) was the Strawberry FANTA!  iLOVE Fanta!  Wanta Fanta!!!!. :D
