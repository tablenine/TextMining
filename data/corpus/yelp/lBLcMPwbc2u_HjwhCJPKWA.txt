I have only been for happy hour, but loved it every time... . . Great choices of food and one specialty martini, but they are always delicious.. . I chose the mussels and goat cheese every time... I sample what my guests have, but a girl likes what a girl likes. . Friendly staff and usually there is room at the bar
