THIS IS FOR THE NEW LOCATION IN EAST COBB:  after wallowing in the east cobb lunchtime mediocrity, i finally found a place that's reasonably priced and good.  real good.  my personal fav is the all encompassing veggie wrap (hummus, falafel, jerusalem salad (looks like greek to me), feta).  also the owner has been present since the opening, making sure the mystery thigh is hot and turning, i assume.  they make their tahini, tzakiki, and hot sauce all homemade.  the lamb shank is in my cross-hairs....oh, and go at an off time if possible; word has spread quickly and the small dining room fills up at lunch.
