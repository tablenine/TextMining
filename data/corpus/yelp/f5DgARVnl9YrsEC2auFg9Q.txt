Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
After waking up at the crack of dawn to head to LA, my buddies and I were starving the moment we landed and picked up our rental.  To satisfy our hunger, we made our first stop at Griddle Cafe in Hollywood.. . Upon arriving, we put our name down and was told it was a 30 minute wait (30 minutes for a hungry Herman feels like 30 hours).  The restaurant is a decent size, but due to a huge following, wait time can be an 1 hour or greater.  Of the many different dishes, Griddle Cafe is most known for its pancakes.  From banana to apple, from chocolate chip to Oreo, there is something for everyone here.  They have other breakfast entrees as well.  Most of them are a variation of what you find at a normal restaurant, but with interesting twists.  For example, I ordered the "Poached y Papas Benedict" which was an eggs benny on a potato skin.  One of my buddies ordered the Cobb Omelette which was basically a cobb salad stuffed inside an omelette.  Overall, I would say the food was good with the service solid.  . . Disclaimer:  I really can't strongly comment on how good the food was because A) I ate so fast that my brain couldn't register how good it tasted and B) I was so hungry that anything I ate would have been the best thing in the world.. . Tips:  . * Resist your hunger and don't listen to your stomach on grabbing something to hold you over from Coffee Bean across the street.  The portions at Griddle are large and in-charge, so the wait is definitely worth it.. * Celebrities come here too, so don't be surprised if you're rubbing elbows with Bradgelina.. * Get a short stack of pancakes to share.  Trust me, its worth it.. * Check out the my pics of the food:  . http://www.yelp.com/us....
