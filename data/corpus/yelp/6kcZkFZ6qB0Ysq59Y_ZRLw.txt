The food here is great. All the tortillas are hand made and hand pressed in the telephone booth of a kitchen that sits up front. They come out quick and are served with the right amounts of everything.. La Lengua, and Panza are my favorite. But they are all killer.. . I think people fail to realize, tacos in Mexico are not the size of a Chipotle Burrito. That is Americanized, monster-sized food. So if you feel like being glutenous or poppin a few buttons on your slacks, then order an extra taco if you must. The portions are not small, they are just right.. . The staff (many from the Violet Hour/Avec/Publican entourage) make you feel at home, don't leave you without a drink and they know their stuff. Lots of great bourbon, Del Maguey Mezcal, cheap beer served with a lime, and craftily created cocktails (if you feel like wearing your fancy belt buckle out).. . It can get packed, yea, but if you go in a group of 2 or 3, the wait isn't bad. Never stood around for more than 10 minutes to belly up against the bar or find a booth.. . Cash only can be a pain, but there's an ATM right up front. And paying with cold hard cash, does add to the character of the place. I don't think any spur-struttin' cowboy would put his Buffalo Trace on an Amex.. . All together, a fine place to hang your hat on any night. They have authentic tacos, beautiful spirits, a great staff and hell... they play records.
