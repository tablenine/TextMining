First let me say this review does not include food.  I had already eaten so I only had drinks.  I will say that everyone else enjoyed their meal though.  The oysters in particular looked freakin tasty.  And I can vouch that the boiled peanuts were both boiled and peanutty.. . Anyway, i went last night in a group of 5 and the crowd was all sexified, overwhelmingly female, and did i mention sexified?  Pretty people aside, i was pleased with the beer selection (the place is after all called TAP) and decidedly un-pleased with our waiter's knowledge of said beer selection (again, the place is called TAP!).  He was a little scatter-brained and aloof, coming back later with an explanation of the beer i had asked about.  Hopefully he placed that description in his memory bank - although i suspect his bank all "fulled up".. . Anyway, the music, while maybe not quite what i expected for such a hip midtown spot, was pretty decent and just the perfect volume.  So nice move with that.  I didn't have to scream to hear myself, let alone anyone else hear me.. . As with any midtown spot, the cocktails were exorbitant.  I mean, $10 for a Cosmo is outrageous no matter where you are.  I don't care if it's on the damn moon.  $10 will feed a Somalian family for like 8 weeks.  I'm so (sarcasm) glad my fiance decided on vodka rather than wine.  On second though, that probably could have been worse.  I digress.... . Anyway, parking was "complimentary" - so i especially appreciate that in Midtown.  I want to hate.  But can't.  Hence 3 stars.  Just be sure you wear your short dress and Louboutins.  You'll want to feel sexified, too.
