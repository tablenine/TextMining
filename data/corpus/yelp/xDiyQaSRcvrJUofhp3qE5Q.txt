O.   M.   G.. . This place got in touch with my inner true Japanese.  Line out the door, Chefs are japanese, and the guests are mostly Asian, in Little Tokyo.. . They say that the goodness of the broth is measured by how much people leave in the bowl.  And in a huge bowl (and that's the regular size) we left maybe two sips because those two sips might have perforated my belly.  nomnomnom.  . . The al dente ish noodles are boiled in a soy-sauce based broth that adds some extra flavor.  and add that with some draft japanese beer (Kirin) and I am in Japanese heaven.. . And even if we're big eaters, we split the Daikoku ramen + tempura bowl combo.  With beer we left with a $15 bill.  Cheap, yummmmmmmy, authentic, quick, service is attentive/quick.
