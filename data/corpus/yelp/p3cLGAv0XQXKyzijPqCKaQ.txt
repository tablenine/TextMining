Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
I've read all the mixed reviews about Papi's...get over it!. Just like a lot of places here in the South, no one moves at lightning speed to take care of you. The first time I went, I didn't know you had to order at the counter...I sat at the bar for 15 minutes until I figured it out. Big deal. Now I know. . They have a respectable Cuban and tasty black beans. But the thing that brings me back is the Monday dinner special...Cuban stewed chicken...Papi must put his foot in it...I can't duplicate it and I'm always disappointed if I forget to go there on a Monday...it's the only day you can get it!. . They need to give up on the WIFI...most times I've been there it's not working. The only reason I don't go there more often is the parking thing...but as soon as it gets warm, Papi's will be my reward for walking the 3 miles a day my doctor says I need to balance my diet. Hmmmmmm!!! Yummmmmm!!!
