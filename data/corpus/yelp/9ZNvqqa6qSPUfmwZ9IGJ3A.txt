Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
We were referred to Lou's by ChaCha (a service that you text questions to..the number in case you are wondering is 242242).  We walked to the Pizzeria not knowing what to expect.  We walked in to a packed waiting area and found out that the wait was 45 minutes to an hour.  My husband always says if there is a wait it must be good.  So with no other plans, we put our names down and give them our pizza order.. They do offer little slices of pizza awhile you are waiting and will never bring you drinks if you ask.. You can call in an order, pick up pizza to cook yourself or dine-in.   You can also eat inside or out.  There is about ten tables inside - no booths. We ordered a deep dish pep pizza and three cheese bread.  Both were very good.  We had left overs and ate it for lunch the next day - still delish!. We'll be back to dine for sure!
