Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
had lunch here during a spontaneous day in culver city. ordered a pasta (orechiette) and an entree. i dont remember the name. i liked the pasta more than the entree but the pasta wasnt anything special ..it was just a pasta with light tomato sauce, red peppers, and some type of sausage/meat. i liked the portion they give though, not too much, not too heavy. the entree..was a grilled chicken with mushrooms, broccoli, carrots, asparagus. this one was much more healthier so that's a plus. i did not try any desserts becuz i was too full but they looked SOOOO tempting and good. even the gelato. i probably wouldnt come back for the food but only for the dessert
