Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Came to the Alcove based on + Yelp reviews &amp; interesting menu on web site. Fabulous place to eat. Very interesting menu, the food was excellant, &amp; presentation was nice. I had crepes with espresso infused cream and my friend a lamb burger. I highly recommend both. We also shared a red velvet cupcake. Best red velvet I've had in LA, 2nd only to my mom's. The fresh, real ingredients were obvious (like powdered sugar in the frosting). Great stuff, I will definitely come back to sample more of the menu.
