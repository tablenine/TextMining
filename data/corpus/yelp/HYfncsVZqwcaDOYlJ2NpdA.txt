Great food, great service, great view.  . . We'd read some less than stellar reviews about Yamashiro, and went in hoping for the best but prepared for whatever.. . First, the place is gorgeous.  A spectacular view of the city and Catalina is worth the drive. Once inside, a beautiful, old feel restaurant, roomy with plenty of wood trim.  . . For starters we had the carnitas risotto.  People, do yourselves a favor...order this dish.I'd never imagine the combination. It works and then some. . . We raved about the dish to the restaurant manager asking if it was possible to get the recipe.  A few minutes later he returned with the chef who gives us the dish rundown and just chatted  with us for a bit.  Really nice, and unexpected. . . I had the cod for my entree; it was tender and moist. My friend had baby back...so tender they fall off the bone...ribs. Yummy!  . . Dessert, we had the souffle cake and s'mores.  . . Everything exceeded our expectations. I would recommend Yamashiro's to anyone looking for a nice night out. . . A combination of great food and great service is really lacking in many of the pricier restaurants.  Yamashiro manages to provide both; I was pleasantly surprised.  . . Good job, Yamashiro!
