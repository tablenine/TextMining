Let's get one thing straight: beer is the reason you come here.  With about 160 beers on tap and a serving staff that is surprisingly knowledgeable about their selection, this place is the beer drinker's paradise.. . The food is also quite good in my opinion, especially for a chain.  Their pepper crusted gorgonzola burger was literally the best burger I have had in my life.  Most of the appetizers I've had are decent, but the grilled artichoke was a bit boring.. . Wait times have been quite short every time I've come here.  Even around 10pm on a Saturday, the wait for our party of 4 was only about 10-15 minutes.. . Parking can be kinda bad.  You could park in one of the many near by lots and end up paying like $10-20, but I would advise you to look for street parking and just walk a few blocks if you don't want to pay.  During the day, street parking isn't easy to find, but at night it's just fine.. . The decor nice, and the atmosphere is comfortable.. . If I were rating this as a normal restaurant, I would give it 4 stars.  Once again though, I remind you that this place is about beer, and in that respect they deliver better than any other place I've been.
