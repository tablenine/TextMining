Sooooooooooooo good. The service was outstanding!!! Lay low on the breads, salad bar (Killer Waldorf salad) and side dishes (loved the plantains though!). It's all fantastic, don't get me wrong, but the meat is so good you don't want to stuff yourself with other things. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet mignon but then again, everything was delicious. I went two days ago and still can't stop thinking about it. It's definitely on the pricey side, but on a special occasion it's worth every single penny. My new favorite restaurant. And again, the service was outstanding. Reservations are a must. Earlier the better (who wants to go to bed on a full stomach?) since it gets really busy after 8pm.
