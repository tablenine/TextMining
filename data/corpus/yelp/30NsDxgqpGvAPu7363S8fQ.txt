Whoever thinks this place is not worth the trip doesn't know what a good burger is.  Get the Hickory burger with cheese (tillamook cheddar) and get a side of hickory sauce for your fries.  Then top it off with a pie a la mode and a coffee.  Best comfort food in sweats and a t-shirt, or a formal gown. (great late night grub). . Always packed, so feel lucky if you get to sit down right away.  Remember your manners and wait your turn.  Kids okay if you don't have a large group-will have to wait longer to sit together.  No happy meal toys or crayons here so don't ask.
