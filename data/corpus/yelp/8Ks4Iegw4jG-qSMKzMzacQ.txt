This place is a flawed gem. It's one of the last remaining bastions of 'old Hollywood', Vaudeville, and old-fashioned stage craft. You have to see it at least once, to appreciate the roots of old, weird America, before big glitzy budgets took over. Think of it as a 'live' museum.. . You can 'do it all' in a night. Arrive early, and catch one of the acts in the 'small' stages out front. Then, eat dinner. Then, while killing time for the 'main' stage show, wander around... you'll happen into something impromptu and cool. Take the time to talk to the magicians too, if you're lucky you'll hear some really neat stories. . . That said, the talent can be uneven; I've had nights where the 'small' stage show was much better than the 'main' stage. If you don't know a member, it's hideously expensive. (Even with a member, it's expensive.) I've also done a dinner part in the seance room, and that was OK but not great. The place is also a bit run down.. . Still, even on a 'bad' night, It's really worth doing, and far cooler as a window into Hollywood past.
