Restaurant: Canton Cooks
Category: Chinese
i am a big fan of this place over the years.  Just as Houstons gives you consistent quality with each visit, Canton Cooks does the same with cantonese food.  Things to try:  calamari, salt and pepper pork chops, pan fried noodles, House Special soup, steamed sea bass, snow pea leaves, pork/fish/salted egg.  I can't remember the exact name on the menu.  This is a good "safety" chinese place if you don't feel like risking a new place on Buford Hwy.  . . One downside is that their prices have steadily increased the past few years.  It used to be quite a bargain, but now it's on the higher end of chinese restaurants.  4 adults will spend ~$70-90 with tip and leftovers depending on what we order that day.
