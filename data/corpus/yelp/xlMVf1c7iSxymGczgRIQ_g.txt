Wow.  Tons of hate for this place.  I didn't see any demonstrators outside so, I'll leave that up to the other folk.. . Went there for the first time a couple of weeks ago.  Contrary to popular opinion, I thought the food was pretty good. No, it wasn't the best asian food I've had but definitely above average.  Had the grilled pork chops, steak tips, noodles, soup  and pad thai (which isn't great) and thought everything else was pretty good. . . Bonus points for decor and large space.  Since when have you gone to an asian restaurant that was huge, nicely appointed with good food?  I can name you some mammouth circus places it's not: Buddakkan, Buddha Bar, Asia de Cuba, Tao which all offer smatterings of gross asian food disguised as fushion. It's huge with modern decor and low lighting.  Almost like a Asian Houston's.  Like Houston's the food isn't amazing but the alluring combination of lower prices, large modern decor, chilly ac and pretty good food will keep me coming back if I'm in the neighborhood.
