I'm  going to have to come back here for a second run. My first time was not pleasant at all..  I had the ribs and chicken..  Both entres tasted like lighter fluid. 3 of my other friends agreed. Needless to say we ordered a couple more side dishes and ate that instead. No doggie bags for us..  None of us have been back since.
