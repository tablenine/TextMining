So I found myself in Arcadia with friends and we wanted some dessert.  A friend suggested Sinbala, and off we went.  The place is tiny and cramped, but the servers are terrifyingly efficient and quite polite.  After a bit of a wait, we squeezed into the tiny, overfilled place, and ordered some amazing shaved ice, which allows you to pick 5 ingredients for $5. . . This isn't the Japanese-Hawaiian shaved ice that I grew up with.  This is Taiwanese style, which was new but delicious. Mine came with condensed milk, flan, peach, azuki beans, and almond tofu--and it was wonderful.  I'd score this place higher but i tripped over every damn thing in the tiny place and definitely had to fight my way just to get to the bathroom.  Still, if I'm ever in the area, I'd be sure to think shaved ice.
