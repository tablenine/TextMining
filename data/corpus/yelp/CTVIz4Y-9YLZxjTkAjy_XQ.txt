Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
So sometimes, it's Sunday morning, and I'm really hungover and maybe sort of overly emotionally available from an intense Saturday night, and all I want to do is completely destroy my diet and gab with my girlfriends.  And this is when I send a text, usually to Allie, that says "Joan's?" and we go, and we eat, and we bang our heads on the table, and the entire day is better.. . Last weekend, I had a grilled cheese with tomato and a big cup of coffee, and it was just about perfect.  And I've had their cookies, and their granola and yogurt, and even some bites of their INSANE breakfast sandwich, and you honestly can't go wrong.  You can't.. . The first time I was there, I saw Kelly from The Office and almost attacked her.  . . They have some yummy food stuffs to browse, and you could go cross-eyed looking into the deli case.  It's my special treat, and I wouldn't give it up for anything...okay, FINE, I WOULD!  I would give it up for Clementine, if Clem was open on Sundays!!!
