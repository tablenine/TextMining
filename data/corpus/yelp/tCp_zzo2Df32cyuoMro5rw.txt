Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Man, korean bbq places are smart.  they serve you the raw food and you do all the work and pay them for it.  =D. . Manna was one of the first to bring all-you-can-eat korean bbq to ktown (or as far as I know), but i think you can get the better quality meat for the same price somewhere else.  I personally like MuDungSan (Western) and Tahoe Galbi on Wilton.   If you don't mind spending more money (not all-you-can-eat), then I like Chosun and ShikDoRak.  Yum...(maybe I'll write a review for all those places I listed.). . It gets really busy at Manna so sometimes you have to wait up to 40 minutes (even with a reservation).. . Anyway...here's the short version.. . Pros:. - meat is meat and all-you-can-eat is great!. - i'm pretty sure the price went up from $14.99, but I'm also sure it's less than $20. - valet parking (so you don't have to walk around ktown by yourself at night). . Cons:. - quality of meat. - busy...which sometimes leads to bad service. - valet parking (i hate valet parking.  why can't they just let you park your own car?!  they have a big enough lot...). - you'll probably run into people from high school...people you've been avoiding all these years.  i mean year.  i'm not THAT old....
