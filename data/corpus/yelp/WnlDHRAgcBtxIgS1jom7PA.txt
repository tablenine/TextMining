BEST Korean restaurant in Chicago.  Trust me, this is coming from a Korean.. . Reason why this place rocks:. 1. Best seafood pancake in Chicago. . 2. At the end, you get Kimchi fried rice. No other place in Chicago does this.. 3. Their meat actually TASTE good. Most Korean restaurants in Chicago, their meat taste good.. but they all taste the same. I mean come on, nobody dislikes Korean galbi... 4. I like the service. Korean waitresses aren't known to be nice in general but here they treat you like they're your mom. They take care of you. They also don't cheat you here if your a foreigner which sometimes happens in other korean galbi joints (cough cough san soo gab san). 5. BYOB. 6. Clean (recently remodeled). 7. Lots of FRESH side dishes. 8. Great soon doo bi ji gae (Spicy tofu kimchi soup). 9. Great dol soo bi bim bop  (Um, vegetable rice bowl thing in a hot stone bowl? Can't translate this one). 10. There is this stoic old grandpa (i think he's the owner) he is always standing behind the bar watching everything. I just find it cute. . . There is a wait which is the ONLY downside I could think of.  It's a small place and it takes a while to eat all the food you get.The bigger the group the longer it takes. But really, it's all worth it. Ask any Korean in Chicago about this place and you'll never hear anything bad about their food.
