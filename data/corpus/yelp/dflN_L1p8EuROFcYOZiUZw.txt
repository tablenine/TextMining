This is my favorite place for Thai food!  I drive all the way from the south bay (now San Pedro) for this place.  . . Everything is soooo good here.  Everything!  Their coconut chicken soup, morning glory, cashew chicken, larb, papaya salad, pad kee mow, BBQ chicken, pad Thai noodle, fried wonton, fish balls, saytay, etc.  Seriously, EVERYTHING!  . . I suggest you go w/ a small group, then each of you order a different plate and share, Thai style.  . . They are open really late and it can get fairly busy w/ the after club crowd, but the wait isn't very long. The waitresses are always very sweet and friendly, but I think they only accept cash, so bring some.. . They've been closed for a few months for renovation, and just reopened.  My friend says its the same food, just a nicer place and lots bigger.  I can't wait till my next visit!!!!!!
