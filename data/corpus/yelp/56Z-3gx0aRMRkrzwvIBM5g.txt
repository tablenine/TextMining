Some of the best sushi you'll get anywhere and brought to you in a no-frills setting...how original.. . Their specials are amazing so be sure an order a few along with your favorite standards. While I'm not a huge fan of spicy tuna and crispy rice I'm glad I tried theirs (to me it tastes just like Koi's), the lobster dynamite, seared albacore with crispy onion, and the rock shrimp are all phenomenal. . . You really just can't go wrong with a trip to Katsu-Ya but it sure helps things if you have a reservation. They don't have much of a waiting area or a stand alone bar but you can order a drink or two from a waitress while you wait.
