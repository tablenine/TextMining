So my bf tells me "We have to get this mac 'n cheese pizza this weekend."  I'm not real excited about it, but hey, this guy will do anything for ME (I'm lucky, I know it), so I was willing to oblige.. . "$30 to deliver any pizza," they say, so we place our order and are off to pick it up.  No problem.  $24 for a MASSIVE pizza.  Not a bad deal.  He gets in the car with the 'za and immediately, the smell overtakes me..."Holy holy," I say, "That thing smells frickin' fantastic!"  . . So we get home and dive in.  HUGE slices covered with macncheesy goodness.  And truthfully, it's not like a real pizza cuz there's no tomato sauce.  Just a carb-lovers dream of HUGE crusty dough topped with a thick layer of macaroni and cheese, baked to gooey perfection.  It was FANTASTIC.  So fantastic I crammed another slice down when I knew I was full.  But hey, I am a trooper like that.. . That pizza was dinner for us for two nights.  $24 for carbliciousness that lasts two meals?  I'm all about it.. . Know what?  I might consider listening to ideas given by the bf from now on.  But don't tell him I said that.
