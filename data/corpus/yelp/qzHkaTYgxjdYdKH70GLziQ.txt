For traditional nigiri sushi this place is FANTASTIC but if you're looking into a 'gaijin' designer rolls be prepared for the cold shoulder.  Sushi should be simple to enjoy the subtleness not overpowered by spicy mayo!  Affordable and cash only.  Wait is unbearable at times but grab a Sapparo and the brew will make it easier.
