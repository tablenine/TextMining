Restaurant: The Bluebird
Category: Wine Bars
Bluebird was not what I expected at all. They are not a bar with your normal bar food and they are not your typical restaurant that also serves beer and wine. I think you almost need to think of Bluebird like you would a wine bar. You go there to drink and maybe nibble on a little something. . . But my finance and I wanted dinner so we each ordered a meal. I had the rabbit pasta and she ordered a flatbread, we also had some frites to share. It was all great! I am a big fan of rabbit, if I see it on the menu I usually order it up. But the only thing that out shines the food is the amazing beer selection. A good portion of the beer list features 22 oz beer master specials, which hit the pocket book at $15-$25 a pop.. . All is great stuff, I really can't wait to go back with friends and order some beers and maybe a small something off the meat and cheese plate.
