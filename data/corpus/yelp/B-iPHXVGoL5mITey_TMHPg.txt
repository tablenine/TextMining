I would like to start by saying I have only been here once for lunch and I will certainly go back.   The food was so good, and the menu just made you want one of everything.   They had original dishes, with many unique ingredients.   The Cobb salad, Spring Rolls and Vegetable Tostada were all good.  However, we had really mediocre service.   It was an hour and a half lunch with only about four other tables (granted, we did order an appetizer which stacks on some time).  After a problem with the bill, the waitress could barely smile or apologize.  They seemed pretty green around the edges with the whole "service" aspect of a restaurant.  I would be concerned coming here if I was in a hurry or if it was crowded.   But like I said, Deleece=Delicious so we will be back when we don't care about wasting an afternoon.. . UPDATE:  Went here last night for my boyfriend and my sixth month anniversary.  The prix fixe meal was such a good deal:  we had caesar salad, tilapia, sausage and pasta, chocolate mousse, and the cheese/chocolate plate.  The main dishes were delicious and presented beautifully.  The salad was so coated in dressing, I really could not enjoy it.  Dessert was good but nothing wonderful.  We also had cucumber mojitos--- very fresh tasting.  Food overall would get 4 stars.  Unfortunately, the service was really poor.  There were only two waitresses, a hostess and several busboys.  We sat for ten minutes without menus or seeing a waitress and then spent the majority of the meal without water refills.  The bussers were so efficient that I almost felt nervous with the ultra-fast presentation of the dishes and the darting away from the table.  It kind of took away from the romantic mood of the meal.
