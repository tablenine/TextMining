Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
I used to love Coalfire. By love, I mean LOVE. I was so excited to find brick oven pizza in Chicago, and BYOB too! It was just too good to be true. I told everyone about it and went there whenever I could convince someone that pizza was in the cards for that night. . . Now, the wild west BYOB has disappeared (replaced by a steep $10 corkage fee) and the prices have gone up. A can of soda used to be $1.25, now it's $2.00. Pizza prices have increased by about $1.50. I have an old menu in front of me so I'm not making this up. It could be a fluke, but the night I went it also seemed that the crowds had disappeared. So maybe I'm not the only one who's a bit disappointed with the way things have gone down.. . If you aren't operating on a budget, like me, disregard this review. The pizza hasn't changed. It's still good. I just can't afford to spend $25 on a small pizza (feeds 2 at most) and one can of diet coke (this figure includes one small pizza, one soda, plus tax and tip). . . I'll miss you, Coalfire.
