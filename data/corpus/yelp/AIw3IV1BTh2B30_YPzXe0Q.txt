Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl.... . And boy is her prix fixe dinner selection for fall a real showstopper! ($23 per person includes martini, beer or champagne of the little lady's choosing, salad or soup, and one of a list of 5 palate pleasing entrees)  The portions were hefty and lip-smackingly delicious. I went out on a leggy limb and tried the Pumpkin Martini (I found it to be way too heavy, creamy and spiced for my taste), but I can imagine how someone looking for a dessert in liquid form might like it.  My girlfriend had the Spiced Pear Martini (definitely the way to go because it was the perfect blend of fresh fruit and cinnamon pizzaz). I had the vegetable stir fry with chicken (two pieces), which was hearty, teriyake-y and came with its own mini pool of brown rice, and my lovely dining companion had the salmon, accompanied by shrimp, mushrooms and spinach. We both had a lot left on our plate because Lola was way too generous! We did opt for the bread pudding dessert ($2 extra), and what it lacked in size (tiny) it made up for in taste. The strawberries served alongside were so fresh...umnumnumnum.. . All in all, Lola broke one seriously delicious leg during this evening of high kicks and high fives.
