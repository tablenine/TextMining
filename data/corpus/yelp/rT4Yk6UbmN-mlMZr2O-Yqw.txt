Had the tacos and they were a little to salty for me.  whatever you do DO NOT GET THE QUESADILLAS.  First the sauce that they put on the quesadillas looks like vomit.  The vomit you have after you mix alcohol and panda express together.  Secondly its just way to  salty.  Third mexicans are cooking the korean tacos....hmmm. weirdddddd.
