The drive up was very narrow and looks like bigger cars might have a little trouble maneuvering. Valet is mandatory and runs about $7.50 the last time I checked. Since it's up the hill, you can get a great scenic glimpse of Hollywood from above. There's also a walkway which leads you to an oriental garden. The place could get packed with people fairly quickly so I suggest making reservations ahead of time. Restaurant is quite large so it does fit quite a lot of people. Inside is very dark with extremely dim lighting (which I like actually). I ordered a Sapporo and a chilled Sake. The Sake was not worth it because it came in a special ice-filled center which means you don't get the full amount as if you were to get the actual bottle. For my meal I got the Sushi Entree which was about I believe 10 pieces, each one a different type of Sushi. I also ordered an extra Uni &amp; Salmon to go along with it. Food took awhile to come out. For $30 something dollars, the Sushi Entree was definitely not worth it. However, as far as freshness, it was up there and was surprisingly really good; melts in your mouth! The waiters seem too occupied and tend to either forget things you asked them or simply take too long. Â The restroom was somewhat hidden as it's an opening to the side which leads you downstairs. Overall I had a good time with friends, enjoyed good food, and got a buzz going. Might I add it is not cheap at all. Sushi by itself is already double the price from other places. I probably will only come back for only birthdays or anniversaries considering the drive, parking, wait times, and location.. . Pros:. - Raw fish was fresh and tasty.. - All my friends enjoyed their dishes.. - Great food presentation.. - Lovely restaurant decor.. - Great hill-top scenery with a garden.. - Tons of seating.. . Cons. - Mandatory valet parking.. - Long wait times in general (table, food, valet). - Pricey because of environment.. - Hard to find location and narrow driveway.
