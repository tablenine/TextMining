Restaurant: Flying Biscuit Midtown
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Another one of those "egg" restaurants.... . I don't like flying biscuit. Not even a little bit. Their biscuits are dry and crumble easily and their black bean cakes taste like nothing even though they have some delicious ingredients.. . The service is shitty... You have to wait forever to sit, wait forever to order a drink, wait forever to order food, wait forever to receive food, wait forever to receive check... I've had a two hour breakfast here before because I had to WAIT FOREVER to get everything. . . It's just too crowded/busy for the amount of staff that they have taking care of everyone. So, bottom line, if you want an Egg breakfast with crumbly biscuits, go here... otherwise, check out some of Atlanta's other AMAZING breakfast spots!
