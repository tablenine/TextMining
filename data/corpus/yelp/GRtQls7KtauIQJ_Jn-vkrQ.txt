This place far exceeded my expectations. . . Came here on a Sunday afternoon and as expected, there was a long wait. However, it took less than 30 minutes. This is a really small cafe and they crammed as many tables as they can. We had the please of sitting at the bar. The service was excellent, the waiter was really chill and nice. . . While we were waiting for our order, we were scouting at other tables to see what everyone else was ordering. Then I see this huge plate of red sea and I couldn't take my eyes off of it. I finally proceeded to ask the couple next to me what it was and she responded with "Red Velvet Pancake." My small asian eyes immediately got big and I just had to order it!! So I asked our server and he said the special menu ends at 3pm and it was about 3:10pm. He asked the inside kitchen and they gave it an OK!!!. . I know their french toast is the "must order" but I can't get myself to pay $10+ for a plate of egg dipped toast. So I ordered the next best thing, the "Some like it HOT Scramble" with chili cheese toast and boy was it GOOD! The tequila spiked rancheros sauce was really goood. The sausage were huge chunks so they weren't skimping out on the meat. . . My friend ordered the "Muscle Bound Scramble," and I wasn't a big fan of it. Only because it wasn't as sauce-y as I like it to be. . . Ok so the RED VELVET PANCAKES! WOW. they were DELISH! It's exactly what you would imagine it to be, a huge red pancake. It looks like a flat red velvet cupcake and tasted like one too!!! MMM. It was so sweet that there's no need for syrup at all! There's cheesecake frosting swirls on top. . . I need to come back when they have this special menu again...
