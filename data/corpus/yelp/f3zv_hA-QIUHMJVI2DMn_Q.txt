Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
This place is probably overhyped already but I'll give my two cents.  . . This is your standard hot dog stand.  Nothing great about it but it's still decent.  If you want to shorten your life by about 30 minutes, just come and eat here.  Everything is super greasy and everyone seems to like it this way.  Celebrities, Thugs, common folk, all dine here at any given time.  . . I got the chili cheese dog with fries.  I've never seen so much grease in my life.  Don't get me wrong though.  It was still really good.  However, I did feel a little bit sick afterwards.  I give it 3 stars only because you have to do it once.  After that, don't bother coming here again because you probably don't need the indigestion.
