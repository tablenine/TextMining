Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
where else can you get sprayed in the face with champagne for your birthday by your server? no where that i know of. this place is cool. ive been here twice. the deal isnt bad, $16.99 all you eat korean bbq. the egg soup that they offer is pretty good as well. and when your birthday is around the corner, and you go to the restroom for a couple minutes, come back, and next thing you know your friends are on the floor laughing because youre literally doused with champagne and you realized you have no other clothes. thats probably the best part. on of the downsides to this place is the parking. they valet, and they pretty much force you to tip the valet guys, just like Â the servers force you to tip them. if you drive stick, on a busy night, you might get caught up on their steep little driveway because of the cars lined up for valet. so watch out for that. other than that, make sure to make room in your tummy for your food cuz you better make the best of that $16.99
