Since they are both institutions in their respective cities:. . *Grandma knows best deli workers* vs. Â Sort of pissed, don't wanna be here burly dudes. . *Pay grandma* vs. Pay at a separate counter and $50 for every ticket you lose.. . *Old timers and respectful customers* vs. NY tourists. . *Man Vs. Food* vs. When Harry Met Sally. . *Free parking* vs. Fuhgeddaboudit. . *$5.50* vs. $20. . Therefore:. . Philippe (LA, CA) for the win, over Katz Deli (NY, NY). . QED.
