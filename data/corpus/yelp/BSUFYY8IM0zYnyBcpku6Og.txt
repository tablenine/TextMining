I love this restaurant!  The guacamole and margaritas are delicious!   We have dined here three times and the food and service was wonderful all three times.   Most recently we sat outside which was fun to watch people watch while enjoying their homemade chips and salsa.  The guacamole is prepared right at the table if you sit inside~ which is neat to watch.   We tried the 3 salsas with chips , fire-roasted chili tilapia, and chipotle glazed chicken ~ very flavorful.   I highly recommend ordering the Mexican Chocolate cake as well!
