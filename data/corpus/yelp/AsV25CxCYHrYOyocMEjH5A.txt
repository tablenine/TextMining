Two words-- and two words alone: carne asada. I was quite hungry when I had lunch here for the first time yesterday, so I can't in good conscience assure you that the chips and salsa were delicious or that the chicken enchiladas with sour cream sauce were quite good or that the margaritas were yummy. But there is not a doubt in my mind that the carne asada was one of the best (if not THE best) I've had in the city. I must go back . . . every week.
