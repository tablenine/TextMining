Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
First I want to preface this review by saying I like Tito's and deep fried shredded beef tacos have their origins in Mexico. . . Now I didn't read every single review here, but none of the ones I did read mentioned that Tito's was apparently shut down a number of years ago by the Health Department for serving Horsemeat in their tacos?
