While I wish I had been here during the pre-expansion days, I have enjoyed my recent experiences here for dinner and a chill coffeehouse show. . . The vibe here is warm and cozy - just asking for groups of friends to share intimate conversations over food and wine. Everything on the menu looked delicious, and the drink menu was quite substantial. I settled on the duck quesadillas because I wasn't too hungry - and they were amazing. I think I need more duck in my diet. Our waitress very helpful in helping us navigate the drink menu. . . While I am not the dessert type - we were so happy with our dinner that we just to go for the cheesecake pizza. It's vanilla cheesecake filling topped on a warm flatbread and topped off with super fresh food. Super tastey.. . The times I've come here for the music, it was so easy just to relax with the music and enjoy the tunes. Many good times were had here at Uncommon Ground.
