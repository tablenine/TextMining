Restaurant: Kogi
Category: Food Stands
I tried Kogi once when the truck came by ucla. It was the first time ever that I tried a K-Mex fusion. The food was pretty decent but it certainly doesn't deserve all the hype - with the never-ending queue and people standing around to eat it.. . I had:. 1) Kimchee Quesadilla - it was my favorite of all because the kimchi in it is sour enough, like a real Korean Kimchi, and the tortilla was soft and warm.. 2) Short Rib Taco - meat was tender but the whole taco itself didn't work that well for me.. 3) Spicy Pork Taco - meat was well seasoned. it feels spicy and taste somewhat like the marinated spicy pork you would get from a K-BBQ restaurant in Ktown.. . in my conclusion, waiting 15 minutes in line for a Kogi taco is just ridiculous.
