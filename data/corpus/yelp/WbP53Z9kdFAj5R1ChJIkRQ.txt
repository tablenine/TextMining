I went here for brunch this AM.  We called ahead at about 11:30 AM and they said they'd have a table for 2 ready for in 30-40 minutes (pretty impressive for Father's Day).  So we put in our name, and when we arrived 33 minutes later, they did indeed have a table ready for us.  We even got to choose between sitting outside or inside (we chose outside).  For breakfast, I had the brioche french toast.  It was really good-- served w/ macerated berries and a mascarpone whipped cream.  It was so good!  My husband had the onion tart with caramelized onions, bacon, and bleu cheese.  I thought it sounded a little funny, but it was actually really delicious.  Our service was overall quite good-- a little slow on the coffee warm-ups, but other than that, no complaints.  We will absolutely be back for brunch, and I'd be interested in trying out dinner there some night as well.  And while I was able to pass up the baked goods today because I was so full from my french toast, I will save room next time!  A pleasant dining experience!
