Simply, the best sushi I have had outside of Tokyo.  No specialty rolls, simple good cuts of fish on rice.  The scallop is fantastic, never had it better anywhere else.  Decent sake selection.  Plenty of seating, but everyone knows of this little gem now so it fills up quickly usually with a line waiting for it to open. I advise getting there early or expect a 45m+ wait.  Price is just above average, but less than the more trendy, hipster joints on sunset or San Vincente.  NOTE: closed on Sundays.
