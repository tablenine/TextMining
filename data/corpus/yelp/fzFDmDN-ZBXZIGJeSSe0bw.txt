In-line with what many other reviewers have said, this place is fantastic.. . Being from out of town, I read the reviews and just wandered in and sat at the bar for dinner by myself.  The bartenders were fantastic and warmly welcomed me.  . . Started off with a margarita, which was well made.  Was served hot, fresh-made bread and nice soft butter - why do some places try to give you rock-hard frozen butter that tears the bread when you try to spread it?. . For dinner I ordered the 14oz filet mignon, which was cooked perfectly and looked as good as it tasted.  Had a glass of malbec to accompany the red meat.. . Per suggestion, tried the kooky hush-puppy grits-and-cheese thing.  Being from the west coast, I'd never seen anything like it.  Little balls of deep-fried cheese and grit goodness, I could actually hear my arteries hardening as I ate, but boy they sure were good.. . Desert - creme brulee.  I'm not a big desert guy, but if they have CB on the menu, I order it on principal, and wow, it was a good one.. . Service at the bar was fantastic, the bartenders were professional and friendly and I don't think my water ever went down more than a sip or two before it was refilled.  Seemed like lots of regulars in there, everyone was on a first-name basis.. . Valet guys were great too - free parking?  Wow, we aren't used to that, either.. . I'm lucky to get to eat at amazing places all over the world, so I appreciate good food and service; this was a fantastic experience from beginning to end.. . Highly recommended and worthy of all the accolades..  . . I'll absolutely be back next time I'm in Atlanta.
