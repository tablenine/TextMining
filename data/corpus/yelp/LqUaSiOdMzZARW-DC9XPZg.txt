the food was yummy as expected but i have a few bones to pick. . "can i order the lisa's delight" (basically arnold palmer) "and just get refills of iced tea after i finish the first glass?"  (you cannot refill a lisa's delight).  this makes sense to me.  it's iced tea and lemonade for about $1.50 MORE than regular iced tea (which comes with refills)...so why can't i just pay more for one glass with some lemonade added and then get refills of regular iced tea?  just because.  that's why. . our drinks took 15 minutes.  15 minutes to fill up four glasses and bring them to the table.  it wasn't even the waitress delivering them.  it was another person whose job was specifically filling up glasses and delivering them.  it doesn't take 15 minutes.  . "can i get cheese in my grits?"  did i get it?  no.. "can i get some more iced tea, please?"  (this, after my glass had been empty for 10 minutes without a sign of our waitress).  "sure."  5 minutes later i had a refill. . look, i like fried chicken.  the waffles are fine.  not great.  fine.  the grits i could probably just do without.  the eggs were freezing.  i just don't think i'll be back.  it's not the greatest.  i'd rather not wait a half hour for a table when i know to expect awful service.
