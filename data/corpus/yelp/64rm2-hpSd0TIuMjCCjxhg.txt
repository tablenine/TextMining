The best sashimi in LA! great prices and staff are always friendly. Must make a reservation to get a table for dinner, else wait 30mins to an hour. But, it's still worth the wait. The sashimi dinner is to die for. No where else can you get top quality sashimi for under 30$. Â Always get top cuts of maguro and hamachi, as well as tempura, rice, and soup. I don't want to say too much, cause it's my favorite Japanese restaurant and having to wait for a table is the bane of my existence!!
