Comes in a close second to M. Henry.  . Super cute interior, great service and a delicious menu!. . I had the "Sassy Eggs" (just half is enough calories for an entire week, but so yummy) and a 'Blackeye" (oj with fresh crushed blackberries).. . The wait wasn't so bad, for a weekend, and it was made easier with the free J. Meinl coffee that they offer by the front door.
