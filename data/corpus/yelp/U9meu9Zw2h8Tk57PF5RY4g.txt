This 1990 NYT review sums it up nicely. Â Love this place.. . "Time staggered past, and it became more than one decade since boards had covered too many windows on the avenue. But Tom's continues to serve exquisite chocolate egg creams and cherry-lime rickeys and all the treats, from grits to pies to roast chicken, that make living worthwhile. It remains a quiet outpost of civility and service and value in a city where such often seem in short supply.". ABOUT NEW YORK; At Tom's, Coffee And Civility As You Like It. By DOUGLAS MARTIN.
