Restaurant: Chabuya Tokyo Noodle Bar
Category: Japanese
I must say, I was skeptical when I read the negative reviews and also heard from some regularly reliable sources that Chabuya was overpriced and lacking in substance.  But I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised with steaming bowls of ramen noodles that had depth of flavor in the broth with fresh veggies and noodles that were cooked to a nice consistency that had the right amount of "bounce" (I seem to be lacking the vocabulary at this hour to accurately describe noodles).  I'm not sure how much is a right portion for most people, as for me, the portions here were perfect.  I finished my bowl and was sufficiently stuffed for a few hours.  Granted I am a petite Asian girl, but my friends can attest to my mammoth eating abilities especially when it comes to anything that has chasu in it (chasu ramen is an awesome blend of Chinese and Japanese).  The minimal yet trendy modern wooden decor added to the pleasant dining experience and concerning parking complaints, I frequent this little Asian American enclave on Sawtelle and street parking can always be found within reasonable walking distance.  As for those who felt this place is expensive for ramen, I really don't find $7-$8 for a good bowl of homemade ramen in the expensive range at all...but that's just me =). . After a few more visits to reaffirm my affections, Chabuya has definitely become a fav!. . P.S. My roommate agrees
