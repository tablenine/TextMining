I actually haven't visited Landmark in a while, but tonight's Yelp party reminded me of how much fun this bar is.  I've only been here for drinks in the past, but the tasty risotto I tried at the party makes me think it may be time to try Landmark for dinner.  The 10 cane run mojitos were great tonight, but Landmark also has a great martini menu so be sure to check that out if you've never been before.  Basically, like tonight,  you can always go to Landmark expecting good drinks and a fun crowd.
