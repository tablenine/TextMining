I went here last night with some friends to eat dinner and have some drinks. I didn't realize that this place was so small, but since there was 8 of us total we decided that it was better to just chill at the bar (where you can order food also). . . That being said, this place was decorated nicely as it had painting of Mexican wrestlers on the walls (you know, the ones with the masks). The place was busy but not SO busy that you couldn't move around so it had a good vibe. . . I ordered a tamale which was decent but I also tried some of the ceviche and the fish was super fresh. The drinks were a little on the pricey side: $10 for a grey goose and tonic. They weren't particularly strong either.. . The crowd here was a little bit older than my age group. Most of the people here were probably in there late 20s or early 30s. I would have given this place a three overall but the manager was pretty fine so I'll give it a four.
