First time here and I will definitely be back! The service was outstanding!! The gf and I got out of the comedy theater and adobo was right there so why not. The guacamole was addicting! I had the steak dinner that was great and the gf had the enchiladas which she enjoyed as well. Prices weren't bad either.. The waiter brought out the b-day cheesecake that was complimentary and even sang a little bit. The bartenders were very helpful when trying to get the cake up stairs without the gf knowing what was goin on. He even came out from behind the bar and upstairs to make sure everything was good! The service alone will lead me back to adobos! Over all it was great!
