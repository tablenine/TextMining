The food here is wonderful, but has to be to overcome the issues with service.  I still love this place!  It's wonderful for brunch and excellent for groups of 6-10 for dinner.  . . Crab cakes are excellent, made with large lumps of crab meat and served with an excellent spicy sauce.  The tuna pagon was average (the tartar wasn't too fresh).  the quesadillas are wonderful and not over cheesed.   My favorite was the Asian chicken salad, excellent blend of flavors.
