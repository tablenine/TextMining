One Friday at about 11:00 a.m. I'm sitting at my desk typing away and it hits me, "Tin Lizzy's Margaritas" I grab my phone and send out a few text messages and the rest of the day goes by in a blur with the thought of cool margaritas, fries and laughs with mi amigas on my brain.. . This place is usually packed so we get there early to make sure we get our favorite spot. I'm a little disappointed that they don't serve fries here, and more so disappointed that when you order tater tots you get like 4 (it's a tease I tell ya).. . Now for the margaritas. There aren't enough words to express how much I love these. Â They are freaking amazing and they bring out my frisky side ;-).. . I like this place because although it's always crowded there's never any drama, everyone seems to get along (I think we always get the random person at our table chatting it up with us), the band is awesome and seems to cater to us (since we're usually the only ones singing along), I have yet to have a server that isn't attentive to our needs. So if you're ever at Tin Lizzy's on a Friday look for the lady that's WAY too happy, singing, laughing, and picking off of other peoples plates and say Hi!!
