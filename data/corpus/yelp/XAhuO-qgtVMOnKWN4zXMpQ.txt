I got the spare ribs special when we came here for dinner.  They were overall very good and I enjoyed my meal.  My only complaint was that the whipped potatoes were a little over whipped and had an odd consistency and flavor.  How odd?  Well as I write this review I wonder if they weren't even potatoes.  I honestly stopped listening to the specials after she said "spare ribs and caramelized onions..."  I knew what I was ordering and thus let my mind meander.. . I had a couple of bites of my old lady's chicken and it was very, very good.  I would definitely recommend the place for dinner/drinks etc.  The food was great, ambiance was cool and the wines were top notch.
