I like the famous French dip sandwiches, but I don't LOVE it.  I will always willingly go though because I don't live around the area.. . The one thing I DO love about the place is the history.  Ten cent coffees, sawdust on the floor and the big tables.  Always crowded with many long lines.  Luckily it does go by quickly.  People from all walks of life come in here.  Corporate big wigs in their suits down to normal every day people.  It's always fun to try to find a seat at the long tables and sit near random people.  If they're friendly enough, you may strike up interesting conversations. . . The location is near Chinatown.  Overly crowded streets and small parking lot.   I've always gotten a single dip beef with a side of potato salad, kosher dill pickle and a slice of pie.    Wash it down with some coke and call it lunch.  I tried double dip once but then you're just munching on really soggy bread.. . Every time I go though, I always ALWAYS hope to see someone chow down on the pickled pig's foot.  To my dissappointment I haven't witness it yet.
