Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Chris Kim's old review seem to have been deleted because he referenced Titos Jew-like qualities. Well Chris Kim will therefore not mention that. The tacos aren't that great. Cash only, 25 workers, all women; 1 register manned by Tito. It was that stupid catchy commercial that got Chris Kim curious. Well the curiosity is gone now.
