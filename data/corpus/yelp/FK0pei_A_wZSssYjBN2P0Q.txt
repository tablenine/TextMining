I must admit, the food was great, and I even tried sweetbread (esophagaus!!)...it was so good! The heirloom tomato salad really seemed like something I could replicate at home, where I'd add much more fromage bleu! The scallops were to die for, but 4 scallops for $36 is craziness! Aren't we in a recession? I could get 4lb for that in FL! The salmon was great, as were the potatoes au gratin, the forest mushrooms were just the right texture and flavor, not too overpowering.  I also had the sirloin, which wasn't memorable enough to write much about but it was all good...there was another whitefish I had a bit of with succotash that was spectacular...all in all, my take on this restaurant was this: great service, good atmosphere, way over priced, most likely to accommodate the pretentious wannabes, keeping up with the Jones'...and I'd love to meet the architectural designer who thought it would be a good idea to put the restrooms in a narrow hallway, leading to the kitchen, complete with bus boys pushing dish carts through, and maybe be/she thought it would be comical to add an elevator in the mix! Please get me that guys card, asap!! (sarcasm, anyone?).  To recap, it was a good thing I was with great friends and the food was tasty or else I'd be pissed!!
