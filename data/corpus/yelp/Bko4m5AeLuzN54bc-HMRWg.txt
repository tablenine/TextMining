Restaurant: Nacional 27
Category: Latin American
I popped into Nacional for a wine event this past week and was reminded of the charm of this great spot.  Our large party was well accommodated and the service was very good - especially since there were so many of us!  After dinner we moved over to the bar to enjoy some less formal mingling and I had another one of their mojitos.  This baby comes with fresh sugar cane (so good!) that takes me right back to life on the islands.  Kudos to the kitchen for a great dinner and the mixologist for such integrity in the drinks you serve.  I will be back.
