I don't care what anyone says, I love Toast. Their menu has everything you could possibly want for breakfast or lunch or even dinner. I love their house scramble, their fries (always served with a side of ranch, yay!), and their soup and salad/wrap/sandwich combos. My favorite is the chicken tortilla soup (I have yet to find better) with the Tony salad. Yum yum yum. Their iced coffee is delicious too and they are always generous about the refills... you can even get a to go cup when you're leaving. The people watching is fantastic here too - I love sitting outside on warm days. The wait can get a little long... but thats fine, I usually just got across the street or next door to one of the boutiques. Also, if you make friends with the hosts they'll take care of you ;)
