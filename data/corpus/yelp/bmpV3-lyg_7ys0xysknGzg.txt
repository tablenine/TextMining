Is there any reason why one should venture to the west side?  Um, hrm, vurm, shrum... nope.  No reason at all.  . . If however you find yourself already there for a cockring convention or the "Oh, You Tease!" hairstyling contest or whatever the hell it is people do over there, you should probably go to the Apple Pan and take a few minutes to forget that you're stuck in the epicenter of everything that's wrong with Los Angeles.  . . The burgers are so good that they'll make you forget how much the area sucks.  The service is so good that it will make you forget that the old guys behind the counter have a perpetual look of  "everyone in the world is a stupid fuck" on their faces.  The patrons are so cool that you'll think, "Maybe the west side isn't so bad after all" and then you'll feel like a fool for trashing it for so long.  . . Then again, maybe you're just a dick and you can't help yourself.  And maybe the west side really does suck, but there IS a reason to go there.  . . It's called the Apple Pan.
