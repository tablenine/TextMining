Eh... Despite lots of interesting items on the menu, an interesting concept and pleasant enough enviornment...something was missing.  It just didn't work for me as the synergy between menu items and actual execution on a bun seemed to be lacking.  In other words, when I bite into a burger, turkey, beef or otherwise, I expect the flavors to complement each other.  Now I know that with the Counter's custom burger options, there are bound to be some great culinary travesties, but nonetheless I found the basic flavor sub par, if not bland.  Even the bacon failed to distinguish itself.   Moreover, the food was incredibly difficult to eat from the "too small french fries" to the "Sloppy and slippery" burger bun.  Service was fair but not exceptional.  And I know, this isn't a sports bar, but my god, when the Hawks are in the playoffs, put them on the TV!  Who knows, maybe I ordered poorly, perhaps, I'm a malcontent.  All I know is I expected better, especially when compared with other burgers with comparable price points.  Next time I decide to be a fatass, I'm going to Fuddruckers.
