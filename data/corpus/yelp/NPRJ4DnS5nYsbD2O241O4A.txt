Restaurant: Holy Taco
Category: Mexican
Maybe its just that I'm super partial to mexican food, but I'm definitely a fan of Holy Taco. The first time I went not so much, but after my second visit, and giving it a bit more attention the second-go-round I think it's safe to say I'm sold. Having been in Atlanta quite a long time I've hit all the typical spots, La Fonda, Taquer√≠a, and now Holy Taco and this one takes the cake. If anybody tries to talk you into $2 taco night at Blue Frog, politely slap them and drag them to Holy Taco to eat something delicious.
