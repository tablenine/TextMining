Came here a few fridays ago after work. It was dead, much to my suprise. We ordered the San Gennaro and it was done in about 5 minutes. We opted to bring it home because there was a bottle of wine calling my name. I've read many reviews saying that you MUST eat it there because it sucks after it has sat for a while. Thats not true. (I did take a bite in the car though....that thing was so damn beautiful I couldnt resist) We ate the pie about and hour and a half later. It was AMAZING...even cold. I don't want to sound like a broken record but it was in the top 2 or 3 pizzas I've ever eaten.
