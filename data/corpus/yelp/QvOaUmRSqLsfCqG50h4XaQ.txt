It's sad that I haven't written a review, I've been coming to this place back and forth several times. Then again, there are the other 331 reviews that talk about the EXACT same thing.. . Guess what's good? The Hainan Chicken.. . As an FYI, the pastas here are good (cause of the damn bread) but it's not Italian pasta, it's like soup. It's Asian pasta. Then you have the equally good pizza. Then the good dishes, then the delicious escargot (disgusting but good).. . Woo, I'm so freakin fat!
