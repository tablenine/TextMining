Not totally sure what I was expecting--after only scanning the Yelp reviews (I should know better to do some serious investigation) I decided on mac 'n cheese pizza out of boredom and the decided need to expand my food universe a bit.. . We arrived and the music was BLASTING. I mean, right, most people that roll up in here at 2am were probably just at some place down the street with twice the volume levels, but for a Sunday night, it seemed a little unnecessary. Checking out all the crazy pizzas on display, my man and I weren't sure if they actually served "regular" pizzas with "regular" toppings (and my bad for not asking) but we settled on the mac 'n cheese and bbq steak and french fries pizza. . . Being even more a pizza purist than I, he was definitely freaked out by his own order. I will say that I liked the bbq sauce--it was tangy and sweet and not too overwhelming, but the french fries were weird and soggy. The mac 'n cheese pizza was, well, mac 'n cheese on bread. Cool concept, but not the best in actual execution--kind of bland, actually. I may or may not feel differently if I was 4 or 5 beers in...but not this time.. . Maybe I'm slowly turning into a sheltered recluse and every establishment in Wrigleyville really isn't all that bad...or I'm just never drunk enough to be there? Sorry Ian's.
