Restaurant: Ria&#39;s Bluebird
Category: Southern
Ria's would be my pick for best brunch in Atlanta bar none. Add up all the factors: excellent, varied menu, super hip, laid-back atmosphere, friendly staff. The only problem is that many people are catching on to the greatness of this joint, so will likely have a wait to deal with on the weekend. But it's worth it.
