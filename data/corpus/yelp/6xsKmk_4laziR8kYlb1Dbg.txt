I went here last night w/ a friend to check out Prix Fixe Wednesdays.  How can you top Prix Fixe AND BYOB on the same night?  You can't.. . The space was cute and everyone was VERY nice.  This is the kind of place where the chef comes out and talks to you if he's not busy.  Of course, I got what he recommended, the Chef's special, which was an African bouillabaisse, if you will.  It was really good.  My friend got the Pork Pie.  I know it sounds not so good but it was REALLY good.  They need to come up w/ a better name.. . The nice thing about the Prix Fixe night is that you can switch around, ie order an appetizer, a salad and a main course (skip desert) or get either an appetizer/salad, a main and then get desert.  It's nice to have that flexibility.. . The cesear salad had a little too much dressing for my taste, but it was good dressing.  We also ordered the artichoke fritters (yum) and the gouda tasting (also yum).  The gouda tasting comes out with fried bread.  Yes, you read that right--FRIED bread.  This restaurant is not kind to your waistline.. . For desert we split the bread pudding, which was REALLY good.  For those avid yelpers, you know I'm a stickler for service, and I will give it a 5 for service.  This is a place where you'll never have to ask for a water refill.  They are chatty if you want them to be, and very discreet if you are having a deep conversation.  I LOVE service like this.. . It only loses one star b/c there were no "lite &amp; healthy" entrees...everything was very comfort foody but don't expect to eat lightly here!  We were sooooo full when we left.
