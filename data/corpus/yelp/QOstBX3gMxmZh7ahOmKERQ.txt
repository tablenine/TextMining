Wow.. . My boyfriend and I came here last night and we both LOVED it. As others have mentioned, the waitstaff are welcoming and overall just amazing. I felt like they were truly happy to have us in there.. . The pizza is...definitely the best thin crust in Chicago. Perfectly crisp, amazingly floppy, made with excellent ingredients. I want to go back and try every kind of pizza they have.. . Sadly, we were informed that they were no longer BYOB, but they do have an assortment of affordable wines by the glass - and our server even went out of her way to make available a wine that was normally only available by the bottle - just a little gesture that made me remember what truly exceptional service is.. . It's unassuming, so you might miss it, but make sure you find it! It's totally worth it.
