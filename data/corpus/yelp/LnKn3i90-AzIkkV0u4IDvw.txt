Still one of the best out there. . . The manfriend and I wandered in on a bustling Sunday afternoon, hoping to score a seat in under 45 minutes. Turns out, we hit it just right and there were two at the counter. It was ON.. . Tom Waits for me, corned beef hash for him (which he said tasted like hot dogs - me not knowing much about corned beef asked if that was a good thing. He shrugged optimistically). . . Chocolate shake, Green River, friendly server. The vibe in that joint is hoppin' and sunny (even if it's cloudy).
