My seemingly endless search for authentic, delicious Comida Mexicana in Atlanta led me to El Azteca on Ponce. Looks like the real deal from the outside, and the kitchen and wait staff are all Mexican...good initial vibe.. . I asked for the best enchiladas on the extensive menu. What I got was a scalding hot plate loaded with room temperature factory tortillas loosely rolled with ground hamburger, chicken, and cheese (I think), smothered with bland red sauce, shredded lettuce and cold sour cream.  Nothing about this dish was reminiscent of enchiladas!  I could have cried, but I was starving, so I gobbled down the whole thing and got out of there as quick as I could. . . Fast food? Yes. Mexican? No. Repeat business?  Hellllll no.
