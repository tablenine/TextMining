Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
I love this place. The Cuban sandwich is to die for, seriously, and I don't even like ham that much (the pork and perfect marriage of dill pickles and swiss more than makes up for it) and lets not forget about the soft, delicious Cuban bread.. . I highly recommend the tostones as well. You get a huge portion for around $2, which you can't beat. In fact, the prices are extremely good for the portions you get - I always end up having the other half of my sandwich for lunch the next day and it is just as delicious re-heated (a big plus for me). Two satisfying meals for around $7? Yes please.. . The only reason it gets four stars from me is because it closes at 9PM on weeknights. Seriously? In Atlanta? I was craving some Papi's so badly the other night, and drove all the way there after work only to find, to MUCH dismay, that they were already closed. Lame.
