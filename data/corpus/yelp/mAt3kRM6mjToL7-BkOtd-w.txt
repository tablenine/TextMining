A friend of ours took us here for a birthday brunch during our road trip. He was right on the money when he described the place. Great cupcakes, food was aight, and a trendy scene. We had brunch here on a Monday morning and it wasn't too busy. I felt like I was on the set of the Hills or something. Ladies with huge sunglasses, all dolled up and everything. It was interesting to see people pull up in Maseratis and eat on the sidewalk. I usually expect people with cars like that to expect to only eat at places with valet.. . Ok, here we go.... . Food was ok. I had a sandwich. The insides fell out as I went halfway through the halves. I hate it when that happens. Turkey was good - not dry at all. Fries? Yea, they we're pretty good also. I can't really say anything spectacular about the sandwiches since they were ok. That's pretty much what limits this place to three stars.. . The bakery side was pretty good. In all honesty, the cupcakes were pretty fuckin awesome, but because I'm rating my overall experience with the sandwiches in mind, three stars it stays. . . Red Velvet. Fucking try it. That was the most delicious thing ever to be made as a cupcake. Not to mention the other cupcakes. The Chocolate, the coffee, the marble, even the coconut. We celebrated our friend's birthday here and the waitress gave us five different cupcakes. Had to try them all. They were good in my book... especially the red velvet.. . I posted pics if you wanna see. Overall, the place was average. Maybe I would have graded higher if I ordered a plate, but I'm sticking with an A-Ok rating this time around.
