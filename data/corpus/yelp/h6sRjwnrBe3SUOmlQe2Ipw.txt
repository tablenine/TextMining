Restaurant: Manny&#39;s Coffee Shop &amp; Deli
Category: Delis
Manny's is open for dinner (until 8:30PM)!. . It is cafeteria style, but instead of paying at the end of the line, they give you a check, and you pay on the way out.  They also have a great selection of candy by the cash register - including chuckles!. . I went last night, and it was delicious!. I saved half of my pastrami on rye for lunch today...I can't wait!  Only if it was socially acceptable to eat pastrami sandwiches for breakfast.... It was actually a tad salty - but still excellent.. . The corned beef was fantastic!  . . I took off 1 star for the soggy and greasy potato pancake.. It wasn't crowded at all for dinner, and I imagine that the pancake had been sitting there since lunch...it was really too bad though, because I had really high expectation.. . Meter parking was plentiful in the evening - even though they offer free valet. . . Unlike the New York delis, Manny's accepts credit cards!  Woo hoo.. . I'll definitely be trying the roast beef next time.
