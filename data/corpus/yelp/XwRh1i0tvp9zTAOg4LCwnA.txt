Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I have dubbed soup dumplings as "little dragon buns" and my love for them will never die. . . I have eaten them in Taiwan and in Shanghai...and having been turned away from Din Tai Fung in Taiwan, was excited to finally get a chance to eat them in LA.. . I guess the soup dumplings were good.  The skin was very thin and their ginger was very fresh but I'd say a bit overrated.  . . If you have to travel over 30 miles to get here, go to Taiwan or make them yourself.  The frozen ones my mom buys collect soup in them as well.
