Are there good reasons for eating here?  I suppose if there had been a horrible war and this was the only place still serving food.  Other than that?   Not so much.. . Every time I have been there I keep hoping that it will improve, yet it never does.  Most recently, It took me almost an hour to get a simple tuna melt.  Of course, it wouldn't have been nearly as long if I had simply decided to keep the first one they brought me, where the cheese was burned on half.  Not just melted, burned to a black crisp.  . . Add in the fact that it took 15 minutes to get seated despite the place being only half full and it all added up to an hour long meal that should have taken 1/3 the time.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else.
