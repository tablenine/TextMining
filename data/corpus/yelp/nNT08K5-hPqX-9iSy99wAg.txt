Not the best falafel in the city. Perhaps I was just having an "off" day. I didn't finish my falafel, and usually I love them. It just seemed like it had no taste. I did enjoy the fact that all the salad fixin's were free, and there was a wonderful array of them to compliment your falafel! But, for some reason, I just wasn't feelin' it.
