I'M IN LOVE WITH THE NUTELLA FRENCH TOAST!! . . I came here with a large group so we ordered two kinds of french toast, the whole wheat pancakes, and three egg scrambles.. . The egg scrambles were all very good but the portions for those are on the smaller side if you're sharing with a large group. But the portions of the french toast and pancake were plenty. It was even too much for our group of 10. . . Another major bonus: Our server was HOOOTTT! yummy. This is why I love how all the serves in LA are unknown actors.
