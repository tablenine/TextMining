To be fair, I should preface this review by saying that I'm a little biased.  This place is right in my neighborhood, so the location is super convenient.  Plus, I LOVE LOVE LOVE good guacamole.  Yes, I did say love three times - in all caps, no less.. . Anyway, the main reason I usually come here is for the guacamole.  But I have also really liked the other dishes I have ordered here, too.  The service is *usually* quite friendly but not always the quickest.  True, the place is often packed to the gills on any given night.  But it's also not good business to make patrons wait, especially when they make it pretty clear they are in a hurry to leave and need the bill before...next year.  . . The decor and ambience is pretty decent as well.  All in all, I'd say Adobo is a great place - if for nothing else, go for the guac!  They make it to order right by your table and it has to be one of the best - if not the best - I've ever had so far.
