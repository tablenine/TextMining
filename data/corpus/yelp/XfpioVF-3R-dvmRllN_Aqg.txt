Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
This restaurant never ceases to amaze. In a city that leaves one yearning for the roasted lamb smell of chicago's greektown, papa cristo's is the only greek in LA worth eating (save for Sofi, which is tasty but pricey). The place itself is absolutely charming, as is papa cristo, from the checkered tablecloths to their touting of the shop's olive oil as a necessary cure-all. Anyone there is willing to help, and they all stand by the dishes, eager to make suggestions, reccommendations, or help in any way. And you *literally* can't find better prices. You'll find 3 gigantic lamb chops for $10.99 (includes pita, greek salad, and potatoes)  I know!  You're thinking that anywhere else it'd be $26.99!!). The chicken is wonderful, too, and two of my personal faves are the saganaki (fried cheese with lemon) and the baklava. We were happy enough to wander in for the first time 3 years ago on a thursday night, and got to participate in family night (where for $18 one can feast upon two entrees, wine, a barrage of sides and appetizers, as well as dessert, followed by belly dancing). Every trip back has been a pleasure, and everyone I've brought has fallen in love with the place.  5 stars for greatness all around!
