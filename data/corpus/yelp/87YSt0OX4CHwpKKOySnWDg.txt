I don't know what the big fuss is here.  Oh, bagna cauda.  big deal. I had sea bass and it was slightly overcooked.  Bro had ribs and they were dry.  Bro's wifey had a tiny salmon ravioli and to me they did not really look appetizing.  They were black.  I forgot why.  Hell, I nearly forgot I ate here!  the winelist was very unimaginative as well.
