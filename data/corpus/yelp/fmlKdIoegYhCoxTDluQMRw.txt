I would imagine this is a nice place to chill, drink some coffee and people watch, but the ordering food deal here is weird and turned me off. Are those beepers really necessary? The person behind the counter was perfectly nice, but what I thought was weird is that you would expect the people behind the counter to be preparing the food and letting you know/ bringing out the food when it is ready, but no, the people behind the counter are just there to look pretty, and someone somewhere unknown makes your food and pops out when your beeper goes off. The panini I had was just OK - really I don't think it's worth trying another. I also got a way too big cupcake, which was nothing to write home about. All of their pastries actually appear to be too big, so not really enticing in my opinion.
