I LOVE Rare! Â It is a burger haven with a huge array to choose from. You can splurge on a higher end steakhouse burger that uses kobe or ribeye; or opt to build your own. They do offer organic beef and turkey options and plenty of toppings to choose from. Anything from apple smoked bacon to truffle butter can be piled high on your burger.. The fries are nothing to sneeze at. They are always crispy and perfectly seasoned no matter which one you decide on; and the dipping sauces are a perfect accompaniment. It is a little pricey but totally worth it. The staff are super sweet and the food is always spot on.
