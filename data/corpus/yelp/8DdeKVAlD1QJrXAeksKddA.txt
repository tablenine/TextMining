Restaurant: El Tesoro
Category: Mexican
I really dig El Tesoro, BUT... you've got to go with a few things in mind. It's basic. The food isn't dressed up or presented in a fancy way, but I've liked everything I've had. . . The service is really hit or miss, and I see that most folks posting here have had miss experiences. Strangely, going at off times results in the best service. . . I love the chorizo and potato tacos, as well as the tofu tacos. The margaritas I can take or leave - if they'd have a mojitorita like Casita banished, I'd change my tune.
