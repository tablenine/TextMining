The five star rating is for their bread pudding alone. It's amazing and delicious and I can never finish an entire piece because it's so big and rich. It's smothered in what has to be the best caramel sauce ever. I really can't say much about anything else here because the bread pudding is too good not to get every time I go in, but I've heard good things about the rest. Also, the staff is very friendly.
