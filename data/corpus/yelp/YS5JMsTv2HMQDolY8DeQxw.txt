Yummy.  Where can you go wrong?  . Burgers?      Check.. Draft Beer?  Check. . Fries?           Check.. Let us not forget not just any fry..Belgium Fries with garlic ailoi &amp;/or  housemade ketchup.  Black beans &amp; slaw, BBQ pork sandwich,  pastrami sandwich...  ya so I've been a few times.  . When they first opened I loved their cupcakes... last few times not so much.  . Last time I was in I saw a drawing of Guy from the Food Network on the wall.  Must assume was there for his Diners, Dives show?
