The Lost Bread french toast was wonderful.  It didn't even need any syrup.  The fresh berries and dusting of powdered sugar gave the brioche just the right compliment.  Go early if you want the Crab cake Benedict.  They ran out, so we ordered the Blu Jam benedict.....it did not disappoint.. This place is very comfortable, and the service excellant.
