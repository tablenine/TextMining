This restaurant is amazing! My best friend and I went this past Saturday and I loved it so much that I had to create a Yelp account just so that I could praise our experience. Our waiter (Wiley) was incredibly attentive and knew everything on the menu front and back. He recommended all of our drinks for the night and they were spot on, especially the ginger fizz. He also recommended the 'pickled plate' (if I remember correctly it was pickled egg, radish, artichoke and cabbage) which I wouldn't have picked for myself but will definitely be ordering in the future; it was the perfect balance to our otherwise sweet meal. My favorite part of this restaurant is always the atmosphere. Dimly lit but not so dark that you can't see your food, and music at just the right volume so that you can hear the people you're dining with, but not those around you. Would probably be an excellent place for a first date. I'll definitely be stopping by more often :)
