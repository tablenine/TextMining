Restaurant: Feast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Feast is somewhat becoming a go-to place for me, despite some drawbacks.  Yes, brunch is obnoxious, but I had a perfectly decent experience when my boyfriend and I decided to sit at the bar instead of waiting for a table.  Then again, I have gone there on a weekend with a party of 8 and had really great, attentive service.  I also went here for a catch-up hangout/dinner, and again had attentive, quick service and good food, but we did go at an off-peak hour (round 6PM).  The one serious drawback is the price...my burger was pretty damn good, but $12?  I'd rather spend that much on a burger at Kuma's.  So off-peak hours and money is less of an issue/you're trying to impress a little?  Go for it.  Otherwise, I'd probably have to think about it.
