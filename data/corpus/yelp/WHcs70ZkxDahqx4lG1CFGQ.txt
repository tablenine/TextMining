Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I consider Pink's a novelty. This would not be a place a person would go regularly, but visit just to say that they've had Pink's Hot Dogs. The line is always long (which can be a good thing and can be a bad thing). . . The food is relatively good. I'm not to sure how many ways a person can make a hot dog taste differently, but Pinks does it. The staff amazingly remembers your order and writes nothing down. . . My only hesitancy is to say stay away from the New York Dog. I had it and the relish topic was not very appealing.
