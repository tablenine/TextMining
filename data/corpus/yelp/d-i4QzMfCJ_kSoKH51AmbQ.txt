yum...no, YUM!  This place is soooo good.  It's one of those places you go for a slam-dunk breakfast each and every time.  I got the Blu Jam Benedict with a side of fresh fruit.  I was so impressed with the eggs.  They were poached to perfection, quite unlike the disaster I had a few weeks ago at Jan's Restaurant (don't go there!)  The black forest ham and bacon were flavorful and delicious.  Put that all on top of a toasted croissant with hollandaise sauce and I was in heaven.  I also tried the stuffed french toast with peaches and bananas, pancakes with strawberries and dark chocolate sauce, and the banana crepes.  Excellent!  It was like having dessert with my breakfast.  This place is by far one of the best breakfast joints around.
