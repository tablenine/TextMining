I can't believe I didn't review this place sooner!. . I love this place for a casual dinner and some beers with friends.  The atmosphere here is always fun, and almost feels like a party on weekends. People watching is fun and the communal tables and crowded space often forces you to interact with your neighbors, but everyone is having fun so it's ok.. . Awesome beer selection, the $5 Franzekaner is SO TASTY.  The rattlesnake sausage is delicious... the fries are great, totally perfect and just like in Belgium!  Try them with the truffle oil!. . Only downside is the bread can get a little dry, so make sure you get the onions and/or peppers on top of your hot dog.. . PS Some of the guys who work here are really cute
