Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Currently, my favorite restaurant in LA!. . Non-pretentious, impeccable and friendly service, amazing food, great Mojito's, and a chocolate souffle that will put you to sleep happier than ever before (make sure to order 25 min early so it can bake). . I have been twice and each time has been special and wonderful. Their pizza's are very unique and they serve various small plate sides, like asparagus with fried egg, corn bits with bacon and portobello fries. . . The restaurant very much looks like it's right out of NYC with a classic decor and high ceilings. Bottega embodies the essence of casual elegant. You will find people dressed in dinner suits and then those dressed in sweats and a t-shirt. What's even better? No one cares. Just go in and enjoy the experience.
