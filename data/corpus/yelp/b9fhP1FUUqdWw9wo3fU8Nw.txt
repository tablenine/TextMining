Restaurant: Kogi
Category: Food Stands
The appeal of the Kogi meal is that it's the perfect blend of sweet, salty, fatty, tangy, and spicy. Every flavor you could possibly want in a food, all wrapped up in a hot steamy burrito, achieving a harmony of multiple flavors that is painfully hard to come by, waiting to be devoured. THAT is the essence of Kogi.
