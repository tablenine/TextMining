Everyone was like OMG this is sooo good... . . Eh, it was good, but not like: OMG you have to try this, you will die if you don't! good.  . . We ordered the fried yucca, fried pork chunks (or whatever #2 is called), grilled halibut, the original pork (#1), and the lamb stew, which is listed under the "beef" part of the menu (eh?).. And a sangria, a mojito and beer.  total was about $20/per person.. . The Yucca was ok.  Tasted sort of like a potato.  . . All of the pork and meat dishes were good.  . . The halibut was eh.  Once again, I must have ordered wrong.. . They serve HELLA greasy bread to start and each meal order comes with white rice, black beans and fried plantains on the side.. . The wait was about 15 minutes and the service was fast.  Overall, it was a good meal but nothing to die for -- but it's a decent local favorite if you're going to be in the area.
