Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
I can see how Cut can get some rave reviews but for me it was just another example of a LAish restaurant with a lot of hype. Whether it was the haughty attitudes of the staff or the fact that every other table had tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of a celebrity, i hated the atmosphere... don't get me wrong it's beatiful but maybe not my cup of tea. I'm all about the quality of food and while ambience plays a factor average food is average food. The food at Cut was above average, nothing remarkable. I had the bone-in NY steak and it was quite good, but I've had better at Ruth Chris and Maestros. The sides were, simply put, not very good at all. For the prices they charge I had expected much more. I wouldn't recommend Cut over so many of the other great steak houses around, unless you want more fluff than substance.
