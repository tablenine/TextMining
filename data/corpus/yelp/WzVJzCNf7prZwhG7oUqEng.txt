Category: Thai
I love crab ragoon... and man, oh man is it good here-. I also really enjoy the satay and pad thai-  always consistant here...  just had it tonight, and although I will pay at the gym for this, man was it delicious.. I started my relationship with duck walk about 4 years ago when i first lived in chicago over in the l.p.  I moved to bucktown two years ago and was sad that I would have to find another thai delivery place.  I tried.  I used other places, but it just wasn't the same.  Then one day I heard that my parents who live in river north got duck walk delivered!  what? i asked???  Can I do this too? (mind you, it was disturbing that my now city dwelling folks use the same take out places, ummm get your own?). . The answer, YES!  THank you duck walk for making the trek!
