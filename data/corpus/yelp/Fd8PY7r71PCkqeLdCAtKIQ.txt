A not-to-be-missed restaurant experience, Wolfgang Puck's special-occasion Flatiron powerhouse still fires on all cylinders.. . Thanks to chef Lee Hefty's heavenly New American food, treat-you-like-royalty service and an upscale modern ambiance.. . Sure, the food and drink only tabs can break the bank, but in return you honestly get everything you pay for.
