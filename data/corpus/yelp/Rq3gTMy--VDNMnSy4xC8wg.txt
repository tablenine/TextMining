For starters, I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could.. . I've only been here twice, both times for brunch.  The first time - which was a long time ago - I had the huevos rancheros and they were tasty, but I don't really remember specifics other than that the portion was HUGE.  This is actually a pet peeve of mine - most any day I'd rather pay a little less and get a smaller portion, both so that I don't shove my face full of food (under my control, I know) and so I don't waste food by leaving it on the plate or bringing it home and relegating it to leftover purgatory.  It's not just the huevos either - on my most recent visit, I watched as the cook made my husband's omelet with 6 eggs!  . . This past weekend I had the tofu scramble (don't remember what it was called - cowpoke, cow eyes, or something "cow") and I have to say I was disappointed.  The menu describes the item as containing green peppers, mushrooms, onions, and cheese.  There was definitely cheese, but I think I only had 1-2 bites with a couple small chunks of the veggies.  It was basically a pile of mushy tofu cubes and melted cheese.  There were no contrasting textures and more crunch (what the green peppers should have provided) would definitely have made the dish better.  I woudn't order it again (if I'm in the mood for a tofu scramble I'll head to Ria's Bluebird Cafe, where the dish comes with lots of broccoli, black beans, and pesto...mmmm).. . Those things said, there's something about this place that's very warm and satisfying.  Maybe it's just sitting at the bar three feet away from the person making your food and being able to watch it all.  I will definitely try it again and just plan to split an entree and a side with a partner the next time.
