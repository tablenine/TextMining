Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks Catherine C got this review on the dot, so go ahead and read her review after I add my two cents so you don't read the same points over and over again.. . The Portobello fries were pretty dang good, and dipping them in the aioli made them even better.. Unfortunately, the Trenne pasta didn't quite do it for me.  Penne-like pasta that's fried a little too much, I didn't enjoy how hard they were considering it was pasta.  The braised rib-eye was tender and it was tasty, but oddly enough it was the kale that stole the show (in my opinion).. . Basically it was a night of celebrating (a friend's birthday) and communicating w/ my friends through sign language due to the noise level in the restaurant.. . 3.5 stars
