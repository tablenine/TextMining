Decent diner food.  The waitresses are all sweet and the service is generally pretty good.  The food is not memorable, but it does the trick late at night (or for a hungover breakfast).  Parking is a bitch, but what else is new in Los Feliz?  . . You're really there for the left-field ambience and whatever company you keep.  All in all, I recommend.
