Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
personally i really like this place.. . the main reason why i come here: CHILI CHEESE FRIES.. . O M F G.  i think i died and went to heaven when i had the first bite.. . when it comes to hotdogs i've only tried the bacon dog -- which was good and my husband is a HUGE HUGE HUGE fan of the ozzie spicy dog.. . the line is usually long, even when it's raining and freezing outside. but it's still good.. . the burgers look good and i've heard lots of raves about them from friends.. . yeah, they're just hot dogs, but what did you expect?  filet mignon?  if you didn't want/expect JUST a hotdog, DON'T COME HERE. anyway, the line is long, but you deal -- just bring  friend or a good magazine.. . anyway, the chili is amazing.. . and the prices are cheap for what you get. yaaaay.
