Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
Oh, Gloria's.  I've been here at least 15 times.  This is the restaurant I've been to more than any restaurant in LA, methinks.  The perfect homey, unpretentious place to come on a low-key night with a date or a group of friends.  The sangria is perfectly sweet and delicious; the chips and salsa fresh and addictive.  . . My concern is that on my last two visits, Gloria's pupusas have not been up to par.  They have been thick and mushy!  These are not the Gloria's pupusas of 2006-2008 (that's how long I've been visiting Gloria's, you see?).  This is an unsettling new trend.. . Carne adobada (my other favorite) is as good as ever.  But what's up with the pupusas?  . . I almost asked Gloria about the pupusas the last time I saw her in the restaurant, but I just bit my tongue and swilled more sangria.  Because, mushy pupusas or not, Gloria's is still my home away from home.. . Salud!
