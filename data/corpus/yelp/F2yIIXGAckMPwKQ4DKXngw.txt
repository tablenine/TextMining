Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
The menu sounds awesome but the tacos are really not that great.  Since $4 per little taco is a big step up in price from hundreds of good taquerias in Chicago the food better be a big step up, too, and its not.  Even if it sounds like it would be when you read the menu.  I even think its probably one of the worst of the more expensive Mexican places around; I'd definitely go to Zocalo over this place for example.  The design of the place kind of sucks too - its really loud even if there aren't that many people there and its got this raw wood look that doesn't feel particularly Mexican and isn't good so I don't know why they used it.
