Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Yea this place really is good. Great place to get a quick 5 minute meal that doesn't involve supporting any of the corporate slag heap burger / taco chains.. I usually get 2 fish tacos and 2 shrimp tacos. The spicy mango salsa and pickles are super fresh and delicious.
