I ordered the tamales. They were pretty decent but needed a little something extra to make it outstanding. Same for the Horchata, nothing original in any way. Definitely missing flavor!. . The best part of my dinner was the salsa!! Their chips were excellent and the salsa was to die for. I had at least 5 servings of it and poured it all over my food to give it flavor. I would come back here just for the salsa.
