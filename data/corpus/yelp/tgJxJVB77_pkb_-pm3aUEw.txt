Before it opened, you could get Bakeshop goodies at the Piedmont Park Farmer's Market on Saturday mornings. I'm a big fan of their cheese danish.. . Stopped into Bakeshop this morning, and it was a feast for the senses: enticing aromas, beautiful pastries and breads, and the happy conversations of satisfied customers and friendly staff.. . We took our order to go: cheese danish, natch, plus a blueberry muffin and a mini ham and cheese quiche. Loved the quiche, with its surprising addition of fresh goat cheese in the center, but was a little disappointed with the muffin. Great top, but the inside seemed a little underdone. . . Nice to have a quality bakery within walking distance of home. Welcome to the neighborhood!
