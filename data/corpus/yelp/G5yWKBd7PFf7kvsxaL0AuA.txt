a 5 not for rolls. a 5 for the atmosphere and the fun times. and definitely a 5 for the oyster shooters!!! love love love the oyster shooters.. i have had some memorable times here, and one that goes down in the books is my first date w/ the "one".:) . i love sitting upstairs in the center by the rail. that to me, is the choice spot for a date night! that is what i always request. every other part of the place is great for groups of friends. wonderful pre-party spot!
