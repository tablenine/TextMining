My friends and I got here around 2:45pm, towards the end of the lunch rush and it was still packed, an EXCELLENT sign for out-of-towners unfamiliar with the best places for local cuisine. We were seated as soon as possible and immediately began plotting our meal.. . There were so many excellent choices for entrees and sides. The sweet tea was delicious and they started us off with a basket of corn bread muffins, delightful. . . One friend got the fried chicken with mac-n-cheese and fried okra, she loved it. I got the veggie plate with turnip greens, yams, broccoli rice and cheese casserole, and mac-n-cheese. Three of the four veggies were out of this world, and the yams were average. My other friend got the baked chicken and it was smothered in a white sauce. The meat was falling off the bone and she exclaimed, "this is the best chicken I have ever had in my life!" We're talking 32 years of chicken tasting experience so she's not completely new to this whole eating thing. . . We talked about Busy Bee for the rest of our vacation and wanted to rearrange our itinerary to go back. It was that good.
