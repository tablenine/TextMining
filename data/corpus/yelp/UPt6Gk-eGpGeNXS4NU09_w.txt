YUM YUM AND YUM!!!. The world famous garlic chicken is the best! The garlic God must have blessed me cuz I've ordered this dish over a dozen times and my chix is always moist and yummers.. One dinner order can feed a family of four. No yolk.. The plantains are my fave.. The avocado salad is just that. Avocados and some onions.. They charge $6.95 split fee which I find very odd. . Since their garlic chix dinner is like 10 bucks, forgo the split fee and have garlic breath for four days.
