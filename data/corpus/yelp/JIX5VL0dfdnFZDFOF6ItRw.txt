This place is cute and unique. I love the idea of garlic in everything cause I do indeed love garlic. The neon ravioli was very good, but I thought the chicken was pretty disappointing and on the dry side. The garlic bread was pretty yummy. I sooner want to give it a 3.5, but half stars not allowed!
