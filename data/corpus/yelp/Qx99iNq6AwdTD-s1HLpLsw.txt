First time trying Indian, it was exactly how I thought it would be.. . Chicken 65 - GREAT! I dont know what the chicken was coated in, but it had a nice flavor, coupled with two dipping sauces.. . Mixed Vegetable Khorma - Not too spicy, even a little on the sweet side. . . Mutton - Spicy, nice even flavor. . . I recommend getting naan or rice to help sop everything up (most everything is cooked with heavy cream and/or butter so there is a lot of extra grease). . Overall though, not bad for the price.
