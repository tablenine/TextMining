Canter's. You surely can't meet a Jew from Los Angeles that has not dined at Canter's (or at the very least scarfed down chunks of Canter's challah or a few of Canter's cookies). . . Until this weekend, my mom had not tried Canter's and feeling like the last Jew within 50 miles to not have, she made me take her into the orange-tabled cafeteria oozing with old people. . . Yes, old people. Everything about Canter's says OLD. . . Anyway, I ordered the matzah ball soup to wrap myself up in the warm, strong grip of Jewish cooking. Solid work. My ancestors would agree, I'm sure. The $13 Rueben I split with Mommy was okay. The pastrami could have been juicier for that scorching price, to be honest. Nicely toasted rye bread and sauerkraut to boot. I love the complimentary pickles. However, you can't live on pickles alone, friend. . . Where Canter's does score points with me is:. 1. Their bakery. 2. Their service. . The challah is fresh like the Prince of Bel Air, the black and white cookies with ganache make me drool, and I'm looking forward to trying the cheesecake Katrina M. raves about. . . Everyone at Canter's is cheery and helpful. While Canter's has aged to the point of needing a walker, it has kept its personal charm. If you enjoy historic locations, visit Canter's at least once. 60 years, baby. . . For new school Jewish deli: see Brent's in Northridge.
