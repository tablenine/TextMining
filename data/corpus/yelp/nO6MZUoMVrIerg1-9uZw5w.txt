don't know what the hype is all about? i do love the no corkage fee (we brought Â an '05 Los Rocas, so it paired very well), but the food.. well, it's not bad, but it's not good. . sorry, but i don't plan on returning. the service was ok, our waitress left (i think) no one told us, but then she was no where to be found and a guy brought us a check... water refills had to be chased down. The one thing i recommend is that we came late (10:30) and it was nice b/c it looks like they really pack it in too tight for regular hours (the tables were only 6 inches apart!)
