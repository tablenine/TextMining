Bite is pretty solid. It has something for everyone. i went here for lunch with my mother. we REALLY wanted to try the polish grill across the street, but alas, it was closed.. . i had spicy eggs and my mom had pancakes. super good. i also like that you can buy libations from the empty bottle. that's super cute.. . they have bad ventilation, so you'll probably end up smelling like the kitchen, but then you can relive your meal all day long!!
