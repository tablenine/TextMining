Restaurant: Highland Tap
Category: Steakhouses
You do get a bit of a secret speakeasy buzz when you descend the flight of stairs to the basement building, even though this is on the corner of one of the busiest districts in the city - Virginia and N. Highland.  . . The cavernous restaurant and bar for me evokes a bit of a Medieval Times - 'dungeon but in a cool way' vibe.  This is a place for a classic steak dinner with few surprises. It's solidly good and will soothe any red meat urge. . . As for the bar area, it's a popular place, and yes, you'll be waiting for a while at the bar.  As Blake B mentions, its definitely gonna be hard to find a tattoo'd up pierced East Atlanta dweller amongst the polo shirts and shiny tank top wearing crowd.
