not that i dont like eating sushi (who doesnt) but i was completely horrified when my friend ordered a HUGE plate of everything raw. thought to myself, "why dont you just take a dive in the pacific, FREE all you can eat raw everything.  you disgust me!!!" but of course i didnt say that out loud.  some things are better kept unsaid but i was still horrified.  the evil eye look.. . im glad i ordered UNraw items and you know what, i liked it.  dont have to eat raw fish to call it sushi.  japanese food comes in all shapes and sizes.  . . i liked my soup, tofu, grilled fish and bento.  sticking to it.  of course i didnt eat all that that day because we went for lunch but i loved my bento set.  . . even though my friends "raw plate" was $15 which is a pretty cheap steal.  could see why its one of the popular items at sushi gen (during lunchtime).  i would never touch it though *evil eye*
