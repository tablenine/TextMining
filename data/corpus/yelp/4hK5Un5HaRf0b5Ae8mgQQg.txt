Restaurant: Urban Belly

I really wish urban belly was closer to me, because I would probably eat here way more often.. . My experiences here have all been great - the rice dishes, the noodle dishes - all fantastic. I love the Lamb and brandy dumplings - most definitely, so much so I crave them.... . Prices are okay - I don't think its a great big bargain - but I don't think you are getting ripped off either... . Also, don't do carry out your first time - I've learned (because this is what i did) you miss a ton of the extras via carryout.. . I'm definitely a fan of the belly
