Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This Little Tokyo ramen joint has a very simple menu where you choose the type of broth (shio, shoyu or miso), the level of spiciness (1-7) and add toppings.. . I got the shio (salt), level 5 (which was not to spicy), and added in pork, corn, onions and egg.  The waiter kinda gave me a funny look when I ordered the toppings, so I must have committed some sort of Japanse cultural faux pax where the combination I got was really whack or I ordered way too much.. . Anwyays, the verdict:  Ok noodles and broth.  But AWESOME PORK!  I'll say it again, AWESOME PORK!  This place is worth going back to just for the pork (or chashu), which is extremely tender and melts in your mouth.  . . Next time, I'll probably just order a big bowl of it.
