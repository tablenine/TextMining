Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Always heard good things about this steakhouse so decided to give it a try.  By far this is THE best steakhouse in LA!  Portions are very generous and the steak is cooked to perfection that just keeps your palates happy and busy!  Next time my boyfriend and I are planning to order one porter house cut and try their famous lobster mashed potato which is enough to feed 4 people.  When we're craving steak, this will be our #1 restaurant for steaks!  Very friendly and outstanding service and a wonderful bartender who made our night quite memorable.  STRONGLY recommended to try at least once!
