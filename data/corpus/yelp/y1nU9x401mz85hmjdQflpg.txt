I love me some bloody Marys with my breakfast.  This is the place to be, although it looks like they've pared down their bloody mary selection to three.  Most recently I ordered the green chili and jalepeno bloody mary, which I hoped would be an extra-spicy bloody mary.  Instead, I got a glass of alcoholic salsa verde.  Seriously, I bet there was not a single ounce of tomato juice in my glass.  My girl got the same thing and asked for some tomato juice which transformed it into a delicious, albeit brown, concoction.  . . Now that I have that out of the way, this place has top-notch breakfast food.  Everything has been delicious.  I ordered the spiced English eggs, which was a special today, and it rocked my nuts off.  The chilaquiles, fritata,  and breakfast burrito and everything else have always been top notch.  I will be coming here often just to make my way through the menu.. . Additionally, I've never been here for dinner, but I bet it is great because it has a cool neighborhood-ie atmosphere.  I don't live nearby, exactly, but whenever I'm in my car I make this my destination.
