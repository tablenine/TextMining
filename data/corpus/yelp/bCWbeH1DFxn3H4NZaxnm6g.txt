Bottega Louie Bottega Louie Bottega Louie! If I say that 3 times and click my heels, will I magically be taken back? yesterday was my first visit (I know shame on me for not having been sooner) and needless to say the reviews certainly steered me in the right direction. I was impressed. I'll rate the food a hearty 4 but the impeccable service I received from their amicable waiters is what bumped this goldmine into a 5 star quality dining experience for moi. . . I tried the Penne Gamber, excellent. I stole some of my friends Trenne, excellent. we even got hooked up with some free pizza since we were first timers, EGG-CELLENT. now that's what I'm talking about Bottega Louie! you sure knew how to take make a gal smile. everything about the place was aesthetically pleasing. the food, the decor, and even the waiters. heck I'd be back just to have that nice handsome fellow with the good posture refill my water 5 times. thank you Bottega Louie for making my st. patty's dinner memorable. I WILL be back sooner than later.
