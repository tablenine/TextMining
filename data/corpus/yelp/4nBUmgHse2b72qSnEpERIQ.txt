OMG!!  I love this place!   Tried it for the first time today and ordered turkey and dressing, mac n cheese (YUM!!), and green beans to go. . . The to-go service was quick and efficient.  When I got home, my food was still piping hot and the cornbread muffins practically melted in my mouth.  I just hate I didn't try the lemonade/sweet tea ( I heard it was really good) . . . maybe next time.  . . Hopefully I will be able to eat-in next time, I was in a rush to get home after getting my nails done next door at The Lenox Nail Salon (i will have to review them next!). . . (Man, I hope my trainer doesn't see this review!). . Definitely check this place out, It's great for a quick lunch spot with traditional southern style cuisine.
