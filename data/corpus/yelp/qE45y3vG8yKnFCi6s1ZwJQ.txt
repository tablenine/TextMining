Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Great Place to eat. . . Huge portions, huge delicious pancakes, great coffee with a french press, large and in charge omelettes. . . Service was attentive and very courteous, even though the server was definitely in the weeds because the place was incredibly busy. . . Only negative, the wait to get into the restaurant, however, the food and service made it all worth it.
