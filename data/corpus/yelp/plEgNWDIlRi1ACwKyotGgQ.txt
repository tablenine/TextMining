they have some cool fusion type sandwiches if that is what you are looking for. however, while they are good, no joking aside, they are overpriced. I wasn't at all unhappy with anything at this spot in general though. and I will give them credit for some crispy, garlicky, and yummy Tostones. . . I suppose the only real downside are the cool kids that frequent this joint, and man there were a ton when I was there both times. What is it about all these CK's in this city? I swear I saw at least 2 kids reading a copy of Catcher in the Rye, and another drawing little sticks onto his etch-a- sketch. Who do these fools think they are kidding? And why did most of the conversations have to start out with "like basically...". . ugh............why?????????
