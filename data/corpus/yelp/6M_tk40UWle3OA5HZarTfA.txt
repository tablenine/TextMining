i've dropped by here a few times thus far and i like it.. . it's a piranesian white and gold space in downtown LA. you almost don't think you're in LA when you see it...until you catch the $7.50 valet around the corner. (park in the structure around the corner and across the street). . the good news is that it is far less expensive than it looks, and the clientele is pure downtown urbanewbie: good looking young professionals that are in a good mood because they walked the mile from their lofts without being mugged, acosted or breathed on offensively.. . BL is manned by more of a battalion than a staff, almost to a fault. they greet and seat you quickly.. . the pizza was good, chopped salad failed at the iceberg lettuce, chicken parmesan was good, clams oreganato were confusing, as was asparagus with egg. but the beer on tap was nice.. . i don't think it's too much of a stretch to say that BL is emblematic of downtown LA in general right now: grand, a little contrived and eager to be loved but approachable and hard to resist.
