I'm a fan. They are cheap comfort food, plain and simple. They are open late, consistently decent, and there are plenty of places to sit and eat inside and out. . . They are NOT great food. They are great because it is *simple*, not over-salted, and they have all the standbys. I'm so glad they are around.
