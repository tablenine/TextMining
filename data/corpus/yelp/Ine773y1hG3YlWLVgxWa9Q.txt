Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
Veggie Grill is like a mythical unicorn because it's both magical and unbelievable. Long story short, I brought my carnivorous coworkers here last week. These guys are never about veggies and always meat, meat, meat. Little did they know that non-meat food can be this great.. . Fried chick wings that somewhat resembles McD's chicken nuggets, but only better? Portabello burger that is tastier and heartier than your local In-N-Out's 2x2? Impossible? No, possible but magical. How about the carne asada that feels like meat, taste like meat and fill you up like meat? . . Wanna convert your carnivorous friends to become omnivores? This is the place to bring because them meat eating coworkers can't wait to go back already. Who says that you have to be a vegetarian to want to have vegetarian food?
