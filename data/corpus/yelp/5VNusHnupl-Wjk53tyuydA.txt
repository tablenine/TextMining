Second joint from Chef Bill Kim and I am a fan!  Never had Korean-Latin American fusion before, but this was really good.   Sleek, edgy, and slightly grundgy decor tries to camouflage this new spot literally under the subway.  Came on a weekday night and they didn't have the belly dog, but here's what we had:. . Asian meat balls with rice noodles and mint:  warm and surprisingly sweet, and a little spicy.  Yum.. Somen noodles with olive oil poached shrimp and tortilla chips:  a cold salad, small on the portion size, but similarly well balanced sweet/savory/spicy.. Tostones with chimichurri sauce:  Think flattened unsweet plantains, deep fried.  Ok but I would try the roasted squash with maple syrup and pho spices side instead.. . Didn't get to the ice cream but would have tried the bacon choco chip or mint brownie - kudos to chef kim for creativity!
