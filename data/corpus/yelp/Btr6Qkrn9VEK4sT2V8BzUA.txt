Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I've eaten at Palms for quite some time now and I would say it is one of the best Thai restaurants in LA next to Taste of Bangkok in Pasadena. . . The food is very authentic and if you can't handle spice or think you can, you better beware. Once little green chili and it's over. . . Our favorite thing to order here is the deep fried trout, BBQ beef, beef jerky, pad Thai, duck curry and you can't forget the sticky rice. . . The service is okay and they could be friendlier but the food is great. I did notice that once they moved to their larger location, the portions became smaller and the prices went up. . . The live entertainment is cool if you want to wait for a long time for a table on Friday or Saturday night but I would recommend going for lunch on the weekend instead of dinner. You can always order from the dinner menu and have the same experience without all the noise in the evening.. . I'm always curious as to why the table by the fish tank always has a reserved sign on it because every time I go there the table remains empty. Oh well, good place to go.
