Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
One of our favorite Thai restaurants.. . PROS:. - Great food!. - Extensive menu! We've been here many times, but have hardly scratched the surface.. - Reasonably priced.. - Fast and attentive service. Really impressive.. - Kid friendly.. . CONS:. - Parking. $5 for valet is a robbery.. - Noisy people. And where isn't? Can't do much about this. . - Always crowded. Come early for dinner. Like 6pm.. - Sometimes having to share a long table with other customers. - Karen Carpenter.... . Elvis is in the house, guys. This may be a PRO or CON depending on your mood, but the dude does add character to the restaurant. One thing I don't like is that they tend to seat the customers close to the stage whenever Elvis sings. If they sit you on one of the long tables, you're going to be sitting next to a stranger. If you want to dine with a bit of privacy, ask to be seated away from the stage.. . Another thing to remember; when you ask for "hot/spicy", they really mean it. The "medium" here is "hot" for other restaurants.
