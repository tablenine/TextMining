I have heard of this place for years and finally got to go.  I can describe Versailles as lemony-garlicky-deliciousness with pork falling off of the bone soft, shredded awesomeness as a side. Pillowy and sweet plantains accompany your garlicky-lemony-awesome falling off of the bone pork.  If you like beans (my stomach detests them, so I can't vouch for beans) their black bean sauce smells smokey to go over the tender rice.  I am giving this a 5 because Versailles is NOT pretentious, is NOT a scene and is very comfortable and has great food with decor being second to the food.  You gotta try it.  I know this is their 1,000th review, or so but I am sending high accolades to this Cuban star of delish.
