i stopped here not too long after it opened.  i was quite used to seeing the old burger joint that used to attract the vintage hot rods and muscle cars every weekend.   but i enjoy good bbq a bit more than the aesthetics of a 49 Willy.  bbq=instant gratification.. . considering this, minus a star for a disappointing sauce!  when you're all about bbq, and you're nothing more than bbq, you need to positively differentiate your sauce from say, something like KETCHUP.  because basically, that's what it tasted like, peppered ketchup.  ok, maybe a half star better than ketchup, but not much.  . . the fries were memorable, but the chicken was lacking in meat.  they need to breed those birds with more hormones - or.. uh, just get bigger chicken. . . not a place i would oppose, but probably wouldnt recommend either.
