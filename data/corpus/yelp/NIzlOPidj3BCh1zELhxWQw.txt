i love this place, i've been there for the past 8 years, whenever i feel sad or happy, i'd go there alone just for lunch, it's a place where i can really sit down and enjoy my food, i love their shrimp in blanket, and pad thai with shrimp, veg tom yum soup, and baby egg rolls, these are what i ususlly ordered every time. service is ok, but their food is better than these thai places around my house in downtown.
