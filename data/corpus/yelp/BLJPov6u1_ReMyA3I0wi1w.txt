All I've got to say is ME WANT MORE! Last time was a year ago but it is still a favorite for me. We come for the 1/2 lb peel n shrimp for $17 bucks. We are both used to peeling our own shrimps at home so to save 2 bucks, we opted to peel it ourselves. When it came out, we were both drooling! Its just large shrimps with olive oil, parsley, and sea salt but its SIMPLY delicious. And I enjoyed peeling it because then I don't devour all 8 pcs in one bite. My friend said she went with another friend and they got the shrimps peeled but it wasn't the same. *shrugs* never mess with a good thing. As you have already heard, the pub burger is out of this world. It's stacked high and I have to use a knife to cut it in half and then attempt to shove it in my mouth. I'm already salivating just thinking about it. FRIES FRIES FRIES.. . Seasonal drinks are the best. Â They are a little pricey, around $12-$15 bucks for a pretty little glass but its still darn good! I go when berries are in season because the strawberry drink they have is unbelievable. I remember my friend got the blueberry one and it looked like water with one blueberry at the bottom. Rubbing alcohol again? . . I haven't sat outside in the patio yet since we usually go around 10pm and I like the coziness of the indoors.....but it looks nice, I'm gonna try it next time.
