Restaurant: Medici On 57th
Category: Bakeries
Medici restaurant: AMAZING spinach goat cheese pizza, great little house salad with mustard (or pesto) vinaigrette. The service can be surly-- once I had to flag down a waitress to ask for a water refill.  She got her revenge by bringing me back a glass of HOT tap water. Mmm... . . The Medici bakery next door has incredible chocolate croissants (apple croissants also super tasty) and decent coffee.  Similarly disaffected waitstaff who avoid eye contact, then bark at you for your order.  Snag a window seat if you can get one (there are only four little tables, sometimes people share), or take your treats across the street and make a picnic in the park there.  Med Bakery does get a bonus point for allowing desperate parents and nannies from the nearby playground bring their kids in to use the bathroom there. Not everyone is down with using the "pee pee tree" at the park, okay?. . One time at the med bakery I went to pour some sugar into my latte, and someone had loosened to cap on the sugar jar-- a pound of sugar (and the cap!) fell right into my latte, splashing it everywhere.  To the servers' credit, they swooped right in to clean up the mess and handed me a new latte a minute later.  That was nice of them.
