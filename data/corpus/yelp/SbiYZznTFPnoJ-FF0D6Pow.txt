Peppers, you call yo self "spicy"??  Uh-uh baby...not unless you're smothered over some real spicy sausage, oh yeah...and your friends, caramelized onions can join in too for good measure.. . I don't mess with them ketchups either....no, no...I get creamy blue cheese or pesto sauces with my salty, fried potato sticks.. . And there's only one gal who can wash it all down...she be Duchesse.
