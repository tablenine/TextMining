Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I have been waiting for a year to go back to Johnnies and am happy to say that those dirty idiots who were cooking and stuffing food in their mouth at the same time weren't there anymore!   I could have sworn that was Johnnie's black Lexus was parked in the back!.  Pastrami at Johnnies is good again - Life is good again.. . This is another one of my old haunts as I love pastrami. This is a different type than Langers (scary good) as the pastrami here is sliced thin, simmered in spices, and served on a grilled french dipped roll.  It's the best of it's type and way way way better than the Hat.  . . If you like the pastrami at your local burger joint then you need to at least give Johnnies a try.  I'm dead serious about this one.  The pastrami here is well spiced and flavorful.  It has just the right amount of fat so that it tastes great and is worth every increase in your cholesterol count.  A key difference is that the pastrami is sliced very thin which makes the meat very tender.  It's a big sandwich full of meat (pics) and tastes as delicious as it looks.  The fries are always crispy hot cooked to order so it's good share one with a friend.. . Like I said, life is good - My cholesterol is going to go up, and Johnnies is back on the top of my pastrami list!
