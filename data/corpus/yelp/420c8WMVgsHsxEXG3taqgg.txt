i was drawn to this place because of a los angeles mag review and was interrested in the syphon brew, which is an old method/version of brewing coffee that looks like a science project. you pick your coffee and they brew it at your table. fun for your first time and to impress friends. Very classy atmosphere, great staff, AWESOME coffee and great loungy type decor, modern. The Facil sandwich is also tasty and inventive. I loved the experience.......Basically ........... all smiles for me!
