I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  There seems to always be a crowd during weekend lunchtime.  I guess this is the place to be for weekend brunch.  We didn't have to wait too long before they seated us.  When I came for dinner, however, the place was a ghost town.  The candles set a romantic mood, but I didn't like how cold it got in that outdoor patio area.
