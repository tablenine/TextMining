Parking is freaking ridiculous, such a small lot! Park on the streets, you'll have better luck but you might have to park far down because that's what happens when I come here, especially at night. Order take out if you have a large party because the wait is going to be over 2 hours.. Other than that, come early even if you're not hungry because when you wait for a long time, that hunger will come to you. By then, your table will be ready &amp; tada! =). . My favorite thing to order here: shrimps with the whole shabang which is $8.99 per lb. Fried catfish with cajun fries $8.99 is also good, gotta love their cajun fries too! I've also tried their gumbo $5.99 &amp; it's okay, not the best, but taste pretty good over rice. Haven't tried their oysters yet but they look pretty good, hopefully next time!
