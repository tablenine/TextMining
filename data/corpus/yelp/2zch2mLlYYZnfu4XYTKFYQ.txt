Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
Urban Belly was an interesting experience that's for sure.  You give your name and then you wait outside until they call you in.  Then you order and are seated at a communal table.  This is a totally different experience and at first I was a little miffed by the whole thing.  Ultimately it was a great experience as we met a great couple from New York who were sitting next to us at the table.  . . The food is great and simple, very asian fusion with a focus on Korean.  I found the noodles (the Asian Egg Noodles among others) to be well done.  The dumplings were also delicious and very fresh tasting.  I found everything had a great harmony within each dish.  We did not have any of the rice dishes, but they looked delicious.. . Urban Belly is BYOB, which is great, however take your own corkscrew as the waitstaff is generally MIA, aside from topping off my glass of water.  We ended up grabbing our own chopsticks and glasses from a nearby table.. . The experience was interesting and I look forward to going back!
