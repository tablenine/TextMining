i don't know... this place is way overhyped for what it is. i've tried it twice during lunch time on a weekday and both times i was able to get a seat almost immediately. i don't doubt that this place gets very crowded -- there's what, 15-20 seats? you're basically sitting in a small shack with a bar around the grill. the burger was good, but i don't know about it being the best ever. certainly not deserving of all the praise it gets... . . the old man that took my order was a little rude. there isn't a big menu, but still i felt rushed. i'd never been there before and needed a minute to figure out what the best course of action was. this was lunch, afterall... if i make a mistake in what i order, then i'm crapping at work all day and hungry until i get home at 6. when i wanted to know what a "mesquite burger" was, i thought it would've been clear that i wanted to know what the toppings were (bbq sauce? onion rings?). instead, the response i got was "its a burger with mesquite". and when i asked if it came with tomato (i hate tomato), he glared at me like he was about to jump over the counter to kick my ass. he couldn't have kicked my ass though -- he's old and i'm a bad ass. . . eh. good pie, though.
