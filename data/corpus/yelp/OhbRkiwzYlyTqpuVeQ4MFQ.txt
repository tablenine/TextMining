I went here on a Saturday around 6:30pm for dinner with a high school friend who I haven't seen in a long time. She picked the place on a recommendation and I read all the other Yelp reviews so I kind of built up a little anticipation for the place because I really enjoy GOOD Hainan Chicken.. . Well, it took them 30 minutes to seat two people. I guess that isn't terrible on a busy day.. . We both ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice (opting out of the extra dark meat, based on some previous Yelp I read) and ordering the ice tea.. . I was impressed by the sheer speed, they popped out the dishes within like 10-15 minutes. Refills could have been a little more prompt, which is my only complaint but the service was pretty good. They even refilled our cups and gave us to-go lids which was nice.. . The actual Hainan Chicken was really good - but the portions were tiny! I had maybe like 7 slivers of chicken on my plate and a maybe the equivalent to an ice cream scoup and a half of rice. Does this stuff get you guys full? I can go to L&amp;L or some other Hawaiian BBQ place drop $7 and drift into a deep food coma from the sheer food.... . The portions were the main part that wasn't cutting it for me. I'd give it 4 stars if they gave me more. I don't think this place is deserving of 5 stars. In reality this place is between 3.5 and 4 stars.. . I did though, like the liquid sweetener for the tea! It was a good place to sit down, eat, and reminisce with my friend.. . Perhaps I came on an off-day, I wish they gave me more food. I kind of left Savoy a little bit hungry still =(
