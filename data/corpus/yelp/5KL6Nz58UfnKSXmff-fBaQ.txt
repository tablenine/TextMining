5 stars for awesome prices and good tasting foods!!!. . My date and I ordered a ton of food here.  . . 4 potato balls. 1 cheese roll. 1 cupcake. 1 cuban sandwich. 1 turkey croissant sandwich. 1 plantain chips. 1 drink. . At first when you get there...the place can feel borderline stressful and cafeteria like.  Two long lines and crowded seating area.  I wanted to give them one less star for the long lines and uncomfortable cafeteria feel, but I realized they have to do it that way to maximize efficiency.  It's hard to imagine anything more efficient.  With that said, the food here taste great for the prices you pay.  For under 10 bucks per person, we were more than full and satisfied.
