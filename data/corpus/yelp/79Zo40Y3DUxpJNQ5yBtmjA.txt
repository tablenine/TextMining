4.53 stars. i think this was good practice for thanksgiving! lawd a mercy i am still full! it's only fitting that we came here to celebrate the oldest unlucky kid's birthday. just like i waddled into saint margaret's hospital very pregnant, all those years ago, after eating here i waddled out.. here's the not so skinny: . service? adorable.. tasting menu?. exceedingly tasty, the tastiest of the tasties were, in particular, the lotus root, and the sushi bombs!. tastier- pork belly and steak. tasty but not as wowing: the fried chicken, perhaps because the sushi bombs are a hard act to follow, and the risotto thingys.. the mango mojitos? fabulosos!. the ambiente was laid back and simpatico, we were able to dawdle and linger.. they kindly plated my lovely mother-in-law's* famous chocolate cake,and last but not least,. we may even appear on japanese television!. . groan, moan groan oh the pain, oh the waddling!. . *she really is lovely!
