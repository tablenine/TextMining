Restaurant: Fritti
Category: Italian
Fritti has the kind of high minded pizza that a place like Piebar attempts to reproduce, but without the overly pretentious atmosphere. It's definitely fancier than a mom and pop pizza joint, but it's not overbearing and snooty.. . Definitely sit on the patio if you can get a seat there. The seating indoors is arranged a little too close to the open kitchen, so the sounds and smells can overwhelm your meal. Outdoors, you get a little more room and much better atmosphere.. . I can't recall ordering anything other than the pizza on multiple trips to Fritti. It's not that the other entrees are bad, it's just that it's going to take me a long time to work my way through the pizza options that I want to try first. There are so many different pizzas with great Italian cured meats, mushrooms, cheeses...I can't be bothered with the salads or the antipasti. Besides, I'd go next door to Sotto Sotto if I wanted something other than pizza.
