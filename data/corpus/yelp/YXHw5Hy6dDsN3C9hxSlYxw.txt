Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
SO I wasn't "blown away" by this place.  It is off the corner of Briarcliff and LaVista rd.  It should be no surprise I ordered Hawaiian BBQ Chicken (and the name of the place is Waikikie ... Hawaiian BBQ... go figure).. . I WAS GOOD, don't get me wrong.  I will go back to this place.  I am not sure what I was expecting (more fresh fruit, more of a true Hawaiian atmosphere... not sure).  The  chicken was great, salad a little bland for a Hawaiian meal.  The service was great and the people nice.  The place is very clean for a small little restaurant.  If you are in the area, it is worth it to stop in and grab a bite to eat.
