::Yelp Certified::. Was greeted by those lovely "People on Yelp Love Us" Stickers!. . Ordered the pupusas: . loroco and frijoles y queso (enjoyed the loroco). . Ordered the tamales salvadorenos: . elote (my favorite), chicken (i like green olives in my tamales). definitely different than Mexican tamales....I'm a little torn now.. . Can't wait to try other items on the menu.  Came with a Mexican and an El Salvadorian (coincidence).  Both mentioned they didn't like mixing the two.  Both mentioned they didn't think either was authentic.  I liked it.  . . "Can't we all just get along..."
