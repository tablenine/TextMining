Restaurant: Wasabi
Category: Sushi Bars
This is the first review that I will begin by praising the bathroom.  Wasabi's bathroom walls are made of chalkboard with giant pieces of colored chalk waiting for you to write everything from the perverse to the poetic.  As serial writers, you Yelpers can have a field day with this endorsement of graffiti.. . The Sushi is great.  It is freshly made and uses high quality fish with inventive serving combinations.  Nan (the owner) is super-welcoming with the added benefit that Wasabi is located in the heart of Castleberry Hill.  No Mas's amazing decorating showroom (and coffee bar) is right next door and there are about 10 art galleries within a couple blocks.  This is a great date spot.. . My only complaint is the size and comfort of the seating (little girl tea party tables and chairs).  Granted, I am 6'8" and feel like Godzilla when I sit down at a table.  All of you normal-sized people can enjoy you dainty eating without worry.
