As an official West Town old-timer, I fondly remember the original Wishbone on Grand.  Back in the early 90's, the hipster community was so small that I would constantly recognize other customers from seeing them elsewhere. You know..."that's the guy who bikes up Damen smoking a pipe!"  That kind of recognize. This lovely little place shares a lot of the spirit, as well as culinary influences, of the original neighborhood Wishbone.  The sides are all southern comfort food: macaroni and cheese, collards, and fried okra, among others.  Despite the   vintage-y hen 'n' rooster decor, I got the pulled pork sandwich.  It was very good, and the meat, which was only slightly shredded but very tender, was barely moistened with barbecue sauce.  More sauce was added on top for flavoring.  It was a very careful preparation of a mundane sandwich, and it made it easier to eat without compromising flavor.  My goodness. I didn't think I was capable of raphsodizing so about pulled pork.  Well, it won't change your life, but it's a damn good sandwich.  The previous thumbs up about the mac and cheese are right on, as well.
