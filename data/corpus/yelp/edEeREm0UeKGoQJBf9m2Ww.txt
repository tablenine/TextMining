Restaurant: Pasta Da Pulcinella
Category: Italian
we've been going to Pasta Da Pulinella since the 90's, it used to be a few blocks away on Ptree in a little hole in the wall. They took my favorite item off the menu (mint ravioli) so I stopped going because it was the only thing that made the $ 10 parking fee worth it to me.. . They do make an awesome caesar salade though &amp; the atmosphere is comfortable &amp; relaxing (but paying $ 10 for parking... come on !).. . it's a good place but like many places it has stop striving for excellence and has become a little stale in my opinion.
