I don't think I can say enough good things about this place. Â Ambiance is great, service is fantastic in a non-fake kind of way (you get the sense that they genuinely care about your dining experience) and of course the food is yummy.. . Also, our waiter was wearing an apron with a charming amount of food stains and various cooking powders--just enough so you know he's actually doing something in the kitchen, but not so much that you want to throw his clothes in the wash.
