I've been here a couple of times in my life and never had the time to review it so I will do it now.  With that in mind, know that my post is dated in so much as I have not been there in about 2 years.  However, I do have some fond memories and not so fond memories.  I loved eating the roasted garlic appetizer.  Their garlic ice cream was great also.  The only bad thing that I can say is that their portions for rabbit was quite small and I basically had to do two orders to get full.
