Oh my word...meat and meat and meat and....yeah more meat.  This places is AWESOME.  They have a great cold selection on the "salad bar" and the quality and flavor of the grilled meat is outstanding.  I went here with a group of about 10 or 12 people, and the service was fantastic.  Our server was very attentive and overheard me tell my boyfriend to get me a Pelligrino while I ran to the restroom.  When I got back, he admitted that he had forgotten.  When all of the drinks arrived, so did my water!  I was very happy and very impressed.  . . When we were leaving I noticed that my pants had some sticky stuff on them and I looked under my chair and some inconsiderate jerk had stuck gum to the chair I was sitting in.  The manager was very apologetic, even though I really wasn't too mad...I was just annoyed, and they gave me money to have my pants dry cleaned.  So nice!. . I would recommend coming here if you have a little extra $$$ because this place is pretty pricey.
