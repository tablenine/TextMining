Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
On advice from friends and fellow Yelpers on the hot dog thread, I brought my NYC family to Wiener's Circle for their first taste of a true Chicago hot dog.  I'm a New Yorker at heart, so I personally find the Chicago dog disgusting.  I'll take my dog with ketchup and relish..f' you.  My husband refers to Chicago style as "dragged through the garden."  There is just too much crap on those things. . . 3 hot dogs, a charred polish, drinks, and 2 orders of fries (one with cheese) ran about $27.  . . If you're looking for ambiance, you won't find it here.  Stupidly, I did not read the reviews beforehand.  I was not at all prepared for the foul mouths.  I am so glad that I did not get a show when I asked if they served shakes.  If you have a thin skin..do not go here.  The flinging of insults, constant cackling, etc will break you.. . My NYC family thought that the dyed green relish was gross, the overflowing peppers and pickles a little too messy, and that the cheese whiz on the fries was disgusting.  They never had a polish and thought that it tasted much better.  They understood why I opted for that instead.. . About 20 minutes after eating, while in my car..both my relatives fell dead asleep.  I woke them to drop them off at Millennium Park, and while I was waiting for them to take their pictures of the Bean, I also fell asleep.  There must have been tryptophan in those dogs.
