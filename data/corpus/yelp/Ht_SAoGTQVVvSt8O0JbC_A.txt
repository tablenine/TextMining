This place wins me over every time I come back.  The night was perfect.  Warm enough to sit outside with tshirts on.. . I got my usual, hainan chicken with dark meat and all rice.  Can someone tell me why this place charges an extra $2.00 for dark meat?!  I thought it was more expensive to get white meat.  Anyways, they ran out of their infamous flavored rice.  When you heard the waitress breaking the news to everyone, you'd hear, "AWWWW!!" Yes, their rice is really that good.. . Their baked halibut with white sauce is pretty good.  This isn't for someone that doesn't like cheese.  I kept picking at my friend's dish, eating up her mushrooms.  . . Unlimited refills for their lemon iced tea.  They'll even refill your cup and give you a lid so you can take it to go.  . . Their staff has always been super friendly.  I always have such a good experience when I come here.
