HMM... This is good fried chicken? After all the hype you hear about this place, I had to go and find out what the whole chicken and waffles thing was about.  So I drive down Pico from Beverly Hills to... NOT Beverly Hills and find the Pico location complete with a dude outside who had an S Curl - seriously dude, it '07, let that look die.  I guess from all I heard about the place, I was expecting to see more than what looked to me like an upgraded Waffle House.  . . I ordered the famous chicken and waffles.  As is the case whenever I order chicken, I ordered thighs, because that's the only part of the chicken that people can never dry out, right? Or so I thought until I got my two pieces of dry thighs. Maybe I lived in Atlanta too long, because I have higher standards for fried chicken. But the waffles made up for the dry chicken.  Luckily though, I also ordered the Mac and Cheese and hence the 3 stars in this review - yummy, seasoned goodness.  I also tried the sweet potatoes pie - filling was great, but the crust was really soggy.. . Should you go? Sure.  Find out   what all the hype is about .  Would I go back?  Sure... for some of that mac and cheese.
