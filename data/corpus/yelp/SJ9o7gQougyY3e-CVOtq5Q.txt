So...I like to give everyone a fair shot so I went back for breakfast and had pretty decent service. My dishes were clean, my eggs were fresh, and the pancakes were great (but they were good last time). I think the trick might be the TIME; the last time I reviewed the place, I had been there for breakfast at about 8a.m. on a Saturday, but when I go in at, say, 11:00a.m. on a Sunday (when it's the most crowded), I get much better service. I know it doesn't make sense, but at least I know what works now.
