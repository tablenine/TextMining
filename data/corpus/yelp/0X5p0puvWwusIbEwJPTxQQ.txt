Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
toro sushi is completely fantastic.  super friendly service, byob policy, affordable prices, DELISH rolls and sashimi.  the sushi chef definitely knows what he's doing and now the entire city know it, hence the 2 hour wait on a friday night!. . i second amanda s.'s request for a 2nd location...but only if the incredibly friendly, kind chef comes with!
