Excellent burger and excellent beers but having to find your own seats and the crowd is a definite downside.  It's no fun going out there with your friends and having to hover around tables so you can sit down.  But if you really want a good burger and beer this is a great place to go.  I would give it a 4 or 5 star if they just had a hostess that would seat you instead of having to compete against other customers for a seat.
