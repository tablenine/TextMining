Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
Note: This review is based on my experience at the De Cero booth at Taste of Randolph fair.. . I don't think I've had a worse taco. Or a more expensive taco. Five dollars for a single taco that barely has anything in it? I tried both the ahi tuna and steak taco. Ahi tuna never tasted so bad.
