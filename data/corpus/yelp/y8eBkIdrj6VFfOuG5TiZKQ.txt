If you know sushi buffets, then you know that their sushi is usually lower quality and selection...but not here! For $25 on a Saturday night, I tried to get a taste of everything and failed! There is simply too much for you to even try one of everything, and everything I DID try was pretty good. I wouldn't say anything there was spectacular, but they were definitely consistently in the B-range in terms of tastiness, which is more than I can say for most buffets.. . If sushi isn't your thing, they also have a huge selection of sashimi, various salads, a soup/udon station, and a cooked section with grilled salmon, oyster Rockefeller, crab-stuffed prawns, and more.. . As for desserts, there is a very pretty selection of petite cakes which don't taste as good as they look, though nothing to complain about either. They also have the first green tea ice cream soft-serve machine I've ever seen. Unfortunately, the ice cream tasted like 80% vanilla ice cream mixed with 20% green tea ice cream -- nowhere near as tea-y as the scoops you get at Japanese restaurants.
