Every time I passed this place, it was full and looked like the lines were crazy. But finally went in on a Wednesday around 830, and there was still a 30 minute wait! It was sooo worth it though. The food is just that amazing, that I'd wait for hours. We started off with the oxtail/polenta appetizer, which sounded weird to me, but aMMMazing. It was so tender and delish! For entree I had the pork loin which had prosciutto and basil stuck to the cutlets (yes there was more than one). I usually don't like prosciutto but it really enhanced this meal. My friend had the spinach gnocchi, which was also great. It looked way smaller than mine, but she couldn't even finish it b/c it was fulfilling. It was like a ball of yummy spinach! Everything about this place was great, from the dim lit minimal decor to the bread!
