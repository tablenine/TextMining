I'm not particularly into vegetarian food, I love meat, but I do enjoy some veggie food every once in a while. Anyways, we came around ten o' clock on a Friday evening and were seated in the nice, "chill" atmosphere right away. . . I tried the yam and yuca fries, which were, ehhh, okay. I also got some plain brown rice on the side, which was what it was. . . For my entree, I got the stir fry green tea noodles. They were REALLY oily, which I was surprised about, considering that Gobo is supposed to be a "healthy" place. Either way, the noodles were greasy.. . I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again.
