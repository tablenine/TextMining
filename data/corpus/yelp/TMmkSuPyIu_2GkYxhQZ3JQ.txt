Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
Update -. Ok so Majestic does serve pancakes. I must've been too drunk to see that the first time. Why I went a second time, I don't know. Maybe it's because my friend who was designated driver took me there!  It was much better the second time around - no cockroaches. I'm changing this to 2 stars instead of 1.. . WTH? I was told this is a historic landmark and I must go there one night after drinking. OK, maybe if I were still in college I wouldn't have minded  it. But I swear I saw a rat run across the floor! The silverware was dirty, and the service sucked. And it wasn't just because we were all drunk and loud. EVERYONE in the place was drunk and loud.   AND they didn't even have pancakes on the menu. What kind of late-night diner doesn't have flap jacks? I would've taken an IHOP or a Denny's over this place.
