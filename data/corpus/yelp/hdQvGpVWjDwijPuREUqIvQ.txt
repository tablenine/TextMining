After I have heard so many things about this place, I was so excited to take my boyfriend here for his birthday.  I really wanted to love it.  . Not only is the service terrible, which I can deal with if the food is great.  However, the food they serve is horrible!  The beef is tough, the sides are bland.  I like the show and everything, but the product is bad.  The only good thing about it is the decor, it is a nice looking place.  . Not enough!  What a waste of time and money!
