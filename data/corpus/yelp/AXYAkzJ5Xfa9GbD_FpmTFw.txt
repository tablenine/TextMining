Restaurant: f2o Fresh To Order
Category: Sandwiches
Fresh to Order gets my vote for best take-out in all of Atlanta.  There's nothing better than the feeling you get when you walk in, order, and leave with GOURMET (that's right, gourmet) food in your hand in under 15 minutes.  I've probably been here about a dozen times already and I've never been disappointed.  The manager and his staff are super friendly and they recognize they're regular customers.  Other wonderful aspects about F2O: A weekend brunch with an omelet chef, free parking in the garage if you're out within one hour, and a decent wine list.  Oh and did I mention delivery?!  Guaranteed you won't be disappointed.
