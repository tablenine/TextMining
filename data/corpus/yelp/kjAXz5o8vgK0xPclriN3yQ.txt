Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Manna is the popular spot most of my friends decide to go to when they want AYCE Korean BBQ; esp when there are large groups.  Manna can definitely accommodate large groups easily, but be prepared to wait if your whole party isn't there to be seated.. . As usual, great food; it's hard to go wrong w/ Korean BBQ, because it's pretty much the same across the board.   Additionally, they do give you plenty of sides...and price-wise, it's pretty much the same as your usual - just under $20 and you're definitely fuller than full at the end of the night.  So when it comes to these types of establishments, service, and crowd come more into play.. . I always say at places like these(much like Dim Sum restaurants), you have to be assertive and call the attention of your waiter; but even then, it's hard at this place.  Maybe cuz of the sheer size and busy-ness...but either way, service is definitely a negatory characteristic that just makes the whole experience that much less enjoyable.. . Parking is a little crazy, you drive up this steep hill into the valet parking...otherwise, park on the street.. . If you have a huge party, come here...if not, you can definitely hit up the other smaller places around LA.
