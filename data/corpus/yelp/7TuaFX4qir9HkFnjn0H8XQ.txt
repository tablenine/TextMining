The best part of Hainan Chicken Rice?  . . THE RICE.  Some may argue that the chicken should be the obvious choice.  However, au contraire!  The rice, the rice is where it's at!  Getting the rice to the right consistency, packed rich with flavor from the chicken broth and with a slight coat of oil from the fat rendered from the chicken, well that is no small feat.  One may even venture to say that it is culinary masterpiece reduced to its most simplest form.  Now, what about the chicken you might ask?  Well the chicken is no slouch either.  The meat is tender and well flavored without being salty and when paired with the rice, well it is everything chicken should be.  Lastly topped with the ginger, soy sauce and quite possibly one of my favorite hot sauce concoctions, well Savoy chicken is forever in your debt.. . So why only 4 stars? While the portions are great and the food is delicious, I award my 5 star Hainan Chicken Rice for "Greenzone" as I feel it is equally delicious but with a lighter, cleaner, healthier taste.  Now if only I could take Savoy's hot sauce and combine that with Greenzone's Hainan Chicken Rice... I would be in HCR bliss!
