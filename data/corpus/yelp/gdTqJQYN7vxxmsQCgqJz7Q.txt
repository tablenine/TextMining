Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
I have a thing for Japanese ramen. You don't understand... one of the first places I wanted to go to on my return trip to San Francisco was a ramen restaurant. So you can imagine how I felt when I discovered Urban Belly's ramen. . . Compared to the ramen that I could have in the Bay Area, this place comes the closest. Yeah, it's a bit pricier and it's not as great as my favorite ramen restaurants in SF, BUT this is Chicago AND so far Urban Belly's the ONLY place I know that serves good ramen. So you can see why I'm a fan. ...But I'm not really a fan of the $12 bowl. Make it $8 and maybe I'll give you another star. ^_-
