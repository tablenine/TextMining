I LOVED this veggie burger. I don't think I've ever eaten a veggie burger that contained seeds/nuts, but wow, it added a certain something. I was eating in the almost-dark (not at Oinkster), --so I wasn't able to discern the components of the veggie patty visually, but the taste told me all I needed to know. The patty itself was very flavorful, but combined with their thousand island sauce, it was really delicious.. . The fries were also really good and crisp, and the house ketchup surprised me. I was enamored with the root beer float (mine was made with Dad's root beer, which I love as a result of shopping at Galco's). Boyfriend liked his cheeseburger, too.. . Oinkster is clearly a neighborhood favorite! We stood in a line of around 20-30 people just to order (Friday night around 7:30pm), and I can imagine it gets even more busy than that. I felt like it was ultimately worth the effort, but if that line were always going to be so long, I can't imagine that I'd have the motivation to go very often.
