Well shut my mouth and slap me silly!  That was the response I wanted from the bar-be-que at feed.  Instead, all I said was, "hey, this is good."  Really, the ranting and raving about the fine southern cooking by my neighbor had me so excited that the food was a bit of a let down.  It was oversold.  So what if I am from the south and a very tough critic.  On a positive note:  will I be back?  Probably.  It's more than acceptable.  But if you are from the land of grits and cornbread, be warned.  It's good, but it's not your mama's cooking.. . BTW, bring cash.
