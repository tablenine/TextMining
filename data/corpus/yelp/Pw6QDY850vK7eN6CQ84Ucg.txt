Nintendo. Grandma's furniture. Scrumptious vegetarian and Organic delights. Check!Check! and Check!. . A friend and I decided to meet here for some snacks and drinks. We shared a strawberry rhubarb pie, with a delectable almond streusel crust. The place was very comfortable. The people, authentically nice, and the pricing oh so right! . . I do have to say this spot is one of the few places open on a weekday after 9pm. Love it! I shall be back!
