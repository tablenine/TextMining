Goat. Cheese. Balls.. . I can't properly stress this enough.  . . You must have them. . You must place them gently in your mouth.. You must savor them. . You must not maniacally chew them.. You must submit.. . Seriously.. . I've gone to Ecco JUST for their goat cheese balls on an occasion or two.  Most other times, however, I order an actual meal. Said meals are always delicious, flavorful, and generally life-affirming.  . . They update the menu seasonally and it never disappoints. . . I have had phenomenal luck with the wait staff. When the ceiling fell on us during dinner [true story], they gave us free desserts.  It was only a little bitty piece of ceiling.. . It's consistently wonderful and a regular haunt of mine.
