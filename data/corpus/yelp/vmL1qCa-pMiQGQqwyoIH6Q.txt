I drove to little Tokyo on my day off for some ramen, but it was hot and sushi sounded like a much better idea.  So, we wandered over to Sushi Gen and queued up.  We made the first seating!yay! and sat down at the counter and started ordering.  Our sushi chef (Masatsu?) was prompt, professional and informative.  I was dining with a friend who is new to sushi, so I wanted to be very sure of what I ordered.. . Everything was fresh and oishi, delicious!  I was especially happy with the yellowtail and the sea eel.  I haven't had sea eel since I was in Tsukiji, Tokyo!  I really enjoyed the sushi and hot, hot tea.  This place is my kind of place, straight up good fish.  Arigato Sushi Gen!  I'll be back.
