I actually liked this place... . Didn't come here for brunch, just a random Tuesday morning so no trouble finding parking and no wait for a table neither. I had the caprese salad and french toast while my friend opted for a chicken wrap, tortilla soup and the fruit bowl. The taste I would rate at a 3 out of 5. I guess I went the safe yet boring route. I had been meaning to order the portobello sandwich.. but... the thought of stuffing my face at 10 am with something greasy... didn't sit too well in my mind. So safe route it is.... . Definitely for next time..... . BUT ~~ their cupcakes are pretty damn awesome btw!!!! I had the red velvet, blue velvet and chocolate. Did I mention I have a major sweet tooF? At $2.25 each I think they're a bargain compared to other places i've been to.. Not to mention tastes a whole lot better too.
