Gotta love this place for their delicious rice plates, drinks, and shaved ice. . . I pretty much always get chicken leg rice and the chicken is always crispy and moist. They'll give you different vegetable sides on different days, but my favorite is when they give cabbage and corn. Along with their tomato eggs and meat sauce rice, you get a simple meal but one that I always crave.
