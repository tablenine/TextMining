My beau &amp; I walked into this place after a long day of walking about Venice Beach/Santa Monica.. very hungry &amp; in much need of comfort... . we had a short wait but got lucky when they sat us at a nice little &amp; i mean little upstairs corner table.. do not go here if you are claustrophobic.. you are shoved in let me tell you but even so it was a nice atmosphere &amp; I was satisfied.. . . i ordered the Salisbury Seitan which was delicious.. oh gravy how i love you... . My Beau ordered a Fall salad special which was a joke really.. we had both thought it was going to be this huge heavy meal like salad(trust me the menu made it sound amazing) but nope it was just a salad, a weak disappointing salad.. I felt bad &amp; shared my meal with him... . We decided sense we were both still a little hungry to get dessert... . WHAT A MISTAKE...  we ordered the tofu cheesecake.. yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck.. it was like they had taken a piece of wheat bread shaped it into a triangle &amp; soaked it in water for two days... DISGUSTING.. . I was soo disappointed.. the best cheesecake I've ever had was a vegan cheesecake in new york .. i dream about this cheesecake.. so it is very possible to make an amazing vegan cheesecake... . If I wanted a healthy dirt tasting dessert I wouldn't order cheesecake ok soo please wake up &amp; name whatever it was you served us something else.. you are ruining the cheesecake name... . NEVER ORDER THIS CHEESECAKE UNLESS YOU HATE YOUR TONGUE. . either way I'd go back for the Salisbury seitan or the TV dinner because I love me some good veggie comfort foods..  &amp; those two dishes rock.. . . If we wouldn't have ordered dessert this place woulda got  4 stars but it makes me embarrassed that they serve that cheesecake to the public
