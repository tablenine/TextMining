Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
This place is just okay. The food was okay. Everything is very garlicy so if you like garlic, you will love this place. The lighting is tinted RED so everyone and everything looks red inside the restaurant. The garlic ice cream is a must try though! It tastes a lot better than you'd think! :)
