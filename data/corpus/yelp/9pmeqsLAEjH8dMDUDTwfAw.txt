Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office

When my friends heard that I loved burgers, they told me that I had to try the burger at Father's Office. So the next time I came back, we decided to go and check it out. We went on a Thursday night around 8:30pm and the place was PACKED! The place was open seating and it was a little bit frustrating because we had to stand around and hover over people so that we were ready to grab the next open table. And we can't order any food until we had a table...so that sucked. . . But once we did get a table, the experience got a lot better. I ordered the burger medium rare, sweet potato fries, and a hefeweizen. The sweet potato fries were good, but not amazing. I actually preferred their regular fries and will probably just order those from now on. My burger, though, was REALLY good. They cooked it with the PERFECT amount of rare-ness. The meat was juicy and the flavors were delicious. One of the best burgers I've tried!
