Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Tried it last weekend. #6 Miso. The noodles were not like what I usually had in a ramen shop. It's more like straight taiwanese noodle with more texture. The miso soup was too salty for me. The bowl was huge, lots of soup, but it's deceiving since the noodle inside was not that fulfilling. I guess Orochon was betting on all the customers to gulp the soup to fill their stomach. That would work, but not for me. Chasu pork size was big and soft, which was good. Egg was only water boiled, not like those brown one in Daikokuya. Lots of bean sprouts that might have expired, there were lots of dark colors here and there. Should have taken pictures. Got a half fried rice. Too salty. The only thing that was okay was the Gyoza. I just wanted to try this place out. Overall, I prefer Daikokuya. I won't be coming back.
