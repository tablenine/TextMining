It is better, maybe its because I want it to be better. Either way, I go in, they know me, and they take care of me. That matters, and I go.. . My waitress however was GREAT. That makes up for a lot. So are the T-shirts which I love. I am a logo freak, and I love theirs.. . Still looking for good fried chicken here, suggestions??
