Restaurant: La Parrilla
Category: Mexican
Sit-down Mexican in the Howell Mill surrounding area is a tricky proposition.  If you want very solid food, you can try your luck at Nuevo Laredo, but you'll always have to wait.   Before La Parilla, I didn't really have a palatable choice for close Mexican food.  The nearby dive "The Friend" is a college standby but definitely not because of the food.  Now I'm glad La Parilla has opened because it is close and the food is usually decent.  Not superb, but satisfying.. . My standby is the Burrito La Parilla, but I also like the Enchiladas Verdes and Quesadilla del Mar.  I was not impressed with the chile relleno I tried, though, and I much prefer the salsa verde to their red enchilada sauce .  Their "La Parilla Dip," marked "Very Tasty" on the menu, is quite good, but it's a bit heavy and expensive for a pre-meal appetizer unless you're sharing with a lot of people.  The Crab Dip was also pretty tasty.. . Their service is usually pretty good, although they can get very crowded at times.  The noise level inside can also get overwhelming and  sometimes they have live music, which is annoying if you just came for dinner and are trying to have a conversation.  Anyway, it's nothing special to go out of the way for and some dishes are hit-or-miss, but I'll come back regularly for a burrito or some enchiladas.
