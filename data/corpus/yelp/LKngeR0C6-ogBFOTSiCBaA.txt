Out of concern for your arteries, I implore you to stay away from here.  After I ate here, I could feel my body rejecting the food, not in literal way, but I knew things were not settling.  And that's when I wondered, "what's really in those hot dogs?  And how is it possible the hot dog is THAT greasy?". . Yes, it is cool that this place has a lot of history, and I totally appreciate that.  In fact, I'd say it might be a good place to go-- once.  I haven't been back since and I don't plan on it-- for the sake of my health.
