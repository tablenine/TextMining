I actually stumbled upon this place when I went to a meeting in the area, I was very early, so decided to have a late brkfst.  Since I was alone, didn't think I'd wait long for a table, I didn't.  But I felt somewhat ignored because I was alone, had to ask for coffee refills, tho the eggs benedict was good, the potatoes were so-so, the service was below par for me.  But would consider going back again to try the brioche french toast.
