Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
Stopped in for a drink after work at Pops thinking...man I could use a nice glass of bubbly.  As I paged through the wine list, I felt conflicted. The wine selection was amazing (especially the sparkling wines of course), which are aptly displayed in stainless steel refrigerators on the back wall, but I could help but gasp at the outrageous prices they were charging for some (but not all) of the wines. Overall it was though to find any kind of value whatsoever.  You seriously need to spend at least $60 - $90 minimum to get a decent  bottle of champagne.  Some okay whites could be had for less, but the pickings are slim.. . Refusing to throw down $100 on our visit, we instead ordered 2 beers (they have three available on tap).  We did get some really delicious scallops on happy hour (all food except caviar is 37% off from 3 to 7 pm on Monday through Friday).  . . Unfortunately the service was inconsistent at best.  Our bartender was cool when he was actually paying attention, but he spent most of his time courting herd after herd of cougars who seemed to have migrated to The Windy City from faraway places such as Arizona and Missouri and Texas.  These alluring, yet dangerous beasts seemed to be swarming at Pops.  . . Long story short, I will not be back anytime soon, unless things with my wife don't work out and i need some cougar lovin'.  Raaar!
