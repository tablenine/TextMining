Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Normally you wouldn't catch me in a chain restaurant, but I was actually surprised with the quality of food.  We had the salmon eggrolls that were very tasty with red cabbage and my husband had surf &amp; turf...not bad.  I had a chinese chicken salad and although I had had better, this was ok.  Downside: It is way too busy for me and the hosts have some major attitude - especially the very rude dude Michael who walks around with a headset ignoring everyone. . BTW, the cheesecake was great - it tasted whipped and creamy. yum.
