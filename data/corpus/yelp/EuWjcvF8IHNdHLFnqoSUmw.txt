Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
First Impression: The decor was cute, there are a ton of tables, inside and out.  There was a display with a decent amount of baked goods.  It was insanely warm in the shop, probably from all the freezers.   . . The Menu: Pretty extensive.  There were a good amount of baked goods and ice cream sundaes.          . . What We Ate: A brownie sundae, a couple cookies and an iced tea.   . . The Food: Meh.  Kind of forgettable actually.     . . The Counter Staff: Meh, it took 30 minutes for them to prepare our sundae and it wasn't even busy.  We asked about it after 10 minutes, they forgot about it, asked about it again after 20 minutes and they forgot that they forgot.  Go figure.   . . The Pricing: I think we paid about $15 for everything.  Frankly, I could have gone to Baskin-Robbins, had a better sundae for cheaper and saved gas money.      . . CONS: Service was slow, the area didn't seem very safe at night, the food wasn't very good and it was expensive.
