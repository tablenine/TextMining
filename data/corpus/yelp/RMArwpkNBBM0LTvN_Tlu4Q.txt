Category: Steakhouses
You would think that someone going to Mastro's for dinner would save up their appetite.  Not this chick.  I had a burger an hour before our reservation - albeit due to a work function.  Therefore, all I had were sides and a taste of my sister's NY Strip.  ALL DELECTIBLE.  Really.  The service was good as well and portions were appropriate for a nice doggie bag.  Only thing I would say is that the tables are a bit too close together.  You become intimately involved in neighboring conversations.  Otherwise, a delight!
