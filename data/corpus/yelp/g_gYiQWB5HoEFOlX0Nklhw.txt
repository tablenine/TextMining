Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
PROS:. - Nice, big, 'n tasty (California) rolls. - Seats at the counter give you the full "dining-in-Japan" experience. - Situated in Little Tokyo, with interesting shops nearby. - Authentic (as close as you can get, next to actually being in Japan) ramen bowls for $9. . CONS:. - Long wait time (we waited 40 minutes around 4:00 pm on a Sunday). - The dirty rag used as a door in the front needs to be thrown in the trash like, NOW. - Menu doesn't have much variety, it's very simple with a few items under each category (ramen, rolls, bento boxes, etc.). . Point is, I'm not a big fan of ramen in general, but it's tasty and will warm you right up on a cold day (especially if you sit at the counter next to two giant boiling pots of soup).  I've been to Japan, I've eaten their ramen, so you can trust me when I say it's pretty close to the real thing.  It's not drop-dead delicious, but it's a fun dining experience and a place everyone should try at least once.
