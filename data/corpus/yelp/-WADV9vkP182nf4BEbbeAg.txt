Oh my.  Oh Jeez!  The first time I ate their ribs I saw stars and rainbows and man, you just can't believe how good it gets there.  . . If you're looking for pretentious BBQ, you aren't going to find it here.  It's all about the food.  The ribs are slow cooked by people that really know what they're doing.  They have ribs, chicken and sides, love the Cole Slaw and . Cobbler. The slab of ribs with white bread and sauce on the side is perfect and a huge meal.  Half slabs will do all but the biggest eaters.  This is a "sauce on the side" place;  The ribs are rubbed with something amazing, and you can regulate the sauce as you see fit.. . The place is small and usually packed.  Don't worry about the line out the door, it moves fast and you'll be able to find a seat quickly.  Whenever there's a blues band in the place (and that's more often than not!) you get treated to some awesome blues and it's a kick in the butt when they pass the hat around for tips.. . Did I say small?  Yeah.  Well, if you need to go to the Men's Room, the Bass Player will have to move out of the way.  This place is real southern barbecue with no pretension, no bad tastes, and no credit cards.  Bring the green and you'll never forget the place.
