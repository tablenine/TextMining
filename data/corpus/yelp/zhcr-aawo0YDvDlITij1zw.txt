I'll be brief. Certainly no need to reiterate what has already been said. What I DO want to say is two things:. 1) Unlike so many of the really hyped places on here, this one met all of my expectations of flavor, value and quality.. 2) Â I loved the better-than-expected service. The owner greeted me, acknowledged I was a newcomer, and proceeded to recommend what I should order, when my friend James arrived a few minutes later. He even gave me a complimentary bottled water when I asked for a glass. In short, we loved the whole experience. (Although tromping around in Humboldt Park on a dreary mid-January day is enough to make you book a trip to Mexico!) Muchas gracias, Cemitas Pueblas.
