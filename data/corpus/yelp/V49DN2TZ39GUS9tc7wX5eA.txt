Restaurant: Maoz
Category: Middle Eastern
First had Maoz in Amsterdam. Then I found it in Barcelona. My infrequent vegetarian sensibilities, my wallet, and my tastebuds all approved. It was a beacon of hope in many confusing lands. Â . . Now that Maoz has his NYC the sky is the limit. I can trust an all you can eat fast food stop that has ample spicy condiments, friendly staff, and fresh falafal balls for my eternal pleasure.
