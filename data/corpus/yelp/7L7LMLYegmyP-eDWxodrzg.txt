A true LA institution!  I've been coming to Philippe's ever since I could walk and it still looks the same.  It's kind of like a culinary time capsule.. . Philippe's invented the french dipped sandwich and they're still the best!  My favorite sandwiches are the lamb and the roast beef.  While all the components of the sandwich are divine (namely the french rolls, meats, and au jus) it is the horseradish mustard that truly puts it over the top.  Be sure that you condimize your sandwich with a dollop or two of this heavenly hot sauce for the full gastronomic effect.  It just isn't a Philippe's french dip without it!
