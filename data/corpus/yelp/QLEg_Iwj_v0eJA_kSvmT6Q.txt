Yeah, I know, you've driven by this place a hundred times but never tried it. Well, get your ass in there! The food is decent and I like the environment. It's nice to sit outside near one of the fire pits or if your inside, treat yourself to a good 60's tune on the small jukeboxes at every table (I'm actually one of the people that uses them). Â The crinkle cut fries are good and there's something about the pickles they give out with every meal that's better then average. One thing I don't like is that they are not open super late anymore which is a shame because it was a good late night place. So, don't just drive by it when your hungry next time because Pauly says -- good stuff!
