Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
I was surprised on my birthday and taken here for the first time. I love garlic and the Stinking Rose is a homage to it. One word of caution however. If you happen to arrive by taxi, take a short walk after dinner and then call for a cab from another location.  Apparently many taxi drivers refuse to pick up diners at the Stinking Rose claiming they stink up the car.. My girlfriend had the 40 clove chicken that they are famous for. I had to try the Silence of the Lamb Shank with Fava Beans, with a nice Chianti of course. You could spend hours looking at decor and hundreds of photographs. In the womans lounge is the Garlic  Fertility Chair to see if one is pregnant. Check out the pictures.
