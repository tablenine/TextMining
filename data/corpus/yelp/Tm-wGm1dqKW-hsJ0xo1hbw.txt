I hover between 4 and 5 here. For what they are, they may be the best. It's a German Sausage house that has a kick ass Belgian beer selection. The fries are great, the sauces very good and I dare say, i will even eat a sausage once in a while. I actually liked the rattlesnake and rabbit one. . . I will agree with the reviewer that mentioned that their buns are not so hot, they could improve on those, great buns may make this place a 5 star place. i guess that could be said about many things, but I digress.. . Overall, i like the vibe, the music can be great, the last time I was there, the DJ was actually quite good. It was packed but not uncomfortably so. i also like their tasty infused water. Don't stop doing that!! It's nice to fill my own water while eating salty food and drinking beer. Don't change.. . German food is not often known for being "gourmet", this may be as close as it gets. Save yourself from the tackle box sushi at Zip across the street and go here instead. At least you can have a tasty Belgian brew and some brown paper table cloths to sop up the grease.
