Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The Kitsch'n has a vibrant psychedelic grandmother feel to it, the decor is definitely good for more than a few conversation starters. The place is just friendly enough to not feel swanky, but it's close. The are board games and other fun things to do while waiting for your food. As for the fare, the chipotle bloody mary had very little tomato taste, but lots of pepper! I settled for the delicious Purple Haze vodka/lemon drink on the next round instead. The chilaquiles were advertised on the menu as the perfect hangover cure, and I can see why. They were excellent! And not very expensive for such a happening place. I can't wait to go back!
