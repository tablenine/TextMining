Restaurant: Clarke&#39;s
Category: Diners
There's something to be said about a place that makes a killer tuna melt AND has sweet potato fries. =). . The food is good, but at 3am it's seems brilliant! I love that Clarke's is open 24 hours and is conveniently located just West of boys town which was close enough for me to walk to.. . There is a front restaurant room and a side bar/restaurant room. It's full service on either side, but the service is not good. For some reason empty or slow it seems to always take forever, but I always go back.
