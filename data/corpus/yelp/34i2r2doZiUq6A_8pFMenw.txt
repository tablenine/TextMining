This place is definitely fun with great food and drinks, not to mention, Vince Vaughn was there the Saturday night we went!  My friend and I ordered a bottle of Riesling which was great.  The caveat, a SUPER rude and snotty waitress named Nancy.  She basically yelled at our table to ask if anyone wanted anything and ended up pouring half a glass of wine all over my hand.  She was unbelievably bitchy to us, yet sweet and attentive to all the tables around us.  She never once asked if we wanted additional drinks, and basically ignored us the rest of the night!  We had a group of 10 people, who would've given this place at least another $200-$300 worth of business had it not been for that waitress whose panties were in a knot.  On the bright side, there is a wonderful waiter named Brian there who was our original waiter.  We explained the situation to him and he was extremely forgiving and willing to take care of whatever we needed.  Too bad he has to work with such a crabby-ass bitch!  Regardless, I'd go back as long as Nancy wasn't there.
