My brother lives near Sushi-Gen and he has been raving about it to me so I figured I'd try it out. . .  Yes, the sushi is fresh but I just wasn't impressed with the service. The service was not that great and I felt that the waitress were rude. Â The place is so small you have to wait for a table and it's not really worth the wait plus the parking situation is horrible!
