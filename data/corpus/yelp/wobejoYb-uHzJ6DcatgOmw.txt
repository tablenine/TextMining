I've only eaten here in the middle of the night when I was working in Htown, so I was usually tired and hungry which may have made the food taste better than it actually was. It's still pretty good though, and i'm a little biased because I always ordered the Monte Cristo but changed the meat so they'd call it by my name all the years I'd come in. Suck up to those customers:). . Never really had to pay for the meals because it was comped from our company but the prices are fairly high even for deli food. I'd probably rate this a 4 star for the food, but dropped it down for the rather high prices.. . Plus this is an LA institution, so it's worth visiting just for the history.. . Cool bar next door, actually it's just a room and it's kindof a dump but its got good vibe. Good desserts in the deli, and there always a good people watching scene even at one in the morning.. . Food - B+. Ambience - B. Service - B+. Value - C+
