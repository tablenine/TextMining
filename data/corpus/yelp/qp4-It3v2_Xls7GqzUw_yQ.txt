What a let down! My husband and I are new to Chicago and trying to find good restaurants worth revisiting in the future. Unfortunately, this place is not it. We had passed by this restaurant numerous times and even stopped in once, only to find there was a 2 and half hour wait. We figured this place must be good, with anyone willing to wait that long. . . Last night we gave it a shot again. This time only a 10 minute wait, which was definitely doable. The acoustics in the place are terrible, tables are crammed on top of each other and the service ... what service. Apparently this doesn't deter people from visiting, because the place was packed. We were seated at a table against the wall with two other tables of four literally shoved right up beside ours. Talk about getting cozy with your neighbor. . . All that aside - the food that is what we came for. But wait, food is not that easy to get here. Our waiter was a bit perturbed when we arrived to the table with beers already in hand and didn't choose to order an appetizer. I think he threw the towel in at this point, deciding to never return. Luckily someone clued him in, that we had been sitting with menus closed for over ten minutes. He then remembered, that we needed chips and salsa. This was probably the best part of the meal. We placed our order, chicken enchiladas and chicken fajitas, both were a disappointment. . . The food came out quickly, but the chicken enchiladas were luke warm at best. The cheese on top was cold. And the dish just lacked flavor. The fajitas or should I say, grilled chicken and onions had a nice flavor, but what happened to the other veggies normally accompanied with fajitas? Maybe I needed to pay additional - like we had to do to get cheese and sour cream with the fajitas. Ridiculous! I'm so glad we paid $6 to park and enjoy this wonderful experience!
