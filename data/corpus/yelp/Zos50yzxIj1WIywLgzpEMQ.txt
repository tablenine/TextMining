French Dip? more like French Don't.. . man, i am WITTY. . . I don't see the appeal of this place. The food is alright, nothing special, but people talk about this like its the second coming or something. . . It tastes like the flavors in everything have melded to eachother. And for $13 a sandwich its highway robbery for what they serve. I've had way better for half the price.
