Prices are unjustifiably high here. $13 for a burger. $27 for a rack of ribs!!!!. . The food is good and always well done, but not inventive. It's just a more upscale American chain. That being said, with no new twists on things, prices are extremely high. Can't justify it in the current state of our economy.
