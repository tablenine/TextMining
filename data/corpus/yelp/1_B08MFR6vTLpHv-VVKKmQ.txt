I work in the area so I come here about once a week.  I love it here, such a classic.  Great meat,  scallions, garlic, (I'm a big garlic and scallion lover) dipping sauce.  I love the owner, he is such a cutie.  . . The trick here is to come off peak hours - there's usually a lull between the first rush and round 2, so if you get there about 6, put your name on the list and spend about 15 minutes wandering around hello kitty shops, you'll be seated fairly quickly.
