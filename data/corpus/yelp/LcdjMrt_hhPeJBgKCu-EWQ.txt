Restaurant: The Earl
Category: Dive Bars
I've been to The Earl numerous times to see various indie rock acts. They have a restaurant and bar in front and a small performance area with bar and stage in back. It's a great place to see your favorite under the radar bands. It is a very intimate setting for music with the musicians within arms length as the stage is only slightly elevated from the floor. The sound is decent and well mixed for the tight spot. This is a place where you really feel part of the music. The staff are friendly and the beer is cheap. If you're a fan of indie music and good beer you will certainly enjoy yourself at The Earl.
