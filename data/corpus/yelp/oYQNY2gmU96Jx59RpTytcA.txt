Restaurant: Maggiano&#39;s Little Italy
Category: Italian
The food and atmosphere of this Maggiano's is comparable to the other Maggiano's I have visited, but what made my last trip here so awesome was the fact that Vicki from the Real Housewives of Orange County was there with a group of people having dinner. It was kinda cool seeing a reality star in person and I like that there are no paparazzi in Atlanta, so I could get a good look at her before having her run off from flashing lightbulbs!
