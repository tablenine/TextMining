Had lunch on a Sunday and my friends and I just got in under the wire before they closed the doors at 3 p.m.  While we were chowing on our noodles, the restaurant staff was tucking into their lunch so there was nothing but the quiet slurping of noodles and munching of chicken throughout the restaurant.  The food is good, but the imperial roll was surprisingly greasy so I might go with the bbq chicken the next time I go there, but I will definitely have to explore more of the menu.
