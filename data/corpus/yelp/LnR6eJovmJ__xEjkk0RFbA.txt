The food here is as close as you can get to top notch Brazilian food. They didnt get a full 5 stars from me simply because the salad bar (which most people i know do not order so they have more room for the meats) is a bit weak. Now, you will never, ever leave their hungry. You get a circular sign disk you leave on the table. Green means come and serve me and red means stop. I excused myself from the table once and forgot to flip my sign. Lets just say when I came back, I felt like Fred Flinstone. The mixed drinks are great, their wine selection is amazing with a 2 story state of the art cellar. Great Ambiance, always met with a smile. If you need to entertain or have a romantic dinner, you may see me there with a toothpick in one hand and a glass of merlot in the other. You must go.
