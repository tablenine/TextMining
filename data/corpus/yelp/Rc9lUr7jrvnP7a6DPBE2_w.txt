Although a bit pricey for a cafe', which is why I took off one star, but I would also like to add that I believe you can taste the quality here. I love the hot pressed sandwiches. My two favorites are: Herbed Roasted Chicken Breast and Grilled Cheese. The bread was had the perfect texture and amount of crispiness. It's just so simple, but so good. There are also fruits and premium salads.. . If you're the mood for ice cream, this is the right spot. Homemade, in shakes, malts, and floats, in sandwiches and cakes,... variety. I love the ice cream bars they make here. Yumm!!. . To further please your sweet tooth, they have different kinds of cupcakes, cakes, and ooey gooey cookies. BEST BLUE VELVET CUPCAKE... EVER. (:
