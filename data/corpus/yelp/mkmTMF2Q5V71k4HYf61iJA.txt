I visited Lola's little after I moved here..I absolutely loved it! my girlfriends and I went to happy hour and we had a blast, well when we arrived one of us was pretty blasted after waiting for our arrival for an hour having to try the special martinis which are wonderful! Â This is a place that is good to go with friends....appetizer were okay nothing major....but the decor and service worth it!
