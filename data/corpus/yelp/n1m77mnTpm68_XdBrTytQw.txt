Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Honestly, I WANT to love this place, I really do. It's so close to my house and convenient. But I have the opposite emotion. I hate this place so much I have boycotted it and convinced neighbors to do the same for about a year and a half. Why? Because the rudeness starts at the top with the owner.. . Oy the attitude. It was bad when it was just the restaurant but then they added the "bar" on the corner and the bad attitude was kicked up to ridiculous. And p.s. the food is "mediocre" on a good day.. . The wine bar used to be Vinnum and it had a co-owner that made it worth going to but, now it belong to the same Jackhole who owns the other two places and has lost it's lustre.
