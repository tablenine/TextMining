The salads are MADE WELL.  They have all the right greens and combination of dressing, nuts, fruits, etc.. . FRESH.. . The mashed potatoes are FABULOUS. GET THEM.. . NOTE:  if you get the Tuna steak, be forewarned, it is only seared, meaning cooked on the outside.  The inside will still look pink and raw.  Though it was still good (and probably better that way to the more mature food eater),  I am going to ask that it be cooked ALL THE WAY THROUGH next time.. . I mean, come on, I'm a vegetarian...
