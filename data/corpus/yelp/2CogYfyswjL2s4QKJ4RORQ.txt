This review is long overdue.  I've been coming to Miller's for years and years. Not so much when I grew up here, but since I've been gone. . . Bam! Every time I come home. More so recently, since I live in Dallas now. Miller's is old school. I mean that in a good way.  1935 ol' school.  . . The decor of the place is awesome,  it's like going back in time. The bartenders are dressed in shirt &amp; vest, the booths are tall and made from real wood. I very warm and comfortable place to hang out.. . Let's talk about my favorite thing here...the food!. . The Fried Calamari is simply some of the best I've ever had...anywhere!  The coating is light and crisp, the Calamari is tender and sweet. Every time!. . The Onion Rings are also light and crispy.  You get a mountain of rings, definitly for two or more people.. . And my other favorite appetizer are the Sauage and Peppers, the saute peppers are sweet, tender and not over cooked or greasy. . . Mind you I didn't have all this in one seating, but over the last five to six . months during trips back to Chicago.. . The Itailian Sauage is awesome, it comes with sauted Bell Peppers and Onions, I haven't found this favor in Dallas area anywhere.. . The Baby Back Ribs came as a slab or you get a 1/2 order combo with Shrimp or Chicken.  The ribs are meaty and tender. Very good.. . Other one of my favorites are the Greek Labm Chops, you get plenty, four I think, season to greatness.. . And the old fashion Chopped Steak was so old school with the grilled onions, it's waa real treat. I forgot how good a Chopped Steak could be.. . Did I mention they serve a real hearty breakfast too.. . I won't go into the bar/sports thing, but let's just say, if you're in Chicago and the one of local teams are playing, this is where you want to be.  Hands down!
