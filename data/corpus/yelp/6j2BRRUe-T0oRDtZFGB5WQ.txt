Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
So I had heard about this place, and happened to be in town for a Bears game a few years ago.  After the game, we headed over to try one of their dogs.  It wasn't very busy, but I knew I was in the right place even when the girl behind the counter said "Now what the fuck do you want" as we went to order.  I ordered a dog and some purple soda.  We got talking football, found out we were from California and were USC fans.  The girl shot back with "Ummm Ummm.  That Reggie Bush.  I'd give him some pussy!".  So there you go Reggie, if you are ever in Chicago, just go to the Weiner's Circle if you need to get laid.. . The dog and soda were damn good.
