Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
My friends and I were pretty excited about going to this place because of all the positive hype surrounding it. I found it good, but not great.. . QUALITY: I ordered a stretch chili cheese dog and my friends and I shared onion rings. Between the hot dog and the rings, the onion rings were easily better! They were crispy, hot, slightly sweet, and the batter wasn't too salty or undercooked. Going back to the main course of my chili cheese dog, it was just okay. I admit that I should have tried something more unique to Pink's as anyone can make a good chili cheese dog at home with cheese and a can of chili. . . SELECTION: They have a huge selection of hot dogs that look pretty exciting, from basic dogs to ones loaded with bacon, nacho cheese, avocado, pastrami, mushrooms, sauerkraut, onions, and lots more. With that many choices, there's a hot dog for everyone.. . PRICE: For under $5, I think that the price of my order was pretty decent, although the hot dogs aren't particularly huge for the price of $3 to $4. Those who want to try to the more exciting selections should be prepared to spend $5 to $10.. . EXPERIENCE: A normal wait time for a hot dog is about 30 minutes to an hour. We waited 42 minutes (yes, I timed it out of curiosity) and I'm not sure if it was worth the long wait. . . RECOMMENDATIONS: If you're willing to wait in line, do yourself a favor and get one of the more pricey "gourmet" dogs. I regret waiting in line so long for something I could have eaten at home and I'd probably want to go back if I had ordered something else. Parking was also a little hard, be sure to park on the side streets for an easier time. Oh! Also, get the onion rings! They're really good. . . SUMMARY: "Not worth that long of a wait, though good. Pink's seems to be a novelty of L.A. that you should try mostly for the experience."
