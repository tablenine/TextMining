my friends and i went to craft for the tasting menu for my dirty thirty celebration. i was impressed...very impressed. . . i'll let the pictures take you through my culinary journey. . . also, if youre into star sightings...this is the place to be. that nite we saw zach morris and tom ford...not together though.
