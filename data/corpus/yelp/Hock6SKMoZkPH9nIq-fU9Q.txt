Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
I've been to Reza's three times. The first two times were disappointing. I thought the food I was served was just not that good. The meat was dry and the falafel was brick hard and horribly overseasoned. The third experience, had it been my only, would have earned Reza's five stars from me. I had some mushrooms that blew my mind away as did the Dolmeh Felfel. I think I'm going to give Reza's another shot myself based on that most recent experience.
