What is so great about this place? It looks cool from the outside-- inside, it's just like any other pub with 20-somethings all looking to hit on each other. Guy to girl ratio is...sucks if you are a guy. Too crowded for anything but standing around on a weekend night. One of the few remaining decent Buckhead places though, and convenient to me, so I come here a lot by default.. . Actually, I went mid-week once and it was actually really nice and laid back. My group of friends got a big table and the waitress kept the drinks and appetizers going. I had a great time then. Overall, overrated, but fine.
