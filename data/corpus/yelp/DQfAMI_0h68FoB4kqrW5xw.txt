Category: Mexican
I'd give their chips and salsa five entire stars. The chips are crunchy, thin, warm and heavenly. Salsa is perfectly flavorful and makes my taste buds do the Supaman dance. Mmmhhhhmm.. . As for the food. Ugh. Okay I'm not gonna lie, it's not the best. I stick to the basics-- enchiladas and tacos. I wouldn't recommend straying from these staples. . . The service at Hacienda is usually bar none. Fast, friendly, English as a 1st language speakers. (On the other hand, If English were their 2nd language, the food would be more authentic...)
