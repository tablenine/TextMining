my gal and i love this place! it's odd how no matter what night we go, it is packed. although it doesn't take much considering it's rather small (one of my favorite aspects). i can't seem to order anything but massaman chicken. i tried the chicken satay appetizer last week. it was rather tasty.. . here's a fun game we like to play while there.. should've been a seinfeld episode. you may notice how the servers obsessively refill your water glass, even if you have only taken 3 sips. when they aren't looking i drink as much as i can! but i never seem to get down more than half a glass before they are filling it again. damn them!. . tip: the parking lot next door on right is available for diners in the evening and on weekends.
