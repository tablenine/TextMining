a long wait is the price you'll pay for awesome food -- especially after sakura got rave reviews from a local paper...  if you're the impatient type,  there's always take out (give them 45 minutes to an hour to prepare your order)... either way, the food at this popular restaurant is worth the wait... good portions for reasonable price...  and lastly, send my best  to harry...
