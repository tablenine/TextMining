Came here for brunch. Free first glass of mimosa with an entree order and then $2 per glass thereafter. Our server was awesome.. . Janet W. and I were undecided between the burger-n-eggs plate and the creole crab cakes plate so we decided to order one of each and split it. Both were delicious. I could tell that I'd probably enjoy their burgers (I've heard good things too). I'm good at handling my spices, so I'm throwing out a bit of caution for the creole crab cakes -- they come with a cajun sauce on top and it may be spicy for some of you. It was one of the best crab cakes I've had though. Mmm. Yum. . . The mimosa tasted mostly of orange juice though. I don't know if it's because I was already kind of drunk from the night before or what, but I wasn't really too happy with my mimosa. It was good that it was "free" though. . . This is a LGBT-friendly place too so I like it even more. . . The receipt in a colorful pump also made me smile. What can I say, I'm easily amused. :)
