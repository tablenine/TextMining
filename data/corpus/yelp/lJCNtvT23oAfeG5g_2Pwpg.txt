I must admit the food is quite good here and it is all reasonably priced.  Like most people, my favorites are the lobster and the French Beef.  However, I called to ask a few questions one afternoon and the guy who answered the phone had some difficulty understanding me as he did not speak English well.  After a while, I think he became frustrated and then just hung up.  Lame.  Go for the food, not the service.
