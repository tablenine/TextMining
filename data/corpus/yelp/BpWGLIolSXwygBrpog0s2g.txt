Geez, 704 reviews?1?  . . Better make this quick.  Daikokuya's a little like Pink's--overrated and rated by people who's never had ramen before.  The broth is inconsistent--good when it's done right; average at best when not.   Even the temperature consistency of the soup is uneven.  Will never wait in this crazy line unless an out-of-towner insists.
