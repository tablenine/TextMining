Restaurant: El Myr
Category: Mexican
El Myr is single-handedly responsible for my very recent burrito addiction. Honestly, until I started working later than usual, I've wanted to go to El Myr every night after work and get one of their grilled shrimp burritos. Not to mention their delicious guacamole and salsa. I kind of like the divey atmosphere of the place, I feel as though I don't need to be or look any certain way to have a decent evening in house. And even though it is indeed a bar, I still feel like I can go in and eat my burrito and have a beer (or some whiskey) and get out in a reasonable amount of time. The waitresses have been simultaneously attentive and delightfully impudent in their serving style, which I like. I like it when waitstaff calls out rude customers when they're being ridiculously needy or demanding. And El Myr delivers.. . Overall a great place to go for a drink or some good, fresh Mexican food, or both, as I usually make it.
