last Friday night my wife a friend of mine and I spent 20min trying to deicide on what to get everything just looks to good and we just wanted to get everything. We eventually got all sorts of goodies, the blue velvet cake tasted like the best blueberry cake I've ever had, banana dulce de leche was amazing it didn't taste like ice cream it tasted like heaven, and the coffee toffee was also good. My wife got an Oreo chocolate dipped ice cream which was awesome. We shared a black cherry float which was kind of expensive for what it is but it still tastes pretty good. An finally we got some coffee cake to go for breakfast the next day which wasn't so great but the bar was already set pretty high. Everyone should love this place.
