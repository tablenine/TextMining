Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
This is one of those places that have HUGE lines and when you get to actually sit down and eat, you're soooo excited and happy to see the little dumplings come out on the wooden tray! The first time I had these dumplings was in Taiwan and I was soooo sad cause they weren't available in the U.S. When I heard they opened one of these in LA, we jumped in the car and drove to LA to test out the dumplings that are made in U.S. They were soooo YUMMY and exactly like the Taiwan ones.. . The dumplings have a soup base within the thin skin that oozes out when you bite into it and also even though the dumplings have a thin skin, it never rips no matter how much you poke at the skin! I've never had this at another place that the skin was thin and didn't break. Also it's purty kewl that you can look into the kitchen and see the chefs making all these yummy dumplings!. . It's totally worth the wait! Can't wait to go back!
