Sometimes my eyes and my taste buds don't see...eye to eye. haha All these pictures looked sooo good but i know I don't like having an overload of sweets, or sweets for breakfast.  So my friend and I decided to split one sweet dish, and one salty one b/c I NEED to try a pancake, and I need something savory to balance it out.  So we opted for 1 blueberry pancake because it seemed like one of the more tame ones, omelette pomodoro, and a side of sausage.  Ooh boy was that cream cheese topping on that fluffy blueberry filled pancake mighty scrumptious.  It was good for the next 3 days too.  Next time, I will be brave and try something a little more crazy.
