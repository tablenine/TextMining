Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
went to the Counter again with two friends and this time the place was dead, the service was fairly speedy and the waiter was prompt with drink refills. I definitely recommend getting your burger on their pretzel bun with the herb goat cheese... but avoid the roasted garlic aioli (if you are prone to heart burn) . . Also had the fried dill pickle chips, which were interesting, you get a nice sized portion too.
