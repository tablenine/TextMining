I was really surprised at just how big this place was!! I was also pretty shocked that the food was pretty reasonably priced; considering it's posh decor and dressed up servers. That being said, we went during a football game, and it was loud, crowded, and the server was doing a lot more watching the game, and a lot less getting me some water (if you know what I mean). That sucked too, because the buffalo sauce there is pretty hot... but I can handle it. That is, if I could get a little more water!!!. . Either way, I would probably eat there again.
