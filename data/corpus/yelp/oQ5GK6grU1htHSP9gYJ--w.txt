This place is for people who are serious about good food. I've been twice for the crab &amp; chicken night, and both times have been top-notch. The cocktails are AMAZING (fresh squeezed juices), the service is exceptional, and the food is amazingly delicious. Best fried chicken I've ever had. The Maryland crabs are awesome - definitely makes for a fun night with friends, and the oysters are rad. I'll be making several return visits in the future. Go here for the food experience, not for the scene.
