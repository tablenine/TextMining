Very good sandwiches and salads, a huge selection of good to great desserts and the best coffee  in the 'hood.  I'm so glad they've got a lot of outdoor seating, because this is a place we return to often.  Faves includes their ice cream sandwiches, their puddings and their bacon scone.  Friendly staff, too.
