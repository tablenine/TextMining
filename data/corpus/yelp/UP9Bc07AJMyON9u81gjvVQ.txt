I live around the corner from this place and all the time it seemed so full, people all the time in this restaurant, and friends were telling me that it was very good. so i decided to try it with them one day. . and YES it is good, the fried chicken is so crispy and the portions are big, the chicen is not greasy, and has good flavor... same with the waflles. . totally would go again
