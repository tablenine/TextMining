So, I'm not a big yelper.  I will only write a review when I'm blown away, in a good way or bad way.  This place suprised the hell out of us.  We've been there twice now and each time it's been wonderful.  They have excellent dishes, good desserts, and great bread.  It's small and frankly fairly unimpressive aesthetically, but it's great.
