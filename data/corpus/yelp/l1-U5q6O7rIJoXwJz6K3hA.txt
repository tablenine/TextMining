Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
The ramen here is okay, and nothing out of the ordinary. Extra toppings range from 50 cents to over a dollar, depending on what you want. I think the bamboo is totally worth it at $1 extra. They give you sooo much of it, and well, I happen to like bamboo shoots in noodle soup. The noodles end up coming out to be a little too expensive for the quality that you get if you add too many toppings, so choose wisely. . . We got two appetizers (under the entree section). The pork belly with kimchi was really good stuff! I would order that again in a heartbeat. I also ordered this bacon, corn and asparagus dish. It tasted okay, but the portion is really teeny tiny when compared to the pork belly thing. I would not order that again.. . No refills on soda. For realzies. Not that it matters, cuz I probably won't be craving much of Shin-sen-gumi anytime soon.
