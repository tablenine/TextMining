Heftier, more robustier review to come - ok i lied.  This will suffice.... . This is to replace my very unsatisfactory review i had posted earlier.  We revisited and had a very informative tour courtesy of their event director Debbie Golden.. . My fiance and I were able to tour most of their spaces and both agreed this would make for a very unique and social rehearsal party.  We also stayed for dinner to try the food.  I had the rueben (mouthwatering!) with sweet potato fries (cold but still tasty).  Kelly had the sliders and regular fries - she seemed very pleased with all of it.. . The advantage to choosing Stats is that you can personally design your menu with items that Stats serves as well as items from any other Concentrics restaurant (price will fluctuate obviously but it's a nice option to have).. . The rooftop bar has TVs that can run separate games or one source (slide show, video, etc) and you can use a microphone as well to be sure you're heard over the street noise outside.  Probably not necessary if you're in the Adidas room.. . All in all i'd define STATS as an upper-end sports bar.  Our waitress suggested "sports restaurant" which is also fair.  Nicer entrees are available on the menu and beer prices are fair considering it's Down Town and this place has got to pay the rent somehow.. . 4 Stars is better than 1!
