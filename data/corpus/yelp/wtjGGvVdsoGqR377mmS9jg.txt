This place has been my favorite Japanese restaurant for years.  I literally have been coming to this place the day they opened!  The ramen there is extraordinary.  If you love extra flavor, ask to add kotteri.  The bento combinations will not fail you either.  The chicken teriyaki is the best I ever had.  I don't know how they cook it but it's very moist and slightly crunchy which makes it so good.  The wait staff is charming.  Satomi-san...She's such a darling.  Japanese politeness at it's very best!  This place gets LONG lines.  One that Little Tokyo has never seen.
