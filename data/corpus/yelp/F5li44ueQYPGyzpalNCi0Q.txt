If you want to wait 50 minutes for your tacos to come, then this is the place for you to go. Seriously, how hard is it to put together a taco?! Â . We weren't even in a big party. It was just the 3 of us.. . And don't even expect your waitress or the manager to be around while you wait. They completely avoid you so that they won't hear complaints about the excruciatingly long wait. Of course, once your food comes, they're quick to place the bill on your table even before all your plates are completely consumed.. . The food is decent, but didn't warrant the high price tag. I get more enjoyment out of a $2 dollar taco dive than this joint.
