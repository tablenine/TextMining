Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Oh my Freakin God!!!!!! I love the griddle from its huge french press of gut rut coffee, to the huge plates of food, the brick walls and blues playing on the stereo! I always take visitors there and havent had a complaint yet. My favorite is the tequila sun rise, that keeps me going all day. Not to mention the hot waitresses and all the good looking patrons. It can get very busy on the weekends so I only go during the week. As i have been a chef for the last 20+ years let me tell ya watch the egg cook do his job that guy kick ass! Being a good egg cook is one of the hardest to master and he makes it look effortless, he would sure beat me in egg cook off.
