Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Ugo is my stand-by restaurant for date night.  It's not the most spectacular Italian food, but I rank it higher than C&amp;O's or Buca de Beppo.  I prefer their fettuccine diavolo, spicy red sauce with grilled shrimp.  My boyfriend typically gets a pizza or pesto gnocchi.  Service is alright, sometimes i feel that the waitresses are faking the Italian accents and are really from Finland.  The outdoor seating is lovely for a Friday night date.. . You can purchase a bottle next door at the wine bar and bring it over for dinner.  Don't valet park.  2 hours free up the street next to the TJ's
