Fabulous!. . Like more than half of the others I see reviewing here, I went with my Groupon in hand about 3 days before it expired.  Every other table around us also had one.  The place was bumping on a Thursday night.. . The food was ridiculously good, and our server even brought a couple of apps that we didn't order as 'compliments of the chef.'  We had the scallops, the duck, the pork belly app, and the tuna nicoise.  All were amazing.  They actually looked like tiny portions, but it was more than enough food for the 2 of us.. . The bar area is also pretty cool looking to hang out and possibly get a drink or even eat at.
