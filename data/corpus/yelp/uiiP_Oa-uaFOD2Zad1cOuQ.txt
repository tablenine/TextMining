i've been wanting to try this place forever since EVERYONE says it's the best breakfast in LA. so, i rounded up 2 friends to get some breakfast and see if it really is the best breakfast out there. i ordered the famed french toast, plain. i thought it was perfectly made. i don't think i'd ever add any of the extra toppings because they were already quite sweet with syrup. my friend ordered the egg breakfast that came with potatoes, bacon and toast. the bacon was thick and unlike any bacon that is usually served at most restaurants. being a veg i didn't taste it but it looked good i suppose. the potatoes were also great. my other friend got the pancakes. visually they look great. good size, nice and fluffy but i wasn't impressed with the flavor. there was something lacking with the pancakes. french toast is def better.. . prices are alright. i felt they were a bit steep for my liking but i guess quality is worth more than quantity. the place itself is pretty simple with indoor and outdoor parking. the menu is also pretty simple with not a lot of stuff to choose from. breakfast is always served. i took a glance at the lunch menu and it seemed like it could be good but i'd probably just go there for breakfast. as a vegetarian there were not many options on the menu. oh well. . i'd avoid this place on the weekends. i live nearby and every weekend morning there are hoards of people waiting outside to be seated. it gets extremely packed.. . overall this place has good quality breakfasts and whenever i need to satisfy any french toast craving i'll probably hit up square one
