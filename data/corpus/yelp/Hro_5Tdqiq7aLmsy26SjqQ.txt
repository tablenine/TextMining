Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: Bars
"Me want veggies", "Me eat veggies" "Nom, nom, nom, nom." . . In an effort to lose weight and stop pumping my body full pesticides herbicides and hormones, I have been on a "I cook for myself and make organic things" kick. I have to say that I feel so much better for it, and now find myself looking down on restaurants where I cant get anything health. So when a friend and I wanted to go out for a dinner date the other night, we chose Uncommon Ground because of their organic "clean" food. . . From the moment I walked in the door, the staff at this location were very friendly. Our waitress was very attentive, but not so much that she was bothersome. She answered all my questions about the food honestly and helped me in my selection. And, the guy who was tending to our drinks, made sure my water was filled whenever I wanted it to be. I was very impressed with the staff!. . After perusing the large menu, I had to pass up some amazing sounding food and settle for veggie burger; I unfortunately am on a limited diet at the moment. I wasn't too impressed with the veggie burger, but I believe that is because I was really craving the pumpkin ravioli or the farm crispy chicken. I know that, being so close, I will definitely be back, but the real questions is: Do they deliver?
