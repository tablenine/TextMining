Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Very good pizza. We had a deep dish and a thin crust. The deep dish wasn't as deep as we had expected...this was a good thing. My Mom was a little hesitant to try real Chicago pizza, this was a nice surprise.. . Be prepared to wait. This location being the flagship, it seems to be quite the tourist trap. It wasn't as bad as it could have been however. We waited about 45 minutes in the bar at 6 pm on a Friday night. By the time we were eating, people were being quoted an hour and a half or more. More people were just standing out on the street waiting for their name to be called. I highly suggest finagling yourself a spot at the bar and having a glass of wine. The bartenders were nice and you can watch them make the pizzas.. . The best part about this place is that when you put in your name to wait for a table, they give you a menu. Then you go up to the counter and place your pizza order. Then, when you sit down, all the waiter has to do it get your drinks and tell the kitchen to throw your pizza in the oven. So efficient.
