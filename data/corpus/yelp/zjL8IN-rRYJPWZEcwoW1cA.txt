I am a big fan of all things French, therefore, I love this not so little place.  I have been bunches of times for bunches of brunches but have never reviewed it before.  I don't know why, perhaps its my own little way of keeping a secret.. . There is an excellent selection of both sweet and savory crepes which really goes a long way for me.  Yum to the apples, but sometimes, I need the other end of the spectrum and they pull through.. . Owned by a French ex-pat, not a chain, one star for sure!  Near my house and directly below Ms. Maggie and my '90s giant hang out pal, yet another.  Really extensive menu choices for the pickiest people ever.....yet another.  Very comprehensive wine list with lots of choices in all price ranges and lots of by the glass options.. . Decent, approachable service that will put up with you blocking the aisle so you can visit your two drunky brunch girls, priceless!
