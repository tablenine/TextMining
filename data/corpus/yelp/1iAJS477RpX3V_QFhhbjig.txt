Restaurant: Leon&#39;s Full Service
Category: Gastropubs
Leon's - I thought you would improve since we saw each other last.. . While Leon's has lots of GREAT things going for it - the service is still amazing, the atmosphere is still great. The beer list, while I can no longer partake, is still great. I ended up with two very affordable glasses of a yummy Malbec that made me quite happy.. . What is still lacking? The food. My date and I ordered the pub frites to start. Now these are still quite yummy. Piping hot, I love anything that comes with a sauce to dip on the side, and the seasoning was good. Not overly salted.. . Our entrees were huge disappointments. I ordered the scallops and they were...blah. They had no flavor on their own, except for SALT. And this is how the rest of the meal went. Everything tasted like salt. My side was oyster mushrooms with mustard greens and this tasted like...salt. The Benton's Bacon crumbled on top couldn't even save it. The only thing that semi-saved my scallops was dousing them in a bit of the smoked tomato mayo that came with our pub frites. . . The second entree, a grilled pork with greens and orange chimichurri, and roasted fingerling potatoes tasted like....SALT. The chimichurri on top of the pork was a real low point, it tasted odd in comparison to the pork which would have been saved by not dousing it in salt. . . When you can't even focus on even the slightest flavor in the food because of the overkill of salt....well, I can't say we'll be back. You have to drive to Decatur. You have to circle to find somewhere to park. You wait 30-45 minutes in between people who live in Decatur that think it's okay to bring children out to a bar/restaurant at 8:30. Then you get your food and it's this underwhelming? No thank you.
