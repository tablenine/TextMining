Sometimes it feels a tad pointless to me to write a review for a place that already has a ton of reviews on it, but I'm happy to say that I appear to be the first reviewer [at least in almost a year] who is writing a review for Resto for BRUNCH.  So if you're looking for comments on their burgers or beer, look at the next review! Or any of the other 30+!. . Walked in at around 1;30pm on a Sunday, and got seated right away.  The friend I was with had been for dinner - she said it gets really loud in the evening, but at brunch the volume was fine... even with the couple next to us about 12 inches away.. . My friend got the hang-over pasta dish, which must be a favorite, because it's pictured on a post-card/business-card they have stacked at the door. It's basically one of the best carbonara pasta dishes you've ever had, with a fried egg on top. Very rich. Portion not huge, but no worries - you have to save room for the Dutch baby! [see below]. . I got the poularde sandwich. Sorry, don't speak french  - but poularde must translate to 'really flavorful chicken'.  It's served warm, chopped up with parsley and just a touch of melted cheese, with a barely noticeable dressing, on a sort-of open-faced focaccia bread. Greens on the side were too lightly dressed [unusual complaint of mine].  . . So, the dutch baby.  The couple next to us got it BEFORE brunch, we got it after. It's like a thick crepe, brought to the table in the very pan it was made in. Lots of butter, and served w/ a lemon wedge.  Rich, warm, dough-y in the best kind of way.  . . Atmosphere is nice, staff is cool and young. They wear cool t-shirts that I want to buy one of.  This place is a REAL find in this area - otherwise a rather barren swath of the manhattan restaurant scene. I hope they have huge success - they deserve it.
