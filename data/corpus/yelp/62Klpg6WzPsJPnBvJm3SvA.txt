It is what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else.  If I might recommend, regardless of which sandwich you get, going for the double dip.  The bread can scratch the throat a bit going down without the extra dousing in their signature sauce.  And in case you were wondering don't even ask f you can get some sauce on the side.  The answer, an emphatic NO!
