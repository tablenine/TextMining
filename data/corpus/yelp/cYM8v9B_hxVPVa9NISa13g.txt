I've been here at least 30 times in the past two years of being in Chicago and it has NEVER disappointed. I love the variety of seating options (downstairs, downstairs sushi bar, heated garden, upstairs, upstairs booths, upstairs sushi bar, upstairs liquor bar . . .). I just found out recently that it's the oldest sushi restaurant in Chicago too (open since 1967).
