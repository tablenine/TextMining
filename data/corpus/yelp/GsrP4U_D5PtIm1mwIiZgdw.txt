traditional bar food served in non-traditional ways.... take away the fun platters and it may not be all that good... however, the pizzas are pretty damn good.   some "fun food" examples: mac n' cheese muffins, cotton candy served in a shopping cart, deconstructed nachos (all the fixings served separately), popcorn shrimp served WITH popcorn and served in a traditional popcorn container.... the service tends to be a bit slow at the bar but be seated and have an endless night of drinking with attentive service.  this is BARELY a sports bar - clients are dressed up and care more about the frou-frou drinks than whatever's on TV.  forget about getting a seat on the rooftop; 5 visits and yet to see that roof--twice though, chicago summer decided to take a day off so it was closed.  there is also a pretty spacious patio with an outdoor TV.
