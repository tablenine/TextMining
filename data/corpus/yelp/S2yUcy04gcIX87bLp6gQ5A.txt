There is a reason why people wake up in the mornings... For PORTOS! This place is bananas in the morning as people line up both lines for their day's fix of pastry and confection goodness. I love them most for their Cheese Rolls. This simple yet delightful pastry is topped with sugar crystals and stuffed with the right amount of sweet cheese. The pastry crust is soft yet flaky for a satisfying bite. I usually like to leave it in the refrigerator for a bit and eat it cold - something about the temperature accentuates the goodness to the 3rd power. Did I mention this delicious pastry is only $0.65? On the weekend, you can get a pre-packaged dozen at a discounted price (which is even crazier because all their prices are so affordable and well, cheap). . . They also have so many other things! Potato balls (stuffed with meat!). Pulled Pork, Shredded Beef, and other Cuban-inspired sandwiches. Sweet &amp; savory Croissants. Juices. Lattes &amp; Coffee. Cake slices and gigantic cakes (their fruit tarts are tasty - really good custard to fruit to crust ratio). I always come intending to just get cheese rolls, but I always manage to leave with just a few more... I'll be honest, there's nothing else I love as much as the cheese rolls, but I don't mind trying until I change my opinion!
