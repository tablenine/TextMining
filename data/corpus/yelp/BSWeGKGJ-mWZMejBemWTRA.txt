i would give this place a 2.5 stars.. . i don't understand how this place got 4 stars with 800+ reviews.. . came on a saturday night.  small parking lot, but we got extremely lucky and found a spot.  i think most people have to find street parking, but this is LA, what else is new.. . line was long, but again, i was expecting this.  what i wasn't expecting though, is that they only had 1 cash register open.  so the line moved a bit slowly.. . now for the food.  here is what i ordered (for party of 2).. . oinkster patrami:  sandwich came out lukewarm, almost turning cold.  i have no idea how long they had this sandwich out, but just from the temperature, i'm guessing a very long time.  taste was OK, nothing mindblowing, but decent taste.. . bbq pulled pork:  not too thrilled about this sandwich.  didn't really taste like much to me.  also came out lukewarm.. . belgian fries:  the redeeming factor of my oinkster experience.  very very cripsy and good.  i actually didn't eat the rest of my sandwich and filled my stomach up with these fries instead.. . plantains:  good, but it's plantains..can't really go wrong.. . ube shake:  great, especially with the belgian fries.. . horchata shake:  good and recommended if you like horchata, although it is a bit too sweet. . For all this, i paid $32.  Granted, i ordered a lot of food, but for a fast food type of place, this is expensive.. . overall, i say this place is overrated.  maybe i ordered the wrong things, but i would not go out of my way to come back here.  i'd rather go to in n out.
