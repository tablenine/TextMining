If you're looking for an outdoor cafe with a European feel then you will find it here. The food has always been consistently good and the vibe is great for a quiet evening out without having to deal with crowds or attitude. When we're at our whits end and can't decide where to go we always fall back on this place. We know what we're getting and we always enjoy it. Also, be sure to check out their Grapefruit martinis... this is what got me there in the first place. :-)
