always get the shaved ice here! its sooo good. you're probably going to have to wait awhile to get seated, so might as well make your visit more worth it and get desert as well. the menu is pretty small, but everything they offer is pretty good. . . you'll leave satisfied, and it wont hurt you wallet either :D
