Best Shabu Shabu place I've been to in LA.  Mr. Shabu Shabu in San Gabriel comes close, but the sauces aren't quite the same.  This one gives you a peanut sauce and a cooked soy sauce that make the whole thing worth the 1-2 hour wait that you might run into, especially on a weekend evening.  . . For anyone that hasn't had Shabu Shabu, here's the deal.  You sit down in front of a pot of boiling water.  You get a bowl of rice, a plate of raw beef (I believe small is 10 slices, large is 15 slices and you can ask them for extra fatty or extra lean if you want either of those) and a plate of noodles and veggies.  You also get two bowls with the above-mentioned sauces.  There are various things you can add to the sauces and/or water (radish, garlic, green onions, chili powder, some kind of hot sauce) as you wish.  Then it's all up to you how you want to cook.  I'm not a rare meat kind of person, so I leave the meat in there for a bit.  Take it out, soak it in sauce and gobble it down with some rice.  You can get an extra plate of meat (as one of my friends I usually go with does) or more (I've gone with people who get 3 extra plates of meat, now that's a lot of meat) for an extra $6 a plate or something like that.  . . Yes, there is always a wait for this place, but the anticipation of what is to come makes it all that much better when you actually hear the guy that runs the place call your name.  As mentioned in other posts, make sure you're in the area while you're waiting.  The owner will come out and check to make sure people that are on the list are still there.  If he can't find you twice, you're off the list.  He also won't sit you until your whole party is there.  Don't settle for cheap substitutes, this is the place!
