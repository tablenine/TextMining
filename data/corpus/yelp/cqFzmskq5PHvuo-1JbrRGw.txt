I went here with a group of people for dinner.  I thought the ambiance was cool but it was super crowded.  Everyone met in the bar area and those people who ordered wine at the bar seemed to get large pours.   Other then being crowded it was also very loud and almost impossible to hear everyone.. . We sat down and had a long table in the back.  The menu was quite eclectic.  I think that's what they are going for but it was like nothing the did was fabulous. I had the fish special tacos. They were fine but not out of this world. I thought they were way overpriced for what I ate.  I tried a bite of a few other people's food and it was fine but once again not out of this world.  The service I actually thought was terrible.  I asked if there were refills on soda and you would have thought it was the rudest question in the world.  . . I am never a huge fan of lettuce entertain restaurants and you can tell this one is popular more for it's location and it being a lettuce restaurant.  For the price of the dinner I know i could have had a much more flavorful meal somewhere else.
