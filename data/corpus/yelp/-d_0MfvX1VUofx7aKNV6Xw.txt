First off, let me clarify that I don't see Kogi when they come to my neck of the woods - the lines are just too long.  BUT, when they're at "X" - there's never a line/wait.  So, my 5 stars is for the food we get, at that spot.. . Location:  Great.  There's always parking, and hardly more than five minute wait/line, which is just about the same for good ole' taco trucks like Leo's &amp; Rambo's.  If you're not into eating standing up or on/around your chair because you absolutely require a fancy-smancy table, this is not the eatery for you.. . Service:  Fantastic.  Smiles &amp; greets.  Always a photo opp for their website, which is not the greatest when you're stuffing your face, but hey, at least you're showing that the drive/wait is worth it!. . Food:  We have tried: the burritos &amp; the tacos and one of their specials which unfortunately I can not remember.  Beef &amp; pork are best, chicken is alright.  The burrito is stuffed with a little extra "cushion" I don't know if it's corn-meal (?) but it's definitely not rice.  We always ask for extra sauce, because extra-spicy = extra-delish!. . Price:  It's definitely a bit pricier than other taco trucks, but it's not too bad.  You could easily get full of a two-three items.. . Overall, I'd stick with the tacos, only because I prefer an all-meat burrito (which gets rather small after taking out the misc. items).  The al pastor &amp; beef are superb, you may have a stronger preference for the chicken than we do.  Is it the best taco-taco ever?  I can't say, but for the fusion that it is, it does justice.  If you're anti-two-hour lines (like we are) - find the spots that are slow and try and go during the non-rush hours.  Bonus - seeing old friends &amp; making new ones while you enjoy good food!
