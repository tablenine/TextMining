Restaurant: Maggiano&#39;s Little Italy
Category: Italian
Infuriating.  I admit that I'm generally biased against chains, but I like to think that this restaurant is WHY I'm biased, rather than that I dislike it because of its chain-ness.  Regardless, this place is infuriating because of how many otherwise rational, well-meaning, decent-food-tasted people seem to like it.  It's not the Flying Biscuit phenomenon, where everyone originally thinks he likes it before waking up one morning and realizing it's unworthy of mention; it's a place that people defend to such a degree that it makes me question whether I've lost my mind.  I LOVE the fact that others compare it, favorably or unfavorably, to the Olive Garden -- this is the company that it deserves to keep, and against which it should be measured.  My vote is that at least Olive Garden pretends less -- sure, on TV, it's all 'hospitaliano' and 'my uncle from Italy loves the $2 boxed wine!', but at least they don't do my least favorite thing in restaurants (as Maggiano's does): ask if you've eaten there before, because if not, they're gonna regale you with the 'special' way they do it.  BTW, the 'special' way they do it is some sorta dull family style.  The food isn't horrible by any means, but neither is it worth paying so much for, and it's SO much worse than it could easily be.  Expect to be invited here for a birthday party or seasonal office lunch.  Woo.  Hoo.. . Addendum: Russell makes a good point, however.  Some of the dishes will just grab you, as much as you don't really want to eat them.  It's like not being able to stop eating a bag of Doritos, but somehow you wind up in Buckhead when you're finished.
