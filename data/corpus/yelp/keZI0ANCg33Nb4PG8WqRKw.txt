.Absolutely by far the best I've ever been too and beats the drive to go to any restaurant that I aim to go to.. . Do I dare to mention all the food this place has that is past acceptable? The black cherry chicken, bbq chicken, turkey meatloaf, collard greens, M. Cous Cous, etc etc.. Also to mention that this place has a juicing station, so carrots, apple, greens, whatever mixture you want.. . Seriously everytime I go to ATL I always hit up this place for food and I close to refuse to go anywhere else.. I'll even wear a suit if I have to, haha, but yeah for real.
