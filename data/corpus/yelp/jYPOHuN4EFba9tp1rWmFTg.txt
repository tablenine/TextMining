Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
went with the coworkers around 1230pm for lunch.  it was mad packed and we waited for what felt like forever...  but when the food finally did arrive, everything was warm and fresh and delicioso!  they charge extra for the cheese which kinda sucks, but the cheddar was really soft and flavorful, not the rubbery shreds you'll get at taco bell.. . considering this place is for american tacos, i think it's a winner.... as long as you don't mind the lunchtime rush.
