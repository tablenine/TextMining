One of two defaults after a night out.  The latter would be Fred 62's on Vermont.. . I recommend the Monte Cristo or the quesadilla.. . Oh, the chicken soup does not come with chicken.  It's more like hot chicken broth.  Chicken is an additional charge, but the crackers that they come with are free (so help yourself to more).
