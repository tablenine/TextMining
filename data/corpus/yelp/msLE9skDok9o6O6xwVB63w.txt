So apparently I'm the last person to get the hype that is taqueria. And apparently, if you want to eat there, you better bring a magazine bc there's a bit of a line. Always. Regardless, the fish taco is amazing, and definitely why I keep going back. It's perfectly breaded with jalapenos for a nice kick, and also has a delicious creamy sauce. The other tacos are great as well, but like I said before, it is definitely the fish taco that convinces me to stand in that line. The guacamole is also very tasty, and the salsa trio never disappoints. I love salsa verde.... . Final thoughts - "bit" of a line, but the fish tacos are worth the wait.
