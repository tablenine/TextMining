I'm the 90th person to review Lola's! I'll try not to make my review trite. . . I went to Lola's to meet some yelpers for Happy Hour. I had heard their specials were good and the drinks strong. Apparently the specials vary and there are select martini's and appetizers that are discounted. I went with the chocolate martini and fried butternut squash raviolis. The chocolate martini was pretty good and I could have married those raviolis! Oh and that Â dipping sauce that came with.... YUMMY!. . For round two I ordered the black cherry mojito and our table shared the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was ok but that black cherry mojito was by far, hands down the BEST cocktail I've had in my ENTIRE life!!! It had a boatload of sugar, huge black cherry and mint leaves galore! If I had married the raviolis, I would have committed adultery with the mojito and Tooooootally had an affair with the mojito on the side! . . When are we meeting at Lola's again??? I'm in!
