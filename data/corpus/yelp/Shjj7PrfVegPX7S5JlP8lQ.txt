cute little pizza place in VA highlands. The pizza was kind of thin, but was pretty tasty. Not a cozy place, to say the least, but it is definitely inviting, and they have a pretty large patio. There is some parking, but parking is always an issue in the VA highlands, so, there's that. I would definitely be willing to go back if I am in the mood for pizza and happen to be in the highlands.
