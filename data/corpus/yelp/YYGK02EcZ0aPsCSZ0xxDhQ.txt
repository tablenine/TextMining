No. . . nuh uh... . I still despise deep dish pizza. This joint did not change my mind. Not even my hunger. If I knew ahead of time that we were going here I would have said See Ya! Â Thin, new york style is where it's at. Chicago deep dish is dead to me. For the 3rd time.. . Also I can't believe some jerks on the street recommended this place to my brother when he came here for business. I told him that they probably laughed their asses off after he walked away. That or they're from a suckier neighboring midwestern state like Indiana or some janky ass suburb like skokie thinking this is some wonderous shit. How dare they play a trick like that on my sometimes awesome brother!? you should be ashamed of yourselves. Suggesting sucky ass restaurants to business travelers/tourists is not nice at all.
