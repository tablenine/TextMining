Mariscos, as us locals affectionaly refer to it, has the best fish tacos in town. If you know what I mean. Andithinkyoudo. They are prepared with a complex (adobo) sauce and about 3 pounds of grilled veggies on the side. Seriously, I thought I ordered 2 tacos "a la carte" and out comes a family-sized feast. And it was really cheap! The veggies were great left over, and it's really colorful and loud w/out being too overwhelming. Be ye forewarned, though, the special Red Snapper Veracruz-style comes WHOLE. Like the head and everything... much to the dismay of one stuffy blonde chick on "Check, Please."
