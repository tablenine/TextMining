This is the cheesiest place ever! The food was very bad! The magic almost as bad and the whole thing was a joke! I went only because a friend had reservations and I had never been before. I would never go back not even for free. A much better place is right next door...Yamashiro's Â the food is pretty good and the view is great! Try this place instead!
