The Tom Yum Soup was not very fresh at all (freshness is key for me). The pad see ew was very spicy (per my request) but fell a bit short of the expectations I had reading reviews prior. The prices were reasonable, and the wait staff was attentive however the ambiance was nothing special and lacked any whole in the wall charm that might have been its saving grace. Â I would be willing to eat here again if a group was set on it, but it is not a first choice in my book.
