Restaurant: Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant
Category: Chinese
It's never too late to celebrate.  Not too long ago, my good buddy and Yelp friend, Daniel L., surprised me with a late birthday celebration dinner at Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant.  The late celebration is due, in part, to the fact that he lives north of the Los Angeles area.  Nevertheless, the surprise dining experience at Newport was certainly worthwhile and I'm most appreciative.  . . As we walked in, we encountered the largest crabs I'd ever seen in my life, as they were swimming in a large tank.  The gracious staff approached us and immediately escorted us to a table.  We came here on a weeknight and it was quite crowded.  Our waiter, who was very knowledgeable, came within minutes to take our order and was most suggestive.  Dining with Daniel, I knew we were bound to have a plethora of full-flavored dishes.  So, we had everything from lobster, sizzling and savory meats, seasoned spinach, to large bowls of hearty soup.  Never before had I dined with so much food on a table at a restaurant, as Newport gives very generous portions.  In addition to our dining experience, the ambiance was most intriguing as well.  From the cloth-covered tables, which were mostly filled with families, to the Asian influenced décor, this restaurant certainly deserves its fame.  Also, since we were stuffed from eating so much food, the curtain call to our meal was the well-liked boba drinks, which were quite refreshing, as they're made with real fruit.. . Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant has certainly proved their fierce devotion to serving quality food and creating a welcoming and family-oriented dining environment.  Dining in good restaurants, such as Newport, fails to get old.  I certainly enjoyed my meal here and highly recommend this restaurant to all.
