i was skeptical after reading some of the reviews however, i was pleasantly surprised. Maybe, i liked it so much because i was in the mood for a burger vs a beer (which they cannot serve as they do not have their liquor license yet)! Â the food was delicious, really good menu and great outdoor seating area. A great addition to the neighborhood!
