My group of five was able to score a table outside, which was great and the food and service was good.  As many people have mentioned, their pancakes are ridiculously large and they have a wide variety to choose from.  I am a coffee everyday person and their French press standard at the table was excellent.. . If I had a complaint it would be the bathroom.  This place definitely seems to be a post-hangover joint and the bathroom on the day I went proved that.
