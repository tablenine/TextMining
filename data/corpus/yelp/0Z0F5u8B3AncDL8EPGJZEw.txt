The pancakes are larger than my head! Maybe a slight exaggeration...but the portions are HUGE! Good prices and good food to boot make it one of my favorite places for breakfast food. The waffles and the potatoes are good. The waits are insane so I prefer to get seated quickly and get my food in about 10 minutes. Which is why the best time to go is in the afternoon. . . Randomly, we saw Eva from ANTM.
