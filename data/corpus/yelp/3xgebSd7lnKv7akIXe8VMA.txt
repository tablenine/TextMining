I have been here a few times, and I generally like how quiet and dark it can be... This last time was a little different, eating close to the bar where we got an eye-full of ex-whitehats and their skanky girls dancing to crap music. Real nice entertainment for the burger that I had ordered.. . The burger itself was nicely cooked, a tasty medium rare. I can't stand going to places where the grill guy can't time out the cooking to order. What's the point of specifying otherwise?. . The onion rings were decent as well. Nothing to write home about, but whatever.. . I think the highlight of the night was the fact that I was able to spend time with Shelli and our friends as it was Tulie's birthday! Woo hoo!!!
