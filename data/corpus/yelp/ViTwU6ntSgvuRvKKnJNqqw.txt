Restaurant: SinBala Restaurant
Category: Taiwanese
Real Taiwanese people will say this place is garbage. Food in Taiwan is nothing close to this. This restaurant is aimed towards the younger crowd and obviously they've never had actual good Taiwanese food before. If you want better tasting Taiwanese food, you should go to May's Cafe instead. Funny thing is one of Â the guys that worked at May's is now working in Sin Bala. Not sure why though. LOL!
