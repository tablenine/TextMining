Restaurant: Real Food Daily
Category: Vegetarian
Solid everyday vegan food.  This is like the CPK or Cheesecake Factory of vegan food.  Reliable tasty food.  (Okay, it's a lot better than CPK or Cheesecake Factory ~ (I lie - I've never eaten a meal at Cheesecake Factory))  . . This is a nice place to go with a group of friends, by yourself, or with a date.  They really do make great "daily" food.  It reminds me of what a thrifty mom would make.  Everything good - nothing too fancy.  (this is the best sit down  vegan restaurant in LA i've been to - Millenium in SF has the next level up of vegan fine dining). . The prices might be a little beyond daily for many dishes, but it's definitely a repeat visit restaurant - the menu is extensive and the specials are always great.  The menu ranges from truly basic food - a plate of brown rice, vegetables, and beans, with a sauce of choice  - to more innovative specials and a vegan wine list.. . They also label things as gluten free for those with allergies.. . Supposedly, you can see celebrities here having dinner.  People like Tobey Maguire and Gweneth Paltrow among others that I would probably not notice if Tobey Maguire was there.. . One of the reasons I love LA!  (Let's not get carried away... there's still smog + traffic)
