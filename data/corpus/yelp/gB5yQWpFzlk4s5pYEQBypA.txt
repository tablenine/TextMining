Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
I had been to David Burke before for brunch (which was also very tasty) but never for dinner until Restaurant Week. . . To keep it short, the ambiance is comfortable, the service was excellent, the special Restaurant Week menu was diverse and the food was good. . . What made this visit review worthy? Josh, the General Manager, stopped by our table twice throughout our meal which was a nice touch. Once to check in on us and secondly to see if we wanted a tour of the aging room where they age all of the meat. While it was no longer than a 5 minute tour it was a perk that made the visit that much more worthwhile. Now whether or not that was a tactic to turn over the table is up for debate but regardless it was a unique experience.. . Cheers.
