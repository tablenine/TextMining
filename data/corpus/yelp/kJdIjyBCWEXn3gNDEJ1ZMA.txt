Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
it comes down to de gustibus blah blah. . unfortunately, pizza sucked, shortly. i was expecting a true culinary experience.. . restaurant was cozy and clean, noise level is low, appetizers were interesting and generously portioned, wine and beer list well chosen, but man...pizza sucked. thin and boring. yup they do use fresh ingredients and they drape prosciutto and mozzarella over the baked pie, nice touch, but still..it's a cracker thin appetizer. just ain't Â sooooo good and it's overpriced for the anorexic portion.. . i noticed that there were too many employees wondering around and looking at guests. . next time i will try the osteria, it sounds like a better option for me.. . valet station takes credit cards, so no need to panic and look for atm.
