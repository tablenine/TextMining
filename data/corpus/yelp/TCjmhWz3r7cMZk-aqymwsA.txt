I can only see this place as being great for a group outing, where with 5 or so friends, you revel in the bombardment of meat--- garlic beef, bacon covered steak, chicken, sirloin, filet mignon, rib eye... it almost feels like a beef tasting, where you are allowed to experience a little of each, and taste and compare right away what type of meats you like.  I understood a little bit what is top cut and stuff, but here, you could actually prove to yourself, yeah, I do like sirloin over mignon.  And I like the group dynamic because only through that trash talking and peer pressure could I push myself to the very limit of my stomach in eating all that meat.  I think I was better for it, as I tried everything, and was very satisfied.  Oh, there was some cheese bread and a GIANT salad bar, but I'm not sure how much I ate of that.. . But yeah, for $50/person, I don't recommend as a date place since you're not going to get your money's worth with your sweetie.  Well, I could be stereotypical, but yeah, go with a group and eat essentially a baby cow.
