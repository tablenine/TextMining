Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I was disappointed that they didn't have bacon there - but that's ok. This is just one of those places that does about 5 things, does them well, and you can't get it any other way.. . I got the hickory burger (really good), the fries (so so...I hate fries that (1) have no salt and (2) aren't greasy enough for the salt I sprinkle on them to stick). The apple pie was good, though I wish it had been hotter. The place also didn't seem the cleanest.. . But it was good, I'd go back, and when I do, I'll update my review if there are any changes.
