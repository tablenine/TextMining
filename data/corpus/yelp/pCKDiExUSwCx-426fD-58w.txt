Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I hadnt been here in awhile, but had to pick up a freind at LAX a couple weeks ago and realized I was going to be only a few miles from Johnnie Â Pastrami. The home made pickles they bring you while you're waiting are the best. I brought my son along because I've told him about the place but have never brought him. He loved it but I cant understand why he didnt order Pastrami! Sometimes I cant figure this kid out.
