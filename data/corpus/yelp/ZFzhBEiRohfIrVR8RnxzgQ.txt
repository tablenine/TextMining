The Office burger was pretty good. Nice blend of arugula with blue cheese and .. other ingredients that I can't remember. I don't have a particularly refined taste sense, but I found the combination pretty good. I never order my burgers rare or medium rare, always well done for me and it was still juicy. The sweet potato fries are also awesome and I didn't mind the no ketchup policy, I eat my fries plain anyway. I am not sure if I'd go back just for the food though as I'm not sure I like the whole ordering food at the bar deal and I can't quite justify to myself paying $12 for a burger, but it does look like a nice place to grab some fine beers and chat with friends.
