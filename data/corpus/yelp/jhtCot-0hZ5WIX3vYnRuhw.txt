The main entrance takes you to a small counter with a few seats.  The setup is delicatessen-style.  The refrigerated case showcases the many varieties of sausages.  VERY interesting proteins - rabbit, buffalo, alligator, rattlesnake.  I plan to find the courage within so I can eventually try the rattlesnake.  I don't know 'bout you, but that sounds like some pretty crazy stuff!  On my visit, I chose the duck and bacon with jalapenos.  Oddly, they ran out of onions so my only topping were the sweet peppers.  Of course, we had to order the fries with ranch and chipotle aioli dips.  After placing our order at the counter, we walked down the long hall to the main dining area and scored a nice table alongside the wall.  There are plenty of communal tables and a decent DJ spinning tunes.  Decided on a glass of Gruner Veltliner instead of beer to accompany my duck sausage.  This late-night meal was simply amazing.  I will definitely be back...and eventually order that rattlesnake sausage!
