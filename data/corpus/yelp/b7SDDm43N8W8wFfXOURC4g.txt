My favorite pizza place in the city.  I always take out of towners here for something a little different.  It's cash only and expect a wait if you come here during "peak" times.  I would suggest splitting a pizza (1/2 pounder), and getting a salad and the bread to start with.  The bread and salad are amazing and must try, and the pizza you can't miss, but won't finish if you are sharing the bread and salad.  The salad dressing is amazing, and the seasoning they put on the bread is great (they sell it too).  Buy some seasoning and add it to a frozen cheap plain cheese pizza...you'll thank me.  . . This place is in my top five.
