My husband and I came here one night and got in just as they were opening, and we sat at the cheese bar.  Everything was amazing, and that includes service.  . . We made the reservation a month in advance, and went with friends for my birthday.  I had a grapefruit cocktail that made me want to start weeping, it was so good.  We ordered some appetizers, (figs and octopus) as well as a bunch of mozzerella dishes to share, and everything was amazing!  We only ordered antipasti and primi, so I am not sure how everything else is. . .but what we tasted was so amazing that I am not sure I can ever venture beyond.  . . We were a big party, and kind of loud, but the service was spectacular the entire time.  I am already planning another even where I can go back. . .awesome awesome.  I want to take Nancy Silverton home. . .but I don't  think she'll go.  Sigh.
