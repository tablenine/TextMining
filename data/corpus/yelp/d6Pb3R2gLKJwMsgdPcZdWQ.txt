Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
I was visiting Chicago a few weeks ago and we were looking for some cheap drafts and ice cold tequila shots, when my friend dragged us to Pops.. . One star immediately for ambiance. The place tries to be cool, and it succeeds fairly well. Add another star for getting a table for 4 with no wait on a Friday night around 11:30 PM. But after looking at the menu, we all felt about a big as the size of our wallets. So we ordered a round of Stellas. Yep beer at a champagne lounge, I think the waitress gave us a death glare. Minus one star for the waitress.. . Then it happened. Vince Vaughn walked in with a small entourage and grabbed a booth across from us. I'm not a huge celebrity stalker nor a die hard Vaughn fan, but this is exciting stuff. Plus two stars for giving me a good story to tell.. . Now we had to look cool so we ordered a bottle of champagne. At $37 bones it was probably the cheapest on the menu. And even though it didn't exactly compliment the Stella I was still trying to finish, it was pretty tasty and the combination kept my buzz going.
