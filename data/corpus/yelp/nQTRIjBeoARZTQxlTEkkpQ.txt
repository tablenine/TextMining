fresh off the plane from nyc, my bro-in-law suggested we grab burgers, In &amp; Out, which you can't get out east..  i'm always down for an In &amp; Out burger (i just like saying animal style!!) but i thought of the Oinkster, a place i'd been once before and which had impressed me with their burger and especially their Ube (taro) shake.. i immediately started to crave the shake at the mere thought of this place and it was decided we'd head over there since it was close to home.. and wanting my bro to have a tasty first meal in l.a., i was confident the Oinkster would deliver.. . . .. and it DID.. we all had cheeseburgers and split a large order of belgian fries.. there was orange lemonaide, there was beer, there were smiles and of course the Ube shake, which was even thicker and more delicious than i remembered.. oh... my... gaa...!!  my bro took a sip and pondering the taste, he said "mmmm, it reminds me of childhood", which i thought was the funniest thing.. but yah, something that good will take you back to fond childhood memories and i'd be happy to go back any time.. to childhood and to the Oinkster.. i've still yet to try the other items on the menu, like the pulled pork sandwich and the pastrami.. so, looks like another trip is called for so that i can write an update.. happy to oblige ;)
