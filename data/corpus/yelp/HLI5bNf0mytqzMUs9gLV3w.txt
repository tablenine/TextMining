Savoy Kitchen is just fantastic eats. Very Very consistent in its food and service. love the outdoor seating as well as the bar for quick single lunches. Take out service is good as well (good sturdy boxes). Hainan chicken is the house special, it comes almost fully deboned which is nice. Rice is perfect every single time and the sauces are just right. They have perfected this dish to the nines. Â Everything else is good too! escargot is always yummy and try the chrysanthemum tea, but the ice tea is good too... especially since it is served with simple syrup. Hands down best for great food, speed, flavor and price.
