I had the burger at Holeman and Finch as usual.  I wanted to dress that bitch up and snuggle with it - yes it was that tasty.  So with that as a benchmark on Friday.... I went to Flip for a comparison on Saturday.. . Swooped in around 10:55 to get a last minute bite.  Ordered a butcher's cut and a nutella milkshake to fully test out the operation now that it's been a minute since opening night (my last visit).  . . Let's just cut to the chase and get this over with.  Has any of you ever played Street Fighter II?  remember Zangief and the 360 pile driver?  No?  Hmm.. ok... ladies... how about Oprah and James Frey?  Remember that one?  What about the other night when Brett Michaels walked into the stage prop at the Tony awards and got dropped like a sack of potatoes.  Or ... or... shit it's too early for me to go on like this.  Anyway, hopefully you get the picture.  . . The flip burger was just aight - the bun was too much, the patty too small, and just no flavors that really jumped out at me.  I think I was mostly overwhelmed by the blue cheese.  The patty was slightly overcooked from my medium rare, but at least they didn't totally hose it like Vortex did last time.. . Nutella milkshake.... eh.  I couldn't taste the nutella.  It was a chocolate shake.  Really sweet - didn't do a whole bunch for me.  Not for 7 dolla. . . Otherwise, not much to note.  I think I was in and out in like 15 minutes. Given the location and experience, I just don't think I'd go back here.  Probably a 3.5 - but just not feeling this place.  and you can tell because I'm not cussing my ass off.
