Ok, overlook the fact that upon arrival there is no hostess, waiting area, or seating organization what-so-ever. This usually puts people off, but be patient- it pays off i promise! Flag someone down, give them your name, and turn around and go back outside. Then, pop back in every so often, and one of the times they will decide to wave you over towards a table. The method? Who knows. Ive never had to wait too long. . . The sushi is spectacular. Good luck getting the whole thing in your mouth as they are the size of hockey pucks. The Godzilla roll is mandatory, and the Unagi is delish as well. And mmm, the Crab Rangoon. . . The price is what gives this place 5 stars. Its BYOB and I never walk out of this place more than $25 in the hole. Well spent! . . Ill be going to this place as long as they remain cheap, awesome, and unorganized =) Hey it makes the place.
