Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
My boyfriend brought me here on a mini vacation to SoCal.  I don't remember how we decided to come to Lawry's, but we heard that it was similar to House of Prime Rib, our favorite prime rib restaurant.. . Funny enough.... Thomas "This place is kind of like a place we have in San Francisco". Our waiter "House of prime rib right? Yeah, that place copied us.". . HAHA, okay maybe he's just being a loyal Lawry's worker or maybe House of Prime Rib really did copy... but who knows.  Both restaurants are great.  I loveddddd the Lawry's in Beverly Hills.  It is HUGE! With a huge dining area, a bar, big halls, even a big separate waiting room with sofas.  Luckily we made reservations because the halls and waiting room were CROWDED!. . Just like at House of Prime Rib, my boyfriend got the biggest cut, and I got the small ones.  But THIS TIME... I had the option to add TWO lobster tails to it.  The prime rib was and the lobster tail was DELICIOUS! The lobster tails weren't huge or anything but it was plump and succulent.  Since it came with two, I offered one to my boyfriend, which he ate immediately while I was saving mine for after my prime rib.  A little later, I ate of my tail and I saw my boyfriend eye-balling it.  Out of pureeee politeness, I asked if he wanted it.  He was suppose to say "no, it's okay" but NOOOOOOO! He said YES and took his fork and took the rest of my lobster tail! . . Too bad there isn't a Lawry's anywhere near the east bay or else I would definitely come back and HOG ALL THE LOBSTER TAIL TO MYSELF!
