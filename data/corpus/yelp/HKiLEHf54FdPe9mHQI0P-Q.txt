My interest was peaked when I heard that you had to check the internet to see where Kogi is.  And according to said internet...IT'S GOOD.. . My friends and I tried it tonight.  We all got the Short Rib burritos.  In retrospect we probably should have all gotten something different.  The burrito was tasty and filled with juicy ribs...and other stuff.  No rice though.  . . There were a lot of people around but it wasn't crowded.  Also a dude with a camera and a single light was there.  I don't know why.  Everyone else but us got the sliders so I'm thinking that must be a popular item I need to try next time.  . . Kogi put me in such a good mood that I gave a homeless man half of my $1.50 coke.. . Cons:  no rice in burritos, has possibility of being far from my house, and $1.50 cans of coke.
