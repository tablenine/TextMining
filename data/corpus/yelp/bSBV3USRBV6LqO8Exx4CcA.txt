Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Call me crazy but I love it here!  People were saying it was too much meat and they weren't such a great meat lover to begin with!  So why did you come here?!  Hahaha, I think this place is heaven for meat lovers such as myself!. . Mina T. came to visit and she loves Manna so of course we had to go here!  It was my first time at Manna but not my first at ayce korean bbq!  It was so good for $22 a person including tip, tax and a soda!  . . The meats came out really quickly and all the little side dishes were all great!  It was also pretty good quality meat as well, I thought they were going to be the all frozen hard kind like the ones you find at mongolian bbq places but they actually had the non frozen ones and it was also very well marinated.  . . The only thing I was a little sad about was the sesame salty dipping sauce.  I wish it had a little more kick to it!  It was pretty light compared to other ones I had.. . Also they didn't have galbi which is one of my favorite meats!!!  Out of all the meats, I liked the short ribs.
