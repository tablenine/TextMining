You know a restaurant is good when there is a line forming before it opens.  So my friends and I decide to here on a Saturday for lunch; we got there well before this place opened (knowing they are always crowded) and there was a line forming right in front of the place.  We insisted on waiting in line and eventually got in after the first patch of satisfying customers left.  I ordered an eel bowl instead of the ramen.  Although a bit pricey, it is worth every penny.  The eel bowl also came with the most delicious side salad ever, a bowl of shredded lettuce with perfectly complimenting concoction of dressing, sweet, tangy and creamy in every bite or veggies.  Now on to the eel bowl,  on top of a bed of rice, a mountain of eel in some eel sauce.  They made sure I got a bite of eel with every bite of rice.  For people who are not fond of seafood, there's Daikokuya's famous rich pork bone ramen, fried rice, and sashimi bowl.  Even though the food is good, the place is tin, packed, and HOT.  I guess they're trying to have this authentic Japanese steamy restaurant ramen atmosphere...BUT with good food, I don't think most people even notice these flaws.. . -Out of Five-. Revisit value- 5. Taste-5. Satisfaction-4
