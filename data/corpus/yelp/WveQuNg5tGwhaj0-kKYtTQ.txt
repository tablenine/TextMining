I'm craving it as I'm writing this review.  We went to Cemitas Puebla because I saw it on the Food Network's show Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives....and the food was unbelievable.  Probably the best tacos in the city.  Everything you order in this joint is guaranteed to be amazing and the staff is SOOO friendly.  Only thing to note for the ladies is that you come out of there smelling like food....so make sure you schedule your hair washing days accordingly.
