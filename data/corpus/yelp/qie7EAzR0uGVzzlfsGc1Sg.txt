Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
three girls with HUGE appetites (and I mean HUGE) ordered two #1's, a side of mac and cheese and a side of grits, and could not finish it all. . That's how large the portions are. . I'm not a huge fan of chicken in general, but this chicken was great. I thought the waffles were okay - the chicken was the main event. . Props for the real mac and cheese. I am always a fan of grits. . I need to return to try more things.
