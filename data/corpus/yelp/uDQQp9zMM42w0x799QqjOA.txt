Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
After the longest 45 minutes of my life, I sat at the bar eagerly awaiting my first Pizzeria Mozza meal.  Started with the ricotta squash blossoms, perfectly fried, not at all greasy but it seemed a little bland to me.  The roasted bone marrow was eyes-roll-to-the-back-of-your-head good.  The grilled bread, roasted garlic cloves, parsley and flaky salt created the perfect combination of flavors.  The bianco pizza with sausage and fried sage leaves was fantastic except for the crazy amount of grease that pooled at the bottom of my plate.  Don't get me wrong, I love pizza grease but we're talking a "crazy" amount here.  Sadly, I was too full to try the butterscotch budino.  . . Note, our bartender Shawn was awesome.  He recommended a great wine and he was just cool like that :)
