Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's is in a way like most of the popular clubs in LA, there's a super long line up that you'll be stuck in for well over an hour if you get there when it's busy (which is... all the time), and most of the people going there are trying to get a wiener into a bodily opening.. . Our hero had a surprisingly scrumptious and super sized "America the Beautiful" dog that was a foot long and loaded with pastrami, bacon, and tomatoes on a bed of chopped lettuce (see business photos for the length comparison picture).  Funny enough, the name of the hot dog that appeared on the receipt was "American Beauty", which definitely makes it deserving of an Academy award from the hundreds of celebrities whose signed photos adorn Pink's walls.. . Even though the long wait is part of the "experience" of Pink's, it's quite an opportunity cost for a meal.  Instead of waiting in line for over 90 minutes, our hero could have worked in that time and bought enough hot dogs with the money he earned to throw a sausage party for all of his friends.  Hooray!. . PROS:. - Quite possibly the most famous hot dog stand in the entire world.. - Really great hot dogs that will surely leave you wanting more.. - Open until 3 AM on the weekends.. . CONS:. - Parking in their lot is always full.. - Ridiculously long queues for food.. - They lost to Bobby Flay on his Throwdown show on Food Network.  Bah!
