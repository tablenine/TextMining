Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
The restaurant is pretty chic with its dramatic Hollywood flair.  Dim lighting, and red overtones with upbeat, jazzy music created a very nice ambience.  And the menu looked fantastic.. . I ordered calamari frites and rigatoni bolognese.  My sister had the special: halibut.  The calamari was perfectly crisp and juicy, and was nicely balanced with the tangy aioli.  However, our entrees were....eh.  They were good, just not GREAT.  I've had better rigatoni at other restaurants.  And my sister's halibut was really dry.
