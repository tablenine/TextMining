Lord.. Terrible Terrible Oyster Rockefeller.. there was so much cheese and spinach and a quarter size dried shrunken oyster.. I had to Tabascos sauce it like mad to enjoy it. My lobster bisque was not as thick as what I am used to and you could barely taste the lobster, it tasted more like shredded pieces of crab, sorry whatever people think, the bisque is suppose to be creamy,rich, and a heart attack happiness in a bowl. . My friend ordered the garlic shrimp that was suppose to be 1 pound, it came out in alittle bowl size of a cereal or salad bowl, and it tasted like cheap frozen salad shrimps tossed in a garlic butter mish mash. The waitress service was terrible, our waitress was not in the mood to work, but rather chatted up a storm with her friends. I asked for a glass for my overpriced Sam Adams.. and never got one. Will I come back? Maybe to try the lobster roll.. but for now I am VERY unimpressed with the seafood spread I tried. Made me mad I had to put down 20.00 bucks for crap.. I would have had to much food somewhere else, and be satisfied.. like at a Taco Bell perhaps. Oh the place was also really cheap on the AC.. it was getting a little warm in there.
