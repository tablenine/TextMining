great location. the foods decent for the after 2 am set. i past out at there table, the waitress got scared and wanted to get me help. i was just resting my eyes. so i would think they would be used to stuff likes this (so i knocked a point). but gave it back since they are 24 hours. parking is also a bitch but you can park at the post office across the street as long as its after 6pm
