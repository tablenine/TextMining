Great, great, great, great breakfast food. I love coming here for some breakfast chow. Here are some of my favorites. . . "GONE SHRIMPING", which is basically egg whites with shrimp, basil, tomato, scallions, and garlic toast. Healthy, filling, flavorful. Good start to my day.. . "CABALLERO" This has scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, potatoes, green chiles, and chicken chorizo wrapped up in a giant flour tortilla. The chorizo is what makes this breakfast dish special. Its flavor is so powerful that it does not influence this dish subtly. It adds color to the scrambled eggs with its orange oils and makes them so full and rich. The fat in the chorizo coats the eggs, brightening them to a saffron yellow. Its robust flavor and warm, tingly spice gives this dish such a distinctive taste. . . "MOM'S FRENCH TOAST" is very good as well. It's old fashioned buttermilk french toast topped with powdered sugar and whipped butter. So classic.. . "BLACK MAGIC" Ok picture this... Buttermilk flapjacks with an oreo cookie crumb center, topped with oreo cookies and whipped cream. If you order this with milk, I swear you'll be reminded of your childhood.. . Also around Thanksgiving time, they provide a special platter of pancakes with pumpkin filling topped with whipped cream and powdered sugar. it's awesome.. . One of the best parts of this place after the great taste of the food are the portion sizes. The pancakes, french toast, and egg dishes are so big. The egg dishes are probably the only plates that you even have a chance of finishing. Pancakes and french toast, well let's just say I haven't seen it happen yet. It's probably enough breakfast to last you through the week. I shared a pancake dish with my friend once and we only got through a fourth of the entire plate. . . They close at 4pm so get your butt there early!
