I have been wanting to try Milk for a while, being a "meat and potatoes" kinda girl, cookies and milk goes along with that package. I was very pleased. It was a bit hot inside, a little bright with the all white walls, and kinds sterile with all the stainless-steel. The food menu is small, but with many "Urth Caffee" type offerings. I had the ham and cheese and it was quite yummy. The bread was crunchy and toasty and the salad had a great balsamic drizzled all over it. Of course, the very best part was the 6 dollar shake. Vanilla ice cream, chocolate, caramel, and malted ball pieces all topped off with whipped cream and more chocolate and caramel, I was in heaven! I definitely recommend giving a try for a quick casual, yet tasty lunch.
