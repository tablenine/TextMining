barneys is a total college bar. if you're into that, this is a cool place to go but if you're looking for something a little more hip, this is definitely not the place to go to. you will find a majority of the guys here wear flip flops, light colored jeans and college sweatshirts. girls wear pretty much the same attire. it's good if you're looking for a straight bar in west hollywood though. i've been here a few times and have never really been impressed or wanted to go back.
