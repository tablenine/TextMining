Attention pastrami fans: The pastramis are only OK. They are a good serving of pastrami meat but does not give that pepper-salty flavorful pastrami taste that pastrami fans look for. The meat actually tastes like it was soaked in water for a day with little pastrami flavor. In my opinion-it was only OK. Not worth driving out of your way for. . . Now, having said that, the burgers are actually very good. They give you a choice of cheeses that are pretty good and the fries are real fries (which I am a fan of). I will definitely go back to try the other choices on their menu. . I saw that they offer chicken sandwiches, pulled pork and my main target for my next visit will be the "Royale." The Royale is a burger that has pastrami and chili in it and sounds like a great heart attack burger...
