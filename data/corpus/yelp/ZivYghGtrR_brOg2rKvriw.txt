Ohhh man, Ian's Pizza is LEGIT.  The guacamole burrito pizza is so freakin amazing, I've never had anything like it in my life!  The crust is perfectly chewy and has that delightful crunch on the bottom that comes from warming it in the oven after ordering. mmm mmm MMM!!!  Also tried the cheese (yummy) and macaroni &amp; cheese.  I really wasn't blown away by the mac n cheese...it was kinda bland...but I think I'll douse it in hot sauce next time which should do the trick. But you MUST try the guacamole burrito--it's like eating 7 layer dip on top of pizza. Amazing.
