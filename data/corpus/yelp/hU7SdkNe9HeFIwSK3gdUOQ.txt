Restaurant: Opart Thai House Restaurant
Category: Thai
I have a friend who swears by Opart, but I don't know, for me I would rather eat at Spoon Thai.. . The portions are pretty small at Opart, and while the food is good, with so many Thai places in the area, I feel that Opart doesn't really do anything to stand out with respect to its creativity, quality, or tastiness.  Nothing is bad, it's just not as memorable for me as Spoon Thai.  Spring rolls - one of the measures I compare Thai restaurants to each other, were nothing to write home about.  The plum sauce was a little pungent.  Again, not bad, just not terrific.. . There is a nice little liquor store right next door however, a plus as Opart is BYOB.
