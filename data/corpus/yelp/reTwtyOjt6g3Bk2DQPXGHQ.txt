I made reservations seeing as though I think it was the last day of the week to enjoy the National Pizza Week special or deal that they had going on.  We could get two pizzas for $14.  So my friend and I started out with some pretty delicious calamari and had the capone and the pepperoni.  My friend said that her pizza reminded her of Milan.  I liked mine as well.  The butter was really nice and soft here.  Our waiter was very friendly and enthusiastic.  I like places that have specials and good deals where the food is good too.  My friend and I were too stuffed to even have dessert and had 2 slices leftover.
