Once Loyal, now DISGUSTED. . Very inconsistent. I want to like this restaurant. The host is gushing. A few of the waiters are a joy (Chris). The decor is polished and slick. But the food and the service is VERY spotty. I have had 4 star dinners here and I have had 1 star dinners. The last time I ate there was a 1 star occasion and these seem to be the standard for now. Everything was off that night. The bartender did not know how to make a Negroni (didn't even bother to look it up). The Martini olives tasted rancid. The food was not even worth mentioning. Wine was oxidized. Our waiter knew nothing about the wine. "GSM" he said, "Oh sure the time zone..." There are so many times I just wanted to walk out. I was hosting company and friends. I was embarrassed for the restaurant at first and then just downright angry that everything was off. . . I have eaten at this restaurant many times, and now I am not sure that I will ever return, unless I hear from other yelpers and reviewers that they have improved. Good luck One, I'm rooting for you!
