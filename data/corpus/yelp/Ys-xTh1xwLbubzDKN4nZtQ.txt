I recently moved downtown and have been looking for cool hip places to eat that are a little off the beaten path. My Aunt sent me a link to their website and I figured I would go and check it out. Tucked away in the art district downtown, if it wasn't for the line outside the restaurant, more like a line for a club, you would miss it. The sausage has amazing flavor and the beers are to die for! . . If you have not been before, they have an expert at the end of the line to explain the different sausages and what toppings and beers are good to pair with.. . Great vibes, cool people, love the live DJ! Great place to go grab a quick bite to eat before going out and hitting the town!
