Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
Ol' Manny has a split personality... On one side, he's a relaxed, popular brunch spot. The food is familiar, tasty, fairly priced (for the Highlands), and you can even bring your kids. On the other side, he's a chill, low-key bar. Beers are cheap (for the Highlands), smoking is allowed, and there's always someone you know popping in.. . Definitely this is of my favorite walking-distance bars; when I don't feel like working up a sweat, or cranking up my car, or thinking too hard about what I want to drink... Manuel's. Pint o' Fat Tire. Done! While I've heard this is a Democrat bar (no, really, I literally heard the eruption of cheering from Manuel's all the way down North Ave. immediately after Obama was officially elected) I haven't been stoned to death yet, so evidently us Libertarians are welcome too!
