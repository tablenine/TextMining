759 Reviews?!?! . What more can I add? Not much. . My thoughts:. +Dining area wasn't too comfortable. I would have sat outside had it not been so windy.. +Small parking lot.. +I had the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich Combo.. +It was served to me without any BBQ sauce. Huh? I had to ask for it.. +The sandwich was full of meat! It was really succulent and flavorful. A little messy to eat. . +The BBQ sauce really didn't make a difference. I couldn't taste it at all.. +I wasn't expecting much from the fries, but they were really good. Crispy and not oily. Didn't care for the dip that came with it. Just salt is fine for me.. +Food was really good, but won't be an addiction for me. . +This was the first place I have been to that was featured on "Triple D." I don't think it really influence me good or bad.
