If this darling place wasn't slightly overpriced I'd give it four stars.. . lovely pizza, delicious appetizers, good service, exceptionally attentive bartender. mushroom pizza was my favorite.. . horrible earl grey iced tea. bleh bergamot.. . I expect to see beautiful people in Los Angeles, particularly in pricier or trendy places. Â This place seems to get a fair amount of higher income earners but no more beautiful people than anywhere else.
