To say their menu is extensive would be a bit of an understatement! The food menu runs on and on with specialty dishes from every Asian culture. The presentation is visually pleasing as food is served in eccentric, non traditional pieces such as a fried rice in a bamboo "trunk" or pho in a kitchen sink sized bowl (check the window displays!).. . The drink menu like the food menu was boundless except more repetitive. The same drink would be listed in multiple sections with varying differences such as coming with boba or with grass jelly, etc. I ended up ordering a Strawberry and Peach Freeze(?) with green jelly. No idea if that's on the menu but they take verbal orders which negates the menu. I'd advise looking at their fresh fruit inventory and deciding from there.. . I didn't care for the fresh fruit that the smoothie was topped off with but the drink itself was refreshing. My only complaint was the service. They have a take out window outside that's not being utilized which defeats the purpose of having it. You have to order inside at the drink bar where the servers also get drinks for dine in customers. It just created unnecessary confusion between servers and customers on whose drink belong to who and not to mention the back log by the front door.
