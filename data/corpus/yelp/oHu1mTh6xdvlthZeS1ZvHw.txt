I wish I could give four and a half stars.  I really like this place.  Cool but also very good food.  It's got Southern classics but they are all unique and updated for 2007.  I like the atmosophere of this place, e.g. their chocolate cake is not, "The world's best chocolate cake", it's "very good chocolate cake".  And the cake is amazing.  Save room.
