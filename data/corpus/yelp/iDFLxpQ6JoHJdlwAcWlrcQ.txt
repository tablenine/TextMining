First off, my dining experience was much benefitted by the fact that my party got to sit in the big corner table by the windows. We called a little bit before we left the house on a a Friday, and then got there around 7, just as it was filling up. I could see if you arrived later than you might have to wait a bit.. . I ordered a goat cheese and watercrest salad (tasty!) Â and split some salumi and calamari with others. I also tasted a tomato and mozzarella salad, which was really good too. I probably should have stopped eating right then because the salad was huge, but I still ordered an entree, the gnocchi, which was simple, but very good. Also, it wasn't a huge portion to push me over my limit.. . Overall: quality food and a very friendly and helpful host helped make the night very enjoyable.
