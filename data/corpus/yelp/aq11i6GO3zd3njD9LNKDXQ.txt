This place is absolutely awesome....however,  I really would NOT suggest eating here before a night out on the town.  Unless that is, you want to sit in your booth at the club all night and look like you are comatose.  I think the best time to feast at FOGO is early Sunday evening, where you can leisurely stuff yourself with pichana, delicious prime rib, linquica, and bacon wrapped fillets...until your tummy bursts.  Then go home and sleep it off.  JYEA!
