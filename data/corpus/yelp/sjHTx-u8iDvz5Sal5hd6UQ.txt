Great selection of beers. Didn't think they would have on tap my faves Â Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier and the Franziskaner Weissbier. I also had the Delirium. . . Food was ok and service was prompt. . . Only bad thing i noticed was that the half yard was actually only 1 1/3 of a pint because my friend poured his pint into his empty half yard. That just totally made me feel ripped off when ordering the half yard glasses.. . But i will be back again for the happy hour and late night happy hour.
