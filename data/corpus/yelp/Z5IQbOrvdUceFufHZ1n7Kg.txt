Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
I only give three stars because sometimes the service is hit or miss. The food, on the otherhand, is fantastic, and deserves 4 stars. We've had times where we didn't even get greeted for 15 minutes, and there's times where our server is extremely attentive. . . Aside from the serving staff, the ambiance is great on the outside patio. We usually go with a group of friends who love the cheap beers, pitchers of their housemade sangria, and the grilled dishes. The salmon and chicken a la provencial is outstanding with rice a la champignon (if you love garlic and mushrooms this is for you!). Argentine food may sound like a new thing to you, but it's great for all, picky or not.
