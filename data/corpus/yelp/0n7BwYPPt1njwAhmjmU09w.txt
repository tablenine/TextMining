Ok, well, I think everything is overrated and this is no exception!  I have decided to implement a new rule; when everybody seems to be raving over a place, I will not set my expectations high as I will be surely (and sorely) be disappointed.  I was expecting this to be amazing, but it was average at best.  The crust was great, but the rest of the pizza was not striking in any way.  The service was fast, but it was the not the small quaint and warm place I envisioned with warm Italian folks speaking Italian.  Like I said, average at best.  Go to Fellinis.  Or Jac's pizza in Inman Park.  Or order it from Pizza Hut.  They deliver.
