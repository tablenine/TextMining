Another yelp triumph! This is a totally nondescript restaurant front in an obscure location, even given its proximity to j town! I never would have found it.. . You order your meal in a small kitchen at the cashier, grab your number and walk down a long hallway to the main dining area. There are a few long communal wooden tables and benches. I love communal seating. Breaking bread together is how you make friends! The rest of the decor is somewhat lacking. They didn't quite achieve the spartan male-testosterone-beer-and-meat-screw-decor ambiance.. . We ordered off the exotic menu:. Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers was our favorite. Juicy, sweet and tasted great. It didn't have a distinctive flavor but was good.. Duck and Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers. My second favorite because it was full flavored, spicy and rich. Definitely didn't taste like your usual beef/pork/turkey.. Rabbit, Veal and Pork Seasoned with White Wine was very good. The girlie sausage: surprisingly delicate and sweet. Tasted like a really good pork sausage. Couldn't identify the rabbit. . Alligator and Pork, Smoked Andouille Sausage tasted like beef and was dry. I did like how the smoky spicy flavors sang through.. . Belgian fries: thick cut fries double dipped, fried, coated in white truffle oil glaze with bleu cheese walnut and bacon dressing. Fried potatoes tossed in oil and doused in a sauce made from three kinds of fats. I think these fries slid down my throat! The dressing itself was amazing.. . 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.
