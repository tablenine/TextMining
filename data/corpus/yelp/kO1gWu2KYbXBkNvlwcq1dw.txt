This place is my hand's down favorite.  They serve two type's of salsa with the chips, the darker is the most addicting thing, smoky, sweet and spicy.  I'd go there for this salsa alone.  Just about everything I've ordered comes with a huge plate of fresh and tasty vegetables which helps offset the wonderfully delicious fried, grilled or marinated whatever you're eating.
