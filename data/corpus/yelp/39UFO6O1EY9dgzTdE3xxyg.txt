Restaurant: Kevin Rathbun Steak
Category: Steakhouses
Food: 5 stars. Service: 3 stars. . Food:. Ahi Poke is one of the best dishes I've ever eaten--that alone would make a return trip worth it. The lobster bisque was horrid (broken, gritty texture and burnt aftertaste), but they unquestioningly replaced it with a decent butternut squash soup. The dry aged porterhouse for 2 was perfectly cooked and goes in the top 3 steaks we've had. The scalloped sweet potatoes were the standout of the side dishes we tried. The jalapeno creamed corn would probably be far better in the summer, when corn is in season. I hope they don't use as much cream in it then and let the flavor of the corn come through more. The creamed spinach was acceptable, but nothing I'd order again. We split sticky toffee pudding for dessert, which was fine, but the vanilla ice cream that accompanied it was amazing.. . Service:. Our server was affable and made some good recommendations. However, our drinks were often empty, which shouldn't happen in a restaurant of this caliber. She handled the bisque issue professionally, and then we overheard her gently warning other people against the soup (so why serve it at all?).. . It was great to see Kevin Rathbun himself there, overseeing the expedition of plates. Though I assume he didn't try the bisque before it was served!. . Overall, I'd probably give it a 4.5 if that were an option, but it was more of a 5 star experience than a 4 star. The food and atmosphere made it significantly superior to Bones and Chops, though the service could use some of their polish.. . And I agree with some other reviewers that the $2 parking fee (with TIP NOT INCLUDED clearly marked on the sign) is odd given the neighborhood and location of the parking lot.
