Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
If you are looking for a great piece of Prime Rib with an old fashion feel to it then this is the place to go.. Forget hip, cool or whatever floats the world of popular restaurants these days.. There is something wonderful about good old fashioned service with a smile and it smells amazing the moment you set foot inside.. How could I ever give up red meat when I know there is a place like this in town? . Yorkshire Pudding?  Well it's an experience all on it's own.  Just got to have it.. Desserts?  The kind that bring back memories of your parents childhood.  Apple pie and ice-cream sundaes.  Yum Yum
