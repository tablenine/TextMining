Like the overall atmosphere of the place. Nicer seating on the inside, but it can get a little loud at times with all the people around you. There's a nice little bar on the side where you can order drinks while waiting to be seated. The food takes quite a while to prepare and get to your table, so you should get a side dish, wine and someone that you can carry a conversation with....otherwise it'll be an awkward night. I recommend the Beef Tartare and a good wine of your choice. I prefer a Merlot because that's the first thing I think of, but I won't tell you how to choose a wine because you probablly have your own favorite. As a main dish I usually go with the Kurobuta Pork Chops because it has never disappointed me.
