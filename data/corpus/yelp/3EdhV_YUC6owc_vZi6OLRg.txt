Restaurant: LA Mill Coffee Boutique
Category: Desserts
Now, I'm not one to incite class-warfare, but LA MILL is such a middle finger to the spirit of this neighborhood. The pretension oozes from the walls (and the ceilings...brass chandeliers?). The robotic staff are forced to wear crisp, black button down shirts, and you will be ridiculed if you ask for something as common as a "cup of coffee." Isn't this a coffee house? Do I really need to look through a 10 page leather bound book to choose my brew? And the food menu..... $16 is too much for a panini anywhere, but again taking geography into consideration this is an insult (even though one of the robots explained that the prosciutto panini will "drape my tongue in velvet"). A $12 cup of potato leek soup? Again, 2-3 times what any cup of soup at a coffee house could ever be worth, unless your car is being washed while you're enjoying it.. . This place literally looks like it was airlifted by helicopters from West Hollywood or Beverly Hills and dropped down on an unsuspecting neighborhood in the dead of night. Is it any coincidence that Back door's last weekend coincided with LA MILLS opening? Backdoor reflected the genuine heart and soul of the area, and asked fair prices for honest cafe goods. But so long as people are willing to pay $4-8 for 8 ounces of thick, over roasted brew, I imagine this place will thrive. By 2010, Spaceland will be a Fred Segal and Leela Thai will be a Grand Havana Room. This is a sad day for the locals.
