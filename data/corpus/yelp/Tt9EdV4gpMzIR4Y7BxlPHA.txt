Uh , do not believe the HYPE !. . OVER PRICED . Grumpy server .Everything is "extra" (ie: fries , onion rings , salad ) . Small burger on a BIG square plate came to the table lookin' lonely and well, kinda pathetic. Burger size was just enough .. . Perhaps to accompany the burger , a (free) side like a little salad or something? a free pickle? a chip ?cole slaw? At the very LEAST  for presentation purposes ? I mean C'mon guys ! A bag of Russet Potatoes is like 4bux ! Throw in some fries !. . $3 for a "real " Mexican coke? Give me a break !  Growing upin Echo Park ( yes , PRE-HIPSTER ) the "real " coke was in every corner store, no big deal . I guess it probably IS a BFD if you did'nt grow up in a diverse part of the city . So get your $3 "real"coke on Or go to La Guadalupana and get a six pack for slightly a little more !. . It's funny watching people drinking from the "real coke" bottles looking around. When did a Coke become so hip ? really ?that is some FUNNY shit ! . .  1/2 star for the good burger meat and the remaining stars to the BEER  !. . I guess it WOULD be the best burger joint in town , if all the other ones had closed, got swept away by a flash flood  or burned down or something. . . Trying waaaaaay too hard ............................. .. What a mediocre place .. Cheers.. (Review was for Sunset location )
