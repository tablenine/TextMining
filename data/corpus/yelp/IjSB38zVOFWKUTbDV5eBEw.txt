The reality lives up to the hype. Ordered #19 (their recommended classic) with cole slaw and Russian dressing...sublime. The place does look like it's straight outta the 1970s, but this is no theme it's the real deal. Kevin (our waiter) was such a pleasure to have, in fact he's been there for 10 years and it shows...career waiters usually go above and beyond and he was no exception. . . Be sure to park at 7th &amp; Westlake. It's Langer's lot they validate free for an hour. The area it's in could be a little shady but it's worth it. The menu is huge, prices are decent, portions are massive, and it's as authentic as it gets.
