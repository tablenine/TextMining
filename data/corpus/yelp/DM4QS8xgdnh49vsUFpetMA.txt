Two words for you.... FOOD POISONING!!!!. . yeah that sums up my last trip to canters... ruined my whole weekend, making me pray to the porcelain gods after spending $15 on some food that was just gross.  my body won't even let me consider going back to this place.. . My first couple of times i had the thanksgiving dinner and it was really good.   turkey in the spring time, turkey in july how awesome... too bad this last time ruined this place for me.. . Side note, every time i've been here i've seen rodney on the rocks eating in the corner under the stairs... it must be his booth or something
