Met up with friends I had not seen in a while and Carroll St. Cafe was a great place to hang out for a few hours and catch up.  The perfect laid-back vibe made us feel comfortable and not rushed.  We never had the feeling we were keeping them from turning the table.. . Food was all tasty - great mussels, steak salad, creative cocktails (loved  the cucumber one).  Tapas menu looked good as well - will have to make it back during the week for their specials.. . Parking can be challenging in the neighborhood but lots of street parking is available - practice your parallel parking before you go.. . Don't go for the food alone - it's the location, atmosphere, staff and menu that work together to make it a great spot overall.
