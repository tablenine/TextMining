Solely comparing this to other ramen joints, its a five star rating.  I've never been to Japan (go ahead and discredit me!), but I would like to believe its similar.. . The wait can be gruesome, so go early.  Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone when ordering, nothing here is that bizarre.  Most of the foods have subtle flavors.
