Category: Sushi Bars
My first experience here was with a couple of friends back in 2008 to hit up their lunch specials in the dining room section of the restaurant. I remember the meal being good but nothing extraordinary. Fast forward 2 years and my parents invite me to lunch here - except this time, it's at the sushi bar. My life, is forever changed... . I can't remember all the Japanese names for the sushi we ordered but let me try:. . Toro . Amaebi (Raw shrimp). Engawa - I loved this here, I had two orders. Hirame . Hamachi. Uni. . Bottom line:  Lunch for the three of us, ordering sushi a la carte (no alcohol), set us back $180 inc tax and tip.  What I learned? That in all my years, I never had proper sushi until that afternoon.
