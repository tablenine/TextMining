This place is so hip it makes me nauseous. The coffee and tea selection is great, but the excessively hip and snobby wait staff and management kills it for me. It even has good atmosphere, but still, 2 stars overall. Rediculously expensive. Ice cream is $8-9 for 2 small scoops. Tea is way overpriced, coffee is even worse. Tastes pretty good tho. I will return when I want to show out-of-towners a snobby and excessively expensive coffee shop.
