Why is this place so mysterious? The mystery to me is why anyone spends this much money to see some vegas-quality magic and are forced to pay a kings ransom for mediocre-at-best food! Didn't I already pay $20 to get in plus $7 to park? Why is a steak $39? Is it marinated in gold? Is it a MAGIC steak? I'll admit that I had a good time with my friends, but rest assured I'll be getting the bare minimum as far as food goes if I return. I guess you pay for the exclusivity of going. I am currently the envy of everyone at my job, even if I'm broke!
