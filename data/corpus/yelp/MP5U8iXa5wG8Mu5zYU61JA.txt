We went here Friday night for a late dinner and I'm upset I haven't been here before...  Just moved to Logan Square/Bucktown and I'm so happy to have this gem in my hood and a place of this caliber.... . I have had dreams of my pannine all arabiatta!  This was possibly one of the best pastas I've ever had.  EVER.  (And I've been to Italy).  The textures in the pasta made for a little party in my mouth with every bite.  Not as spicy as other arabiattas, but VERY garlicky - so watch out if that is not your thing.... . Hubby had some veal dish (I'm not impressed with his selection, but that could be due to my vegetarian beliefs).. . Totally appreciate the wine prices.  $5 for a glass!  That is unheard of and entrees started at $9.50, if I'm remembering correctly...  . . Such a welcoming and "accessible" place.  People were dressed in shorts, dresses, jeans, heels, and sandals.  The man behind the bar (the owner?) and his group he was entertaining gave us a cheery and thankful goodnight.  Did I mention the service?  Attentive, but not pushy and we had a few people helping us.. . Go, go go!  To Buona Terra!
