Went here for dinner the other night. Made reservations online.  I only give this place 4 stars for atmosphere....2 stars for food. . Atmosphere: Awesome! There are telescopes available above the restaurant and signs labeling the cardinal directions/towns. Restaurant and upstairs bar both are on a rotating floor. I was looking forward to going up the glass elevator but it was damaged due to the tornado unfortunately.. Food: Vegetarian platter available upon request but other than that no vegetarian options.  It included green beans, squash, kale, bok choy, and wild rice. The meat eaters I was with liked the food - steak and salmon. Meal comes with mediocre complimentary bread - wheat and white/cheese on top. Creme brulee was very good! . Prices: overpriced for quality of food, but you pay for the view of course. Our meal came to $120 for 3 entrees, 1 glass wine, dessert.  There are gift certificates on Creative Loafing right now ($30 for $15). . Service: great. All servers were very nice. Had no problems. . Parking: at hotel since it was validated for dinner only for up to 3 hrs.. Conclusion: Will come back for drinks to enjoy the view but not again for dinner. Overall, pretty cool place!
