I read all the outstanding reviews and forced my husband to trek to San Gabriel for the lobster.  The 3 1/2 LB lobster @ $15.95 per pound was mostly shell.  We could find very little of the precious tail meat and the claws were almost empty.  We probably got about a pound of meat from the whole lobster.  However, there was probably a pound of green onions on top to make up for the lack of meat.  . . I have no problem eating at a place with a B rating from the health dept. but there wasn't even a rating posted... I'll update you if either of us get sick.  I probably won't, as my gut  is made of iron, my husband on the other hand is a food snob and is sick just from the thought of wasting $90 (4 beers and a noodle dish included) on such mediocre fare.
