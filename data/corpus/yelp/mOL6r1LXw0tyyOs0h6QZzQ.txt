Hands down my favourite coffee spot in LA!  Delightful decor and delicious dishes keep me coming back again and again.  would def recommend getting there before 3pm to try the doughnut holes before they're gone for the day.  . . pros: . parking lot in the back . wonderful service &amp; creative menu. . cons:. a bit on the pricey side for what you get (even tho it's o-so-delish!)
