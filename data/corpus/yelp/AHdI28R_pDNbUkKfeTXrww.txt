Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
Ok, this is what happened:  I'd just viewed "Check Please" and the review of this hamburger place.  The reviewers were uniformly 'ok' with the service, but differed when it came to rating the food.  That day, a couple of friends called to mention they were going there.  Now, since I've been living a few blocks from "Mary's" since it opened, but never drawn to it; I was ready to try it out.  After all, it was just burgers - something simple, produced at home 'to my complete satisfaction'.  Why not try it out?  This place answers the question, "How many people does it take to screw-up a hamburger?"  Go to Mary's and find out.  . I mentioned the TV reviewers were mixed on food and service.  I'm not.  It's just a burger and Mary's has perfected making average food mediocre.  . We had drinks, appetizers, and entrees.  All of these ranged from average to below.  My beer looked more like a Wassermann sample, the appetizer was the quality of something from a hermetically sealed bag, and they totally screwed-up my burger order until I was compelled to call them on it.  Lo and behold the burger they sent me was totally wrong.  Couldn't anybody have caught that before it got to me?  And now, a few words on the wait service:. Many we came in contact with either were 1. Incapable of recalling the menu in their hands; or 2. More interested in looking around and chatting with others than the customers in front of them.  These people would be much better at being - hmmm - almost anything not dealing with humans.  Did I mention this painful (yet comical) experience took over an hour to unfold?  . Oh yes! If you want to go here and be impressed - wait for the check.  You will be.
