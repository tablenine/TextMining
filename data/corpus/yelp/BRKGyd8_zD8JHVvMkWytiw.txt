Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I've been coming to Apple Pan since I was 8...so I may be a little biased. Make no mistake, this isn't a fancy burger establishment by any means, but the paper soda/water cones and the red vinyl bar seats are part of its old school charm. Prices have gone up over the years (around $30 for 2 ppl with burgers, fries, drinks and dessert), but I think it's worth it for great food and a comfortable/cozy atmosphere. The guys who work the counters have been there for decades...talk about job security. . . As for the seating, it's a little tricky. There's almost always a line. And it is first come first serve, depending on where you're standing. I always just scope out how far along the folk at the counters are, and wait behind the people ready to pay their bill. This place is definitely not good for groups...it's tough enough to get 2 seats together. If you can't handle the seating situation, just order it to go. . . Everything is freshly made and hot off the grill. My go to favorites are the steak burger (has a relish/ketchupy sauce), fries (perfectly golden and hot from the fryer), a slice of banana cream pie (just to die for perfection - tried to copy this many times in my own kitchen with zero success)...all topped off with a coke served in a paper cone.
