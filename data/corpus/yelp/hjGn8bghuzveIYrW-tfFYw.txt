As one can see from the photos the view here is extremely nice but that is as far is it goes.  You are coming here for the view since the food here is decent but not worth the price.  For example the sushi here is really small so one must order many times to be satisfied.  The service is great especially if you call in advance they ask if there is a special occasion that is bringing you to the restaurant and when you are being seated they say Happy special occasion.
