Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Let the shouting and battling and Yelping begin:  Best burgers in LA.  . . There.  Yeah.  I said it.  Wanna fight?. . Sure, you can get a half-a-billion different toppings at the the Counter, sure there are only two kinds of burgers - the steakburger and the hickory burger, and sure, there's often a wait.  But MY SWEET LORD, that is some gooooooood meat:  Soft, flavorful, fresh, nectar-of-the-gods if such a thing could be made from the perfectly ground flesh of cows.. . The counter:  Old, horseshoe-shaped, real.  The guys behind the counter:  Old, horseshoe-shaped, real.  The service:  Lightning fast (that is, once you sit down).  The fries:  CRISP!  SALTY!  AMERICAN!  The condiments:  lots and lots of ketchup, poured liberally by the horseshoe-shaped counter men.  The drinks:  Come in a paper cone!  . . Yay, Apple Pan!  The antithesis of new, the best of the old, proof that joy can be found in a place that looks a little like an Edward Hopper painting, except everyone looks pretty dang happy.. . Except the deadpan horseshoe-shaped counter men.
