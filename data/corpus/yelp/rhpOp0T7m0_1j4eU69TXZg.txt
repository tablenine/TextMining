I have been going to one of the two locations for as long as I have lived here.  A hundred years ago when I lived in Andersonville, this place and Calo were literally the only two places that would deliver to my "questionably safe area" (ahem, Clark &amp; Granville.  really? "questionably safe?").  Then when I worked in River North, we would get delivery about once a week from the Ontario location.  So I am pretty familiar. . . Anyway.  Part of my problem is that they are very pricey for what it is. Hummus is delicious, but $5.95 delicious?  Not sure about that.  The Koubideh is fantastic, as well as the Ghemieh Bodemjan, but really, we all know what the real reason is for going there in the end.  And that is the dill rice.  I have tried replicating it many times at home, but it is never the same.  . . I would go here much more (since I work only a few blocks away) if the prices were a little more reasonable.
