Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Umami Burger, The Fifth taste. I ponder what that fifth taste is suppose to taste like since most of the flavors was totally over ruled with salty greasiness. The presentation of the dishes are very creative and appealing. But overall I would say I was not highly impressed... Mainly going in with the expectation that this place is suppose to be an AMAZING BURGER JOINT! I tried the Umami Burger and the Turkey Miso. Both the meats were very dry and loaded with salt. The buns were bit soggy, but that's because they choose to use the sweet hawaiian roll breads as the buns, which in my opinion a creative call on the dish but for overall texture could not justify to call it an AMAZING BURGER. The place is small, typical for any eatery in Los Angeles, contemporary, and simple. The rest of the menu is also very limited and also great presentation. Out of all the places for great burger joint, I just find this place to be OK and bit over priced for the quality of food. Would I go there again? Probably for the Umami but could care less for the Turkey. I would need to be treated to go this place again. . . However, I will say I give kudos for the culinary creatively on the burgers! But would perhaps encourage some improvement on few of the dishes.
