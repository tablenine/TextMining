Restaurant: Jack&#39;s Pizza &amp; Wings
Category: Pizza
So, I strolled into Jacks hoping for a low-key place with wings and some pizza.. and it is OH so much more.. . They have baked wings, which I had - that were delicious.  My friend has just one slice of pizza that was HUGE and she raved about it.  There were several specialty pizzas that sounded very... creative to say the least.. . and strawberry wings?? I don't know Jack about that... We also tried the dessert pizza topped with chocolate, gummie bears, kitkats, reeses.. and it was fabulous.  . . They have trivia on several weeknights, and malt liquor for 1.50... . Whats not to love!
