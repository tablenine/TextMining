Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
It was one of those pooptastic days that drove us crying to mama Lola's warm, welcoming bosom at the end of the day. Crying in the car, crying while scoring street parking, and then tearfully fleeing to her empanada-filled, intoxicating bosom of happy hour love. . . We sat in her plush lap, and she plied us with addictive sweet potato fries, flaky beef and chicken empanadas, bacon and mozzarella pizza, and fried calamari. 'There, there, children,' she practically whispered. The empanadas seemed to be made of puff pastry, so flaky and delicious. Way flakier than even my friend's Hollywood douchebag date. I went for the renown Apple Martini, arguably invented in the mid-90's right at this place. It snuck up on me quickly and before I was able to sop it up with our appetizers, I was in a semi-drunken fish bowl. Fingertips numb and shoving things in my mouth, chewing, then swallowing them. Let's hope they were sweet potato fries. (Side note: there were some abnormally long fries.). . I just hate trying to look sober. Restraining crazy movement and enunciating words. Keeping my eyeballs at a steady gaze, so I don't end up looking like one of those frogs with the turned out eyes. Or Biggie Smalls. The Vertigo Lemon Drop Martini was slightly mellower, sugar-rimmed with a hint of yummy grenadine. I did, however, find myself lazily lapping at my fingertips sticky with melty sugar during conversation. Wouldn't any sober person?. . We returned to Lola's twice in one week and it was like coming home. Even when she told us her happy hour was now back to ending at 7:30pm, we did not hold it against her. . . Lola. Voluptuous, tasty, cheap, nurturing, mama Lola. Till next time.
