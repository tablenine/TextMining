Restaurant week choice for me that disappointed. I can't say anything really stood out to me. The good things: the cauliflower soup, the seafood, and any dessert other than with Â chocolate. The bad: the quail and the chocolate desserts. I do like the fact they use fresh and local products and you can taste that difference. I just wish there was something that made me want to ask for more of it. Environment is very private and yet with an open floorplan. The service I think is what may have ruined the taste of the food for me...the table next to us was getting their dishes much faster than us and had gotten there later. By the time they left, we were wondering where our desserts were and if we were ever going to get them. If somebody wanted to go back, I would try it again.
