The view is undeniably good as is the sake... please know that I say this fully admitting that I am no sake expert.  Take it with a grain of salt if you must....  and I have only had the appetizers so I will refrain from commenting on the menu.. . The dramatic, steep drive up sets the stage for the view that awaits.  After sunset, the lights below are quite enchanting.. . Back inside, you my find that the waitstaff is friendly but doesn't always hear you the first time around... I had to repeat myself a few times as did my date.  Also, they don't wait for you to finish one glass before they pour another.  I found myself with two glasses of sake and two of water most of the time.  (Maybe that's not such a bad thing!). . I'm told the architecture isn't quite dead on what it should be but unless you're in that industry, you should be impressed with the decor and ambiance.
