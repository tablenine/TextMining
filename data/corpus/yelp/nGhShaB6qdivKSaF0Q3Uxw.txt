On one of my visits back to L.A., a wayward friend of a friend took us to this incredible spot.  I love you, Lala's!. . I had the skirt steak with the chimichurri sauce generously smeared on top of it and the mashed potatoes.  It was the one of the best meals I've enjoyed.  I haven't been able to find another place that does it like Lala's.  The chimichurri was fresh and full of flavor.  The garlic, citrus and herbs went so well with the juicy steak.  Do they still serve it?  I didn't see it on the menu online.. . Then, the dessert was just as good.  I had the crepes with banana and Dulce de leche.  Drop dead delicious.. . We sat out on the patio which made it a great experience.
