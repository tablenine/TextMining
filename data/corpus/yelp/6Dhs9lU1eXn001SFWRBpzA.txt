Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I can't BELIEVE I haven't Yelp'd Roscoes yet!!! Oh my God, this place is just simply heaven on earth! I grew up going to the Gower location after late nights at concerts or clubs. I barely remember those years because it was always after quite a bit of drinking (but I digress...) These days we hit up this Pasadena location which is larger, plenty of parking and REALLY friendly staff! I always get a #3 split with all legs if I'm with someone else. That gets you 2 waffles &amp; 4 legs. Perfect! I add on mac &amp; cheese (by far the best anywhere!) and a biscuit w/ gravy. Two instructions not to bypass... you MUST drench your chicken in Red Rooster hot sauce if you're not a pansy &amp; can stand it AND you must eat your chicken &amp; waffle simultaneously. There's just no better way! Treat the awesome staff right as they deserve it and trust me that they'll remember it! I go a few times a month &amp; don't give a hot DAMN about the calorie count or price. Roscoes is worth it!!!
