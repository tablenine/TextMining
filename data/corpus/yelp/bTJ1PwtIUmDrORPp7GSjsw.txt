My wife and I went to Pozole for the first time on Halloween night.  The tequila selection is truly amazing and the margaritas are fantastic!. . The food is not quite as good. All of our dishes were very bland.  I usually judge Mexican/Tex Mex restaurants on the quality of their salsa and it was disappointing.  The red salsa had no flavor - if you find this yourself, you can somewhat fix it by adding a lot of Cholula hot sauce provided on the table, as well as some fresh lime juice.  The chipotle salsa had no flavor at all.  The habanero salsa was a sweet salsa and it was pretty good.  The tacos were good but again, lacking a flavor.. . Overall, I would go back to test out the tequilas but I would probably eat somewhere else before I go.
