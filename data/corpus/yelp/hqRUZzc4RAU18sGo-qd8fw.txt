Restaurant: Aja Restaurant &amp; Bar
Category: Dim Sum
My friends and I came here for some drinks.  It's a nice bar/restaurant with crap load of asian cliche's.  My friends and I actually had to laugh at how American's tend to group all asian cultures into one.  I.e.  Japanese geisha next to chinese writing or Chinese Buddhist heads next to Indian Buddhist heads. Anyways, its an ok bar.  The music they were playing was 80's upbeat music and there were alot of middle aged women dancing so we left.. . But one thing they were on the money was service... It was raining and they had guys waiting outside with umbrellas walking my girlfriend and I up to the doorway.  Service inside was just as nice.
