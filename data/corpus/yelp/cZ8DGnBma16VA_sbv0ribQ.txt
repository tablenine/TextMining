I have no idea how they keep their food prices so low and quality so high. The food is delicious and the service is friendly. My only qualm at all about the place is their postage-stamp sized parking lot! It's definitely the place for cheap&amp;tasty Thai food, and the crowds and plaques on the wall are on display to prove it
