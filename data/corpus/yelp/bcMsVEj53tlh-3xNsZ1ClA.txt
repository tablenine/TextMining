Ordered two galbi (short-rib) tacos, one galbi burrito, one blackjack quesadilla, one kogi dog after waiting in line the requisite 30+ minutes.  . . Food was delicious, time in line with friends was fun, especially as we were at The Bruery and buzzed... but not sure I'd rush out to wait in line on a Tweet.. . A must go, and if it weren't so great, and such a long line, then I'd rate stars much higher.  Too good for you're own good Kogi!
