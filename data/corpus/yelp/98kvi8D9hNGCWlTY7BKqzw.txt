Found the Kogi truck in Culver City a couple weeks back and was so glad I did.  My son and I stood in line for about 20 minutes, which wasn't too bad.  By the time we left, the line had doubled in size.  We ordered a bunch of the short rib, spicy pork and chicken tacos.... Once we got back to the car we tore into those suckers and all you could hear was lip smacking, finger licking and lots of OMG's!!  Delicious (damn, my mouth is watering just thinking about it).  Well worth a 20 minute wait, but my impatience wouldn't allow me to get in a 2 hr line no matter how good the food.  If you see the Kogi truck with a reasonable line, slam on the brakes and get yourself some!!  YUMM!
