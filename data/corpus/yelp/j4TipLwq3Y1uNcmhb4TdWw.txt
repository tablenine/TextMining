aww I was kinda sad to come back to no more vegan banana cake! Â or any vegan desserts for that matter.... but, on a positive note-- I love the ever-refreshed menu! lots to try. yum. For these two points, I took off a star, then put on a star so please, don't confuse my 4-1+1 stars for 4. It's 3+5/2. Totally different.
