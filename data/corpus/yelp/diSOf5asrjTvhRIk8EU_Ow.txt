Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Philippe's is the original.. . This was one of the stops I was excited to visit during EDC weekend. One of my best friends took me here and I had the privilege to be here right before a Dodgers game. Fans were lined up for their famous double-dip beef w/ swiss an hour before a game.  I knew I was in LA when the restaurant was filled with people in "white and blue".. . I had high expectations coming in...and all those expectations were met. I enjoyed the vintage decor, the friendly staff, the large family size tables, and the of course the sandwiches! I ordered the double-dip beef w/ swiss (recommended by my friend). The meat was tender, the bread was lightly toasted w/ a slight crunch but matches the tenderness of the beef. It literally MELTS in your mouth!  . . Before trying the sandwich, I had the nerves to compare Philippe's with the franchise BuckHorn from the Bay...There is no comparison. Buckhorn is like the big mac to authentic all beef burgers next to Philippe's. So if you're one of those people who enjoy Buck Horn, you will fall in love with Philippe's.. . If I lived in LA, I can see myself coming here on a regular basis.. . Thank you Philippe's for a great time!
