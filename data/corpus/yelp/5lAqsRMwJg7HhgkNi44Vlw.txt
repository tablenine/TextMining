Randy and "Hefe" :) are amazing!  They flooded our table with such an array of cocktails and yummy bites that we had to dance off everything at the end of the night!. Randy was even able to get my "non-raw/ceviche" eating friend to devour all FOUR kinds of ceviche he prepared.  And the dessert - oh the dessert.  The Churros were phenomenal - took me right back to my childhood in LA.  . Service was quick, sweet, and extremely knowledgeable.  And the Manager "Hefe", I love that, was warm and lively - perfect fit for this hip space.  . I definitely feel in love with them via Ceviche, though.  Just don't tell my Peruvian Grandmother.....shhh!. By the way, the late-night salsa dancing is the best!  Perfect way to work off your meal!. Though, BEWARE of the tasty, too good to be true, Sangria - 2 and I was done!
