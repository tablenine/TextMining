Restaurant: Apres Diem
Category: French
I am torn about Apres Diem.  I can't decide whether to love or hate it.  . . I think that part of the problem is that it will NEVER measure up to Cafe Diem.  I don't know how many Yelpers remember that place, but it was one of my all-time favorite coffee, chill-out, and studying places all through college.  Then it closed.  When I found out that the same owners had opened a new place called Apres Diem, I was STOKED.. . Sadly, Apres Diem is nothing like Cafe Diem was.  It's a little more of a "night spot" or a place to be seen than the chill cafe that I remember so fondly.  . . But I don't think that my comparison to its predecessor is the only problem.  Another issue is that the food and the service have been decidedly "meh" on every occasion I've been to Apres Diem.. . However, despite my whining about its trendiness, I do kind of like the vibe of the place.  And the drinks are not half bad, either.  I wouldn't refuse to go to Apres Diem if a friend requested to do so, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go there.
