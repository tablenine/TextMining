On a hot day in the SGV, what do you do to cool down?. . Two words: Shaved Ice!. . When my friend and I came here, to my surprise, there was a line! You know a place is good when there is a line. And when I came in and saw all the young cool hip Asians, I knew this was a spot to be in SGV. I ordered the shaved ice - Red Bean, Lemon Jelly, Black Jelly, Almond Tofu, and of course Condensed Milk. It was very large and I could not finish it all. I would say that one shaved ice is good for two (or three) as long as you like the same toppings. My friend doesn't like beans, but she likes the Mochi.. . All around me, I saw people order real meals. My eyes darted towards the Taiwanese sausage dishes, which I hope to try someday. Others ordered noodle soups which looked appetizing as well. The service was really good but parking can be a little headache (but where in the SGV is parking not a headache?). . I came out with a brain freeze and ready for the summer heat.
