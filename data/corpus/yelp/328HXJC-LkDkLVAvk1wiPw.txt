Restaurant: Zocalo Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
Sorry, Nuevo Laredo.... I have found my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Atlanta. . . The pollo con mole at Zocalo is THAT good. Real mole sauce with nuts and a hint of chocolate is the best I've ever had, compared to the "mole" sauce they serve elsewhere. And served with corn instead of flour tortillas, just as you would have in Mexico.. . The menu contained most of the typical items you'd find in a Mexican restaurant, plus a whole list of entrees that were something much different than the fare at someplace like La Parilla. . . And all this in an open-air setting on a pleasant night makes for a great experience.
