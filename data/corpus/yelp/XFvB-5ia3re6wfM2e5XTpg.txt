I was annoyed by the fact they would not let you order to go, but would let you order at the bar and then subsequently let you wrap up your food....pointless.. . Basically I gave them a low rating because the host was such a jerk to me. Granted, I wasn't really dressed appropriately for the place, but I hadn't really intended to stick around anyway until i was forced.. . It was around 11pm and on a thursday night. So, not that many restaurants in the area were still open. I'm a vegetarian and this is one of the few places that even had a vegetarian option that was open at the time. I wanted to get a pasta they had w/ hazelnut, but they closed the regular kitchen before i could order. So, i had to order off the bar menu, I picked out a wild mushroom salad that was pretty out of this world good. The bartender who served me was also extremely nice. I wish I could have gotten to try the pasta dish, but alas it was not meant to be. . . I would have rated this place much better if the host wasn't so snotty. I've done both serving and hosting before and there is really no excuse for it.
