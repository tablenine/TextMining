O M G! After many many  food adventures in San Francisco, I've been feeling that there is something missing in Chicago. This place has helped to fill that void. The menu has subtle hints of Asian fusion. The short ribs appetizer was a total appeTEASER!! $15 for 3 tiny cubes of succelent beef short ribs. Believe me, I treasured every little morsel. Then we had the baby spinach salad which was delish. Then came the carrot soup with mussels. The ginger in the carrot soup was perfect for a chilly night. The mussels were good, but on the small side. For our main courses we had the veal chop which was awesome. The meat was perfectly cooked and so flavorful. Then we had the bouillabaisse  which was tasty, but I thought the broth was a bit salty. The dishes were all presented beautifully. Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive. This was such a wonderful birthday treat.
