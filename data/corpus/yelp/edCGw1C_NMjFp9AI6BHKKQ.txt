Restaurant: Rose Angelis
Category: Italian
Another favorite Italian restaurant in Lincoln Park.  I've attended both private events and walk-in dinners at Rose Angelis.  A quaint little apartment building was made into a great local restaurant.. . The best part about private events is that you don't have to wait a very long time for a table.  . . We've never had a bad meal or service here, it's one of our favorite spots.  Make sure to make reservations for large groups.
