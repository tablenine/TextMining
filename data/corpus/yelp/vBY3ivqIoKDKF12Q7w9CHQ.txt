Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Amazing meat. Now before Fogo de Chao i was not a big meat fan but I am now. The selection is unbelievable. I expected to pick at things but just stick to the salad bar and boy was I wrong. The flavors were coming out of my ears everything was perfect. The cheesy bread is great and so are all of the sides. . Though it was very expensive you should definitely try it. This is something to experience. I go to Gaucho's Village in Glendale now tho because it's "almost" as good and 1/2 the price.
