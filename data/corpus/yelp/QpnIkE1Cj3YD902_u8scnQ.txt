We went to check this joint out when we were in a pinch for lunch in little 5 points. First things first the burritos are HUGE here, they also have some very good homemade salsa. . . When you see the luchador painting on the door you know you are at the right place. Ill be back soon for sure, its the best burrito I have had in Atlanta so far.
