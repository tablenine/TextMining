Plenty bitch and moan and crap themselves when it comes to ripping on La Mill.  The common thread I find in said moaners is that they're typically the types of people that I can't stand to converse with.  Usually that's enough reason to defend a place like La Mill except for the fact that I like La Mill.  It looks weird on the inside and I kind of like that.  The great coffee and tea costs as much a Home Depot day labor but like the illegal help -- sometimes it's just right.  The food, oh the food.  Providence (ne Water Grill) don Michael Cimarusti has given La Mill a menu for diners to have an amazing plate of food.  Try the salmon, it'll make you swim upstream.  . . _C$
