Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Another visit to an LA standard with an anticlimactic ending. Â I was excited to try this place out because I love me some fried chicken.. I mean how can you botch up fried chicken? So I sat down, and ordered the standard fare, the chicken and waffle.. . but seriously.. it's just a dried piece of chicken and an eggo waffle. a plain freakin eggo waffle. . . maybe it's like Pinks and there's some fantastic other menu item or condiment that makes this place great, and if there is, it's a mystery to me.. . I just know it's not worth the 2nd visit.
