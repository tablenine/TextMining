Had dinner there on Saturday night.  We were 10 mins. late for our reservations and the host was very friendly and sat us promptly.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and the atmosphere was comfortable, somewhat loud, but it actually allowed for better conversation.  The food was delicious as we had a pasta with meat sauce and a chicken breast with fresh mozz. and sauce.  Enjoy this down to earth, home cookin' italian restaurant.
