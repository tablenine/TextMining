Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I haven't tasted any other prime ribs that can beat Lawry's yet.  . . Valet is $5-6/vehicle.  Self-serve meat ball appetizers-while-you-get-seated is a plus--just don't eat too much of it or you won't be able to finish your entree.  . . Overall, my english cut prime rib (three thin slices), creamed corn (orgasm in your mouth) and french wine was superb.  I tried a piece of the lobster tail and it was really fishy.  If I could change one thing about this restaurant, it'd be the interior decor.  I don't like that it's dark and musty inside AND some of these tables are in such close proximity together that you can't get in or out unless the table is pulled out to provide enough space to get up from your seat/booth and get out.
