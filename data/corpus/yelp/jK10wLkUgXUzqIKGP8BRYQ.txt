Category: Desserts
Sitting in the restaurant, waiting for my wife (who was waiting for the bathroom), I couldn't help but notice the people next to me: standard couple, likely in from the burbs or Kansas.  They ordered two means and had barely touched their plates.  Why?  Not good?  Probably not.  Probably just too much food.  So here's the trick: when stopping here with your SO, just order one appetizer (avocado egg rolls), one salad (chopped) and a main.  Split everything.  There is no way you'll go hungry.  And, if you can believe it, we left without even having a piece of their eponymous dessert.  Total: under $40.  Not bad for a pre Spelling Bee din din.
