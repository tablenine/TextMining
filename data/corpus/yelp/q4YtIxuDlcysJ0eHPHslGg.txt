I think it must be yall..  We have put Pura Vida on our regular list..  Today we went at 6pm and enjoyed the $3 Tapas.. The mini empanandas  YUMM.  The Pinchos  not a huge portion but these folks know what a real CHIMMICHURI is all about.. The Duck Marduros WOW WOW WOW  have these along with the Yucca Croquettes and your in Tapas heaven. and the ANCHO CHOCOLATE FLAN is just too good for words ( pssst is really is supposed to have that liquid gold at the bottom) And you can get a $30 coupon at Creative Loafing for half off. DEAL
