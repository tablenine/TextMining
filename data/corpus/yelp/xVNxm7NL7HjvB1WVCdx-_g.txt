Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Good Ol' Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles!!!. . I remember back in 19___ (lol) when I was a freshman in College, we frequented this place because it shut down at 3am like most "after-the- club restaurants". . . After Notorious B.I.G. made it infamously famous by "Frequently floss hoes at Roscoe's", big fights erupted and caused havocs on Pico. The establishment PROMPTLY started to shut down earlier and earlier.. . While the quality of the food has gone down over the recent years (ie smaller chicken, gravy consistency, etc), the "HOOD FACTOR" and the atmosphere has certainly not! This is what keeps me going back to this place lol. On any given day, you can buy incence, a Laker t-shirt and a bootleg movie all fo under $10.. . The combination of the sweet and sticky syrup, cinammon-infused waffles and greasy @$$ chicken with a side of smothered potatoes (extra onions please) is a delightful and sinful treat for me every time I feel the need to have one!. . "Momma" still works here and is as attentive as ever. . . You will catch a glimpse of "Roscoe" every once in awhile because he lives in the immediate area!. . Although Roscoe's has expanded over the years (adding locations in Pasadena and Long Beach), this is one of the two TRUE ORIGINAL RECIPE Roscoe's and should be one to visit before you die! The other one is the "TRUE ORIGINAL HOOD ROSCOE's" on Manchester, right off of the 110. I will save that review for another day :)
