They're expensive because they need to feed those ginormous koi fish swimming through the restaurant!  It's smack in the middle of the 90210 and has a dress code (huh?? dress code in LA?) so I didn't expect any less.  . . We ordered the crab, prawns with garlic noodles and a side of garlic rice.  It was all yummy (the rice was really good!!) but the prawns may have been a little overcooked.  The waiter was also kind enough to bring us a free birthday dessert -- fried bananas with ice cream on top.. . If you're into celebrity sitings or people watching, you might enjoy the scene.  We almost saw Whitney Houston and AJ (who's AJ?), but the window shades were down and all we could see were tons of flashes from paparazzi cameras.. . What can I say?  Been there, done that.  There are too many restaurants in LA to go back to Crustacean... next?!
