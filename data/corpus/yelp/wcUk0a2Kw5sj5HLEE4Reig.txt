Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
When a restaurant specializes in something... it better be good at it.. . Savoy specializes in Hainan chicken.  Is it good at it?  YEP.. . The orange hot sauce that complements the chicken combined with the chicken broth fused rice is close to perfect.. . 4 stars because... well, their other dishes are just average.
