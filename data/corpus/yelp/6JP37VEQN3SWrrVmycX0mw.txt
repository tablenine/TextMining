Based on the "Piggy Fries," the "Oinksterade," and the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, I was in heaven at this quaint, throwback to 60's family dining. It's pretty basic stuff, but it's fun and kitschy and cheap AND most importantly it's delicious. I can't say I was blown away by their award winning desserts and I wish the pulled pork had good ole' Carolina vinegar-based BBQ sauce on it, but otherwise it was awesome!. . The service was exceptionally friendly and all smiles and several large groups descended upon the joint who all seemed to enjoy themselves. If you are in Eagle rock and want to hog out on some good food, Oinkster is the place.. . The only not so good thing about this place are the restrooms. Both the women's and men's restrooms are on the outside of the building and were in need of some attention... Â it just reminded me of a gas station bathroom.. . The "piggy fries" will call to me in the middle of the night....
