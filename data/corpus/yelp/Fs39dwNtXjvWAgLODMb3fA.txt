Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
After my so-so Burger Bar experience, I was hesitant to try another "gourmet" burger.. Since I pass by this place everyday after work, I thought I should try it!. My gf and I was in the area on a Sat and we spontaneously decided to give it a try.. First of all the place is quite small but cozy.  Since the main area was full, we were seating in a tiny room  of about 6-8 facing the wall.. Not the most idea of seating but we came here for the food.. With the recommendation from the greeter/seater, II ordered the Hatch Burger and my girifriend ordered the Umami.. The burgers are small compared to other burgers but it was quite filling.   I actually thought they were going to be smaller, like White Castle sizes.. . When I bit into the Hatch, I noticed the bun immediately.  Although the burger was good,  it had a "something is missing" feeling.. . That feeling disappeared when I took a bite of the Umami!. Whoa!  So juicy and so much flavor!  Just cooked a perfect medium rare, just like the sign says.. . Since the name of the place is "Umami Burger", thats the burger to get!. . In the end, the only thing that tasted average was the ketchup.. . I say the whole experience took about 30-40 mins tops and it cost around 30 bucks!. . Not cheap but it satisfied my curiosity.
