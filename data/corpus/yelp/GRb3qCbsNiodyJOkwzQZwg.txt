Food good. Just good. . . SERVICE: HORRIBLE!! . . We were there on a Friday night after work. We knew there would be a wait for a seat, no problem. We ordered a bottle of wine and just chilled standing to the side for about an hour. Finally got seated at the "pizza bar". Okay -- so far, so good. Ordered another bottle of wine and an appetizer. Okay -- so far, so good. . . Waited about 20 min for our appetizer ( A PLATE OF SALAMI'S). Never came. The waiter (who looked like his mother must have dropped him off after his 5th period English Lit class at the local high school) insisted that we never ordered it! Seriously. Hello, service. Okay, so let's say we didn't order it. Really, he's going to try and argue? Okay, anyways -- get our food. eat our food. Ask to order one pizza to go while we have dessert. The waiter (yes, the 17 year old waiting on us) told us "we're not serving to go orders because we're too busy". Okay, we'll order another pizza for here. He says "Sorry, we're really busy, and we're going to need your table, so we cannot serve you anymore". . . Yep, cut off for wanting to spend more money in this joint. Wow. . . NOTHING ITALIAN AT ALL ABOUT THIS PLACE! NOT ONE THING/PERSON ETC.
