I didn't eat a whole lot of food here...just a tun of margaritas. actually i had more of the tequila y sprite (or was it 7 up? ..not sure, some white soda but not fresco).  . . the queso fundido was OK.  about 1/2 as good as frontera's, but probably 3x as much food for the same price.  actually that's pretty much my assessment of the whole place...  the drinks weren't terribly great, though actually made with real juices and not from a mix.. . ceviche was decent.. . the mojitos didn't taste all that real, like they were from that mint liquor mix... but those aren't mexican anyway.. . i've heard the back patio is nice too!
