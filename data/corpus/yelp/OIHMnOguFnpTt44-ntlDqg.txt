I had the Special #2 and it was hot!  I was sweating while I was eating, which is always a good sign :)  . . Next time I think I want to get a less spicy version because I really was distracted from the spiciness rather than the taste of the ramen.. . They don't take credit card unless there is a minimum of $20.  I'm not sure when ramen got so expensive?!  I can get top ramen for $.59?!  Anyways,  I think I paid $13 for ramen, tip and parking.
