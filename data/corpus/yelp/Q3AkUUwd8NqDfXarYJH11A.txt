roscoe's....when bad food happens to good people.. . how sorry i am the chicken / waffle joke house didn't pan out.  one extra star for the cool cat that sat us.  if you reaaaalllly like food, and haven't ever craved popeye's or KFC (that would be me), don't waste a meal here.  the laughs end when your food arrives;  the word food being a v.loose definition of what was on the plate.
