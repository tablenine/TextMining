My dad and I ate here before hitting the surf at santa monica state beach.   Perfect combo.  They have a plate that their menu describes as providing the 5 elements of energy.  In other words a macrobiotic plate.  It had a bean, a grain, squash, root vegetable, pickles and steamed greens.  It also came with a bowl of white miso soup, we ordered a second bowl of that which made it so we each got a bowl and then the large plate it's self was enough food for both of us.  Also it came with a starter of corn bread with this amazing carrot dip.. . So from this one experience that had extremely friendly staff I'd definitely go back and I'd also highly recommend this place to anyone who has a chance to go.
