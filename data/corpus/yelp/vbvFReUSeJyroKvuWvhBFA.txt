They say guys do stupid things for girls. The stupid thing I did was let my friend take me here. She always talks about going here, but never has it been in a good light. That should have been my first hint to say, " No, let's not go there after the Dodger game." Instead, I did a stupid thing and now I'm writing about it.. . On the outside, Fred 62's seems like a good idea. It's a diner on the corner. They've got some great music playing and for the most part, it seems like a cool place to go to. Then you get a closer look. This place is crawling with hipsters. I don't know about you, but I'm not a fan of the hipster scene with their hats and skinny jeans.. . As for the rest of the atmosphere, I guess it works. The booths are spacious and it's dark enough inside that you can easily ignore the hipsters.. . I'd have to say the food here is hit or miss. I had the fish and chips which is tough to do outside of a pub or somewhere by an ocean. The fries were good and the fish was ok. Overall, it was a miss but lots of places strikeout on that dish.. . The menu is huge and I'm sure you can find something good. If I ever come back, there were a few things I'd like to try. Of course, I'll do anything for a good friend so if she ever said let's go, I'd have a chance to try those few other things.. . The one great thing I can say about this place is it's the perfect drunken after bar hopping spot. If you're not sober enough to get to a Denny's, Fred 62's is an acceptable substitute. Actually, if you're already in hangover mode...the dim lighting is a plus. The food is perfect to soak up all that wonderful alcohol you had but beware getting sick afterward. Then again, you probably would have gotten sick without the alcohol.
