Restaurant: Leon&#39;s Full Service
Category: Gastropubs
Trendy restaurant meets classic filling station. Upscale cuisine meets well-stocked pub. It's hard to believe, but that's what it is. . . We ate out on the patio, which is well but subtly lit. The trout was exemplary - great taste, great presentation. The fries were average, but the assorted dipping sauces made them special. The fries with dipping sauces seems to be a growing trend, and I'm glad to see it. Ketchup may be the American way, but it isn't the only way. Some things, like the "bacon in a glass" and the small water glasses without enough ice, are a little gimmicky, but I'll overlook them.
