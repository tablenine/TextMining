I like it, stopped in there because I had a craving for NY style pizza because I'm from NY originally and really wanted some home cooking.  I love the dark dungeon feel and the lunchbox caddy plus they have Tekken 3.  I had the pepperoni slice which was good but was missing a tiny element and that was grease!  Yes I said it, NY pizza is pretty cheesy and greasy.  The pizza was darn close to the original all it needs its more cheese.  There you have it!    I will be returning to try out the trivia nights.
