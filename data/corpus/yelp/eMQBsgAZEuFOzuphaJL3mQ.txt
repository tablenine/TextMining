Category: Pizza
It's kind of like three locations in one: a little bakery/take-out counter; a bar with some seating where you can eat; and the full-service restaurant. We ate in the full-service portion, a big open room that's really loud. When we ate, it was between 3 and 5, an odd time block between lunch and dinner services. As was explained to us about three times, we could only order off a minimal menu. The server was practically trying to convince us to leave and come back later. . . Nonetheless, the pizza we had was delicious. There was a good beer and wine list. Four stars on the food. Two-and-a-half on the service, decor, experience.
