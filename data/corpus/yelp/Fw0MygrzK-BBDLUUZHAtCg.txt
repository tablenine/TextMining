I consider this place more of a seafood shop than a restaurant. But don't get me wrong, the food is good. There aren't that many tables to eat, but the food comes out fast! . . FOOD: I had the boiled shrimp with the Cajun corn. Even though the shrimp takes some work with peeling before eating, it's definitely worth it. I like that the shrimp is open so that you can devein it yourself. The corn is cooked with a touch of Cajun spice. The two is a nice combo, but a little messy.
