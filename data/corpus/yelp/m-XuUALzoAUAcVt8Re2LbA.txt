I am going to keep this very short....     Impeccable service.     Top quality food. I can't think of any other reasons to go to a restaurant. The food is not just top quality, but there's serious thought given to the blend of flavors. I tasted combinations that amazed my palate. . . I highly recommend Craft to anyone looking for a serious foodie experience. Oh yes - be sure you're good and hungry!
