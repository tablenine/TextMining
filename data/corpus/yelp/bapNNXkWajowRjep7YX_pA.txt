The more I eat here, the more I like it. I'm a repeat customer and I live 6 hours away. . . What makes this place stand apart from other ramen joints is the broth. The soup base cooks a good while, simmering with pork bones, which doesn't sound that appetizing but it makes all the difference in the world. . . Bottom line- I like ramen and I LOVE this place. Sure, I have to wait a bit to eat but is it worth it? My empty bowl and full belly say yes.
