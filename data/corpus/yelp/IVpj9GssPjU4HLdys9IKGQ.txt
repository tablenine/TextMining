The decor was nice enough..though personally  Not too crazy about the "luau show"- style seating. .. We made a reservation but when we got there they didn't ask us or let us tell them that we had a reservation.. they just seated us. ( They have 4? booths near the windows-but all were full.) Not sure if you need to request that or not. Or, even if you did, you would get them...it was OK as it was not busy and we were just happy to be there...plus, sometimes seating like that can be festive... I was not "floored" by the food but for the price, really can't beat it.  Stay away from the Won tons appetizer - they were those that were all wrapper and nothing inside..Yes there are places that actually put filing inside them and it isn't all fried wrapper.. Everything came out timely, hot and ample portions. We were able to get our food as spicy as we like it.  2 star, 3 star... Unfortunately, they do not tell you anywhere on their site that "Elvis" takes Monday and Tuesdays off....so going there for the 1st time for a "kitschy" birthday dinner - hoping to see the elusive E. was kinda disappointing.... Our service, while certainly not refined, ((you know, serve from the right, clear from the left kinda thing) was gracious and attentive and just really friendly vibe all around.  . OH--,PS-valet parking is $2.50 plus tip.
