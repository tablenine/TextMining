Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
You are missing out on a basic Angeleno experience if you're living in Los Angeles and have never eaten at Philippe's. . Lots has been said, so I'll just add my two cents...my favorite combo (they come a la carte, but I like these together):. . *Beef sandwich, double dipped (they'll know what you mean at the counter), add the hot mustard at the table.. *Potato salad. *Lemonade. *Slice of pie (this may be overkill, just depends on how hungry I am). . Awesome. My eye just twitched thinking about it.... . Oh yeah, bring cash. And don't forget there's seating upstairs.
