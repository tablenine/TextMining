I just don't get it.  Heard all the hype &amp; went to Gibson's expecting the best steak of my life.  Walked away feeling cheated.  Not only was my otherwise good quality filet tasteless &amp; undercooked, but the sides were just a slightly elevated version of your average school cafeteria...bland, boring, barely edible.  Parting words?  Gibsons: Sizzler goes glam.
