Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
My husband and I were looking for a place to grab a quick bite before an IO performance and didn't want the dude-brha Wrigleyville bars. Man, did we hit the jackpot with Ian's. The mac and cheese pizza was awesome, and my husband loved his BBQ chicken slice. We even came back after the show for s'mores pizza. Thanks for the recommendation, Yelp!
