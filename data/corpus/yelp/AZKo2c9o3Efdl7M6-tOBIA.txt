Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
I have been to Milk a few times, but haven't so much recently since I moved to Silverlake.  I have eaten here a few times and the food is so-so.  It isn't anything spectacular and it isn't awful.  The main attractions are obviously the ice cream, pastry's, and various desserts.  The brownies/blondies are delicious and I really enjoy there frozen desserts.  I have had the grasshopper and the ice cream cone w/chocolate which are both HUGE and delicious.  . . The one thing I really hate is that my coffee whether it be a latte or mocha is always burned whenever I order there.  I enjoy a coffee with my dessert and they never seem to get it right.
