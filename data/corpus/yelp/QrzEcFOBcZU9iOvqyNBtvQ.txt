Restaurant: Sepia
Category: American (New)
Sepia is a favorite if only by the sexy name (hey, it is the photographer in me), but it does have many other great qualities!. . The drink list is fabulous with unique mixes of liquors and beers and juices.  Prices are average to upper in cost...around $11, but the bartender is engaging and the service is excellent.  . . Though dinner isn't something I've been lucky enough to partake, I was lucky enough to nibble on a few items with Colleen and Carol on fine evening.  Delicious flatbread and tasty braised lamb shoulder added to the lovely cocktails.. . I like a little upscale ambience, so Sepia has a nice look and feel and the folk area also have an upscale look all of which makes this a favorite in my book.
