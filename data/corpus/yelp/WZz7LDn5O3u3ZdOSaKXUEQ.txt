The five stars are for the chicken, the burgers, the breakfasts, the service, the atmosphere, and the portion sizes!  The desserts are always worth a try too.  We once had a cinnamon cake concoction that was created by our waitress - it was awesome!. . I agree that the sides have seemed bland and dry lately, which is a bummer for me since I'm a big fan of the "meal of 5 sides."  The last time we went in they said that they just took mac &amp; cheese off of the menu for good - which was devastating to hear. I never *loved* their mac &amp; cheese, but I sort of require mac &amp; cheese in the winter and it seems just nutty that they wouldn't have it.  Oh well, I'll still go for the rest!. . This has been a big hit with out of town guests who want to get some "local flavor," and it's very family friendly.  Fun spot!
