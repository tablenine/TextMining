Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Okay how should i start, i worked here for about 2 weeks.  That  means I should know what's going on inside the kitchen.  Want to know? Flies.  Manna can get very busy, its a $17.99 all you can eat bbq restaurant and big companies or owners like to bring there employees or big families here.  Since it gets busy they like to have all these banchan ready to be served.  But wait while it's getting ready to be served the flies gather and have a little picnic before you get your food.  I mean I use to come to eat here myself but after i know the behind story Never.  Some people don't care about flies too much but i really do.  This restaurant could get cleaner and i definitely wouldn't recommend it to my family and friends.
