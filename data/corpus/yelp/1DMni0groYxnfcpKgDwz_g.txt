pretty excited to come out here because i've heard lots about the office burger. and i agree its pretty damn good. i'm a fan of ALL burgers though...but yeah its good and its definitely crave worthy. i actually wish it was bigger and cheaper. i probably couldve eaten 2. don't share. order your own. Â . we got lucky and found seats at the bar on a semi crowded saturday night. our bartender/waiter pretty much picked our beers for us since we're beer noobs. worked out pretty well and we enjoyed them. . tried the sweet potato and shoestring fries. both were great.. . yeeeppppppp i'll be back if im ever in the area! probably wouldn't drive all the way up to LA JUST for the burger though.
