I've never reviewed TC? Wow. Tasty China has been through its ups &amp; downs but I've had some great meals here recently. You CAN get your General Tso's here, but don't let it fool you, there are some gems on the menu. My favorites are the dan dan noodles, crispy Â fried pork belly, and fish in hot oil. It's BYOB with no corkage, and is a big fave among those who like to bring in their own bottles to match with the spicy cuisine. The last time I went we paired it with some hoppy beer with was a great match as well. Although it has a Marietta address, it's right off the highway, and can get there faster from Midtown, than some intown restaurants (20 minutes or so straight up I-75)
