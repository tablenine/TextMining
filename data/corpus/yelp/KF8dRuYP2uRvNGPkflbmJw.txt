Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
I really can't say anything bad about Taste.  The food was great and reasonably priced for the quality and "fanciness".  The atmosphere is quaint, classy and perfect for a romantic evening.   And I had some of the best, friendliest and most attentive service of anyplace I've been to in LA.  The white truffle oil and mushroom mac and cheese is great.  I had the beef short ribs braised in red wine which were fork tender and incredibly flavorful.  They even have Chimay Rouge Cap in the bottle which was a great compliment to the short ribs.  Even found plenty of street parking ....although it was a Tuesday night so you probably won't be so lucky on a Thurs-Sat night but stil I will return to this little gem.
