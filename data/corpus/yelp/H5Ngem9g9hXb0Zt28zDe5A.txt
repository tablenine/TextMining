Restaurant: Wahoo! A Decatur Grill
Category: American (New)
I'm not gonna lie here...this place is fantastic!  I just got home and before my food coma fully hits I will tell you about it!  We made reservations yesterday- no prob.  I just emailed pam@wahoo or something like that- its on the website.  We had 7 people and got the fixed menu which was wonderful.  You sit down, get drinks, and then decide on an entree.  Then the food just keeps rolling out, perfectly on schedule.  We had calamari, mussels, and crab cakes all served family style which was fantastic!  We polished it off and then after a perfect lull the entrees came out.  I couldn't decide on seared ahi tuna or the 10" NY strip.  I finally went with the tun and oh.my. GAWD it was soooo good.  Barely seared, encrusted with peppercorns and a spicy sweet sauce....mmmmmm.  And as if it couldn't get better... they brought out a big bowl of both blackberry cobbler and bread pudding   Our server was a fantastic delight.  He was knowledgable about wine and was invisible when we were having conversations.  We never seemed to need anything.  If I was a tuna I would die to be at Wahoo again!  Even if I was lightly seared.
