Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
My absolute favorite Prime Rib restaurant!  It's probably unfair to say this place tastes better than Ruth Chris's or Morton's, but it does.  I know, I know Lawry's is primarily a Prime Rib restaurant and the other's serve up the whole cow.  It's just that the meat is so juicy and the sides are beyond rich, you are left falling asleep on those fru fru soft oversized pillows called a 'seat' only a Police/Firetruck's siren could wake you up.  Fortunately, there are plenty those racing along La Cienega.
