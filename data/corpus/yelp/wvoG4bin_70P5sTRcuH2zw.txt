For all you people who are willing to pay 5 bucks for a frozen beverage but are complaining about price of good quality meat made fresh get over it.  I like the fact that they use 90% energy efficient induction and all the meat is antibiotic and hormone free so I think the price is quite fare when you take it into consideration. Also there is no msg or food coloring not that I mind but I have friends that are allergic and it is always nice to have a place to recommend to them.. .  That being said I think that the buns are delicious and the cute names tickle me pink every time I come here like the chairman mao bao.  The beef is well seasoned and braised to perfection the pork is tender. I would recommend this place for a light lunch or a snack; the staff is always friendly and while the decor is bare bones its always clean.. . I have no problem paying for quality and this place is well worth it besides getting down to brass tacks 4.50 a piece is still pretty darn reasonable I always leave happy and eager to return for more.
