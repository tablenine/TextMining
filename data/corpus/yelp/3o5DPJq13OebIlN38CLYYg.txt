Worlds biggest pancakes!  WOW, how fun!  We got take out because we didn't want to wait in line so I can't really comment on how long the wait really is.  I can say that our order was ready by the time we walked there from the Laemmle down the road.  . . I got the teacher's pet pancakes.  I asked them to add walnuts but they forgot to do that.  Aside from forgetting the walnuts, my pancakes were fantastic!  They were HUGE, I didn't even eat 1/4 of them.  Heavy too...and I sure felt heavy after eating them!  They had cinnamon apples baked into them and they also had them on top.  Warm cinnamon apples, does it get any better than that?  . . Paul was real excited to find out that they carry chili from his favorite chili place in Encino, Chili My Soul.  They have four or five different flavors a day actually!  He got a bowl of Texas Pride chili that came with garlic toast and three toppings.  Neither of us liked his toast but that is OK everything else was great.  Paul LOVED the chili, he actually said several times that it tasted better than it has the last few times he went to the actual restaurant in Encino!  Very cool!  . . We loved the Griddle Cafe!!!!!!!!!!  I hope we go back soon.  Oh, and how cute are the waiters that work there????  WOW, kudos to the owners for hiring hotties!  I think Paul even caught me staring at one of them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
