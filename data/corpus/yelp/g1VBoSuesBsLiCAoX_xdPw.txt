Very cool 'little' bar. And I mean little. Get there early or go alone if you go as the place is tiny and always packed. Large crowds are pretty much screwed, but there is a small outdoor area you might can get at if it's cooler out. Good selection of beer, large selection of liquor, and pretty good food too. If you're on your own or a party of two, head on over.
