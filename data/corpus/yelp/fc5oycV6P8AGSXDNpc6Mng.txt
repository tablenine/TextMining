Their 40 clove chicken is probably their best dish there! It is really well prepared and flavorful.  And it's not dry, a huge plus.But that's about it.. .  I've been there many times, and usually with friends that have never been to an ALL GARLIC place.  But with all the varied dishes, often shared  among my friends in Asian family style way, I've been pretty disappointed. . . We've had their seafood dishes, steak and pasta .. . I DO NOT recommend their seafood. We had zuppa de pesce (seafood soup), while it had large chucks of seafood, the quality of the seafood was bad. It is a rather simple soup, in terms of number of ingredients, but freshness is key.  The dish is certainly not worth the $19.95- $49.95 price tag (difference between size of soup). Odd, and sad really, considering they have other seafood restaurants. I've been to their Crab House (in SF, and I will review that soon). . . Second, their prime rib I have no complaints about the quality of the meat, it is nice. But in terms of the uniqueness or staying to the garlic theme, they are not really hitting the mark.  They do include garlic mashed potatoes. . . Their pasta--their dishes are simple and not impressive. . . Overall, a nice place to try and definitely an experience but not a place I would go regularly.
