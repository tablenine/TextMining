Hey you! Are you lookin' for a cup of coffee and a selection of comfort foods or maybe a delicious sandwich or pastry to get your drunk ass home after 2 A.M.? Or you might want to be served by a cute, surly, little old lady who doesn't like your haircut and is possibly pissed she has to work the overnight shift? If so then this may be your place. I mean seriously this place is an icon. It has so much history and a legacy of great food and good times to uphold. I would give this place 4 stars just on the amount of fun I have had here and the things and people I have seen over the years. People watching here is A+ and adds to the nostalgia. Plus it's 24 hours. You have to appreciate having anything this great available to you at all hours of the day. And if Max's across the street is crowded you can always hit the Kibitz Room. Sit in Rodney's booth if he isn't...Or join him.
