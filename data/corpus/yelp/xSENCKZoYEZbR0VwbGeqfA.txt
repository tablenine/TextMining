Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I drove north from SD and somehow ended up in Ensenada! Seeing that I stumbled upon the best fish taco place, I had to try it even though I just stuffed my belly with a big juicy hamburger 15 minutes before! I paid a buck-fifty for the taco and a buck straight for some fresh horchata, no tax! With those prices I must really be in Mexico, right?. . After paying, the lady dipped the fish in the batter and fried it right before my eyes. A few minutes later, I was handed a fresh fish taco - just a corn tortilla and the strip of fish. Â I walked over to the salsa bar and smothered the taco with some shredded cabbage, HOT mango salsa, HOT guacamole, and topped it with some orgasmic cream! YUM!!! You'll want to consume your taco right away and there's lots of indoor and patio seating perfect for that. I would've bought another after finishing the first one if I wasn't already full when I entered the place! . . I was finally reminded that I was in LA when I saw the art for sale on the walls and the friendly Caucasian owner who seemed to really appreciate the business. Next time I want the best fish tacos, I'll remember that I only have to drive north 2 hours from SD to get the best from Ensenada!
