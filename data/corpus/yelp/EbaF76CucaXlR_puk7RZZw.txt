Restaurant: Uncle Bill&#39;s Pancake House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
It was a Saturday morning and we decided to check out Uncle Bills Pancake house for breakfast. Parking was easy to find right around the corner, but it was metered as is all the parking in that area so we had to keep an eye on that. Uncle Bill's was very busy and we were seated in the back corner outside. I liked the patio area but it was very crowded and we were basically eating on top of other people around us. I ordered the breakfast burrito (which I was not a big fan of). I felt that the eggs were undercooked and I didn't like that basic overall set up of the burrito. My girlfriend ordered an English muffin and a fruit cup and a chopped banana from the sides order because she wasn't very hungry. They forgot the banana and we ended up having to take it off the bill. We were also overlooked a lot when we needed something as it was so crowded that the waitress was covering many tables at once. The location was great and when we were waiting for our name to be called, we walked down to the beach and touched the water for a little while. Overall, the food was ok and the location and staff were nice, but we were packed into the patio like sardines and it felt like an inconvenience to everyone else when we wanted to go to the bathroom.
