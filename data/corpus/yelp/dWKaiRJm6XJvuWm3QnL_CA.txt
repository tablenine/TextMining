came here for lunch but we didnt have a lunch menu.. however we were given a hot &amp; yummy fried ball of potato with minced meat in it (i dont know the name) &amp; i diiiiied.. . then our orders came. mine was the pulled pork plate with black beans, plain rice, &amp; glazed &amp; fried plantains. it was sooo satisfying.. . i was so stupid that i didnt know it came with a handful of raw onions on top &amp; I HATE it. so i had to remove it. i guess i could have asked them to grill it for me, so that is my fault.. . my friend ordered the fried yummy rice with chicken. the chicken just came off the bones &amp; it was sooo good too.. . great lunch!!! great vibe, good service, really awesome food!
