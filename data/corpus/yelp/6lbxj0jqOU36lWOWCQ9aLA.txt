Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Sorry Ugo, you might have gotten higher if you were located in the suburbs or ventura county, but we hold our restaurants to a higher standard here in civilization.. . I do like your outdoor seating.  You really help make my neighborhood into the charming "we-enjoy-life-one-step-at-a-time" destination that it is.  BUT that is why I expect more from you.. . I've only tried various pasta dishes and every one has been so so.  It feels as if I am eating at a Maria's Italian Kitchen.  Downtown culver city is NOT a strip mall spot, so I believe the food shouldn't feel like it belongs there.  If only Ugo could have the food of Alejo's or Fioretto's...Oh to dream the dream!!!
