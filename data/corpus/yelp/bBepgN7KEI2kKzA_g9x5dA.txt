I was very impressed with Pizzeria Mozza.  To be honest, I was expecting to be underwhelmed considering I had such high expectations from all the hype.  Well, I came out craving more!  . . We ate family style beginning with bruschette pane bianco, we also got a cheese and tomato dish to top the pane but I can't recall its name at the moment.  The tomatoes were absolutely amazing.  To accompany our meal we ordered a sparkling wine called La Brusca recommended by the waiter.  It was definitely tasty and everyone likes bubbly, right?  We ordered two pizzas to split between the three of us, the first being the margherita with mozzarella, tomato and basil.  A common pizza but it was perfect, the sauce has a nice tang to it and the crust was perfect.  Our second pizza included gorgonzola dolce, fingerling potatoes, radicchio, and rosemary.  The waiter warned us it was bitter but we all enjoyed the unique flavor.. . Upon first review of the dessert menu I wasn't sure I would like any of the desserts offered.  Not being a huge pumpkin fan but interested by the menu item I selected to pumpkin gelato pie.  I was in heaven when it arrived, it was full of flavor but not overly rich.  The candied pecans were perfection on top of the gelato pie and the rum raisin sauce was a perfect sauce for this desert.  My dinner mates chose the caramel copetta with marshmallow sauce.  The mix of sweet and salty in a frozen dessert was fantastic.. . At first the prices seem steep for pizza but considering the quality and amazing flavors it is well worth it.
