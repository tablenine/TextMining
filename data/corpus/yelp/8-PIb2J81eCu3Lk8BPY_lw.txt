I came here for lunch with my coworker after hearing so many good things from my cousin who also works nearby. Let me tell you, from the moment I walked in I was in complete and utter awe. I really felt like I stepped into a NYC restaurant as seen in Sex and the City!. . The place is very spacious and primarily all white with a bar, open kitchen and small side gourmet market. There is a huge brick pizza oven in the back of the dining room where you can watch the chefs makes pizzas. The atmosphere was very casual and laid back, which was nice when you feel lost in a sea of business suits! And I found the waitstaff to be very welcoming, attentive and unpretentious. They even offered us free samples while we waited for our table! . . After feeling so overwhelmed by the different choices on the menu, my coworker and I finally decided to share the calamari and Napoli pizza with pepperoni. The calamari was very light yet flavorful and we could tell that the pizza was made with the freshest ingredients. Needless to say, we were very satisfied and content with our lunch. And the best part? the price! it didn't cost us an arm and a leg. It was very decent and reasonable.. . On my way out I decided to try the macarons from the gourmet market. They gave me a free chocolate one as a sample and I purchased a lemon and raspberry to go. I have never had a french macaron in my life but I thought they were all delicious! I will definitely be coming back again soon!
