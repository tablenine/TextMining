Category: Barbeque
This place is great only about $20 a head and you get to eat all you want.  The best plate to order is the bogogi and the beef plank steak or ribs...I forgot but you cook it yourself and you get alot of side dishes to come with it...like korean pancakes which are like eggs onlions in a pancake batter but not sweet...JUST DELICIOUS!! and then they have different kinds of salad for you too...the regular korean salad which is a bit tangy but great and then the potato salad and the pickled vegies...which I love.  This place is great for group parties and birthday...speaking of birthdays you can order a bottle of champagne and then they ....well I will leave the surprise for you don't want to ruin it. =^.^=
