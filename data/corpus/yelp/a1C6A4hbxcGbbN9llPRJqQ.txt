Rather on the spendy side of dining out, two entrees with two sides (and no appetizers or drinks) was $100. That said, it was delicious!. . Our servers were all very attentive and knew the menu, though they seemed quite eager to add alcohol to the tab, which we consistently refused. The porterhouse pork chop was massive - at least two inches thick - and was served on a bed of grits. Perfectly cooked, it was tender and flavorful. The braised pork ribs were excellent, served with red cabbage and spatzele.. . The menu seems to change based on what's available, so if they don't have the duck-fat fried potatoes, you'll be missing out. More like really thick potato chips, they are absolutely excellent.. . Would I return? Probably not. I was a little surprised by the price.
