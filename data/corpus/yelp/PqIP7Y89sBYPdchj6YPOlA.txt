this is the kind of restaurant that make a neighborhood a neighborhood!. Anything with in walking distance is five stars to me, but a place that really cares about what they make-puts me over the moon. The crabcake benedict is something that my husband and I fight over. The bake shop is the best, I ordered 60 cupcakes for a meeting- and no one ever misses an early morning meeting with me now. Every morning when I walk the dogs I walk bye the bakers window, and there she is icing a beautiful cake. It is the way to start your day!
