As the 798th reviewer of Porto's there's really not a lot to add.  It's amazing.  Love it.  Glad I don't live nearby or I would be buying larger jeans.. . My friend had me meet her here for brunch before I caught a flight home out of Burbank.  I had a fried potato ball filled with meat; a steak sandwich that was like the best taco you've ever had, but with bread instead of a taco; and chicken noodle soup.  They were all awesome.  Then  my friend showed up and ordered one of every dessert (almost -- lol) and I tried those, and they were all amazing as well.  . . Yay Porto's :) Considering how lacking the food options at Burbank airport are, this is definitely the preflight place to grab some food.  If you're in a rush, just make it to go -- you'll definitely make the security guards envious.. . Oh, and I should have mentioned -- this place is ridiculously cheap.
