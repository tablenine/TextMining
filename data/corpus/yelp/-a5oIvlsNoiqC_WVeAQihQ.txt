This is the only place to get something to eat after nuking your liver with posh drinks at East-West.  I love their Pastrami and their home made pickles.  Everything in their bakery looks amazing and their staff is quick and friendly.  The only thing I dislike about this place is their bathroom.  It's on the second floor, off to some dark, rickety corner with poor lighting which I guess is convenient if you're in the upstairs lounge.  If you get a chance, stop by and check out one of their shows.  The bands that play here are so indie, you're granted immediate hipster status for catching their show.
