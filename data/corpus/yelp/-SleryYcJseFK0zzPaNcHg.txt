Restaurant: Cafe Istanbul
Category: Turkish
I love this place and I was tempted to rate it much lower since its more recent popularity has made it increasingly difficult to get a table on Fri and Sat nights.  The food is great, even though they will tell you that they are not a Turkish restaurant if you order a falafel (isn't Istanbul in Turkey??).  Anyhow, they have hookahs for around $15 each in a variety of flavors, I recommend the apple, and belly danceres to give it a nice middle eastern feel to it.  The restaurant is split into two parts, one with tables and one where you sit on pillows on the floor.  I go there for drinks occasionally ($$$) but since it is so near to my house, I often go to grab some food.  They have a good vegetarian selection and kabobs for us carnivores.
