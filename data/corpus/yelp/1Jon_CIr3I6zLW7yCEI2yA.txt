Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
What's with all the haters?  Pink's is pretty sweet, I'm a San Diegan and have been there plenty of times.  Sure, the lines are long and you have to sit outside on plastic chairs, but soak in the nostalgia and enjoy yourself a chili dog.  . . *I wonder how many of the people that aren't fans are just comparing it to some East-Coast or Chicago dog?*
