Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
In what seems to be a restaurant catering to the Silverlake Hipster and Yuppie Crowd, the pho at Pho Cafe was surprisingly delicious. . . The place was packed when we got there, but we only waited 5 minutes or so. . . Pho Cafe has an all English menu, and we were the only Asian customers there. I didn't expect the Pho to be authentic, but it turned out to be among the best Pho I've had. The meat is very tender, and the soup is rich with flavor. Service was prompt. My bowl of pho was served hot, perfect for a cold rainy day.. . The location is hard to find, no signs, and parking is difficult. There are about 36 seats packed into the small restaurant. People are seated so very close together.. . But all that is a testament to the food and overall appeal of the place. The place is packed regardless.. . I would venture to say, the down-to-earth unique setting makes it a great spot for a first date.. . The breakdown:. . Noodles: 9/10. Soup Broth: 9/10. Meat: 10/10. Meatball: 8.5/10. My Food Rating = A. . Ambience: 9.5/10. Service / Attitude: 9/10. Clean: 8.5/10. My Experience Rating: B+ . . Location: 7.5/10. Parking: 7/10. Wait: 7.5/10. Payment (Cash): 7/10. Business Hours: 9/10. My Convenience Rating: C. . Pros:. - Tender Rare Beef!!. - Hip Young Crowd . - Minimalistic-Modern Decor and Lighting Fixture. - Unique Down to Earth Setting / Nice and Bright. - Clean for an Asian Restaurant. - Tiger Beer. - Opens til Midnight. . Cons:. - No Signs Outside / Hard to Find. - Parking is Difficult. - Pricey at $7.50 for a regular sized bowl, $3.75 for Beer.. - Cash Only. . TIP: Order #11! Highly recommended.
