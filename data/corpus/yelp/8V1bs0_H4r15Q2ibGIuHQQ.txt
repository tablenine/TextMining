Restaurant: Highland Bakery
Category: Bakeries
If you're looking for bakery/cafe with a nice neighborhood feel, good food, and an unpretentious (albeit a little aloof at times) staff you can't beat Highland Bakery. . . I live in the neighborhood and have been there a couple times. The standard fare is pretty good but I've yet to try the ricotta or sweet potato pancakes. However, I must admit that the few times I've craned over into someone elses plate at the next table it looks pretty impressive. . . I highly reccomend the grits with whatever you have and coming from a newbie to the region that reccomendation doesn't come lightly. If you go there on the weekend, expect to wait so make up your mind before you leave home exactly how long of a wait you can stomach because we all know no one like that person in line who thinks their need to eat is more important than anyone elses.
