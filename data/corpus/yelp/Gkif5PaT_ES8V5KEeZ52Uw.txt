Got introduced to this place from my friends who live in La Canada, but seem to always go to San Gabriel and Alhambra for good eats.  And again, they didn't steer me wrong.  My friends admitted that one week they came here 3 times and got a carry out for lunch the next day - all Hainan Chicken. . . The Hainan Chicken is so tasty.  Incredible that something so simple - chicken, rice, with ginger &amp; hot sauce - can be so addicting.   And so affordable....at $8 - how can you refuse?. . Being newbie to this dish, there are lots of ways to eat it.  Dipping the chicken in the sauces and eating it with the rice or mixing all of the sauces with the rice and enjoying it that way.   I personally prefer the dip and eat while my friends like the more authentic mix and eat. . . We were lucky to come here on a rainy Thursday evening and got seated almost immediately inside.  Don't come here with a group larger than 4 or you'll be stuck waiting for an outdoor spot (unless the weather is super nice).  . . The rest of the menu is interesting - Chinese, Italian (they have pizza and pasta dishes) and French.  I've been told that the escargot are delish as well.  But folks always come here for the chicken.
