Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I have only ordered one thing off the menu at Tito's Tacos for the last decade or so: 2 tacos with cheese. They pile a bunch of chips and salsa in the box with the tacos and send me on my way. For the next few moments I am in taco heaven... and a few hours later I am in bathroom hell. Is it worth it? ...yeah. ...yeah, it's worth it. Totally.
