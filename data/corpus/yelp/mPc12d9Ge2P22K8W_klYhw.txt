Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The cities of Arcadia, Monterey Park, El Monte, and Alhambra have the best Chinese &amp; Taiwanese food in the greater Los Angeles Area.  Unrivaled in taste and presentation... They just do things better out here.  Din Tai Fung is no exception. . . I would bare-knuckle box a medium sized bear over the food at this dumpling house and as I emerge victorious I would celebrate by eating juicy bear meat dumplings w/crab made by the chefs at DTF.          . . Go with a big party so you can order as many dishes as possible.  Truly nothing bad on the menu... can't really make any mistakes...but I do Recommend the following:. . Juicy Pork Dumplings  (Xiao Long Bao). Juicy Pork &amp; Crab Dumplings. Fried Green Pea Shoots . Noodles w/ Minced Pork. Shanghai Rice Cakes. Red Bean Dumplings. . *Do not forget to add the chili oil to you soy sauce/vinegar/ginger dipping mix.. . The staff is always moving as the place is in a constant state of extreme chaos. But, they manage to provide great attention to detail and execute service with tremendous efficiency.  This place is a little bit far... but it is never a wasted trip. . . Highly Recommended
