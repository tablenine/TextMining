Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I was expecting the hot dog to be pretty amazing...afterall I and others wait in ine for a nice amount of time...but ite was okay...ive honestly had better. However, the chili cheese fries are pretty amazing...and made up for my high expectations of the hot dog..and for some reason the variety of hot dogs made me want to still go back...and yes its cash only....and i didnt realize that until i got to the front of the line after like 30 some minutes...thankfully i had cash but be warned...bring miney and of course its not expensive
