I happened to like the concept of this all organic restaurant nestled into what used to Latin Kings territory.  The food was a bit pricey but, since it's all organic I expected to pay a little more than usual-almost as if you switched to Whole Foods from Jewel.  . . I was particularly hungry this day so I ordered the turkey chili and the Mexican flatbread.  The turkey was good but a little bit on the salty side however the flatbread I had was freaking good.  The ingredients were very fresh tasting and the bread that all the melted goodies came on was to die for.  I think they take big pride in their bread and it shows on all angles bread should be judged on.  . . I may be a bit biased because our waitress was cool and it was empty when my friend and I went to eat there, but overall the experience was good and I would definitely go back and try the other flat breads.. . p.s. if you're super hungry get just a cup of the chili and a flatbread.  I almost threw up the organic goodness after I ate.
