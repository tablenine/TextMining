Usually, when I'm paying $16 for a burger, I expect the chef to personally bow at my feet and thank me for patronizing his restaurant.  And $8 for a Red Stripe?  I mean, I know New York is expensive so I should probably shut up about it... but really?. . That is really the only reason I downgraded my review from 4 to 3.  I can't help it, but while the burgers were delicious, a turkey burger is not worth $16.  I can get the same enjoyment out of the one I pick up at my local diner on Tuesdays.  And they serve it with feta fries.. . But RARE does know its burgers.  The patty was perfectly moist, yet firm, with an amazing black olive tapenade and feta dressing.  The side of fries we ordered were those thin, crispy shoe-strings that I'd take over steak fries, any day.  The vibe of the place was upscale, but relaxed.  A bit cramped and loud, as though it were trying to replicate the scene of a regular burger joint.  Honey, when you charge that much for a burger, a "burger joint" you are not.  Stick to your craft but give your patrons more room so there's not a chorus of, "HOW much for a burger?"  I probably wouldn't have noticed if the couple beside me didn't gawk at their bill.  I was in New York and willing to spend.  But their reaction, and the reaction of the woman behind me, made me second guess my decision.
