Taiwanese Food baby! They have good wiener rice but more importantly they have the absolutely best shaved ice!!! BUT BEWARE OF THE KILLER SUPER SUN VISOR! (check out my photos for a visual reference). . This place has hands down the best Taiwanese shaved ice ever. The topping list is extensive and you get 5 toppings per order! You can also have FLAN (pudding) as a topping! So good!  Unless you are a huge ice fan like myself, you should share it.  Toppings include:. . *Peaches. *Pineapples. *Lychee. *Almond Jello. *Flan (home made!). *Mochi. *Peanuts (gross). *Taro Chunks. *Condensed Milk. *Mung Beans. *Red Beans. * + More!. . The coolest thing about this place is that the ice is doused with a generous portion of brown sugar syrup that gives the ice a nice flavor rather than being boring ice.  Sometimes they lay it on a little too thick but just tell them easy on the sweet syrup.  Be ready to wait a long ass time for ice in the summer time, because everyone and their moms come here for ice.  Also, keep in mind that they are closed on Tuesdays (what a random day). Fo Sho come try the ice!
