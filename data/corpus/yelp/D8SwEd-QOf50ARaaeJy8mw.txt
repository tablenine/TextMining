Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
If your looking for a place where you can just dig your hands into and get it all over your face, this is definitely your place. The boiling crab is a unique experience with seafood, its earthy and gypsy like serving your food in a bag with all sorts of spicy, lemony, or garlic-y types of sauces. I adore the sheer creativity of this restaurant and the fun environment, here you can write on the walls! And they like it! take your friends, boyfriends, girlfriends and have some fun at this place =D. . Only downside is the the super tiny parking and the waiting time for this place, they don't take reservations and the waiting time is never shorter then 15-45 minutes.
