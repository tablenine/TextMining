Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
i remember stumbling upon this spot with a friend of mine and it was around 1am. the ramen is really good and the decor in the restaurant makes you feel like you're in Japan for a second. haven't been back in quite some time since Koraku (left one block from here) stays open a lot longer (3am). nevertheless, booya daikokuya.
