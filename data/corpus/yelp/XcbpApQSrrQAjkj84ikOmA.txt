BYOW FREE corkage.  My boyfriend's favorite place to bring a date apparently lol and he finally took me here! (\(o'-'o)/) yay. . A very small restaurant and it is a bit crowded but the place is very cozy.  We had a reservation at 8:30pm, we got there at 8:30pm and got seated right away.  The service was great.  Considering how busy the place was our waitress was very attentive.. . We ordered socca cakes (mediterranean chickpea crepes with mojo de cilantro dipping sauce) . http://static.px.yelp.....  (oopsies its sideways), Bacalao Salt Cod Cakes with aioli . http://static.px.yelp.....  , Wood Oven Roasted Mushrooms and fire roasted sobrasada (ground chorizo sausage on olive oil focaccia) . http://static.px.yelp..... .  My favorite was the Cod Cakes but the other dishes were as good!  Very flavorful and went well with our Zinfandel. We brought our own wine, munched on these great tapas, and had a wonderful time :). . I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't so crowded.  But I would DEFINITELY come back here and try the other dishes!  I love this place :) Thanks TT!
