my fiance is a meat eater and im not, but we decided to go here anyways. luckily they had salads so i had that. the honey dijon mustard was really good but as i got to the last bite, i noticed something tiny on one of the tomatoes. this was none other than a dead ladybug, just my luck. i didn't complain but also felt like barfing at the same time. the lamb, on the other hand, according to fiance, was really good. sorry, this was a really crappy review.
