Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
This place is known for its xiao long bao (XLB).  However, its not as good as its sister restaurants in Hong Kong or Taiwan or anywhere else in Asia.  They are very close to perfect but not quite there.  They are served in metal steamers and not the bamboo steamers that I ate on at the DTF in Hong Kong (Kowloon).  The XLB are still a little more doughy on top than the counterparts.  They also don't have everything on the menu that its counterparts have.  Although I am disappointed in this dumpling house, it is still very good and is a must for anyone who wants great dumplings.  Very close to perfection, but still not quite as good as the ones you'll get in Asia.  But, I guess you don't have to fly there to get it.  . . Pros: XLB. . Cons: Not the full menu that its sister restaurants have.  No color menu either.  Although the menu is limited, it still would be nice to see things in color.
