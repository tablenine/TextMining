Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I am going to preface this by saying - this is the first time I have ever had Korean BBQ... I have no idea what to compare it to (or really what the heck I was doing or how I was supposed to eat most of the dishes.). . That being said... DANG! This place was gooooooood.. . I am glad a friend gave me a few pointers (like they bring out lots of appetizers - and try the galbi) because I would have wondered what all I was getting. To those of us with no clue, all you really know is you ordered a grill item. If you do look at the back portion of the menu, it tells that they will bring you a selection of the appetizers, but I noticed this after we started to order.. . We ordered the marinated galbi (their signature dish), the spicy pork and the veggies. As if by magic, all sorts of little dishes appeared with tasty bits of kimchi, seaweed (I loved this stuff), radish, broccoli, sprouts and a few other things I had no idea about. We finished a few items and they brought more!. . Portions.. holy crap.. there were 2 of us and we ordered waaaayyy more food then should be allowed. I am glad my volleyball playing friend manned up and did some justice to the pork and veggies, I just couldn't hang. . . The meat was juicy and tender and had a lovely marinade. The pork was indeed spicy but had a lovely flavor to it. They brought out a steamed egg that was pretty tasty.. I am not even sure I can cover all the things that were brought to the table. SO MUCH!! . . I seriously feel like a tick about to pop.. but it was so worth the discomfort. . . The service was very friendly and prompt. I felt for all we ordered, the prices were very fair and the food was awesome. I would love to know how many of those grates they go through a night... they changed ours numerous times. . . I will definitely be back - next time in stretchy pants, I think.
