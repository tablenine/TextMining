What can I say, the pizza is good.. I love pizzerias that uses real coal ovens vs the common gas ones, the added flavor is priceless :). . The only drawback is that their pizza margarita is topped with mozzarella cheese, and overall, lacking the proper amount of cheese, imho.. The prosciutto pizza was delicious!. crust is perfect, sauce is perfect.. . cant wait to go their again.. this time, i'm bringing beer. (its BYOB)
