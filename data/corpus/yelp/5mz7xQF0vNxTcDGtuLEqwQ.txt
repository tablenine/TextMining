Another spot in Little Tokyo which is filled with Japanese people so you know it's legit.  That's the mark of a good Asian restaurant.. well authenticity wise at least.  . . The wait is kind of long here.. we were a little late for our reservation and we had to wait another 15 minutes.  . . The sashimi deluxe special is really worthwhile on the menu.  Fresh.. varied.. large spread... great deal!  The mistake we made was that we thought the sushi deluxe special would be as good.. it's not.  Saw the salmon teriyaki.. quite large piece of salmon.. so you wouldn't be going wrong with that either.. . The only thing I wish ther was... more rolls.  They had maybe a handful of rolls where half of them were California or cooked ones.. if they have fresh fish, they should show it off with tasty exotic rolls!
