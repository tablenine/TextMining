Like chicken? Sweet.. Like waffles? Might be the best anywhere.. Like orange soda? They've got that too.. . Just don't let Big Mama catch you with your elbows on the table--she'll slap you. If only I were kidding.. . (PLUS bootleg DVDs, fake jewelry, and a cornucopia of trinkets available right outside on the sidewalk!)
