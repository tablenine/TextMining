Milk is a cute little spot for a quick bite to eat or to get yourself a milkshake. . . My favorite is their pozole. I know its not made quite the traditional way but I love it. The broth, hominy, shredded pork all good. The only unfortunate thing is that they only serve this bowl of greatness Sundays and Mondays...Shame on them! . . As for the other items, the sandwiches and salads are a hit or miss. The owner recommended the Media Noche and I was happy with that choice. I haven't tried any of their sweets but I have tried their malt and that always hits the spot. . . Writing this review is making want their pozole....
