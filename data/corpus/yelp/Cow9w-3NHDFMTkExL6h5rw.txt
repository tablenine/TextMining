Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Loves:. Toffee Milkshake - Very thick and crunchy. Banana Ice Cream Cake - SO GOOD an ice cream cake! They use real bananas so the color looks kinda ugly (like almost a light brown) but it tastes very, very yummy. Make sure to defrost though so you don't need a sledgehammer to cut into it.. Oreo ice cream bar - One of my fav. desserts at Milk but it is really big for an ice cream bar and kinda difficult to eat because there are actual oreos on the outside. Make sure you have a napkin!. . Decent (Their food portions might be on the smaller end.). Chicken orecchiette pasta. Ahi tuna
