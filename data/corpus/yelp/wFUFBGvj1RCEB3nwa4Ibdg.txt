If you're sick of the typical LA scene and want to get away for some good coffee, try this place. Even though it is one of those trendy coffee shops in LA, I differentiate LA Mill for being in Silverlake. One time I went there with a friend to sip on some coffee and read for a bit for our finals. We sat by the window, and it was raining outside. I felt as if I were in San Francisco, with all the big green (not palm) trees and wet leaves outside. It was really nice. We got all moody and ended up closing our books. I called my friend in San Francisco and she called her dad in Korea. Good times.. . I only go to LA Mill for coffee, so I can't comment on its food. But the drip coffee is really good. It has a variety, so if you're not sure what you want, ask the server for some suggestions and she (I always get the same server for some reason) will kindly help you out.
