Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
Uncle Julios is always a treat, now it's not the best mexican restaurant in the world.. as they are typically found in mexico... but it's a wonderful, boisterous atmosphere best shared with a large group of friends.. . I love their outdoor patio, perfect for those warm summer nights where you can enjoy the delicious fare and of course one too many cerveza or margaritas.... . . I especially appreciate their tortilla chips, they are light and crispy, so that by the time you receive your entree you are not stuffed to the brim... and you can actually enjoy it... . After a long day at the ball game, after a traipse around the city, after a kayak tour, or just wandering the neighborhood... you can always find uncle julio's hacienda a warm and inviting place for friends and family to meet up, tell stories and catch up from the busy world.
