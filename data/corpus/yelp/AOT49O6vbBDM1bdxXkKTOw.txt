Overrated?  ok maybe it is a bit overrated.  I only say that because there is NO food that I know of that's worth a 2+ hour wait!  And this is a TACO truck for crying out loud.... . The Kogi we went to was located on Abbot Kinny in Venice.  We went there just to check it out and if the wait is ridiculous we were gonna head to in-n-out instead.  But lucky us~ the line wasn't that long :) . . We waited about 15 mins to get our tacos, burritos and a kogi dog. . I got a spicy pork taco:  . http://static.px.yelp..... . a shot ribs taco: . http://static.px.yelp..... . a short rib burrito: . http://static.px.yelp..... . and a hotdog . http://static.px.yelp.....  that was not so good. . . I liked the burrito more than anything but the tacos were pretty good too!  It was definitely something I have never tasted before.  I couldn't tell if they use jalapeno or kimchi for the spices.  It did have a little pickled flavor to it tho.. . If you haven't tried it, you should try it :D  I mean I wouldn't suggest waiting 2 hours but hey it was worth it for some people!
