I don't know about you guys that gaved this place a low rating, this place have been around for a long time and if you're old school and love pastrami sandwich the way it's suppose to be made this is the place to go. Â Best pastrami sandwich in LA County on my opinion. =0). . The pastrami is so good, it can be deadly and give you a hearth attack. =0)
