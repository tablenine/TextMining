Went for lunch (I like my dinner here liquid, with a side of breasts and thighs) and was trying to eat healthy.  Oops!  Yeah, that was stupid on my part - I ordered the Thai Chicken Salad.  It was colder than my beer, had absolutely no taste to the dressing and was devoid of much chicken at all.  The two guys that I was with actually ordered like real men and got burgers and they were fairly satisfied with them.  . . Go here for the drinks and leave your healthy eating for another time.  My server had the personality of a doormat.
