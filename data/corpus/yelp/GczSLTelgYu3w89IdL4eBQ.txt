Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
Just got back from Fred 62 again... . . This place is one of our crew's favorite places to eat after a night of club and/or barhopping in Hollywood. If we don't end up at Sanam or Korean food, it's usually Fred 62. It looks cool, and the food is good.. . I love the peanut butter shakes! . . And the smoked salmon breakfast sandwich, which is filled with a huge piece of smoked salmon, hash browns, cream cheese, scrambled egg, and a tomato, all fit in between a super buttery bun. Soo good.. . My friends always order the Jucy Lucy burger, Fred McMurray brkfst sandwiches, or even some asian soups, like the BangBang. Fred62 does serve vegetarian dishes, but they dont look appealing to me. (female friends have ordered that crap while at Fred62 w/me). . I have tried the pancakes, which were "aight" but the french toast looks really good. Also tried the chicken salad sandwich, which wasn't too tasty at Fred's, so I was disappointed. However, if you stick to the classics like peanut butter shakes and the breakfast sandwiches, you can't go wrong!. . Kinda pricy though, for what you get! Make sure you dont blow all your dough on valet parking and drinks at the club before you go to Fred's, or at least bring a credit card! . . One time, we sat down and noticed we were next to Cut Chemist from Jurassic 5, which was pretty cool. We just gave him his props and we continued eating. I dont know why the hell I wrote about this, but why the hell not.. . BTW: very cool looking, clean bathroom. very clean overall.
