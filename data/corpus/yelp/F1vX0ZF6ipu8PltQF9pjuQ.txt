Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
Savoy is my first and favorite Hainan chicken restaurant. If they're not busy, I suggest asking the waitresses to make it all dark meat. I'm not a big fan of the pizza bread; I find it a little dry and bland. But the lemon ice tea is awesome AND they give you free refills and top you off on your way out. The pastas are not bad either, but don't walk in expecting it to be Italian-styled.
