I've been here three times so far, and this is a great place for Lunch and Breakfast foods. Great variety of Salads, Sandwiches, Burgers and Egg dishes as well. I recommend the Turkey Burger, and the Tucson Salad... and make sure you try the sweet potato fries. They have great red velvet cupcakes as well. Portions are big, and service is fast. Try sitting outside when its warm. Nice waiters and parking can be hard to find though.
