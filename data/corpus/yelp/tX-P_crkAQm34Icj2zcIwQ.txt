Wow. By far the best restaurant I've BYOB'd ever.. . I came in town for a wedding as with some others. My friend and I decided to come here for a little classy dinner style. We somehow got a table with 11 on a Friday night and had a fantastically drunk and tasty 2 hours. The waiter was patient, helpful and energetic. The prices were reasonable and the food--awesome.. . With at least 4 other people, I got the quail, which was one of the best meals I've had at a restaurant... ever. With ratatouille, to add. We were the last people in the restaurant and drunkenly walked out for an even drunker late evening.
