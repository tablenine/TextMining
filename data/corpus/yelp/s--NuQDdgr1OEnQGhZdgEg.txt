Restaurant: Café Bombay
Category: Indian
Cafe Bombay is now officially my go-to Indian place in Atlanta.  Being variety-lover than I am, I *love* the lunch buffet.  Picture 2 buffet bars, one vegetarian and one for the meat-eaters, each with 5 or 6 different dishes and flanked by various desserts and sauces.  As far as I can tell, the selection is, for the most part, constant with a few rotating dishes.. . Some of my personal favorites:  . Chicken TIkka Masala- sweet and creamy. Bombay Aloo- delicious potatoes. Navratan Korma- creamy mixed veggie curry. Chicken 65-  I think they call it something else, but it's basically the same thing as the Chicken 65 I've seen elsewhere.  Little fried chicken strips with spices. See Kyle S.'s review.. . The staff is always friendly and is sure to keep your glass full, which is definitely key at an Indian restaurant.  That said, none of the food on the buffet is spicy at all, which is probably my only complaint.  I mean I understand that it is a buffet and everyone has to eat it, so you can't make it super spicy.  But come on!  It's Indian food!  Maybe just two or three spicy things?. Either way, go, try it, it's easily one of the best Indian buffets I've encountered.
