The food is great!! The tortilla soup is the best I've ever had. Trying to sit on the patio requires good timing or a lot of patience but well worth the wait.. Delivery is a gamble though. Twice they never showed. When I called the driver already went home. They always seem to forget sides, napkins etc.......so I would suggest eating there to avoid frustration. . They have a cool little bar too.
