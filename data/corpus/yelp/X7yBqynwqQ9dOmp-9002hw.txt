We begin with 3 stars for the nice bathrooms, nice doormen, and nice atmosphere overall.. . Limited amount of food on menu: -1 star. Delicious burger that was one of the few food items available on limited menu: +1 star. Seeing the "no food additions/subtractions/exceptions will be made to any order" comment on the menu and feeling slightly peeved at the slightly snotty tone: -1 star. Delicious thin fries to go with the delicious burger: +2 stars (I'm a sucker for thin fries). Getting charged $8 for a peche lambic when I know that I could get an entire bottle for the same price at the local Trader Joe's: -1 star. . Wasn't disappointed in the place, but wasn't blown away either.
