Okay first off I've eaten probably a gazillion bowls of ramen in my lifetime, from cup o noodles, to my grammas home made. . I love their noodles, and especially love to watch the entire creative process (if you sit at the counter) how they boil and drain the noodles, and how they slap it all together and serve it to you piping hot. Oishi! Add a bowl of rice and gyozas and well it is the shitz.. Back to the ramen, I'm so low brow (cup o noodles) that my tastebuds really don't scream at me with nirvana. . Therefore the 4 stars.. . What I hate is the wait and the hipsters and dipshits. Me included.
