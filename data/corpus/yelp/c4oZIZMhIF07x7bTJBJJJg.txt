What a spot.  Great locale to start a night out in the Highlands bouncing around.  Gets a little smoky in the evening with the late crowd so come early and sit in the dining room if that bothers you.  Allison is the bomb, she was bartending last time we went, but I think still waits tables sometimes, ask for her :)  . . The filet and crabcakes are our favorites, and the martinis are the best deal around.  They give you the glass full then you get a nifty little carafe full as well.  We've heard good things about brunch but haven't gotten around to it yet, hopefully soon.. . Get your butts into the Tap!!!
