Went here last night with my bf and some friends.... . Overall experience was good. :) 4 stars because the food was goooood, waitress was overly enthusiastic, but the hostess was a bit snooty. what is with LA and having snooty service? Really? is it reeally that necessary?. . Anywhoos, rating on food I ate:. . - Kobe beef burger with pomme frites...YUM!! Juicy, sweet and salty, with a soft bun with a bit of a crunch. mushrooms, gorgonzola cheese, avocados galoooore! Pomme frites were awesome, but I dont like my frites tooo greasy - and they were a bit on the greasy side.. but good overall.. . -Ahi tuna tar tar appetizer..it was oooook, I've had better - but their sauce was good - cant remember what it was ...but it was a tangy sweet and spicy flavor. - such an amateur rating....lol. . - Bf had the Cumin pork chops..I had mixed feelings on this...I only had a few bites, and I was already feeling like the meat was overwhelmed with the spice...it was really all you could taste. Pork chop was nice and tender and juicy - but tooo much of the Cumin flavor. Probably why they throw in the Mac and cheese in there - THIS WAS AMAZING BY THE WAY....Texture was chewy and hot..yum! Â and the cheese...oh the cheese...please try this. . . Food was good, would totally come here again. would love to come for brunch - see how that is.. . :D
