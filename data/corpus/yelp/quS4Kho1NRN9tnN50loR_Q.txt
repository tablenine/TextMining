TRUST ME, this ain't no Arby's!. . Our professor took us out to lunch here (and no it's not elementary school, it's the good 'ole college education we all pay high prices for), and it was just as tasty my first-time around.. . First time, over a year ago, and amnesia's hitting me.  I just recall my bread not as juicy and soggy, I like my food to drip.  But I do remember the sides... and I'm all about the sides babay.  Coleslaw, tasty.  Potato salad, tasty (but I'm very bias towards all those that are creamy/mayoy/potatoy).  Pasta salad, good. And the cheap yet small iced tea, beam me up scotty!  . . Second time around, yesterday, I ordered a beef with jack cheese  dipped sandwich.  Again, it could be a little soggier.  Only the ends of the sandwich were slightly mushed.  And then my professor taught me another lesson.  To ask to DOUBLE DIP it!!!  And maybe, if necessary, to even TRIPLE DIP it!!!  . . PHILIPPE - until next time.
