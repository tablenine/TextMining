Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Of course I had high expectations for this place.  After all, it is mario Batali's restaurant, but then again HE's not the one cooking in the kitchen.  I also thought to myself, don't have too high of hopes because if I do and they get crushes..I'm NOT going to be very happy.. . So I go in to the restaurant and I really like the decor.  The two HUGE-sized mirrors and the color~ It definitely makes you want to eat pizza :P  My friend orderd a diet coke and out came a mini glass bottle of diet coke. . and it said Coca Cola light.  I thought that was so cute that I had to order a soft drink myself :P  So we started off with Bufala mozzarella &amp; prosciutto di Parma - delicious! Never tried the bufala mozzarella but it's nice n gooey (as my friend described it).  Then we had 4 different pizzas...my FAV was the Bianca w/fontina, mozzarella, sottocenere &amp; sage. SOOO flavorful!  We also had the pizza with the fennel sausage/panna/red onion &amp; scallions, and the prosciutto di parma/rucola/tomato &amp; mozzarella, and a musrhoom pizza (can't find it on the menu online).  We then ordered a caramel/cream/rosemary&amp;peanut cookies dessert and it was sooo delicious!  I especially liked the sea salt in it.. . It's definitely a different pizzeria that you HAVE to go to..and my friend told me she had to call 2-wks in advance to get out reservations for lunch. .all in all it was DELICIOUS! :P
