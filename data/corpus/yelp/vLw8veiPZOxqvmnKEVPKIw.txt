This is something I expect on the Westside, not DTLA, but here it is! . . The service was impeccable. It reminds me of service I get at Petit Robert Bistro in Boston. The waiters were very observant and accommodating to our party of 16. The suggestion of a impromptus prix fixe instead of having us order individual dishes of our own was an elegant move on their part. Smart because it allowed them to showcase some of their favorite dishes to everyone instead of having you just have a snapshot of an individual dish. Service should always be on doing such as making sure waters (complimentary sparking or still) are filled and dishes are out and exemplary rather than simply asking "is everything okay" like in other restaurants. . . I won't repeat what dishes we had since Dawson has it in her review but everything was delicious (I didn't try the fungus fries though b/c I'm personally not a mushroom lover)!. . The place is simple but beautiful. There a takeout display counter, completely open kitchen, and a wood fired pizza oven in the back.. . But don't let the classy look scare you away. In fact, some of us came in with t-shirts and short, broken flip-flops that required emergency trip to Rite-Aid, etc. I saw many kids some here with grandparent age adults as well. Woot to the non-snobby and a sign that you're NOT in the Westside. . . My only gripe is that the bread served in the beginning wasn't warm all all. Would have loved the hot, toasted feel and taste to it!. . Check and check again on where to take tourists AND locals whenever they're in DTLA! . . P.S. I loved how Shauna D noted to the manager that she dines here on a weekly basis. He replies with a name card and a "whatever it is you need"! :D
