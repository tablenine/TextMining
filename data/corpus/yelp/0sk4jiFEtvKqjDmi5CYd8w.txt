Restaurant: Ru San&#39;s Buckhead At Tower Place
Category: Sushi Bars
So there's a new underground club in Atlanta, have you heard of it?  Well, its located in Buckhead and it is known as RuSan's.. . Now, beware, you might get a little sushi in your club, however.  But, if that's what you are looking for, then this destination for you!. . The sushi is ok, and very fair to the wallet, its easy to get a decent meal for under $10.00.  Seating is very packed, and the atmosphere is very loud.  Maybe its the old grouchy man in me, but my idea of a relaxing sushi meal isn't from screaming group of young 20 year old college kids.  But I must admit, the vibe is very lively, and the servers and chefs did there fair share of wishing their birthday patrons a happy birthday.. . There are a lot of "sushi" variaties to choose from, however, I question the freshness of some of their fish, as one of my salmon rolls was very gummy, and warm. . . That being said, my RuSan's Buckhead was 'ok' nothing to write home about.
