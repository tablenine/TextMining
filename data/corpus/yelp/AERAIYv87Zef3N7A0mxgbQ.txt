Sometimes, I feel like a creature of habit. And. I guess so. If I am along this strip of Clark when I am in Wrigleyville, I will come here. Especially if I am hungry. And, I was HUNGRY this past Friday night. So off we went to Ian's.. . We walked there and there was a line out the door. No sweat. I wanted pizza and I wanted it now so I stood in it. I am updating the review for this fact. They get an extra star from before. "Why?" you ask. Well I'll tell you why: this line was the most efficient that I have stood in in a very, very, very long time. I was impressed. I was shocked. I was...full, because it only took about 10 minutes maximum to get through the line, where I tried the breakfast burrito pizza (to die for) and my go to favorite, Mac and Cheese pizza. . . All in all, Ian's can color me impressed because I am.
