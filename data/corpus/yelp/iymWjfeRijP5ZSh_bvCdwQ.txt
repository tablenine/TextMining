Went on a Friday around 5:30pm, plenty of seating and parking but got full around 6:30pm.  Loved the energy and decor, bright lights, music, friendly helpful staff.  Lots of families.  Ordered the paella and carnitas, both excellent.  Paella had shrimp, fish, chicken, mussels, calamari, scallops and the saffron yellow rice.  All cooked to perfection.  The carnitas were excellent, moist and plentiful.  Loved the plantains.  The rice and beans were just ok to me.   With drinks, 1 alcoholic mojito (so so) and a hot tea, around $50.  Free garlic bread was warm but a bit greasy for me.
