Good atmosphere but can be on the dark side. I kind of feel like an A-list celebrity when I walk in, though. Very posh. Staff is very friendly and gave us free shots for no reason my first time here. After many trips, I have only ever had the farfalle because it is one of my favorite dishes anywhere. Half price on Mondays makes for an excellent "I need to make this day better because it's Monday" dinner experience. They will, however, turn you away if you are wearing sandals.
