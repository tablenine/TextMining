Restaurant: Miller&#39;s Pub
Category: Steakhouses
Great old school Chicago pub.  The interior (and exterior) of this place has a quality that a Hollywood set designer would get paid tens of thousands of dollars to try to replicate, and wouldn't be able to get the layer of... I don't know... old, that gives Miller's its unmistakable charm.. . It's funny that all of these new school cocktail bars are opening up that are trying to bring back, "classic" cocktails, when you can just go to a place like Miller's and have a classic cocktail from a bartender who has been mixing them up since the Mad Men days.. . The food is what it is, classic meat and potatoes pub fare, nothing exceptional, but done well.  Mostly I like to go to Miller's for a perfectly made martini, or Manhattan, and enjoy the ambiance.
