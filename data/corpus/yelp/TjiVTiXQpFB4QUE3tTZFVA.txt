I came here with 2 friends last night, and we were told it would be an hour wait for a table.  We considered going somewhere else, but after about 45 minutes we were seated at the bar.. . The bar is THE place to be!  Mitch greeted us and we ordered some rolls - the salmon lover, Tiffany, kamikaze, and a salad roll.  One of my friends ordered the sashimi dinner, which is a special Mitch creation.  Everything was ordered tasted absolutley delicious and looked gorgeous!  After we were done with our sushi, Mitch made us a couple of hand rolls, just because!  It was a really great dining experience, for just around $20 a person!  I'm thinking I'm going to have to make Toro my weekly sushi spot!. . EDIT: 2 stars off of my review.  A month ago, I called to make an order for carryout.  I was told it would be a 2 hour wait!  I called at 6 p.m. on a Thursday night - that's a little outrageous.. . Tonight I called at 6 again to make a carryout order, and I was informed they aren't taking carryout orders this week.  Sorry Toro, I love your sushi but I'm taking my business elsewhere.
