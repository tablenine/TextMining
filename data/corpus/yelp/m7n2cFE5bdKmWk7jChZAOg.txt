Possibly the best steak I have ever eaten. Dry aging is the way to go, but if you're not into dry aging, the "South Side Filet" is wet aged. All of the appetizers were delicious, especially the "East Coast, West Coast" oysters, and the crabcake. Tuna tartare was also excellent, but the star of the show, a dry-aged ny strip had me at first bite. Drinks are great s well. Try the mojito.
