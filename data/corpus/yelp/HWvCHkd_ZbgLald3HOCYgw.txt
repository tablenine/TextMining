This place is one of a kind! Good food, good beer, and TVs!. Sure the hipster crowd is a little overbearing, but hey, it is what it is I guess... . That said, the burgers are quite tasty, the fries are always fresh, and the sauce selection is a nice compliment! Service has always been up to par, the food comes out rather quickly, and parking is plentiful.. . Keep up the good work OINKSTER!!
