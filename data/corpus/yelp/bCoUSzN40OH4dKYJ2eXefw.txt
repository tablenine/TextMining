really cool place  to go. food was great the beer was great and so was the sake. bit of a warning here though, you want to make a reservation and bring a good amount of money.for my freainds and i was about $2,200 dollars. that was for 15 of us. we also ordered ahead or time. great shows and lots of laughter.  Do it once every 2-3 years
