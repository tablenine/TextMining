There's one thing I really hate about going to Roscoe's.  Is that I want to order more than I can eat.  It's not enough just to get their juicy fried chicken and their spectacularly fluffy waffles (so fluffy, it sucks up butter and syrup like a sponge!).  Roscoe's has great cornbread, collard greens, red beans and rice, and mac and cheese.  Oh MAN the mac and cheese is good!. . Oh yeah, there's the other thing I hate about going to Roscoe's - particularly this location.  The wait.  There's always a line, always a wait of at least 20 minutes.  But it's not because I'm an impatient person whose time is too valuable.  It's just because I'm hongry and I gots ta have my 'Scoe's!!!
