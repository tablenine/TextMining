Let me just put it this way... stellar food, gorgeous views of L.A., and rubbing elbows with the likes of the cast of the "L Word" means you're probably going to pay for it with a $12 martini here and there. That's just the way it works.. . I went on my 23rd birthday, compliments of my fantastic boss at the time, and sister. I'd never been, so it was kind of a "surprise" for me :) . . The ride up the long windy hill led to a mansion sized establishment overlooking all of Los Angeles. Breathtaking at night, probably even better by day. Like I said, the place it huge, so if you're a little bit tipsy, you might get lost going from the restroom, back to trying to find your table ;). . We got oyster shots, chocolate martinis, and a lovely sashimi sampler. The place is huge and very "scene"...Impeccable service, food, drinks,etc. Even the bathrooms were beautiful.. . The grounds outside are also lovely. We walked around briefly following dinner to enjoy them before departing. Would recommend this place to anyone who either is well off to begin with and wants a quality experience, or for someone who is just celebrating a special occasion and is willing to spend a lil extra than their average "Kabuki" visit.
