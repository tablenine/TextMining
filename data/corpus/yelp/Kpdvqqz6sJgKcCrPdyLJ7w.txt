Restaurant: Dantanna&#39;s
Category: Sports Bars
UPDATE. . I met up with a friend here for a quick drink.  It was  a midway meeting point.  Four stars because the bartender was great.  He recommended a wine for me, then let me taste it first.  Nice!  Also, I didn't get to eat any food but, what I saw looked and smelled great.. . One thing that I didn't like was that they still allowed smoking inside.  We were there for almost an hour smoke free, then a few people lit up and ruined the fresh air atmosphere.  Definitely a loss of a star on that one, which leaves Dantanna's with three stars.. . ---. Already a little tipsy off that DiSarrano, I headed here with my girl friends to have some fun.  One of my girls was having a "Waiting To Exhale" moment so, she wanted to get out of the house.  Dantanna's ended up being our choice because pretty much everything was closed. It's a nice location.  The bar area is pretty large and spacious and the bartender was cool.  He was attentive and knew how to pour the drinks.  The rest of the restaurant I didn't get to check out because my butt was glued to the bar.  . . As the night progressed, people started smoking.  Yuck!  The ventilation system must have been broken because it stunk.  Otherwise, this is a cool spot.  Not pretentious, just laid back.
