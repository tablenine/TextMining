Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
There was a time I enjoyed coming here.  But the crowd, lack of parking and the price just isn't worth it any more...  The food is not my taste (personal taste, others seem to love it).  We live in Los Angeles, with hundreds of restaurants just on Melrose, Beverly and 3rd; whats all the hubbub about Joan's?!?!
