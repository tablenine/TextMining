Restaurant: Tin Lizzy&#39;s
Category: Mexican
Tin Lizzy's is good. . . I end up being here, well, a lot. Maybe too much. It's actually my boyfriend's favorite casual restaurant to go to - so we end up here anywhere from one to three times a week. One thing for sure is that the service and quality is consistently good. . . Yes, you have to pay three dollars for the chips and salsa. Although not the standard by other Tex-Mex type restaurants, it's actually fair. I prefer it, because if I want to eat light and healthy than I would rather not have a big bowl of chips tempting me. The salsa is tasty, I love the seasoning on the chips. And they give you a lot!. . I'm not a huge fan of the tacos. I find tacos in general difficult to eat. I do appreciate that they have whole-wheat shells to help make up for the fact, that well, you are eating a taco after all. For lunch I'll often get the cup of chicken tortilla soup (amazing - love the fresh avocado, lime, and cilantro) and a fish taco. They also have a new "fit menu" - mostly of grilled items. It's not really anything that's not on the menu already, but again I do appreciate the thought of eating healthy.. . The reason we come here so often is for the skillet. It's amazing, and filling. It either comes as a whole skillet or half. The buffalo chicken is the way to go. It comes with rice, corn, onions, peppers, tasty chicken, and queso. Not a fan of having the salsa come on top of it though - they didn't always have it that way. It's a good dish, and well slightly addictive. . . The service has always been awesome. Friendly waiters who you can make conversation with. A good place to go meet up with friends, have some drinks, chow down on the chips, and indulge in the skillet!
