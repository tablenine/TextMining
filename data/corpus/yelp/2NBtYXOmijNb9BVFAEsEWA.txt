Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Granted, I have only been once, but I would have to say that Tank is overrated. It's good sushi at great sushi prices. I dropped over $200 here for two of us and I did not leave feeling it was worth it. I had no particular gripes with the quality or the service, I just wasn't "wowed" like I think I should have been at that price. Sorry.
