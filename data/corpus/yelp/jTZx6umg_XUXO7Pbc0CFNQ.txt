Category: Italian
I've lived in LA for over 10 years and have never eaten at the Stinking Rose until last night.  All I can say is CRAB! with GARLIC! delicious and wanting more. Some of the other menu items were just okay...ceasar salad, prime rib dinner but my rating is for the CRAB with GARLIC and garlic lemon butter.  Next time I go I'll order the crab and know it will be fantastic!
