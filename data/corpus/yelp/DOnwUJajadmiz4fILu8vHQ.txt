Porto's is everything comfort food.  I can't begin to tell you how much I enjoy this place.  Yes it's chaotic and packed with people sometimes, but this is half the fun.  The long line is well worth the wait and what I call "delayed gratification".  My go to order:. . Media noche preparada. 2 potato balls. 1 meat pie. chocoloate croissant. 2 choc chip cookies. guava cheese danish. . Either location is awesome.  I suggest you go there immediately.
