Dear Fred 62, . I would tell you that you have my heart, but I would be lying. But you do have my tummy. My tummy loves you, and those delicious golden balls of fried goodness that you serve. ( It also loves your delicious shakes, and your amazing bacon). Your mac. n cheese balls are... 1- Better than the ones at the Cheesecake Factory in Union Square, SF, the only other place I've seen them. ( I know, I know.. But they are so tasty at that location!) . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . 2- Made with some of the tastiest mac n cheese I've had in LA. Some people mask the yucky stuff with loads of breadcrumbs and toss it on a plate, but Fred gives us the gooooooood stuff. . 3 - The best 345983405 calories I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth. . . Thank you for existing, and providing tasty and affordable (in hollywood even!!) food, 24-7 and thank you for having amazingly not bitchy servers, like Julie. . . Love (from my tummy) . Elise
