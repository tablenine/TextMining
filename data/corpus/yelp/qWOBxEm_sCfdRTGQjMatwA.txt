Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
If nothing else, come to The Wiener's Circle at least once on your trip to Chicago.  The mouthy service is part of the charm, and the prices are really low.  It's a great stop after a long night on the town, with a major bonus being the outdoor seating in the summer months.  Be careful with your cell phone: the last guy I saw on his while ordering was threatened to have it deep-fried!
