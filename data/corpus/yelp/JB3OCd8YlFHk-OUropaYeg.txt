Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Lord of the Rings Dog - onion rings + barbecue sauce + stretch dog = simple and delicious. Get it.. . I echo the sentiment that 1 hour is too long to wait for anything, much less a hot dog.... . But...it's Pinks. It's fun, it's trendy, all these celebs sign their pictures and it's on the walls proclaiming their love for pinks, they have fun names like Rosie O Donnell dog, Muholland Dr. dog, etc. and that's fun!. . I'm gonna keep this review short because the I believe this place is worth the visit if you're visiting LA.  Try going during an off time to avoid the one hour wait, and you'll probably find the hot dog is even better.  Get the onion rings and fries, in my opinion better than the hot dogs. and just marvel at the fact that what started as a little tiny hot dog stand on the corner of melrose &amp; la brea could evolve into something like this! . . (Chili Cheese dogs are worth the heartburn, p.s.)
