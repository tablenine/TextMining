I have to give this place 5 stars!. . They serve the best sashimi ever with such reasonable (unusually cheap?!) price. Since I had been here, I've always compare other sushi places with Sushi Gen. I tried even more expensive places but man~ Sushi Gen is still unbeatable!. . Lunch special is really really special with the variety, quantity, quality, and the price of the meal. I always get sashimi special. Their fish is so tender, soft, and fresh. I don't know which part of fish they use. The fish tasted like it could melt in your mouth! I thought about taking out one star because they only serve salmon salad instead of sliced salmon Â sashimi, but I couldn't because the fish is just too good to be true for less than $15!. . The wait for lunch is awfully long (Mon to Fri only). I still think it's worth it! I loved it so much I even came for dinner. Dinner gets more expensive and not much more food, but I think the price is still decent with its quality. After all, I cannot always afford to wait in line for lunch. :P. . I hate that I'm moving out of LA. How can I find such a good sushi place with this kind of price in the Bay Area?! :(
