The most appealing part about this restaurant is the great lighting. Most Vietnamese/pho places have terrible fluorescents but this place has a nice atmosphere. It's not the most authentic place by any means -- and the pho really isn't that good [too much five-spice, not enough cilantro, kinda bleh overall] - -but I liked the appetizers [the vegetarian wonton was the stand-out], service was good and they carry Tiger beer which happily reminded me of my travels in SE Asia. Lots of vegetarian options too. Don't think I'd run back anytime soon though.
