My friend and I were starving from driving all day from the SF Bay Area, and were ready to scarf down some major grub. So glad to have Canter's as the answer to my hunger. So my friend ordered a half sandwich and soup, oh I'm not wanting to guess the meat but I think it was salami on rye, with potato salad, and vegetable soup, which came with the nice touch of some bagel chips. Wow, that was a mighty high pile of meat given on the plate! For my meal I had a lox and onion omelet with potatoes, served with a bagel. I thought the potatoes were very different in that they had been sliced very thinly, then griddled until the pieces directly on the grill were rather crisp, but the remainder were cooked but still on the soft side. A bit saltier omelet than I expected--perhaps the eggs should have been undersalted to compensate for the saltiness of the lox? And my, what mighty pickles they have, with a flavor profile that really sings, unlike the crass commercial preparations off grocery store shelves most people experience--that's what you get for made-on-the-premises items. We were too sated to try the bakery items. Perhaps this calls for yet another visit. If you're a deli aficionado, look no further.
