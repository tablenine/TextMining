Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Good but not great. Maybe I expected a little too much after reading such raving reviews, but I found El Tepeyac Cafe to be no more than satisfactory. Â The first time I came here I tried the acclaimed "Hollenbeck" and was just short of disappointed. I thought I'd give the place another chance and returned a second time but came to the same conclusion: the portions are absolutely overwhelming and its mexican authenticity, questionable. Plainly, I didn't feel there was anything special about the place. Call me the antagonist, but I don't think it's worth the wait or the heartburn.
