I'm a bit disappointed with the hype this restaurant has caused because really the food is ok. This being my second time there I've decided to finally write a review, the first experience was not bad, we had good stuff and we had ok stuff, this time around I decided to give it another try. Yet many of the things we ordered were mediocre and salty! . . What we had: . For starters: . - Grilled Octopus: very, very salty although the octopus was grilled perfectly . - Steamed Mussels: pretty good this one, very fresh sweet mussels . - Grill Prawns: my favorite for the night. Cooked perfectly and the prawns were sooooo sweet! . . For dinner: . - Ricotta &amp; Egg Ravioli: My first experience was way better. I remembered I liked this dish a lot, this time around no wow factor . - Squid Ink Pasta with sea urchin and dungeness crab: again another salty pasta dish - the sea urchin and crab however were delicious . - Garganelli with rag√∫ Bolognese - salty again! very salty, I wonder if the chef accidentally spilled salt in everything . - Grilled Beef Tagliata - this dish was ok, I've had better steaks . - Grilled Cauliflower - for those who don't like cauliflower, this is a must try! It doesn't even taste like cauliflower, my second favorite dish of the night! . . All in all I enjoyed my dinner, not because the dinner was fabulous but because I was surrounded by good company. I'm starting to think this place is way overrated.
