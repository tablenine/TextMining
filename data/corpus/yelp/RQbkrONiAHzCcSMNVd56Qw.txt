I ate the following:. . -Greek salad. -Quail. -Tartare. -Dark Chocolate Sundae. . Everything was outstanding except the quail - it did not seemed thoroughly cooked (however it was not undercooked to the point I'd send it back). Tartare was fabulous and the sundae capped off the meal perfect. Quite on the expensive side but a great place to be on a friday night!
