What a great spot for brunch.  I loved their coffee, handsome wait staff, cute patio seating (very dog friendly) and just the friendly vibe of the other brunchers.  The food we got was delicious.  . . How it works is you order your food and then get a table.  Very fast service, the food was visually nicely done and it was a great spot for people watching.  Despite being a lovely Sunday my friend and I quickly got a table.. . We plan to go back for lunch and one of the yummy looking desserts!
