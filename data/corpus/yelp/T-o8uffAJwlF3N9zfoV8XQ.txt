I'm a fan because of the beer selection. As a vegetarian I'm limited to about 3 hot dogs but that is my deal not yours! My carnivore friends love this place. A great place to have lunch and drink a beer at the outdoor patio on the weekend or meet for a beer inside the nicely done space. Can't go wrong with the fries other but darn that heartburn! :)
