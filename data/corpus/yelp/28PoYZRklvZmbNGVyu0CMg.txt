Everything we ordered - the drinks, the salad, the appetizer, the dinner - was all perfect.  The bill stung a little.  That's the only reason this place is getting less than five stars.  There is definitely a particular crowd that is right for this setting (dark, muted, pretentious) but hey, to each their own.  If this is your scene, the food certainly won't disappoint.
