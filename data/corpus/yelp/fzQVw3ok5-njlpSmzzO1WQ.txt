Meh...Good looking menu and food was decent, but nothing special. It was a little on the pricey side. I had the stuffed pork, which sounded a lot better than it was...flavors weren't there and the pork was overcooked. overpriced at $22 or whatever.. . If you want latino flavors there are better and cheaper places, if you want a twist on this food there are tastier places and if you want a unique scene there are better places.. . So basically go somewhere else. . Caveat- The only plus was we had an extremely attractive and nice waitress.
