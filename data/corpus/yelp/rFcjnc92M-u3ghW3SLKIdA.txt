Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Seeing the amount of people who have already reviewed Lawry's i will not go into specific detail of how good the food is (seeing how there are already 366 reviews) there isn't much more i could tell you about how the prime rib is, i will simply offer you my views of the pros and cons of the restaurant. . Pros-. -the prime rib is excellent as are their signature sides (salad, mashed potatoes, spinach, corn etc). -the food is always consistent it is not a "hit or miss" restaurant. -the service is amazing. -one of the few restaurants in la that seems to have remained the same since it has opened (in a good way). . Cons (in all fairness i have to mention that all of my cons are directly correlated with how busy the restaurant gets so my cons are basically complaints about lawry's on a fri or sat night). -seating seems cramped, it is a bit uncomfortable when you are sitting less than an arm lengths away from the people next to you (so request a corner table for a party of 2). -even with reservations expect a wait. -the valet takes FOREVER....and when i say forever i mean forever, if you want your car faster you better have a 20 hidden in your palm (as many do) or expect to wait in the huge mob of impatient others who refuse to be exploited out of an andrew jackson
