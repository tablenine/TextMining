RFD completely changed my perception about vegan food.. . I've driven by before but never thought for one second to enter because the word "vegan" just blocked off any desire.  But my friend wanted to come for lunch, so I did.. . It was amazing, and you don't have to be a vegan to appreciate the quality and complexity of the food.  Whoever created the menu and the people in the kitchen cooking are geniuses.. . The restaurant itself is airy, and very "green."  I heard they only use organic products, and they use very healthy sugar like sugar cane for their desserts.. . My server, Penny, she was so helpful and nice.  She recommended the "sea cake," which is the vegan version of the crab cake.  It was grilled, not fried.  So healthy, but so yummy.  I'd probably go back just go have it.  I also liked my friend's salad, which was the bbq tofu salad (I think).. . Parking is an issue, since La Cienega is a tough street to find parking and there's no valet.  But it's well worth it and you won't have to feel guilty for cheating your diet!. . Prices are decent for lunch around the area.  I think for two people, our bill came out to be around $40-$50 for one appetizer, two drinks, a salad and a wrap.
