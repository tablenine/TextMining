Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
It's only appropriate that my very first yelp review be about my very favorite restaurant..esp since they named this place after my dog...oh wait...or did I name my dog after this place?  Nevermind.. . But back to business...Lala's is an AWESOME place for a meal, esp if you're a fan of food with LOTS of garlic and onions. The food is simple and delicious.  First of all, they have this great chimichurri sauce that you dip their house bread in, and I assure you, you will NOT stop dipping.  In the several times I've eaten here, I always end up ordering either the A la Cebolla, which is pretty amazing if you're an onion lover cuz it comes with HUGE peices of grilled onions on top of grilled chicken breasts.  Now if you're a garlic lover, the Entrana el Ajo is for you...grilled skirt steak with large chunks of garlic.  YUMMMMY!  Most of their entrees come with either mashed potatoes, rice pilaf, or salad on the side but I always just stick with the salad when I'm pretending to be healthy or the rice pilaf when I'm tired of pretending.  The mashed potatoes aren't anything special, which if fine since the entrees itself need no company.  . . As for the ambience, the Melrose location is cool...it's the usual outdoor bistro type vibe you get a lot of in LA...they have a nice back patio for outdoor dining,..great for dinner on a warm evening and even better for ppl watching - also good for big groups.  The inside dining room can feel a little cramped and loud so just stick to the outdoors.  . . p.s.  save room for the banana crepe de leche (or something like that...) dessert.  YUMMYYYYYY!
