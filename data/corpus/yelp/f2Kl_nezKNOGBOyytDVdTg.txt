This was my first visit to the famous Philippes. Had the beef dip with a side of potato salad and a lemonade, all for around 8 bucks. Correct me if im wrong..arent french dips supposed to be somewhat juicy? My dip was dry and flavorless! .             Added some (alot) of their mustard to the sandwich. Hahaha wow that stuff should have a warning label on it!! Its good if you like dijon mustard on steroids. The potato salad and lemonade were both good..the dip was very disappointing. I might give this place one more shot, only because umm 4 stars over 1,000 reviews...yea. Still dont get it.
