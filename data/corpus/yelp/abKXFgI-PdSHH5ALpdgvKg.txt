I have passed by this place on several occasions and it always seems to have a lively bunch.  Well I passed by on Sunday and decided to walk in.  To my surprise the place was not packed so I was seated very quickly.  The patio is great and prime for people watching. . . I order the pancake special and let me just say it did not seem as if I put a dent in it at all.  I know what to expect next time and also to wear elastic around my waist.
