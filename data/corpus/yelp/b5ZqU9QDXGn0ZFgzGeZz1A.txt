5 star for the quality of the sashimi (prices taken into consideration). . The uni dinner is heavenly, though a bit pricey. good bargain for uni-lover. . For a refreshing and deliiicious lunch, opt for the sashimi lunch (which is way cheaper than its sashimi dinner - $16), which includes steamed tofu appetizer, miso soup, rice, as well as the sashimi plate (that is pretty accomodating, i have to say). . . Now, the downside? the waiting time can be a drag! especially if you have a party bigger than 4. I usually like to pop out either at 1pm for lunch (which is near closing time 2pm) or 8.30/9pm for dinner - which is perfect time and you dont have to squeeze with other people!. . Overall, sushi gen is still my fav place to go when i have that raw fish craving! de-lii-ciouuss!
