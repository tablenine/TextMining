Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
This is the best Cheesecake Factory in the Midwest (it's like Cheesecake Factory meets papa Smurf).  Great location, but as a result, it is surrounded by annoying tourists which means it is always crowded.  However, I love their menu and I adore their burgers.  I know some people just hate this place (mostly due to crowded tourists), but seriously, this is a classic joint.. . p.s. Never get their meatloaf!
