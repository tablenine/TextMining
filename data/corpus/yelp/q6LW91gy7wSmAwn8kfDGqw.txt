Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Love love love LOVEEEE this place!. I go here for random celebrations and I have not had a complaint ever.  The tossed salad is delicious, yorkshire pudding delicious, creamed corn, steak, lobster, all delicious.  I absolutely love the sweet corn and the atmosphere is romantic and fun.  I should definitely try the prime rib, but I definitely recommend this place!
