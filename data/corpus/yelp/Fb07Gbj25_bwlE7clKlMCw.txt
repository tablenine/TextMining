I ate here last weekend, during the Renegade Craft Fair, while I was on a whirlwind cupcake-eating tour of Chicago. Needless to say, after all that sugar, I wanted something light and hopefully healthy. I found all that in a mini feast at Mana Food Bar.. . My friend and I were able to sit outside and enjoy the sun. I had a tart lemonade, which I really appreciated as most places make lemonade so sweet I can't drink it, as well as the side of collard greens, which was garlicky and perfect, the pickled vegetables (asparagus, cauliflower and tomato), which were fresh, crisp, and delightful, and the eggplant in miso sauce which was delicious.. . I probably overordered because even though these were small plates, there was plenty to go around. The prices were reasonable and there were several other dishes that sounded tempting I didn't get to try. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago. I ilke that they have hot and cold food, a decent selection, good prices and that the vegetables were all recognizable as the vegetables I ordered, but were also deliciously spiced.
