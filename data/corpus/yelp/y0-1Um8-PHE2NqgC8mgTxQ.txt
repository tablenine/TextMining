Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I heard a lot of hype about Pink's and it lived up to none of it.  The line is long because the women inside purposefully make the dogs slow when throwing chili and onions on a dog should take 1 minute, tops.  The dogs themselves are pretty good quality, but nothing the staples center couldn't give you.. . Coming from New York, the late Dash Dogs and Crif Dogs just doo-doo's all over Pink's.  Even Gray's Papaya is superior, since you're getting the same quality dog in about 2 minutes and for $1-2 a piece, instead of $5 for a Rosie O'Donnell dog?. . Pink's is fine, but just understand all you're getting is regular hot dogs with some toppings.  Nothing to wait in line an hour for, AT ALL.
