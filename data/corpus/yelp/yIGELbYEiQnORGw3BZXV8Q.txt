This is the best sushi buffet around...or should I say at all. If this were any other sushi buffet, the rolls would be old and have sat out all day, chewy rice, you get the picture. Not here. The sushi chefs are right behind the bar making the rolls fresh and keeping them that way. There are also soups to choose from, salads, desserts and other Japanese dishes. A very good restaurant with a nice atmosphere. I do plan to go back!
