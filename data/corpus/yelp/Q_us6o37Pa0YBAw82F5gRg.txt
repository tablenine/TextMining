What is wrong with some of you people? "Waaaaaaaaaaah $12 for a burger." "The burger at Islands is better!" "You have to order at the counter". . Fuck off, seriously lol....FO2 is a nice expansion of the SM location, which i actually still prefer...I totally appreciate the fact that FO2 is so much more convenient in terms of seating and parking.... . The brews are all great...I had 3 last night for $18...Not really sure where you can complain about the pricing. The selection is superb and the staff are extremely knowledgeable...As for people saying they get poor service, well maybe next time you should think twice about asking for a pint of MGD 64 or Stella...Microbrews ONLY.... . The fact that FO2 has a 3/5 rating is a total fucking joke...Stop your bitching and fuck off to TGIMcFunsters. . BTW...When did this place become asian central? I was there last night and I swear it was 70% asian
