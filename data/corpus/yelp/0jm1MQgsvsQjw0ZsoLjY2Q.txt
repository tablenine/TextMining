Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Din Tai Fung is home of the famous Taiwanese export xiaolongbao (aka soup dumplings for the uninitiated). A group of girlfriends and I made the Sunday morning pilgrimage to Arcadia from Santa Monica. Let me just preface this by saying 33 miles for dim sum is really, really far by L.A. standards--like an eternity. But I was determined to try Din Tai Fung (as an infrequent visitor from Boston) because I'd heard so much about these legendary dumplings.. . We also learned that there are actually 2 outposts of Din Tai Fung in Arcadia. They are basically in the same strip mall, but one is newer than the other. While I'm not sure about the newer locale, this one had a glassed-in kitchen where you could salivate over (err...I mean, watch) the dumpling masters make fresh orders right before your eyes. It really ramped up my appetite! . . Once we were seated, we proceeded to order 9-10 dishes --predominately soup dumplings, of course. Of the classic pork xialongbao, fish dumpling, pork &amp; shrimp dumpling, veggie, and red bean dumplings, I hands-down preferred the original pork xiaolongbao. The presentation was interesting as the mini xiaolongbao looked like brains, while the pork &amp; shrimp dumplings resembled sea anemones. The sticky, multi-colored rice dessert was just OK. . . Service was pretty darned quick given the crowded dining room. Like 99% of Asian restaurants, they like to keep the customer turnover high. If I were to do it again, I'd probably just order multiples of the original pork xiaolongbao (don't mess with a good thing!) and save room for dessert at Yogurtland, which is just across the way in the adjoining strip mall.
