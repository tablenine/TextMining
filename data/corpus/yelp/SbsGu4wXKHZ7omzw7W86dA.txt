Restaurant: So Kong Dong
Category: Korean
I started heading to So Kong Dong for weekend lunches after reading Yelp reviews.  I'm glad I did!  I find the restaurant to be cozy and welcoming, especially when it's rainy and you need some hot tofu soup.. . A big perk is the combo meal that offers soup (or other options like bibimpap) and a side of BBQ for great prices.  This is a nice alternative to the pricier BBQ lunches at other local restaurants that start at $15 for even a lunch portion of just kalbi or bulgogi.  Also, I get a kick out of watching my boyfriend try to figure out how to eat the fried fish they serve before the meal using chopsticks.
