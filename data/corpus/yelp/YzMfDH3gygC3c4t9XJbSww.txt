I came here because one of my friends is Vegan and I wasn't really expecting much but the food is very flavorful so you can't even tell that there's no meat. Our table ordered the nachos to share and it is one of the best nachos I've ever had. I had the Burger with the Works which comes with a veggie patty, avocado, grilled onions, tempeh bacon, and cashew cheese. The burger was huge so it was kind of messy and hard to eat. I also had a side caesar salad which comes with these delcious wheat-free croutons. (It kind of tastes like the wheat bread that you get at cheescake factory but its a crouton!) . . It's a little bit pricey but you feel feel good about yourself afterwards! I'm definately going back!
