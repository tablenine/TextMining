Great dim sum. It's almost always busy which is a good sign, right? They have a good variety of dim sum available. Definitely don't go there though if you need a quick meal because the wait alone will put you out around 30-45 minutes. This is the first place I went to when I wanted to try dim sum and came highly recommended as a good place for people new to this fun food!. . Word to the wise--if they try to put chicken feet on your table, it's just because it is supposed to be for luck. But make sure you shake your head furiously if you don't want to try it!!
