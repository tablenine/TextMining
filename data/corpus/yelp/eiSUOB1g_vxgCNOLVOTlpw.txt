Restaurant: Pho Dai Loi
Category: Vietnamese
A big bowl of steaming soup was just what I needed the night we visited Pho Dai Loi. It really hit the spot. I think I ordered the #20, which was beef skirt and flank. A+! The broth was savory and delicious, and I found the noodle to meat ratio to be quite adequate. I added a tiny bit of Sriracha sauce to my bowl, which I usually adore, but I felt it was overkill. Fresh jalapenos were served along with some other toppings (bean sprouts, etc), and that was all I needed to add a bit of pep to the soup. Next time, no Sriracha. . . Service was fast and friendly. Our server had no problem answering questions about the menu and offering suggestions. Water refills were also plentiful.
