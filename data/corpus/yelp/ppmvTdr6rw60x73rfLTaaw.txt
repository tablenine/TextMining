I had the tasting menu here which I thought was going to be a special selection off-menu, but it was just 5 pre-selected dishes from the regular menu. You're better off choosing your own dishes. The food was very artfully presented and the restaurant interior is clean and white, easy on the eyes. About what you should expect from a fine dining establishment but nothing particularly exceptional. It seemed a waste that they fried the white fish in a chicken nugget-like batter. Each course was good but not mind-blowing. I think Green Zebra does a better job at being both inventive and memorable.
