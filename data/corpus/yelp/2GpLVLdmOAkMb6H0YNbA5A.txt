We came in here on a weeknight mainly so that it wouldnt be slammed. For a wednesday night, they still had a good amount of people in there. . . We went for the Kansas City Strip which I was told is their specialty. I thought the cut was real good and would definitely get it again. The Mushrooms side dish was a great compliment to the steak. . . I'm looking forward to going back and trying the Ribeye. Its also worth noting that the service was excellent.
