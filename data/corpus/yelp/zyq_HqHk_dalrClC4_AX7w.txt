Category: Diners
Best time to go is the summer, during the sunrise. You have the outside patio to yourself and your pack of smokes. Great service, great view and total quiet. If Fred 62 was like that all the time, I never would have left LA. Otherwise, it's hipster hell. But if you like eating tacos while sitting between Gwen Stephani and that whore from the Distillers, you'll love this place on Saturday night.
