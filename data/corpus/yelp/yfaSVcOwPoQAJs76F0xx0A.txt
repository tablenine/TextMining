I've had really good luck with the chicken dishes.  The arroz con pollo and the bistek de pollo are always good.  Also, the the fried yucca is a must for an appetizer.. . I would stay away from the fish.  I ordered the salmon once and it was really dry (no amount of garlic n' lemon sauce could save it).  I would also avoid the shrimp.  They come in a garlic sauce that is a little too oily for my taste.  Stick to the chicken and you'll be satisfied.
