Went here with some friends on a Saturday night at around 8 and waited in a line. By 10 pm we are still in line but further back?? Everyone seems to know the waiter's brother or his brothers mothers grandpas friend or something. Â Definitely NOT worth waiting. Make reservations if you do decide to go, otherwise there's a Waffle House across the street.. . The food is nothing to die for. Dinner was fairly inexpensive, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wouldn't have minded paying a little more for some friendly/faster/cleaner service.. . Definitely think there's a lot of hype about this place. I'm reading some of these reviews and just wondering if these people are talking about the same place.
