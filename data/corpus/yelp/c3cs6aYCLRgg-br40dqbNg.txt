I had recommended this place to a few friends even before going myself based on reviews I had read and the popularity of the restaurant on Opentable, and heard good things about it from them.  However, upon trying it myself for lunch, I can't say that I was impressed at all.  Perhaps it was what I ordered- a burger and a pasta for lunch, but generally the food was just not that impressive.  The burger was just way too heavy for lunch, and the pasta was very regular- nothing that stood out.  The bread was pretty good though, I do remember that.. . I do hope to try this restaurant again for dinner, and do feel that it would be more impressive than the lunch that was served up.  I probably should not be ordering a burger at a French/New American restaurant, but I thought that it would be presented in an innovative and unique way, which it was not.
