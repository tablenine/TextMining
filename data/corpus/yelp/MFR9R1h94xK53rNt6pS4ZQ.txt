Went to Oinkster for lunch after seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  I wasn't sure I wanted the pastrami but fortunately my co-workers ordered that.  They seemed to like it and left no fry in the basket.. . Ordered the pulled pork sandwich, no onions.  The BBQ sauce was very tangy which enhanced the meat.  I just needed more of it, it was good.. . Fries were also good.  The homemade ketchup seemed watery but tasted great.  We went somewhat early so we had no issues with a wait or getting a table in the shade.  By the time we left, there was a line almost out the door so they certainly are doing something right.
