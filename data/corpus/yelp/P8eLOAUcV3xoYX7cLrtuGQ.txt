Restaurant: Ben Pao
Category: Chinese
I tried Ben Pao again last night -- a compromise I don't regret. I stayed away from the noodles and fried rice this time, since I didn't want grease soup for dinner. A wise choice.. . We got the cherrybomb shrimp and the panang curry with tofu, which usually comes with chicken. I would order both dishes again. The cherrybomb shrimp was spicy, but not too spicy (for wimps). I appreciated their restraint with the breading. The curry was slightly watery, but the ingredients were fresh, delicious, and abundant.. . I can't give Ben Pao 4 stars because their menu is like a minefield. You have to choose wisely, and even their better dishes won't blow you away. But overall, this place is solidly okay as long as you're not expecting authentic Chinese.. . Do yourself a favor and get something with water chestnuts. They're pretty much the best thing about Ben Pao.
