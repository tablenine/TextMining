Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Lines are ridiculous long all the time! 45 mins to an hr long!.  If the hot dogs were worth it, but it's not. Prepare for heartburns and overfilled greasy calories. Double the calories if you are there on a late night dinning.. lol. . I honestly think weinerschnitzel has better hot dogs and chili.. . I gave it a two star only because we ran into the Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa a few years ago and he was doing an interview. .. hehe
