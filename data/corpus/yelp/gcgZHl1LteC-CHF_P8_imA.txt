I recently tried the pad thai, really good! would order it again, that and the spinach rangoon or whatever they are calling them!. the eel appetizer was not good, well I didnt like it.... We live close so we will prob always go back!. DO NOT order take out from them, I asked for vegetables and tofu in my pad thai, there was barely any tofu at all...and husbands malaysian seafood dish has barely any seafood, a bunch of rice! We are boycotting for the next two months we decided! Also my Pad Thai lacked flavor this time to, it was really dry so minus a star for that!
