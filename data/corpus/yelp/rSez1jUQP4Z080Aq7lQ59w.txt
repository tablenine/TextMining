Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
This was my first time going to Lawry's Prime Rib in Beverly Hills, CA.  I absolutely LOVED IT!!!  They start you off with hot, fresh slices of sourdough bread &amp; butter, then the waitress comes over to prepare the Spinning Bowl Salad:  WHAT A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!  She literally spins the big metal bowl of salad &amp; while it's spinning, she pours the famous Lawry's House Dressing on the salad from high up in the air.  Next, the server comes over to the table with the infamous metal serving cart that contains all the meat-lovers goodness &amp; all the side items to go with the prime rib.  The waitress asks you what cut of prime rib you want; I got the Diamond Jim Brady Cut, which I had cooked Medium &amp; very juicy, Creamed Corn, Creamed Spinach &amp; Mashed Potatoes w/Gravy &amp; Yorkshire Pudding, which is, for all of you out there that don't know what that is, it's a special bread that originated in England.  Next, after dinner, I had dessert:  Creme Brule, which was sooo very delicious!  My grandma had their English Trifle, which was very good, too, but a little on the sweet side.  If you've never been to this restaurant, you're missing out for sure.  But expect to pay a pretty penny for your meal &amp; dining experience, but also get ready for the best dining experience &amp; meal ever in your life!!  The best prime rib I've ever had!!  Reservations are recommended because this place does get crowded; we went on Saturday, January 30, 2010 with a 7pm reservation.
