I saw Queen Latifah!  . . We came to this place for a wrap party and I was happy to go as it would be pretty difficult to get in without some sort of hook up or go on off nights like Monday or Tuesdays.  . . The club is really nice.  The outdoor area has a bar and tons of VIP tables.  The inside also had the same type of black VIP booths.  Obviously you would have to get bottle service to sit at one of these tables.  There is a back room with a smaller bar and more seating.  Overall the decor is peachy and black.  Trendy.  Nice.. . The bathroom was a good size.  Not your typical 2 stall, stand in line forever just to pee type of bathroom.  The drinks were all on the house that night but I would imagine that such a trendy place drinks would be quite pricey.. . This was my chance to go and couldn't pass it up.  The crowd was good, obviously industry people and celebs.  If I had the chance to go again, I would def go back.
