Restaurant: Leon&#39;s Full Service
Category: Gastropubs
Our second visit to Leon's was a on a snowy Sunday night. So we lucked out--it wasn't crowded and we didn't have to worry about the wait. Just as before, service was efficient and friendly, food was great, wine and beer interesting.. . This will become a regular spot for us!
