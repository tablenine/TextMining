Probably would have given 5 stars if I knew what more of the menu items were.  They have a unique offering of items, including some dinners for two that they cook at the table.  My boyfriend and I got the marinated beef dinner for two and it was very good.  I also got a spicy beef soup appetizer that was very good.  They serve at least 8 small bowls of items to mix with your main dish, such as pickles, bean sprouts, rice cakes, potatoes, and more.  Overall, a very pleasant experience.
