Restaurant: Lee&#39;s Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Several years ago I had an OK bahn mi here and then ignored this place until not too long ago when I gave it another try.  Since then quick visits to Lee's Bakery to grab a wonderfully tasty sandwich have been frequent and rewarding.  The grilled pork one is my favorite...it's different but just as good as the best American style BBQ, with beautiful smell and savory as hell.  They give a large amount of this in the sandwich.  Also love the egg in sandwich.  Price is only $2.50...that is just sick.  It's cheaper than a crappy little box of Chick-Fil-A nuggets, a gourmet taco, or even a chili dog, twice the size and infinitely tastier.  I love living 3 minutes away from this place.. . I've eaten a few more involved dishes here.  The noodle soup, variety meat congee, and Viet pancake.  They are mostly decent but not amazing.  Not enough noodles and topping in the noodle soup.  Pancake is kind of sloppy.  For the variety meat congee, Pho #1's dish C22 is the way to go...much better than any other congee in town, including the Chinese places.  The pricing is very shady for these, they are not displayed and I was kind of surprised when they charged more than the Pho places.  . . It's a bakery, so you can get some cheap Vietnamese French bread, pastry, and some other ready-to-eat items.  I've tried a few but was not too impressed.  You could get bubble smoothies here as well, very good quality for cheaper than Mozart or White Windmill.
