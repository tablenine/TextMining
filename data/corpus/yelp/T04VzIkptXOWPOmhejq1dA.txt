Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I use to live a few blocks away but b/c the lines is super long I didn't end up going very often.  . . This place in my mind is kind of like Pinks Taco.  There is no real reason why this place is so busy all the time.  The food is not spectacular.. There is no service.. The atmosphere.. no atmosphere..  But I think that is part of the beauty of this place.  A tourist attraction that you must go and check off your list.   For me I get cravings for their meat and cheese burritos.  It's not that it is really good or anything.  It's just to my likings.  Well the cilantro in the salsa is a good touch as well.  . . bottom line:  go once to check off the list.  Go again b/c it is cheap and fills your stomach.  . . check
