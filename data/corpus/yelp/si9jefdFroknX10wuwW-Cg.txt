Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
My latest steakhouse venture happened to be the most expensive one in Los Angeles as well. Yet, the food didn't disappoint. It was actually really great, in the same league as Mastro's and Fleming's Steakhouse. The only noticeable difference is that Cut is more fushion-esque than the other more traditional establishments. When I last went, the group and I ordered the appetizer bone marrow flan, which was a really great choice. I've never had bone marrow in flan form, but added with the side bread, the two made an awesome combination. Then the entrees included the Rib Eye steak, filet mignon, the most expensive wagyu Rib eye kobe beef ($160! Yikes), and the US kobe style rib eye steak. All the steaks were great in taste and texture. I guess the star choice of the night was the kobe beef steak. The taste was soft, buttery, and rich. It was definitely something I've not had at other steakhouses in LA. The desserts were also pretty good, which included the chocolate souffle.. . In all, I highly, highly recommend this restaurant. It's one of the best steakhouses in LA, and probably one of the best restaurants in LA in general. The food here is pricey, but delicious and of high quality. The staff is amazing, as is the ambience of the whole environment. But my 5 star rating goes to food taste/quality only.
