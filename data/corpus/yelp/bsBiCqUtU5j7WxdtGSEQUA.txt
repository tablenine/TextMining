Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's Hot Dogs are DELICIOUS - but I feel that it does not live up to the hype.. . Basically, Pink's is a well-known restaurant that specializes in hotdogs and other fast-food style snacks. Being a L.A hotspot, customers usually wait on approximately 30-60 minutes. I would suggest on coming at the least busiest weeknights. That way, you can enjoy your hotdogs without having to wait TOO long.. . However, if I were hungry, I would not want to come here. I'd rather go to Costco to get three polish sausages.. . ALL the workers at Pink's are very nice and welcoming.. . Personal Favorites:. Guadalajara Dog with bacon. Cool Mountain Peach Soda
