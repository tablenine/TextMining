Everything was grey on the day I went to Belly Shack for lunch. Drizzling rain and rumbling trains matched the decor quite nicely, but there is an unfinished quality to the interior design of this place which is unnerving. It looks like they either wanted to go with an urban biking aesthetic or a deconstructed aesthetic and made a compromise between the two to the detriment of each. I thought the egg crate foam on the ceiling was a really neat touch, but it made me miss the clean and cheery lines of the erstwhile Vella Cafe. . . I got take-out for myself and a co-worker and the food was all very tasty. I got the lemon grass chicken and ordered him the meatballs. The bread was really good and though I thought it was strange for them to add the lemon grass to chicken like a slaw, it was still pretty good when I put it all together in my mouth.. . I was confused by the menu with the desert options. I thought I was getting a brownie topped with ice cream [frogurt?] and not the other way around. I will not be repeating this mistake. The frozen dairy treat is just like the vanilla ice cream at McDonalds across the street and the brownie bits, while super tasty, aren't plentiful enough to justify the expense. If I want to spend $4 well on ice cream, I'll go to Margie's just up the block. . . They do offer gluten-free meals; so I'll be back another time. I think they just have a bit of a growing phase to get through.
