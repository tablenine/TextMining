kind of overpriced, but the food is good!. . Come here with friends to eat breakfast and catch up. Its outdoor seating is neatly arranged with cute tables and chairs and as one friend puts it..." lets sit where people walking by can see us." so basically you want to be seen here. They had great homestyle potatoes and everything looks fresh, i mean everything. They have a variety of desserts to choose from, however they arent labled and once they gave me the wrong slice of cake. Regardless, its a cute and yummy place!
