Slightly overpriced, but the delivery was quick... the pizza was pipin' hot. I ordered the Spinach to Finish and really enjoyed it. I love that it's thin crust and I love how massive the pieces are. And, I actually prefer the dough to other pizza places in the area.. . I can't comment on the actual environment, but they were great for delivery.
