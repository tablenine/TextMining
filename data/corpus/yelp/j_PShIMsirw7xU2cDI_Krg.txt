Love their breakfast.  Just love it.  Their food is delicious, and the menu options include everything you could ever want for breakfast.  They do this one dish with macaroni, bacon, eggs and cheese, which sounds weird but is really good.  I also like their burrito.  This, so far, is my favorite breakfast spot in LA.  It gets 4 stars because sometimes it takes a long time to get your food, but I still love it.  Also, the line never seems too long on weekend mornings.  The breakfast here is just my style.  If only they could open another spot in Silverlake.
