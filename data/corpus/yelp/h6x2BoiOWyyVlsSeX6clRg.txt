Ugh appletini I give up my first born to you. . . Ordered mac n cheese (crispy on the top and cheesy in the middle. ) Then a veggie lasagna, which I am normally morally opposed to (meat is a key ingredient...KEY) , which I was super pleased with. Spinach, great cheese, tangy pasta sauce plus some decent garlic bread. . . I forget what my friends ordered but they liked it a lot. This place is pretty intense about carding though so make sure to bring friends with IDs.
