I grew up in the north where the noodle is thick, miso flavor, with a lot of oil and fat on cha-shu.  So I have to tell you that my review is biased.  I'm not too into tonkotsu but it was pretty good.  Gyoza was ok.  The best thing about this place is the decor.  It is full of old Japanese posters and photos which was totally cool.  Oh one thing, I saw dirty things on the floor of the kitchen....I kinda question how clean this place is.  If you want a good, spicy ramen in the area, go to Orochon ramen.  If you want more authentic Japanese ramen, go to Santoka inside Mitsuwa in Gardena.. . *Food = pretty good for Tonkotsu. *Service =average. *Price = ok
