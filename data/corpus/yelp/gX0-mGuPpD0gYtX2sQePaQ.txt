Mirroring what others have said, not entirely authentic Vietnamese cuisine. But food is food, and the food here is quite good. The standard range of food (rice bowls, pho, or the lunch specials) is $7-9. The coffee is okay; may be better to opt for the ginger limeade. But really, you can get Vietnamese food of equal or greater quality for less money anywhere else in L.A., though apparently not in Silver Lake.
