Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
O. M. G. I LOOOOOOOOVE this place!. . When I was working at Warner Brothers, my supervisor took me here for lunch, and I immediately fell in love.. . It's a Cuban/Latin American bakery, and they have THE MOST AMAZING SANDWICHES AND PASTRIES!!!!!. . I don't even know where to start.. . Their sandwiches are awesome. I usually get the pastrami, sandwich cubano, or pan con lechon.. . They have these things called potato balls, which I've never had before, but they're SO GOOD. As the name implies, they're potato balls filled with meat.. . The other thing that's amazing are these cheese rolls. So freaking good. Whenever someone at the office brought them I would be so happy.. . Porto's.. I really REALLY miss you. You were probably one of the best eats I've had during my stint in LA.
