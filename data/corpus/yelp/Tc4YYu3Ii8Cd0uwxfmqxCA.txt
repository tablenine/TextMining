Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
I think you're crazy as hell if you don't love Noodle Town!. . It gets dumb crowded in here and for a very good reason. They serve ridiculously delicious food fast and piping hot. The staff here is ready to go and never let me down once. There's certainly the air that they want you in and out, but that's no problem for me when its 2 in the morning and I'm coming down from my wasted-ness.. . The poached chicken in ginger and scallion sauce will own your ass and make you call it daddy. For real. Â The aforementioned sauce is also available in lo mein and crazy good. Soft shell crabs, black pepper and sea salt calamari, roast duck, yummy pork and wonton soup....damn, damn, DAMN! Even the steamed broccoli there makes me blow a gasket. . . I would gladly wait 20-30 minutes to get in here, it's off the chain! Highly, highly, enthusiastically recommended!
