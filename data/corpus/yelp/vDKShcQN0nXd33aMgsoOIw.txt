Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I had never heard of an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place, and certainly not for less than $20, so I was a little skeptical at first. But I'm so glad my friends took me to this place. Granted, it's not somewhere I'd go for a date - it's loud and you're basically sitting on picnic tables under a huge tent-like thing - but come on, it's $20 and you're guaranteed to leave stuffed and satisfied!. . Also, watching people getting showered with champagne never ceases to be entertaining. I think I have developed a pavlovian response to their birthday song now.
