Oh. my. God. Delicious! I went here a couple weeks ago and the food rocked my world. I had the Shroom pizza and it was amazing, so good. We also ordered the Tapanade and Winter Salad (both completely tasty and awesome) but didn't quite make it to dessert- too stuffed. I'm looking forward to coming back when it's warm out, this was definitely added on my list of places to keep going to. Put it on your list too!
