If it hadn't been for my fellow yelper friends, I never would have known about this place. Thank you guys! . . I really enjoyed the ambiance and eclectic crowd this place has. Here's what I consumed: . . Winter Solstice Brew - I think its called this, not sure. I'm not a beer drinker, but this was pretty tasty. . Shoe String Fries - Yum . Sweet Potato Fries - Evil Potato Heaven . The Office Burger - Really Delicious, and cooked to perfection. . . They do not have a waitstaff, so one orders everything at the bar, and then they bring it to you. Their beer and wine selection is quite nice, and we found parking to be a breeze. They do keep unusual hours, so check the website for updates. I'll definitely be back! I also want to check out the Santa Monica location. Oh - and they have a great patio area, too.
