I went here for the first time this past Friday. It was a different experience. I found it funny that they use paper plates and plastic cups. I really enjoyed the mini burgers though. They were delicious!! The waffle fries were good as well. . . The drinks were VERYYYYYY watered down, and they were loaded with sugar. I had the worth headache afterwards. I suggest getting beer from the tap because at least you are guaranteed to receive the full product!
