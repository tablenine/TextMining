Yeah, it's good.  So go.  It won't change your life, but it's damn good food and a really friendly staff.  . Wish they had some more apps, but the cemitas &amp; other items are as good as everyone says.  Wash it all down with a real Coke (sugar, no high fructose corn syrup) and you're good to go.  Great hangover food.. I'd buy bottles of the guy's sauces if they were available.. I'll be back.
