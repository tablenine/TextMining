The Hainian Chicken is really good here. The sauces really enhance the flavors. The rice is also flavorable. I don't think anyone should order the pizza though. The pizza has always been disappointing to me. It's way over the top doughy and cheese that does not separate! It's one big clump of grossness. . . So please, stick with the chicken and you'll be happy. Oh, they also do take out, so you really should call ahead and pick up. The place is popular so dining in will take some patience.
