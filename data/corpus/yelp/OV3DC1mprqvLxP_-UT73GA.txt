Another LONG and OVERDUE review.... Seriously, I really don't understand what the hype of this Kogi truck is. Do you people not know how to make tacos? First of all, invite your friends over and have them pitch in to bring a case of cold beer, chips/dips, rice, and other goodies.  Then buy some GOOD corn tortilla from a Mexican market, grab their red and green sauce, go to the Korean market and pick up marinated burlgogi (I prefer to make my own since we Koreans make the best at home) and grill it w/ charcoal. Then add chopped onions, cheese and cilantro... there you have it, tacos that are cheaper than waiting in line for over an hour and something WORTH eating.  Want the kimchi quesadilla? Then buy some kimchi, flour tortilla and cheese.  To make it tastier, you can add some K-bbq in there, too. :P Besides, I can make WAY better tacos and quesadillas than this overrated truck. -_-. Seriously, it's definitely not worth the wait in line.. . Advice:  Don't be fooled by their ending times.  One time, when I went, they were only open for 45 minutes and left at 10:45PM instead of staying until the promised time of 1AM.  If I were you, I'd call or tweet or facebook or something KOGI and ask them if they have a permit to load their trucks there cuz when went last time, there were a lot of POLICE and other nearby stores complaining about people blocking their driveways and such.. . To Kogi: You need to be more organized and know where to pick your places because you are making the local business owners angry.
