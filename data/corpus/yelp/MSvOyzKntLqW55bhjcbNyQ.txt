Here's another throwback LA eatery.  This place is very charming and gives a sense of what LA was back in the 50's.  I usually get the roast beef dipped sandwich with jack cheese, cole slaw or potato salad, pickled egg and to wash down everything...2 lemonades.  This place is usually crowded, but what do you expect....where else can you get lemonade and coffee for 25 cents?  I am so glad that they have perserved this place because it gives LA a nice charming place to eat.
