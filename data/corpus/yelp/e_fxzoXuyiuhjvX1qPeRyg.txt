This is a meat eaters delight.  For me this was perfect because I don't eat grains and the salad bar was awesome.  They had a lot of fresh vegetables and a lot of variety which is big for me.  Before I knew it I had a big plate of vegetables and lots of different cuts of meat on another plate.  It's a bit pricey but you won't leave hungry.  It's great for a large group.
