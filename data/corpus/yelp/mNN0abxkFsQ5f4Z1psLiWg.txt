What is with all the high stars?  Are you all nuts?  Well, it was not that great to me...Bland food, poor service! And a bit pricey...there are soooooooo many better places in the same area...I am beating myself up for having gone (based on Yelp reviews) and spending waaaaayyyyyyyyy too much money for absolutely nothing.  "nuf said". Go if you must, but, you won't like the food or service...don't say I didn't warn you!
