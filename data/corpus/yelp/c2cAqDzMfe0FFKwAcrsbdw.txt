Very expansive, down to earth sports bar in Pasadena. Been here a number of times. Service is on par with any other large well run operation. Not the most personal, but gets the job done. It's 3 levels! 4 if you count the area on top of the hollowed out bus. Pool tables on second floor. Multiple bathrooms. Drinks are normal prices.. . The most similar place I've been to would be Yankee Doodle on 3rd street. This place is better because it has a higher energy filled with more regular, and it seems to be a bit cleaner and well run.
