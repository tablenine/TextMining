Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
you know, im not a huge fan of prime rib.  when im in the mood for it, or have to eat it though, lawry's is the only place to go.  the valet service is prompt and polite.  however, ive always had to wait to be seated despite my reservations.  fortunately, there is a bar that makes decent drinks and freeee, eeendlesss meatballs and potato chips.  the first time i came here, i actually had the fish of the day which was just a white fish and it was actually very good.  could have been a bit bigger though.  the spinning salad is wonderful yes, yes.  mainly, i think they have a good flavorful, but light sauce and they have the best croutons evar.  EVAR.  as for my prime rib choice, i usually get the english cut.  its just like having sunday roast in london and it brings me back to my happy place.  the creamed corn is supposed to be one of their flagship items, but it taste varies.  i usually go with the creamed spinach as my side.  yum :D  the non-alcoholic beverages here are good, but um.. sparse.  i just get a glass of wine.  australian shiraz with prime rib,  sauvignon blanc from new zealand with the fish.  both are very good.  birthday girls and boys get a yummy slice of cake and a song.  definitely a 4 star place but id rather just cruise over to ruths chris for some ribeye.
