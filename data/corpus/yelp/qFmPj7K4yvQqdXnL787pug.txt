I am reviewing this establishment as a place for drinks and it that sense it didn't disappoint. Mondays $5 dollar martini night delicious! Their specialty martinis are varied and range from fruit to chocolate-to S'more. Yeah, that's right, a Smoretini it is just as good as it sounds. Our bartender Bryce was awesome, he always kept a good eye on our cups as well as laughing at our jokes and cracking a few of his own as well. I wanted my first visit to be for the food but I'll take cheap/delicious martinis as a runner-up.. . They also have a good selection of beers but I never sampled them because I was busy trying to try all of the martinis on the list. That was dangerous, I don't recommend trying to do it all once.
