My friend and I went here for a late brunch around noon. Although the wait outside in the sun was a bit gruesome, the food was worth the wait. I got the Fairfax High, which is hash browns, lox, red onions, tomatoes, topped with two poached eggs, bagel chips and hollandaise sauce. It was pretty f'ing delicious. The price tag is $12, and I almost want to just get a half order because it was so large. Â Nevertheless it was an amazing brunch.
