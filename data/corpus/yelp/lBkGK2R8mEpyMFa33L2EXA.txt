Restaurant: Fritti
Category: Italian
For the two or three vegans that will read this....Fritti's pizza dough and sauce is egg and dairy free!  This makes their cheeseless pizza one of my faves.  While the service can be hit or miss (esp. during the busy times), the food is always pleasing.  Weekday eves are the best times to hit this place and I suggest some time at the bar or on the patio.
