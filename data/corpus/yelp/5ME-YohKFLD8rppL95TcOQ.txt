Restaurant: Two Urban Licks
Category: Bars
Our waiter told us that Two Urban Licks was the second busiest restaurant in the Southeast (right after the Varsity) in terms of number of people served (he wasn't sure what the source for that was). Which in itself is pretty impressive - being an upscale restaurant, where patrons sometimes like to linger over a four course meal for a couple hours, I would think turnaround could be a challenge. They definitely have the seating for it. . . it's located in an industrialish space near one of the postal centers and past some small businesses off of Ralph McGill. There's also not one but two hostesses perched at the front to take the incoming flow of traffic. The space has ridiculously high ceilings and touches like vastly oversized flowers in vases and revolving artwork on display. The kitchen that sits directly in the middle of the main dining area is a bit like watching Iron Chef, but in real life. There's also a patio, which (weather permitting) could be a pretty romantic spot. . . The menu changes quite frequently, and I can only image the amount of planning that goes into this. Very cool that you'll get to experience something new every time you visit, but it could be a sad moment if you find a dish you love since it'll likely be gone next time you visit. . . And a note for the ladies: bust out your highest, most uncomfortable shoes here. The valet line is literally right at the entrance of the restaurant. . . you could probably get away with walking like 28 steps or so (unless you have to make a trip to the bathroom). . . If you're looking for somewhere quiet to have a serious discussion or take your Auntie Susan who has an aversion to loudness, this won't be ideal. But if you're looking for a place for a group, something new to try or meet up with friends, cruise down Freedom Parkway and check it out. Just be sure to make a reservation.
