Restaurant: The Izaka-ya by Katsu-ya
Category: Sushi Bars
First meal in LA on last weekend's mini-getaway trip and it was fabulous!. . I can't remember the exact names of everything we got, but you can take a look at my pictures -- they speak for themselves! The most memorable things were the salmon sashimi (SO FRESH! melts in your mouth like butter) and seared tuna w/ fried spinach (really different in a good way -- a must try!).. . Tip: It's a small restaurant and can get really crowded! Either come early and hang out w/ some sake or make a reservation.
