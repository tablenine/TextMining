Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
hot dogs are hot dogs...except when they're topped with bacon, pastrami, tomatoes and more.  i stopped by on around 1am saturday morning and waited for about 45 min for my 12 inch long Jalapeno Hot Dog topped with extra thick slices of bacon, mouth-watering pastrami, tomatoes and lettuce.  My friend got the Ozzi Dog, a spicy polish sausage topped with nacho cheese, american cheese, grilled onions, guacamole and tomatoes. Plus a side of pastrami and onion rings.... . the dogs were delicious, the buns were soft and sweet. i was afraid the toppings would overpower the dog but they didn't.  it was a great combination. the onion rings were pretty amazing as well. pink's is an experience that everybody has to try at least once.  i plan on going back for their reknowned chili dogs and maybe top it with some bacon.....
