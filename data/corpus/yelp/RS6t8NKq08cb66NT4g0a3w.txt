It's kind of hard to really give them a full review because I've only been there once, for a business meeting, and one of the guys in the group had already made reservations there so we didn't really experience the waiting. However, when we were seated, the first table they sat us at was the one right outside of the main entrance by the host table. As soon as we sat down we could smell the sewage stink from who knows where. So we asked to be moved somewhere else and so they did, inside the cafe at the couches. When we sat the couches sank so deep in that we could barely prop ourselves up to have a decent conversation let alone to eat. Not to mention the flies that were just everywhere all over people's food, flying through conversations and just annoying everyone in the cafe. You see everyone lifting their hands up to swat about. Before we decided to leave we gave them one final chance and so they gave us a corner table outside on the 3rd street side. That was I guess the best they could do at brunch time on Wednesday afternoon. It's ok I guess, we had to deal with the burning sun on our backs because we were so far out the awning above the outside patio didn't even reach far enough.. . The food? It was not bad, not the greatest, I've had better. Maybe I was already irritated by the whole experience of trying to sit at a table to talk business that I was just turned off by everything else they had to offer.. . I might give them another try one of these days.
