Hainan chicken...so good! And I don't even normally like chicken! The pasta was fabulous and the waitresses were so cute! They were sweetly making us laugh by sassing us about the amounts of condiments were were asking for.. . I got really great service considering how busy they were. One of my top places to go now, even though it means a drive from the OC.
