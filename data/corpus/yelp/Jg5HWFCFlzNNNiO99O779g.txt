Second review...... I changed my review from 4 stars to 2 stars. Basically because I went back for the steak tacos and they tasted nothing like the first time. The first time they had an amazing char-broiled flavor. The next time I went back there was no char flavor. Inconsistancy at it's best.  Also I have a problem when they decide to sweep the floor right next to my table while I'm eating.  That's just gross, particles of debri flying around. That's just nasty and rude. Go sweep somewhere else you asshole.. . First review...... Steak taco with onions, cilantro and the dark salsa.  That's all you need. The best steak taco in the city.. -1 star because the floor was filthy and because service was a little slow.
