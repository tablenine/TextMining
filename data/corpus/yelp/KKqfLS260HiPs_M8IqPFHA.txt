I'm not sure what is meant when people call Mirai expensive. It's on par, price-wise, with any other decent sushi place (we're not counting the all you can eat for 20 bucks). On the other hand, Mirai definitely wins handsdown for quality and taste and yes, even size. The nigiri and sashimi hunks here are HUGE!  I used to be a huge fan of Starfish but that place has since gone to hell in a handbasket probably due to its unfortunate location down the street from the ever-popular Sushi Wabi (which is good, but also, not as good as Mirai).  I have to say, Mirai seems to keep getting better and better with every visit.. . Must haves: botan ebi (huge pieces here too!), all the cocktails (cucumber passion if you're not afraid of girly drinks), the king crab meat appetizer--whats the name?, the monkfish foie gras with fluke or octopus, the real wasabi, and just about everything pretty much.. . All my sushi dollars are going to be spent here from now on.
