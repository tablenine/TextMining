Wow, I've never seen such a busy restaurant for its size. I'm a huge fan of Mitch's special rolls. I am a little biased since I know the owner but really this place gives off a unique vibe of friendliness due to the owner,Mitch. He tries to make everyone feel special and unique as a customer and that type of service is great to stand out. The food is superb and the wait and popularity here is demanding but just make sure you plan your evening well and call ahead for the wait times. You will pleasantly surprised with the service and food quality. Bring your bottles of wine to enjoy the cheer, chatting and get your tastebuds ready for those special Mitch' sushi rolls!
