Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
First off, despite my hatred for the Argentinian soccer team I agreed to eat here with my girlfriend. Just kidding... kind of. We showed up for a birthday dinner for a friend of hers.. . To be honest, by the end of the night I was actually glad I came along. I had a good time and some good food. I ordered the Entrana al Ajo which was a a big freaking skirt steak covered in garlic and a side of garlic mashed potatoes. I love garlic so I was peeing myself on sight of such gloriously stinky food. Perhaps others around me were not. To hell with them.. . After I spoke about my dislike for all the pulp-like fruit floaties in the sangria (same way I prefer to drink my OJ, not eat it), I drank two pitchers of it. Personal preference is one thing, but passing up alcohol because of it is just... stupid.. . The service was decent but only because my girlfriend and her friends knew one of our servers. Homie hooked it up, but several times we asked the other servers for more bread or to-go boxes, never saw them again. Pretty annoying.. . The overall ambiance is pretty nice. Restroom was kind of shady. Hold it if you can. Trendy hipsterish LA crowd, a little too much for me, but I suppose it's expected. I did find myself whipping out my iphone a time or two for no reason at all, as well as a nagging urge to purchase a v-neck shirt. Hmm, strange.. . Maradona and the "Hand of God" '86 World Cup incident aside, I recommend this place.
