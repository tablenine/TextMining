Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Atmosphere:. It is very comfortable and the table settings and appearance are modern, which is a plus in my book. . . Food:. I prefer "pan fried dumplings" as opposed to steamed. But they were nevertheless, appetizing. . . Note:. This place is plated for 4 or more per party. You kind of get full without much variety with just 2 and variety is key if you don't want to shell out over $20 per person on 3 or 4 plates of 10 pieces. ugHHH ... Bring people!
