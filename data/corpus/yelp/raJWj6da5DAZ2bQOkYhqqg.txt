This is a restaurant that at first glance seems perfect for a romantic dinner. Especially their courtyard. It's quite pretty with the tables around the perimeter of a lovely japanese garden. The setting however is all but romantic. . . There were mostly groups sitted there. A family with a 2-year-old screaming and banging cutlery here, tourists with no brains or decorum there....you get the picture. Next table from us sat a group of 5-6 people who between them had a metric tonne of excess weight and were discussing how someone they know can hide a mobile phone in the folds of fat on their stomach. What a bunch of monkeys.. . The food did redeem this place substantially. Every dish was lovely. Very high quality ingredients, very well prepared, very imaginative. The wine list had good variety and was reasonably priced. . . Service was very average at best. They brought out 4 dishes at the same time. Come on!!! Then the bus boy came around to refill the water and poured water into my wife's wine glass. Having this pointed out he started fussing, checked the bottle of wine and ran off to bring a refilled glass to compensate for the ruined one. Except the wine he brought in the new glass was something different. It was nice enough, so we didn't complain. . . In a serious restaurant a slip up like that would warrant taking the wine off the bill altogether.
