Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I went here for lunch today with an old friend.  I can't remember the last time I came here, maybe a few years ago.  We arrived at about 11:25 a.m. and spent about half an hour in line.. . I ordered the chili dog and the chili cheese fries.  My friend ordered the Guadalajara dog and onion rings.  We shared the side orders.  I like the Hoffy dogs with the "snap" to it.  The chili fries and onion rings were both good and we both had leftovers.. . When you're in the mood to line up along La Brea and aren't worried about your calories and cholesterol level, Pink's is the place to go!
