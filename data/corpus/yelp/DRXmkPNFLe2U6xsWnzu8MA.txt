Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
i don't understand the hype about this place. the wait is atrocious (before being seated and after ordering), even close to closing time. and the rubbery canned mushrooms are disgusting. yeah, i don't live close by so take-out is not really an option. i might give CB another shot if i happen to be in the area, cause i love pizza in general but next time no rubber-rooms for me!
