My bf and I enjoyed a wonderful Valentine dinner on the Friday before. We had reservations for 7:00, but we weren't seated until 7:30. We waited at the bar and I enjoyed a glass of wine. The host was so sweet to us. He apologized a couple of times for the wait and told us that our table would be ready soon. He told us he wanted to find the perfect table.. . By the time we were seated, we were both famished! When the bread basket came, I thought it was so buttery, but my bf seemed to enjoy it. For starters, I ordered the salad rita and my bf ordered the Cesare salad. Both were pretty tasty. As for the entree, I ordered the clam linguini with red sauce and my bf ordered spaghetti. My entree was absolutely delicious! All the ingredients were fresh and the linguini was cooked perfectly! We polished off my dish and took my bf's dish home. They also included bread in his to-go bag. He was so excited about lunch the next day! . . The service and food were both outstanding!. I couldn't of asked for a better night! Â This is the best Italian restaurant in Atlanta!
