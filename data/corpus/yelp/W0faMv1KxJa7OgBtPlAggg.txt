Called to make an RSVP at 5:40 for a party of 5 at 6 on a Sunday night. "No problem" they said. Sitting outside in March on tin-like tables should have been miserable, but with the plethora of heating lamps and warm service made it quite pleasant. We were impressed with the menu and the cool looking appetizers and ordered some drinks to start ourselves off. I was sad the fried chickpeas were more non-edible skin than edible bean, and that my flat-bread "meal" was rather lacking in size/quantity, but everyone else likes their meals. Overall, we enjoyed the karma of the place and the fact that we could eat gourmet food while watching people walk down the tragically hip streets of Culver City.
