Sooo good! They make everything themselves!. . There are so many delicious ice cream flavors. . . My boyfriend and I shared a banana split, oh the nostalgia. It has a scoop of banana ice cream in it that is to die for. . . This place is a heavenly boutique of sweets. It has created cravings in me which I never knew exisited.
