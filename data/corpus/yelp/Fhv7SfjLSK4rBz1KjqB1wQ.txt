Excellent food, drinks, and service.  its a small place...very, very small.  It was also hot, so they had the door propped opened, and that allowed small flies and such.. so the food was excellent, but i don't like eating in at a cramped and hot table, fending away the flies...so maybe ill go in the winter.
