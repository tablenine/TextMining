Okay, now I'm pretty sure they raised their prices because I just paid $40 (included tip) for 1 scallop dynamite, 1 bowl of rice, 1 salmon nigiri, 1 albacore nigiri, 1 spicy tuna cut roll, 1 unagi nigiri and 1 hamachi cut roll. It was the perfect amount of food, but I remember a couple of years ago, for $40, I was "I'm going to throw up" full, not, "Okay, let's get dessert now" full. Quality is still okay, and service was quick, but prices have gone up! Oh well, I guess it's in line with everything else. Cash only, people!
