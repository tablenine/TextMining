One of the hidden gems of the Chicago area, an area that has plenty of Italian choices around.  A bit out of the way for some, on the corner of Logan Blvd. and California, but that means there is actually street parking!  . . A few years ago, when I spent the summer living in Logan Square, I had at least 3 meals an evening sitting at the bar. (Eating at a bar is ALWAYS more fun that drinking in a restaraunt).  The owners are pleasant and will remember you forever, and the staff is always ready with good recommendations.  . . The butternut squash ravioli is by far my favorite dish, although the daily specials can be worth your time too.  Portions are good sized, without being huge.. . Try this place, it is worth the hype.
