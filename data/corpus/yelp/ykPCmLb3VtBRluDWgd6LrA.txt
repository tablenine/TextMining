I'm not a huge connoisseur of the brat... but I do know my sausage.  *ahem* I really liked the Louisiana hot link covered in grilled onions and sauerkraut.  Pretty standard - but who cares if it's delish.  I loved the thick rustic fries and all of the yummy dipping sauces you have to choose from.  I suggest the sweet &amp; sassy bbq, the curry ketchup or the chipotle ketchup.  oh yea... and if you're not into beer - there are plenty of exotic and fun sodas to choose from (have a cherry ginger beer!)
