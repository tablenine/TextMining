If you're craving upscale Mexican then Adobo Grill is the perfect place to go! As everyone else says the guacamole alone is an experience because they actually make it at your table- it's really good!. . Their ceviche and quesidilla appetizers are also really good! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!
