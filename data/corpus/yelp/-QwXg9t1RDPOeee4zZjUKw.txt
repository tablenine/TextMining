Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
When I lived down here, I knew Pink's was famous, but I lived on the west side, and it seemed silly to drive across town for a hot dog. Once I tried Pink's, I liked it enough to make the trip once a month or so. Nothing wrong with a good chili dog (or two) with a side of onion rings.. . So why just 3 stars? Wasn't learning that Matthew St. Patrick (Keith from Six Feet Under) was shorter than I thought (but still very cool) enough? Um... not really. It's not hard to see celebrities in LA.. . Here's the deal. It's probably been about 3 years since I had a hot dog from Pink's. Do I miss it? Frankly, no. I'd rather have go to Rosamunde's Sausage grill up here and have one with chili (and they're chili is FAR superior to Pink's).. . Don't get me wrong, Pink's is good. It's just not great.
