Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Was dying to try Mozza out for a couple of reasons.  The buzz, of course, but also cause it's in my neighborhood.  Didn't love, love, love it like I was hoping to.  The crust, like everyone agrees is amazing but I didn't LOVE the pizza.  We had the mushroom pizza, clam pizza, and sausage pizzas.  The clam was my favorite, I'd give it a solid 5 stars.  The others were okay.. Did love the wine and butterscotch pudding.  Their fig dessert tasted like a fig newton, not great.. We had the bean starter as well as a croquette type thing.  Neither were amazing.. I'm definitely going back but will try my luck and eat at the bar, seems more fun that way.
