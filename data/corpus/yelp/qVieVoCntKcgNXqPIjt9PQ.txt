This new location is a huge step up from their hole-in-the-wall location on Argyle.  It's a huge, open space that's more modern-looking with exposed brick and ductwork....sexy! . . Anyways, we were seated promptly, a teapot on the table and menus in hand.  After a couple of minutes, we were ready to order, but we waited......and waited....and waited....until I wave my arms high up in the air to get some kind of attention.  We ordered the hot and sour soup, beef chow mein, half a duck, and shrimp fried rice.  . . The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor was it sour....it was bland and boring.  They must have forgotten to add some kind of key ingredient because in no way did it come close to hot and sour soup.  If I order hot and sour soup, it better make my toungue burn and my lips pucker...this did neither.  The chow mein was bland as well, it had a lot of noodles, just how I like it, but the flavor just wasn't there.  The juicy roasted duck was a winner as well as the shrimp fried rice with its grilled taste.  Other cons were lukewarm tea and dirty plates.. . I will come back again as I've heard excellent things about their peking duck; however, the dumpy Hon-Kee on Argyle will always be first-place in my heart.  I think that overall, their food is much better.
