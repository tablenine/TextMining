You know, I don't know if "real ganstas eat thai" or not.  I've been reading a lot of Raymond Chandler lately and all the gangsters in his books don't really eat at all.  They mainly smoke and drink and say really pithy things. But that was the thirties and, as far as I know, Thai food hadn't been invented yet.  Anyway, something to ponder.. . On to the food: This is one of the few places I can remember where the delivery is actually better than dine-in, at least in my experience.  Sure, the food is a little expensive for Thai, but the portions are good and it's quality eatin'.  Had the Tom Yum soup (shrimp) tonight--spicy, great flavor, and packed full of perfectly lovely tender shrimpy goodness.  Great curries, tasty noodles and delicious appetizers--especially the satay.
