so, so good!  whether its brunch or dinner, im always pleased.  here are my thoughts. . . the pickles - i can't get enough of the sweet and the dill combo.. the meatloaf - omg, yes please. it's not your  mom's meatload.. the breakfast sausages - totally unique and very homemade.  so tasty!. skip the bread pudding and go for the pecan pie sundae.  it's almost absurdly good.. skip the goat cheese croquettes.. the french toast- is it possible to be this good?  it's like the pecan pie sundae on fluffy bread.. the scallops- light and delicious.  . . mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... i love buttermilk!  it's a little loud, and the cocktails could use work.  however, the food is topnotch and i can't wait to see where this place goes.
