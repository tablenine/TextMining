Nice Southern comfort food.  It's not upscale or a dive, and it reminds me of a smaller Claim Jumpers but without the stupid theme. . I ordered the roasted turkey with gravy and cornbread.  Delicious!  Our group enjoyed some sweet potato fries with melted blue cheese and that was delicious too.  I really wish they had fried chicken and fried catfish but unfortunately they weren't on the menu.. . Southern food is soooo good but it's bad for the waistline.
