Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
This place is great.  Full stop.  I've traveled throughout Asia and eaten in high-end restaurants through to great-but-dire-looking dives in Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong and lots of other places.  The noodles at Urban Belly as good or better than I've had anywhere.  I've had every noodle dish on the menu and thought they were all great.  I've had foodies in from NYC who were blown away, too.  The thing that I think is esp. great is that Bill Kim stretches the concept to take his dishes beyond the typical by making unusual but delicious combinations.  For example, the rice noodles with hominy and kimchi is like a Korean pozole.  The lamb and brandy dumplings are just great.  the flavors can be intense and unusual, so those with less familiarity with non-westernized Asian food may find this a bit challenging.  more some may find I happen to like the counter-service/communal seating set up, so that works for me.  I also tend to go during the day when things are busy but not stacked. . . In short, this place is great and well worth a visit.
