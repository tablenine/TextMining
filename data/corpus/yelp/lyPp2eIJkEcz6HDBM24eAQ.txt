I enjoy going to Rock Bottom, but I feel like I should enjoy it more.  I always feel like the beer selection could be better....I generally end up just getting the wheat beer, even though I try to find something different each time.  . My friend and I split the nachos and pretzels (which have a lot of garlic and are delicious) and have a couple of brews.  We starting coming here to take advantage of their Mug Club benefits after we attained MBA status at Goose Island, but I don't think the Mug Club benefits outweigh the much better beers that Goose Island has to offer.
