Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Old style diner with authentic waitresses. I am not kidding - I think they have been around since they opened. Nothing wrong with them, they are sweet and efficient.. . One definite recommendation: Do not go for anything other than the pastrami sandwiches. Burgers and dogs are not special. Go pastrami and you get a mountain. I usually remove some of it to avoid a coronary.. . Enjoy
