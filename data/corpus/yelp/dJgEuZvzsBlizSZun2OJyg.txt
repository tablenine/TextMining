I have been a supporter of Eats for years. It was a life saver for me, as a poor college student who was also vegetarian (WAS). Six bucks for a huge plate of food and I would still have a little money left over for beer. Eats saved many weekends for me. And it continues to be one of my favorite places. If I want something fast, or hearty, or cheap. Or if I just want a little nostalgia - it can be found at Eats. . Oh, and ginger beer. Yes please.
