Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
HANDS down the best chinese restaurant in LA!. I try to get there at least 6 times a year.. Introduced by a flirtatious and friendly mandarin speaker, Im used to getting the best service there.. We still have to wait in line but there is a fun chinese novelty/bookstore/juice shop there next door(-they also sell boba but you have to ask and it is bigger boba then you will get in SF.). . The steamed dumplings are to die for and they usually understand vegetarianism, often curtly saying "no you not want that" . . The kitchen is behind glass so you can watch the rather large in number of latino boys roll your dumplings right there. Â . . I have gone there with friends who have thanked me profusely for bringing them and some have gone back to enjoy it on their own.
