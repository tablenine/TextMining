On my second visit here, I was sadly a little underwhelmed but I think it's because I just ordered the wrong things. Although I loved my chinese chicken salad last time, I wanted to venture out and try something new so I opted for the apricot glazed ham and brie sandwich on ciabatta. It was a little too dry and not very flavorful. I was not impressed at all. . . My friends and I also shared a half-pint of the butternut squash side which came in a little bowl. It looked really amazing but again, it didn't mesh well with my tastebuds. One of my friends really liked it though, so I guess it just depends on the person. . . The best thing of the day was a dessert my friends and I shared from their bakery called Frutti di Bosco. SO delicious! It looks like a berry tart with powdered sugar on top. We all loved it! I definitely recommend this one!!. . Although most of my food was mediocre this time around, I'm still giving Joan's 4 stars because I absolutely love the space and ambience here! I love the market, the setup, the charcuterie, the bakery, the colors, the busyness, everything! I can't wait to try the rest of their menu items! :)
