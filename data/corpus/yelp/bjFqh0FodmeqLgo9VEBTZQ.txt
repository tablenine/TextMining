HOLY sh*t ballz.  I looooove this spot.  I'm a Thai food fanatic, of course I'm sure my idea of Thai is a bit Americanized, but whatev.  GREAT experience!  Asian Elvis dude singing is an experience all in itself.  Family style servings.  Busy busy crowd.  The whole communication by Secret Service earpieces brings a chuckle.  Valet has never been an issue w/ me b/c I park on Hollywood.  Here's what I've orderd, and LOVE: Red Curry, Thai Basil Noodle, Pad Thai and coconut ice cream.  Enjoy!
