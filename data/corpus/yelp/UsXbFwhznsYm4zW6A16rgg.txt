OMG I loved this place!  Their sweet potatoes are bomb!  Best I've ever had.  I want more, too bad there aren't any up here.  I had the waffle and it was not disappointing, I think it was the butter that really made it taste amazing.  The cornbread is just ok.  I loved their biscuits, very soft.. . Funny this location is right next to a KFC!. . Since this local is in Pasadena, I have a feeling they are not as busy as inland.  So I was happy we got seated right away.  That was cool.  Best part of all, Snoop Dogg eats at Roscoe's and so did I, finally.  That's how we do it on the wild West.
