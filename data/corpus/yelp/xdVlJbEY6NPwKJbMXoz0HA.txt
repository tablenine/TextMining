Restaurant: Southern Sweets Bakery
Category: Bakeries
This hidden bakery in Decatur is a bakery that's worth every praise.  I came to know this bakery through Cafe Sunflower.  I used to go to Cafe Sunflower often because of their lovely Strawberry Layer cake.  Then I miraculously found out that Cafe Sunflower does not make their own desserts, but gets shipments from Southern Sweets Bakery.  So I could not resist but visit this place.. . When I was driving to get here, I honestly thought I got lost because this part of Decatur was very unfamiliar to me.  By some mere luck, I found the place and went in.  The interior was homely - warm, not overly decorated, and comfortable.  Since there were so many cakes to choose from, I did not go with the usual Strawberry Layer cake.  Instead, I went crazy and ordered Rustic Apple Pie.  Although I heart any apple desserts, I could not find a place in my heart for this one.   But it was a pleasant experience, overall.
