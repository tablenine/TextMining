This is a great Chinese restaurant.. . The service was superb; the waiters, busboys, entire staff were extremely friendly and polite -- and they all spoke English!!  Now that's just not something you see at a Chinese restaurant.. . The seating area itself was nicely spaced, didn't feel crowded at all.. . And the food was extremely tasty.. . I typically have a difficult time rating Chinese restaurants because the food all seems to taste the same to me.  But here, they truly have some original and unique seafood dishes.  I've never been a big fan of clams, but the ones I had here in the black bean sauce has changed my mind.. . Again, a really great Chinese restaurant, one of the best I've been to in a long time.
