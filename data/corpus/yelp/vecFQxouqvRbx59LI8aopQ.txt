Good food and friendly, good service.  Being a southern California native, I thought it was horrible I've never had pupusas.  I've heard of them here and there and how they're so good, but never had the opportunity to try them.  Soo I found Gloria's here on Yelp and decided I'd take my friend.  We arrived a little bit after the evening hours started up so it was pretty empty.  I tried the Salvadorian Special, which is 1 pupusa and 1 tamal del elote.  I wasn't wowed by either actually, but I did appreciate the new experience.  I'd have pupusas again though.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as great as I thought it'd be.  I had the sangria, which was good.  No fruits, but it was light and not too strong.  Throughout the meal, it got more and more crowded and by the end of our meal, the restaurant was packed!  I'd say if I lived closer to this place, I'd go again.  There was a lot on the menu that looked yummy.  :)  Wasn't amazed, but it was good.
