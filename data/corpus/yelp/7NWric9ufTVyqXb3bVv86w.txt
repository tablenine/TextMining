Oh, I did want to mention that you can avoid the long line by parking yourself on a seat, albeit an hideously uncomfortable no-back tiny butt metal stool, at the bar/ open kitchen area. A server will take and serve your order right there, even bring you a drink vs. the self-serve area for the rest of the dining room and patio.
