The person that introduced me to this place claims this is their favorite restaurant. I was not impressed. We got edamame, some quinoa dish(their website is down so cant remember the name) and some sort of salad. The flavor just didnt hit the right spot for me. There was something off/missing...anyway, I dont know what it was but I don't plan to try it again.. . I just dont get the hype...
