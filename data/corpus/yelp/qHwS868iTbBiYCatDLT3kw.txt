I noticed that these guys have a stand at Madison Square Park Market going on right now, so I had to pay them a visit since it's been a year or two since my last treat of theirs.  . . I got the liege waffle with belgian chocolate topping.  It was tasty but the only reason I didn't get more toppings is because at the time, I didn't want to spend too much money on a piece of waffle. Maybe I need to go all out with the toppings one day? . . Overall, good but not over the top amazing.  It will definitely satisfy your fix for a warm bread-y dessert with melted toppings, that's for sure. The people are very friendly and cool, and when I first saw their stand at the Brooklyn flea market a couple years ago, I bought the cutest Nutella spread knife from them.
