Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I love Pink's.  I love getting a hot dog with all kinds of stuff piled on top.  I love waiting in line trying to decide if I'll venture out and try something new.  I love watching the people making them, working all fast a furious.  I have never had to wait a very long time and even though they are not the best hot dogs, I really enjoy going to Pink's.  Its so LA it makes me laugh.  There are all kinds of hot dogs named after celebrities and characters.  Its just fun.  Go at least once and don't take it to seriously, its just a hot dog!
