Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
They gave us a free taco by accident. yay! but i was too full from eating another dinner to enjoy it. Boo! . . The fish in the tacos were so soft and didn't smell fishy. I didn't even use a lime. It was one of the best fish tacos I've had. :D Wait now that I think about it, it was just soft. I don't remember a crispy part... I will have to go back and check. So while I check i have to take a star away. The shrimp taco was good but I liked the fish better. The jicama juice was not very strong or tart but it was only a buck. I'm sure they have to water it down to make a profit.
