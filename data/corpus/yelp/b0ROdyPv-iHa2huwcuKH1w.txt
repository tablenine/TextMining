We came here at 8:30 on a Friday night and got seated right away - they have a lot of tables.  The servers are all hipsters, and ours was quite unfriendly.  Not good.. . I ordered the Carbonara - a pizza with bacon and a fried egg in the middle.  It was tasty, just a little salty with the bacon. The personal pizzas were 12 to 15 bucks each, a little pricey since they feed only one person.  The service was quick, but our server was rude.. . Being organic makes it four stars.  If it wasn't organic, I'd give it three.
