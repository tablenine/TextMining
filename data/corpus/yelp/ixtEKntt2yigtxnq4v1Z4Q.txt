I know this place is known for their chinese sausage, and my friends looove it, but I'm all about the Taiwanese shaved ice.  We meant to come here for ONLY dessert after Din Tai Fung, but my friend ended up getting an order of sausage &amp; raw garlic (it's supposed to be really yummy when you eat it together), and I ordered a green onion pancake.  Great little snacks even after an actual meal!. . There's always room for shaved ice, even if you're full from your meal!  We ordered it with red bean, boba, pudding, peanuts, and these pink &amp; white rice balls.  It was delightful!  Really refreshing for a hot day, but still great on a cold day...you just might need to put your heater on full blast in your car when you drive home!
