In such a politically charged environment I felt compelled to visit a place that is full of pork of the non-political kind.. . This has been told to me as THE ribs place in the city.. . Even last nigh when the temperature was -5 outside, I braved the cold and arrived to find a small wait?!?!?  Wow, this place IS popular.. . Sitting at the bar and having a few drinks while waiting on my table was nice.  Bartenders are friendly and the other patrons....many of which I assumed lived near by, where also friend and quick with conversation.. . Onto the ribs....the standard offering is $20 and you can pick regular or zesty sauce.  Zesty is good, though I felt it was more sweet than heat, but good nonetheless.. . Meat fell off the bone and I had it with pepper-jack creamed spinach which was quiet good.. . There menue has plenty of other selections to choose from, though I wouldn't know why you would unless you came here often.. . The decor has a dive bar feel, but with class.  Jukebox is a treat and not loud...which I like because you can hear the music AND hear yourself talk to the person next to you.. . Movies have been filmed here (see other reviews for details), so a place you should put on your to do list for the windy cities eateries.
