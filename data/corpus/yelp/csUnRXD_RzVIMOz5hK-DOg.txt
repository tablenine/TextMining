Lives up to the hype.  One bite of my short rib burrito and the half hour of waiting on a random street in the dark disappeared from my memory.  The months of hating and doubting were gone.  I grew up on both Mexican and Korean food, and both are done justice by the Kogi truck.. . Kind of expensive and the whole chasing-down-the-truck thing isn't conducive to everyday eating for most of us, but it's good stuff.  Now I just need someone to start a knockoff in my new hometown of Chicago...
