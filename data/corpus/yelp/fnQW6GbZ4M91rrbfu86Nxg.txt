well i thought it was just me, lol.. . i was so effin excited when this spot opened couldn't wait to try it.. actually tried going here about 2-3 times dealing with rude, ignorant, not skilled in their job hostesses. and i say it cause i've been a hostess off and on for years. seriously, it put such a damper on wanting to go here that i'm surprised i even tried again. . so it finally happens and the food's o-k....i got the lamb, which someone below described as "pretty much stew", that sums it up. i can say in it's favor, the gnocchi was fresh and very tasty.. the dessert was excellent (apricot, sage, thingie no longer on the menu, unless they resurrected it). the 2nd time i ate here i got the same thing, including an incompetent hostess, and just an alright server. two's enough for me, i wouldn't go back. . . oh fraiche, i had such high hopes for us!
