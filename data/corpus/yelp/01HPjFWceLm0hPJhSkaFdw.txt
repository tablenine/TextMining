I recently made it back to JCT kitchen after more than a year and was better than I remembered!! I was so happy that I decided to bring my friend who was visiting from SF to JCT. We shared a few appetizers( truffle fries and shrimp toast) and split the fried chicken salad and everything was just perfect. I also appreciate the fact that they split the salad for us in the kitchen I hate when you tell them you are going to split an entree item and then they bring it out to you and give you tiny little plates to eat off of! It was a little loud in there at lunch time but the place was packed. I can't wait to come back and try them for dinner!
