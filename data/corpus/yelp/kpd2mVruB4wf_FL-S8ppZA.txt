Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
The chicken is amazing. The waffles are amazing. The mac n cheese is amazing. The service is a bit slow at times when they're busy, but it's bearable. But overall, this is a place that everyone should at least hit up once to try. Go to this location in Hollywood, not to the other locations. I've been to the Pasadena one a couple times and it's not nearly as good. They don't split bills either.
