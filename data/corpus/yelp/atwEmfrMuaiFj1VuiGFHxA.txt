Hip, Trendy, Delicious, Large beer selection, and Decently priced!. . My o My.. Where do i begin?  My date wanted try to try this eatery out after reading about it on yelp.  Unfortunately, I believe we arrived during peek hours.. on Sunday, around 8-9pm, where we had to wait about 45 minutes before it was our turn to order. ( At least we had time to figure out what we wanted). . We had:. 1. Santa Fe Jack Cheese &amp; Jalapeno Peppers - smoked turkey. 2. Austin Blues. 3.  Large fries + White truffle oil glaze + 2 sauces ... ( Sundried Tomato Mayo and Chipotle Aioli ) . 4. Three beers:. a) Floris Apple Ale - apple flavor. b) St. Louis Framboise - raspberry . c) Chimay Grande Reserve (Blue) - strong woody taste. Price tagged at : ~$50. . . I wanted to try the Duck &amp; Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers - supposedly  juicy and packed with flavor, but it was not available =(. . The hot dogs were smaller in sizes than expected, but what they lacked in quantity they made up in quality.  Juicy, flavorful, and fresh!  The white truffle oil on the fries gave it an extra kick and the dipping sauces.. i loved! They have variety of beers to choose from and since i like the fruitiness associated with my chosen beers. I definitely have no complaints. I would come back just for the fries + beer!. . Cons: They forgot to give us our order of fries.. then when it arrived..they forgot the white truffle oil on it. The third attempt: success! LOL. . . Pros: Food and Beer.. . Note* For the hot dogs, I would select the following toppings:  Caramelized Onions and spicy peppers. We had the sweet Peppers on one of the hot dogs because the cashier insisted we go with that. Which ended up tasting..out of place!
