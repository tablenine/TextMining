A classed-up Taqueria del Sol with better food, atmosphere, and without the brash indifference toward the customers. Clean, artsy design in a beautifully restored house, but the decor is not (as sometimes is the case with these types of places) simply a smokescreen to disguise mediocre fare. . . The menu is inventive but not overly experimental, and adds a twist to conventional dishes. The four taco entree ($12) allows a sampling of the various meats they have, which are very tasty (the pulled pork and the duck were my favorites). The house margarita was better than most I've had around town, and at $5 didn't break the bank.. . They seemed a little understaffed when we were there, but it was 7:00 on a Friday night in downtown Decatur. Once we were seated the service was prompt and excellent. We'll definitely be back!
