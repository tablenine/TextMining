Huge fan of this place!  I saw it featured on diners, drive-ins and dives about two months ago and finally had the chance to stop in for lunch.. . The sandwiches/cemitas were fantastic and I'd recommend them because you can't find them anywhere else.  I wish I had the appetite to continue ordering items on the menu, but it's a good reason to come back and try other stuff.
