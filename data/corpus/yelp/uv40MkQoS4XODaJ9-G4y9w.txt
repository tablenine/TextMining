So there I was.... . A 6' 3" white boy stuck in the middle of a throng of Â much less than 6' 3" Asian folks. To say I stuck out would be and understatement. Not necessarily because of my taller stature, but more by the clueless expression I had on my face. The good news is my clueless and weary expression (hour and a half wait!) quickly turned to joy once I started shoveling their tasty grub into my pie hole.. . So here is what we ordered:. Pork dumplings which were delicate, tasty and fresh.. Roast beef noodle soup that had seemingly 8 foot long noodles.. Pork chop fried rice that was simple and good. . Sauteed green beans which were perfectly seasoned.. Shanghai rice cake was my favorite. Add a little vinegar and this dish comes alive.. . If you're in a hurry, don't come here because you WILL have a wait. But of course its well worth it.
