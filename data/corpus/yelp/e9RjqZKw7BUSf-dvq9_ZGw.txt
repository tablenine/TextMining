Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
For those who do not want to drive up to West Hollywood for dinner, Ugo's offers sophistication and affordable eats. Ugo lies in the heart of Culver city. Great value for your dollar. Great atmosphere for a nice dinner during the week. Â The food is good and service is good. I particularly love their new addition, the wine bar. The ingenious idea of having a self-serve tasting room is what makes this place my favorite. You purchase a card with credits on and it and go around the bar and select wines from around the world, but mostly Italians wines. They not only have wine, but champagne as well. I can't wait for the great LA weather to come, the outside sidewalk dining and drinking will be great!
