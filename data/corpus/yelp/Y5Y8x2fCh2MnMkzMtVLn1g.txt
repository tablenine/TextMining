Okay, the food was fantastic. The waitress was fantastic. I had a great time. I am giving it a 1 start because I GOT FOOD POISONING, from my dinner. . . Therefore, the food was not good - because I woke up at 3 am with the worst stomach pains in my entire life - and then went to the bathroom every 2 minutes for the rest of the evening. . . I did call Roy's and make a complaint. I was told that no one else from Friday night called to complain about their food - AT THIS POINT - DO I CARE THAT NO ONE ELSE COMPLAINED!! - NO, I DO NOT. . . They did however, call back and say they were offering us a $50 gift card to come back and try again. I will let you know how that goes - it might be awhile or i will never go back
