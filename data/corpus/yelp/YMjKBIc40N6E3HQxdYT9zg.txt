This place might have been the best breakfast I have ever eaten.. This place does not fuck around when it comes to Breakfast.. They do it big!  Big portions and big flavors leaving you with a big stomach!. . I ordered an omlette which was packed with lots of fresh veggies, jack cheese and turkey meat.  MMMMMMMMM,  yeah I'll leave it at that.  It was on point x100!. . My friend ordered a mimosa and she didn't want to finish it, WTF?!. So I finished it and it was amazing.  I'm not a big mimosa drinker but it was one of the best I have ever tasted.. . I tried some of my friends short stack of banana pancakes with brown sugar and I almost creamed myself at the table.  No joke, this is what comfort food is all about.  . . I will be back here some day guaranteed.  Flawless
