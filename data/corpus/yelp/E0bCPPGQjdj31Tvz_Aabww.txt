Restaurant: La Tavola Trattoria
Category: Italian
Good slick urban ambience, if a bit crowded in a loft-like way (you can reach the bar in about 10 steps from anywhere inside the restaurant).  Has patio in the back that's part of a connected facade for several restaurants, however, its potential is greatly dampened due to the the view being mostly of the back parking lot.  . . Menu is not long but packs in a good variety of trattoria preparations, including a Cacciucco seafood stew that I don't see in other places.  Sometimes boar sausages and ox tail make it into specials, both are a pleasant surprise that tells me the chef plays with different ideas and is not fuzzy about using less common ingredients.  Mussels are plump and bread very, very good (I want to ask them where they get it).   Calamari is offered grilled and not fried, which I like.  . . Risotto and pasta come in about 7 varieties and are very delicious at times, but not consistent.  I've had the asparagus risotto and a sausage pasta slightly overcooked or limply seasoned before.  Although the agnolotti is a delightful touch, I wondered what a manicotti was doing on that menu.  But overall the primi are well-prepared and come in surprisingly large portions. . . I haven't had enough of the secondi or dolci to review those.. . Daniel the waiter was very knowledgable each time I dined there, answering questions about food and wine fairly.  I also liked that he pronounced Bruschetta right.  Hostess is impossibly cute, and very friendly. (and, apparently almost always there)  . . This place is certainly worth a try or three.  But at the price range similar to Sotto Sotto, I prefer the latter.
