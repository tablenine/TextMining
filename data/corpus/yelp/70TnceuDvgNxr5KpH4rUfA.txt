Restaurant: Sura Thai Bistro
Category: Thai
Thai favorites with a funky twist? Count me in. . . Sura Thai Bistro takes what we all know and love (Thai apps, soups, small plates and entrees) and makes them sparkle. Crazy good flavors, interesting combinations and excellent execution and presentation...lovely! I especially loved the Tom-Kha soup and veggie dumplings with soybeans (didn't even have to remove the edamame "slippers" my self, they did it for me!). . Ultra mod interior, without it hitting the bill. This place is stylish/sleek without the pretension. Service was friendly and quick, ambience was cozy (despite the modern feel), and the green tea was pipin' hot Â (CAUTION) to soothe my sicky senses. . . No longer BYO ::::tear::::, but the martini list looked pretty tempting. Next time I will enjoy one in the little floating bubble chairs.
