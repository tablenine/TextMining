Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
A little pricey, but the meat and all the various kim chi on the side is well worth it. The sides goes hand and hand with the meat they serve. . . This place is a sit down, bbq place, so be prepared to smell like korean bbq when you decide to come here. Â The server do most of the cooking for you, so don't worry about the multitask of eating and cooking. . . My 2 cents, get their SOOWON Galibi special marinade meat ($35). It is the cut where it is one bone and they basically roll the meat out on the grill.. So tender, and sweet.. . If it ain't for that, I wouldn't have korean bbq craving. (Very Very tasty order)
