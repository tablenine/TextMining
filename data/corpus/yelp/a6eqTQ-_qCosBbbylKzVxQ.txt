I had lunch at the Veggie Grill today.  I've been a vegetarian for about six months, and was dying to try this place.  I was a bit disappointed when I saw that most of the menu relies on meat substitutes. But, I thought, hey, when in Rome.... . I was also a bit miffy because my lunch came to almost $20. That is a lot for lunch. But then, I did have dessert too.. . I had the crispy "chikn" sandwich with a side of the sweet potato fries.  I was BLOWN AWAY. Not only did the chicken taste like chicken, but it LOOKED like it too!  Where do they get this stuff?  It was by far the best vegetarian meal I have ever had.. . The carrot cake was out of this world. The menu says that it has no dairy or refined sugar.  What??  How can this be? The "cream cheese" frosting was so light and fluffy and sweet.. . I know for a fact that I could bring this food home to my meat eating husband and he would not know the difference.. . In the end, the $20 for lunch was worth it. I'll definitely be back.
