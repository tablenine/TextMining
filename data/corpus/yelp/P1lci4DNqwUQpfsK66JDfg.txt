I don't understand the reviews. Long wait. Mediocre ambience in the back room. Poor wine rec. Two homemade pasta dishes - the pasta was homemade for both and was tasty, but one had an unsuccessful sauce, while the other was too sauce-free and loaded with a silly amount of duck and pancetta. Â A tad pricey. And, topping it off, a truly bizarre waiter, who seemed like a character out of an SNL skit, making weird faces and even winking as he uncorked the wine.
