I read this "Pastrami King" article in the latest issue of Bon Apptit magazine saying it may be the best pastrami in the US. So, within 4 days I was there.. . The rye bread was outrageously good, soft and flavorful with a crunchy crust. The pastrami was super tender and soft but lacked deep flavor. Â The pickles lacked flavor as well. I wouldn't say it was the best I've had, but ranks in the top 3-5 and it's definitely worth a try. So far, Canter's is the Pastrami King in LA as far as I am concerned.
