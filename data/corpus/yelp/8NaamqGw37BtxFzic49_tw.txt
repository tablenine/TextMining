I love the smell of the baked goods coming out from this place.  I love that there's an outdoor patio.  I can imagine some nice summer days drinking coffee and eating a sweet goodie people watching after I just went shopping down the street.  It feels like the kitchen of someone's home.  I like the display of copper cookware that hangs on the wall.  I love that it's open pretty late until 11pm from Monday to Wednesday.  I had the raspberry italian soda and the apricot tart with the easter bunny cut out.  It was sweeter than fruity, and I'm not sure how I felt about that.  The tiramisu looked more appealing than better tasty.  If you like to indulge on the more excessive side of things such as lots of frosting, cream and sauce then this is the place for you.  The prices aren't too bad and the staff is nice.  I didn't get to try any of the coffee here, but I'm sure there will be a next time.
