We had a 4pm reservation and got a talking to about showing up 30 mins late...hello there is traffic and yes we should have called but it was 4!!! The food was great.We had lots of appetizers: beets,squash blossoms ,asparagus and marrow bones were phenomenal ( call the cardiologist ) The pizzas were great we had 2,clam and Â cheese . The waiter was charming but there was a long wait cause the lunch shift was leaving and the dinner staff arriving. I am still fantasizing about the caramel sundae with peanuts. They also had my favorite wine Vino Nobilo de Montepulciano at a great price. the quality was great and you pay the price...we loved the bread that came with the marrow bones and it was from la brea bakery ( pain rustique)and the waiter knew exactly which bread it was...i bought it at gelsons and had it last night at home grilled with olive oil. Thank god we don't live close because I am thinking about the food all the time.
