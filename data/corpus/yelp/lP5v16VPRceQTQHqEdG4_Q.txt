I really wanted to hate this place, but I can't.  For some reason I felt that "organic pizza" sounded like a contradiction, but it isn't.  The flat bread pizzas are pretty yummy, but not heavy like traditional pizza.  The Caesar salad is extremely simple, yet super flavorful.   It is nice to  have such a fresh, light alternative to the cheese baby I normally acquire post pizza outing.  . . Plus this place is kid friendly, which I think pizza places should be.  And I like the idea of supporting local farmers and the such.  The service is pretty solid too.
