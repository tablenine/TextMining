I came here knowing all the rules and was hoping to for a great burger with an amazing glass of beer. I wasn't disappointed at all. The burger was cooked a prefect medium rare and you could tell that this was good quality meat that you were eating. The flavors from the onion, compote, cheeses and argula really blended well together. The shoestring fries were killer with the garlic aioli. . . I was really impressed with the amount of Belgian ales they had on draught as well. can't wait to come back here.
