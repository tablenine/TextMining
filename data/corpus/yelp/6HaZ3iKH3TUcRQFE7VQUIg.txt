Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Back in the days when boiling crab was located in westminister, i was totally in love. seafood + spicy = heaven! So when I heard that this location was open a few months ago or whatever, I was SOOO happy! But after seeing how small it was, I was like great...small place=long wait! Â I ALWAYS get the shrimp and sometimes crawfish. I feel like the shrimp is worth more because it has meat. And then the crawfish is a lot of hard work just to get one little size of meat. The spiciest I ever got was extra spicy. Ugh, wrong idea. It didn't have any flavor because all you can taste is the hotness. Well, that was my fault. Now I lessened it down to just spicy.
