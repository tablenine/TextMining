Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
I love Bosa Nova:. Open late &amp; great food = best combo. The bread is really fresh &amp; warm, with garlic, salt, &amp; tomato topped on it.. I would recommend: . coxinha for an appetizer - fried shredded chicken crouette so good &amp; crispy. picanha steak with plantains &amp; mashed potatoes, I think this cut is the best for the price. I tried some of the other steaks &amp; they didn't compare to the picanha cut in flavor &amp; seasoning. The combination with the plantains makes a sweet, salty flavoring with the mashed potatoes adding a little garlic and creamy texture. . I would recommend getting the sangria, it's not too strong &amp; very fruity. . . The service can be a little slow, but the food is definitely worth the wait. I don't think they take reservations, but they do have take-out. If you're coming at dinner time on the weekend it can get pretty crowded &amp; it's not that big a place.
