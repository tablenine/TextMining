This place rocks. I keep hearing about the brunch they have, but I haven't been yet so I"ll Â have to check it out soon. I had a wonderful dinner here with my family when they came to visit. I had a fish dish which was so good, and everyone else got steaks, which they were all very happy with. I remember the crab soup was really good. It's a beautiful restaurant inside, very classy and romantic looking. It's not cheap, but they definitely know what they're doing here. I'll be back for a special occasion.
