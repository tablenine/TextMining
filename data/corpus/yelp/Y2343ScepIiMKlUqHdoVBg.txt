It's been a while since I've been here, but from what I remember it was alright.  I think the best part of the restaurant was the champagne brunch.  The dinners were decent, the lack of air conditioning sucked, the lines sometimes didn't seem worth it, but the champagne brunch was a pretty sweet deal.  My wife and I liked the champagne (Wycliff) so much that we used it at our wedding :)  I guess I would recommend checking it out if you are in the area, but otherwise it's not super amazing.
