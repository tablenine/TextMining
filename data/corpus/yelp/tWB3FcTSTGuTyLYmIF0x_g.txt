I was really looking forward to having a pastrami and corned beef , aka For Fressers Only, but at DS, the Fairfax sandwich.  They were out, so I had the corned beef.  For $11, they didn't skimp on the meat.  Unfortunately, the beef  was dry, like the heat lamp had sucked all the juices out of the meat.  Maybe it was just the timing, I did get the sandwich in the 8th inning.  But still....Oh well, I guess that's what I get for abandoning the Dodger Dog for one night.
