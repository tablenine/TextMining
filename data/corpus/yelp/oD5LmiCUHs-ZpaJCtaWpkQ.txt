Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Umami Burger is delicious!. . Their signature burger sets itself apart with big pieces of shiitake mushroom that really surprised me. On top of that, there's a paper-thin crisp of fried cheese hidden in there, which is very nice. . . Those two distinguishing ingredients make the Umami Burger unique to me. I've read that people complain about the bun, but I think it suits the signature burger.. . As far as sides go, I went with the tempura onion rings and dipped them in garlic aioli. Super greasy...but I liked them!. . Let's not split hairs and argue about what the best burger in LA is. There's room for more than just one burger in this city, don't you think? All in all, Umami Burger offers a good burger that I will definitely come back for. Props!
