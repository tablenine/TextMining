I expected much better food based on the reviews.  perhaps breakfast is their schtick.. I had a burger which was fairly good.  though it was served with breakfast style sauteed potatoes.  they were good.  they are not french fries.. my companion had salmon and salad.  the salmon was dry and over-cooked.. they have no wine.. it so full of 'emo style' hipsters i almost wanted to try tossing a potato cube through the gaping dilated hole in the ear lobe of one of the emo dudes.
