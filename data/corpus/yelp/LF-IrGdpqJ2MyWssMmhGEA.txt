Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
If you are a Ramen fan, you'd love this place. It's nice how authentic it is. I felt like I was in Japan. The Japanese waitresses are so cute. Anyway, they give you several options when building your Ramen noodles. Interesting concept. See for yourself. Don't take my word for it.
