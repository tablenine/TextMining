I had heard a lot of bad things about Les Deux.   Stuff like:. . "Les Deux? More like Les Douche!". or. "Have you seen all the tramps who go in that place...?" And then I step into Bar Sinister across the street where men/women are bound and whipped upstairs.. . About Les Deux:. . *3 rooms... 3 different types of music.. . *Dames and I came on Monday and found a Karaoke room, a live-band room, and a room with music over the speakers--mostly modern rock.. . *Girls--ya get in free! Ya hear me? Free!  Sorry, boys.  Cough up a $5 spot.. . *Rum and Coke = $10. [eek. Steep.  Best remember to Flask it next time.]. . *Bathrooms are clean and don't look like a gutter rat lives in 'em.. . *people were so darn friendly--especially in the Karaoke room. . . *there are at least two doors for each room, and at least one of those doors leads to open air.  I am a fan of magical escapes from douchy dudes!  Or perhaps just an instant shot of cool-crisp LA air to sharpen the senses... . Les Deux, I shall return!
