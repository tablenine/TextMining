Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
If Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles asked me to do an infomercial testimonial for them, i'd do it in a heartbeat. And my testimonial would sound like this:. . "My name is Jamora and I've been on a diet now for the past six months. But when I like to cheat and get a lil fat again, I go to Roscoe's House of Chicken n Waffles. I love their Southern style fried chick'n... I cover it all up with an extra order of gravy mixed in with some maple syrup and gobble it all down. Why do I turn a blind eye to calories when I go to Roscoe's? Well their chicken is extra crispy, flaky in just the right places, and after you get through the breading... the chicken is quite tender. And the waffles? Girl, you better plan two extra days of exercise after you eat a stack of those. Buttery, fluffy, round... crispy... I can already feel my body producing an extra layer of fat in anticipation.". . Despite the lines, parking nightmare, and perhaps not the best service, you still wanna get there and be like the Cookie Monster, but with fried chicken (fried chicken monster!).
