Restaurant: Birds Rotisserie Chicken Cafe &amp; Bar
Category: American (New)
Birds is OK. I used to really enjoy this place but lately everytime I go (today at about 5) they serve up some mediocre stuff. The chicken was kinda of bleh. . The onion rings and the ribs are pretty tasty, but I wouldn't go here for ribs. Insted I'd try a real BBQ place like Mom's in the Valley, even RIBS U.S.A. . The people watching is good, and they have a pretty awesome happy hour tuesdays and wednesdays from 11 p.m. to midinight. . The place has charm but needs to improve on its service.
