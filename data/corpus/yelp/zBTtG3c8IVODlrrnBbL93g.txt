Things I liked:. The pancakes. Sitting at the counter watching the bustling kitchen. The frequency of coffee refills. The waitress was nice, especially when I bugged her with questions about public transport. . Things I didn't really like:. The pesto in my 'green eggs and ham' made the dish almost disgusting.. Some of my potatoes were raw, and some were burnt. That's pretty special.. The portion size is just way too big! I was having breakfast at 3pm, so was quite hungry, but I still only one pancake and half the plate of eggs.... Half portions would be good for lonely diners like me. What's with putting a slice of orange on a plate of fried potatoes, is this normal? . . Having said all that, I bet if I'd gone with my gut instinct and got eggs benedict and some fruit, I'd have been mighty happy. I tried to be fancy and get pesto and it backfired... oh well. I'd go back to see how the other food fares, but maybe with another person so I don't feel I've wasted half of it.
