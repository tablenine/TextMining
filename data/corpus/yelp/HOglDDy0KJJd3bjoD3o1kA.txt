Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
A tucked away old-school steakhouse in Beverly Hills. I experienced haughty hostesses but well trained waiters and busboys. Sides are large and encouraged to be shared; the best by far was the truffle gnocchi, so skip the mashed potatoes. Steak was out of this world in terms of taste and portioning. Much better than Ruth's Chris but incomparable to Cut. Best dessert we've ever had which consisted simply of fruit and fresh cream.
