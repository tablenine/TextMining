Sorry to all you Doughboys lovers but this place is overrated and can you say OILY? The food here is just swimming in grease, even the red velvet cupcake.  I ordered the french onion soup once and wasn't able to finish it, so I took it home and put it in the fridge.  Next day, I open the lid to find that the soup is barely there with at least a half inch thick layer of opaque yellow grease over it.   . . Warning to all you health nuts out there -- don't eat here or you'll be in the ER awaiting a triple bypass not knowing the hell why.  You got cholesterol from Doughboys clogging your arteries that's why!!!  Don't complain about your love handles if you eat here.
