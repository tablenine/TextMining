Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Thank you Yelpers for recommending this restaurant.  By far the best dumplings and beats out all of the places in Chinatown.  Unfortunately, we went late on a Saturday and they ran out of the dumplings in soup and the steamed buns.  Oh well, excuse for another trip.  The juicy dumplings and shumai were so tasty.  I'm glad I finally understand what true chinese food is about.  Service was fast and efficient, and surprisingly the wait was only 10 minutes on a Saturday evening.
