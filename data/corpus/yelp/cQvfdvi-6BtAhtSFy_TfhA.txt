i like their sashimi platter.  i used to eat here all the time.  but now i am disappointed by their sashimi platter $35(?).  it gets less and less each time, and the portion is probably 1/3 of the size they used to give before.  the wait is long, too.. the male host is cool and lets me go in, but the female host is a b&amp;&amp;&amp; and keeps letting other people go in as if i didn't know.. i spend about $80-100 each time i go, and eating only 2 people.  the fish is sometimes very good, but sometimes taste a few days old and fishy and not fresh.. depending on the day you go, you may get a very good meal or a very yucky meal.. their teriyaki beef and tempura are the best, but they charge about $24 for this.  they do make very good tempura.  i haven't found a better place for tempura.. if they can be a little more generous and consistent with their sashimi platter, then i would go back here.  or else i would just go elsewhere.
