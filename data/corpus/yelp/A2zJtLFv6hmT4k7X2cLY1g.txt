I dont know what the hype is here. This place is a rip off.  BURGER IS TINY!  Quality products being used. I'll give them that. But thats where my compliments end. Tried 2 different burgers the HATCH and the UNAMI both BAF (Bland As F@C!)  And the sides oh man ... Its more like a SID you gotta pay extra for the ES. You barely get anything. And the MEXICAN COKE...TOTAL RIP OFF! First of all it was gasless and came opened and bottles were brand new. If you order a coke in Mexico pretty sure its gonna be in a used bottle. Makes me wonder...hmmm are they pouring Shasta into these bottles in the back.  Even the COKE was BAF. How can you fuck up COKE. Man too bad I can't give no stars. CUZ 1 is too many. OK thats it.
