This is what I'd call a new age deli in the sense that everything look traditional like a diner that has been around for 50+ years, but everything looks brand new.. . I can only speak for lunch, though during the weekends this establishment you can patronize until midnight.. . The menu offers a great selection of sandwiches and dinners along with breakfast all day long.. . Beer, wine, and liquor are all available as is a bar.....or rather counter...to consume them.  Or you can have rootbeer floats if you are looking to relive some childhood moment.. . Servers were nice and helpful, though the host practically stood on top of us to get us out of  a booth for waiting customers....even though there was 10 counter seats available.  He offered coffee and ice cream....want something free, I suggest you hang out in the booth until he comes by *evil grin*.. . Its a diner, so we'll leave it there and won't make the review make it sound like anything different.  Check it out if you find yourself in the south loop.
