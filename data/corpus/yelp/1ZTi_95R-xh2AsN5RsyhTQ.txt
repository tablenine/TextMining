I used to go to the Houston's in Houston, TX. Then I came here and was disappointed to notice that the taste is not the same (the one in Texas tastes better). And then, the more I went the more I noticed the flavor getting blander and blander....try the Houston's in Texas and you will notice a huge difference.
