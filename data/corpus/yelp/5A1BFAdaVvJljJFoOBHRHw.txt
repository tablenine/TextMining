Went there for our anniversary dinner. As everyone has said before it's pretty loud, not really a romantic setting if that's what you're going for. We both got the regular size filet, both were cooked perfectly. I was impressed that i asked for blue cheese and he asked for horseradish crusting and even though they weren't on the menu the waiter didn't think twice and said sure. Wine was delicious, a bit over priced compared to their competitors. Twice baked potato was delicious, and 1.5 pounds! I'm not a baked potato person but the inside is almost like mashed potatoes. Dessert was also enormous but nothing to write home about. We got the strawberry shortcake, I wouldn't order it again... the shortcake was kind of hard.. Overall, it seems like a great place for a boys night out. You can feel the testosterone in the air!
