Ohhh M Geee... this food was sooo good!  I ordered the short rib taco which was a corn tortilla with short rib and a mix of cilantro, onion scallions and a Korean bbq sauce.  The only downside is that the taco was so tiny for $2.  I also got the special.  I think it was the sweet chilli and sesame quesadilla.  Which was stuffed with cheese, chicken, their Korean bbq sauce and on top was the sweet chilli and sesame.  It was THE best quesadilla I've EVER had.  I actually ordered it when it was the special for the week before, but the guy was nice enough to make it for me anyway :)
