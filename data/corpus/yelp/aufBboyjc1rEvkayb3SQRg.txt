Their blue velvet cake is AMAZING. I'm sure you already know that by now. It's very moist, not overly sweet, and the actual blueberries are a nice touch. . . When I went back in December, I was fortunate to try their seasonal pumpkin ice cream sandwich. I'm a sucker for anything pumpkin flavored and sandwiched between two gingerbread cookies - it was to die for. Even though it was a little too sweet for my liking (i'm not a big fan of sweets), I can't wait to try it again when it comes back later this year. In the meantime, the blue velvet cake will make up for the wait.. . I haven't tried their sandwiches, they seem a bit pricey but when it comes to desserts, Milk is highly recommended.
