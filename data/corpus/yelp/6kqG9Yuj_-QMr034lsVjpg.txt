Its like a deep fry cook-off in your garage. The atmosphere is fun, and the value might be there, but did anyone know they shut this place down for a week cause they had "health issues?" *gasp* Yes, of all places this extremely cheap, but please... serving substandard meat? I always tell my buddies, not to go here since the service is just ok, and the meat? Seems like something my dog would think twice about eating. If you can stand paying 1-2 dollars more for better quality, go to Tahoe Kalbi on wilshire. There it seems like your actually walking into an establishment and not into a circus tent
