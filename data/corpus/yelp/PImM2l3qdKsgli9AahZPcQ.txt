my cousins wanted to bring me here for awhile. every time i'm in town- they talk about the pancakes here. trouble is- i don't like pancakes! i know!!! i'm insane, right? . . i like savory things more than sweet. french toast, waffles and pancakes are not my style. i love me some sausages and eggs, ya heard? . . i seriously stuffed my face this morning. we were here at the butt-crack of dawn... okay, 9am! because the lines were ridiculous! whatevs, though. i got full just staring at the pancakes. my cousin Jezebel ordered some crazy crap called, Creme De La Creme- basically it's a graham cracker crusted french toast drizzled with cream cheese/cakeish topping and powdered sugar on top. i looked at her like: WTF? my handsome Jerome ordered up a Cobb omelette for me and a Saturday Night-something (i can't remember the name) w/ some Kahlua/Baileys concoction. his eyes smiled at me behind the menu and i asked, "what?" he replied, "you're sooooo going to love it!" muahaha. wow, i guess the *evil laugh* of "muahaha" actually runs in the family. . . the egg specialties menu is extensive! me likes. everything tasted delicious... but seriously- that's WAY too much crap up on the pancakes... you kiddin' me?! i thought i got a cavity just by taking a few bites from other's dishes. either way, i love the atmosphere.
