This place is wonderful!  It took a few U-turns to find this place, since it is in an unsightly location.  To my surprise, they have converted a giant warehouse into a restaurant, and a beautiful one at that.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere, however my only downfall was the heat.  I'm not sure if it was the fact that we were in a warehouse or because it was crowded.  On a different note, the food was absolutely delicious.  I would highly recommend the salmon chips appetizer.  I ordered the chicken entree, and it was also very tasty.
