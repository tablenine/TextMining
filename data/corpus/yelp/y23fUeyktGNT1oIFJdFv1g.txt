Best Indian-Pakistani food in Atlanta.. This restaurant is very low key, which I like. . My favorites: Saag Paneer, Chicken 65, Butter Chicken, Nehari, rice, the naan, mango and pistachio kulfi.. They also cater for events. You can even have your wedding or any other party there because they have a hall in the back.
