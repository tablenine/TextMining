Everyone talks about the "quality" of food here, but I'm not really sure what they mean.  We timed out visit so that there was no wait, and that was fine but do you mean quality as in the mediocre fries were taken out of the bag frozen rather than be forced to come from a fresh potato?  . . I've had many nice burgers in my lifetime (my favorite was the kimchi-foie gras burger at the now defunct Coupage in Seattle) but this was just a fast food burger.  Such a burger has its place, but not as a 4+ star rating on Yelp.. . That said, there's a place in Seattle that generates similar culinary responses from me:. . . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . .  - Local icon.  - So-so fast food burger.  - Overhyped
