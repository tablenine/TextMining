Uh, this place is pertty DARN GOOD.  I'm not huge on mediterranean, so here's the scoop:. . Grilled Calamari-  5 star.    The sauce is so good, and I thought since it wasn't fried, it'd suck, but no, this is like bomb diggity to the max effect.. . Farfalle Al Pesto E Pollo (bowtie pasta in cilantro pesto sauce) - 4.5 star.      GOood stuff. . . Risotto Al Porcini-  5 star    WTH, I hate mushroom, and this stuff is mushroom overload flavor, and it was THE BOMB.  Mighta been my fave dish.  That says a lot. This and the Calamari could have a Face/Off competition.  . . Red Curry risotto with seafood-  3 star. . Three Cheese Pizza-  2 star  (yeah, avoid the italian stuff I guess). . Mediterranean Medley-  3.5 star  (personal preference, I liked the hummus and the pastry thing, not the grape leaf and sausage was ok). . Braised Lamb Shank-  5 star  Yeah, it was so good, that people were saying next time they come, they're going to order this.  I have good taste.  . . Flourless Chocolate Cake-  4 star.  Can't really go wrong with it I guess.
