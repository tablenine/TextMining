the food sucked!  . . but, i think we ordered the wrong things?  . . i ordered this nasty "sandwich thing" that was recommended by the waitress (because they were out of my first two choices: Chicken Meatloaf and Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup).  the nasty "sandwich thing" has a name, but i forget, it is an open faced mess of cheese, mushrooms, grilled onions and roast beef.  it is disgustingly massive, and they recommend folding it and half and eating it "like a taco," but that would only work if my mouth were as wide as the holland tunnel.. . my friend ordered a soup/salad thing.  her soup was gross, it was the "steak vegetable" soup (or something like that)... it tasted WORSE than the soup that has been sitting all day evaporating at the hospital cafeteria.  avoid it. . . the service was great. . . maybe this place is overrated, or maybe we just ordered the wrong things...  honestly, i might go back and try a big breakfast sometime... or just coffee and desert.  but i think TOAST across the street is probably a better bet.
