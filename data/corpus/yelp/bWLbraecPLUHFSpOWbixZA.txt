Wanted to reminisce with a couple of buddies as we went when it opened a couple of years ago. Granted it was quality meat grilled to perfection and similar in size as those at JH. However your almost paying $20 bucks for a cheeseburger - wtf and it's not even Kobe. . . Pros quality meat good service . Cons indulgent and not a value proposition almost $40 with drinks for a burger, yikes - never again unless on an expense account. Makes you feel awkward without your pinstripes and suspenders.. . Heh aren't those Gordon Gecko days over - i thought Oliver Stone is coming out with a new movie about the fall of the over indulgent, guess NY is not always ahead of the times.
