Been here twice. The menu is quite creative and offers good variety, though the dishes seem a bit hit or miss. Artichoke and Edam fritters were perfectly cooked and had wonderful texture, but were short on flavor. Baked haloumi cheese had wonderful strawberry jam, though the overall dish is a little too salty (and I absolutely never find things too salty). The arugula/beet/stilton salad contains delicious, fresh arugula although the stilton was not real stilton.. . What are really wonderful are the moules et frites. I'd say HB's version is right up there with Hopleaf's. The broth is slightly less savory, and I really enjoy the touch of anise. The mussels themselves are fresh and very tender. The fries are up there with the good pommes frites I remember enjoying in France and the Netherlands (never been to Belgium). Moules et frites places in the USA usually give you the shoestring fries, though I've never seen these in Europe. The fries are drizzled with truffle oil and served with roasted garlic aioli. The portion they give you is huge and you will really have to cut yourself off to avoid consuming a delicious shitload of potato goodness.. . Buy yourself a good beer like Saison Dupont, Westmalle, or Karmeliet, come here and get 2 plates of mussels, and slowly wean yourself off of your hopleaf addiction.
