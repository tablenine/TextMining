Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
One of the better ramen joints in the area. The flavoring of the soup is just right (not too salty or too overpowering), and the texture of the noodles is perfect - not too stringy, not too mushy, not too hard. Of course, they let you customize it to your liking, which is great. I do wish they had more than one type of ramen, but I guess it's called Hakata ramen for a reason. . . Their enthusiastic service is truly Japanese-style...you get this sort of service a lot in Japan...but the yelling starts to drive you crazy after awhile.
