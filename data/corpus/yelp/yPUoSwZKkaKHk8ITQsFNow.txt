seriously?!  i just can't believe that this place has so many great reviews.  I dined here yesterday with very high hopes due to all of the hype and they just did not deliver.  the service was bad.  really bad.  the food was OK at first (i ordered the mafaldina)...and then i tried some more later that night and really just decided that i didn't like it at all.  the boy had the duck tortellini which was better than the dish i had--but not great.  the reduction sauce tasted like liquor and like it had never actually been "reduced."  . . up until this time, i have always said: "you really can't mess up pasta...it might not be GREAT, but it will never be BAD."  i stand corrected.  . . i can really think of at least 10 better italian restaurants in the city just off the top of my head.  don't bother with this one.
