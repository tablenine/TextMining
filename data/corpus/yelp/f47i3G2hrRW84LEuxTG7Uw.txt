Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
45 minute wait.  Not bad considering I've heard stories that people wait for 2 hours or something. . . The hot dog itself, has that weird snap that I think a lot of East-Coast people like, but I hate it.  I had the Martha Stewart dog and the Guadalaja do.  Both weren't 'that good.  I think the more complicated you make the hot dog, the worse it is (bacon, sour cream, tomatoes not good on a hot dog.)  The chili fries were pretty good, but not worth a long wait. . . If I go next time, a simple chili dog and chili fries is enough...
