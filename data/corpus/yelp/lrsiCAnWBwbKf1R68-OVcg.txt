Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
OK, I'll keep it simple. This place is too hyped up. Went in to see what the buzz was all about. Ordered the sausage and mushroom pizza. Mushrooms were canned. Sauce was mediocre. I waited for a half hour next to a bunch of hipsters; I had to even listen to this scruffy-looking lame dude reenact his entire screenplay pitch he made earlier in the day to some exec in Santa Monica. Wasn't worth it.
