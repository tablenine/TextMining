I am kinda surprised to see such positive reviews of this place. Maybe I went on an off night.. . I went recently with my girl and a friend of ours to have dinner before a concert at the Vic. The place is cute but very small so we got lucky there was a table available for us. (There was a line when we were leaving.) Now even though the place is small and it isnt possible to have a lot of customers at one time, it took a while for the waitress to get to us and take our order. You would think that they would try to expedite everything in order to turn tables. Very strange.. . I had two problems with the food. First, we ordered the curry and it was very watery and kinda bland. Thai curry is pretty much a staple and it doesn't bode well if they can't do it right. Second, the portions were tiny. I guess having less to eat is the way they compensate for the slow service. As a whole, I was dissappointed and I don't think I got my money's worth.
