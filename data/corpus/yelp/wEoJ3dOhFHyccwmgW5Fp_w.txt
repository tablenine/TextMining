Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I've lived in the neighborhood for about a year and a half and I don't know why it took me so long to check this place out. We went on a Friday night so it was pretty crowded, there was a wait to be seated and the pizza took 45 minutes (!!) to cook. We killed time by ordering a salad to share, which ended up being huge and meaty and delicious. I did my best not to fill up too much on the salad, at which I somewhat failed, but once the pizza came it didn't matter how little room I had left. I wanted to kill that thing. Murder it. Slowly. Hear it scream. Aaaanyway, I'm not usually a 45 minute wait kind of guy, especially for a fucking PIZZA, but this was absolutely delicious. Highly recommended if you have the patience.
