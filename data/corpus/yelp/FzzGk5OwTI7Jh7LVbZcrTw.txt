Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
below par.. . two of my friends and i were thinking of a place to eat, and one mentioned that din tai fung should do.  when we got there, several groups of people were waiting around to get their numbers called.  i was thinking, a lot of chinese people at a chinese joint...  this must be where it's at!. . the dumplings were tiny!  apparently this place is owned by hobbits.  you end up ordering several more menu items, and it ends up getting a little pricey (for some damn dumplings). . if the quantity sucks and the price is kinda high, then that wait in line must mean that the food tastes sensational yes?  well it's not bad, but the taste is very bland.  it's like you're eating an edible sponge wrapped up with edible rubber.  the same description for the texture.  everything seems slightly overcooked.  . . the service is fine, but the food comes in waves, and as i said, the quantity is rather lame.  if you want to torture a hungry friend, this is the perfect place to recommend.. . if it's 10 bucks a person, this place is doable.  change that number to 20, and suddenly it kinda sucks.  for that price range, you should eat something delicious and filling like korean bbq instead.. . honestly, just go to an asian market and pick up a good pack of dumplings.  you'll save money, impress your company, and eat something with flavor.  if i'd go back to a mcdonald's but i wouldn't come back here, it kinda says something about din tai fung.
