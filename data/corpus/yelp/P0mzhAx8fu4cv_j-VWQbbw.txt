I have been here about 4 or five times.  The Corp office for House of Blues was next door and I would take my client there.  He loved this place and ate there often.  He ate all over the menu and enjoyed everything.. . I used to saddle up with The Pug burger.  Its LA so its a little foo fooy for my own liking but hey  its walking distance from HOB and the dude like to go.  Its kinda tucked away in a small walkway next to some bookstore,  They do sushi and salads and all sorts of shmancy crap but for lunch..... the burger does the job.. . Staff is pretty attentive and there is seating outside and in.  I like it and if I were in the area, I would do it again but I dont miss either.  Not totally remarkable but pretty good.
