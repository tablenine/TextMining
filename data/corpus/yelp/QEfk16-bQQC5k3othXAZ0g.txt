There is only 1 thing I hate about this place--the long wait especially on Sundays.  I have to admit the workers are mighty spiffy in getting you in and out in no time--but the thing is there is always at least 30 people before you when you get there.  I've learned to just call in my order and they will have it ready when I get there.  I don't think there is any one thing in here that isn't deeeelicious.  Here is my list of faves:. -Cuban sandwich. -Potato Balls. -Ham and Cheese Croquette. -Mango Turnover. -Fruit Tart. -Guava and Cheese Strudel. -Dulce De Leche Kisses (my new discovery). -Banana Chips. -Sweet Bread. -and of course my ultimate fave the Cheese Rolls. . And might I add their custom made cakes are absolutely amazing.  I've never ever ordered one, but I just stare in awe at the ones in their fridge.  Even though the wait is just insane, I love Porto's so much that I can't bare to take any stars away.
