Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Located in the gully side of LA next to west hollywood - I had my first Roscoe's experience here.  Who would have thought southern fried chicken and waffles would be so complimentary?!  I always get the one with 2 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles.  Plain and simple.  Always satisfies.  A must stop after a long drive on the 5 from the Bay Area.
