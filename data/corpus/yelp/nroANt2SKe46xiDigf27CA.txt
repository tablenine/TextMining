Crazy list of very creative (sometimes overly creative) rolls make up most of the menu. If you ask your server what is fresh, the quality of the fish can't be beat. I had the best Escolar I have ever had on my servers rec.. . The vibe is great. A neighborhood spot that does the trendy/upscale vibe pretty well. Ideal date spot (in my opinion) - low key yet nice. Â Great menu is also a nice bonus. Enjoy.. . -pk, . http://www.pkafka.com.
