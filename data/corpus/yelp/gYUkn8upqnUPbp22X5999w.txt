I think anyone who can create tasty vegetarian delicacies using merely blenders and toaster ovens deserves a thumbs-up. From their extensive drink list to their chowdown yummies, bring a small group when it's quiet to sit in the window on pillows and slurp cool drinks. Or come by with a drawing pad and sit down at one of the many artsy shellacked tables. And while you wait for your food---check out the little gift shop in the back with imported goods and random knick knacks. It's a wonderful place to seek out for last minute tid-bits.. . Owners Allan and Rhonda whip up wonderful Chai Shakes, juice blends, homemade soups and everything from salads to quesadillas to burgers to baked foccacias, come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
