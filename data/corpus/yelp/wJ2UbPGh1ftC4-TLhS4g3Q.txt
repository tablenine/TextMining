Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Food:  I LOVE this place.  love love love.  ive tried most of the items on their menu and they're all great.  however i only go for two things: the juicy pork dumpings and the red bean dumplings.  i dont know how they do it, but its so yum!  i can eat about 30 of the juicy pork dumplings and 10 of the red beans.  sooo good.  i just poke a hole, put some ginger/soy sauce/vinegar in it and eat it all in one bite.  sweet and sour soup is not bad, the rice cake noodle things is good, again the other dumplings are great as well.. . Ambiance:  can get loud, simple, clean. . Staff: sometimes they are slow because they are soo busy, but the food comes quick so its all good. . Price: $$
