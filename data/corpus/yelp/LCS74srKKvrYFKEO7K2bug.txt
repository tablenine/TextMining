Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
I had my birthday brunch Â here yesterday. I had the Crab Cake Benedict, which is basically one of the most amazing breakfast foods I've ever had in my entire life. It was like an pseudo English Muffin topped with a crab cake and of course the poached egg with the most amazing Hollandaise sauce you'll ever have.. . My BFF ordered the French Toast with Bananas, Almonds and Nutella. I'm pretty sure it ties with the world's most amazing breakfast foods.. . My White Peach Bellini was delish, to top it off. This place isn't pretentious as it many would assume, being on Melrose just steps away from MJ.. . No complaints. Great ambiance, great service, and great area. I'd go back. Can't wait to try their dinner.. . It costs $4.50 for Valet. They parked it on the street for free. Oops.
