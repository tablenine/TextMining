i really like this place...the food is really good.. . i absolutely love their tom YUM koong...or shall i say tom YUMMY koong hehe.. . ive never had tom yum koong before, until i actually went to thailand...and that was liek THE soup they served with every meal.. . i never did find a place that had tom yum koong as good as thailand, until i came here. . . i came here when they were at the previous location...a while ago, and had the tom yum koong-spicy. little did i know back then that when you asked for spicy..it was...SPICYYYYY...but still good.. . i came back here recently for lunch and ordered the tom yum koong, pad thai, and bok choy. their food is GOOD.. their SOUP IS AWESOME.. they have really goof papaya salad as well.. but their SOUP is what i love the MOST. . . too bad its a bit far for me to go regularly...otherwise i would come here whenever i craved thai food....
