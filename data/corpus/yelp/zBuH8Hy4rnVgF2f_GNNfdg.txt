Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Took a friend from out of town on Sunday.  As we were being seated, they told us that they only had dumplings and soup, nothing else.  After we were seated, we realized that the power was out.  Soup and dumplings were coming out, but my friend was really disappointed that he couldn't try anything else.  They didn't really explain anything and then all of a sudden we started seeing other dishes going out, by this time, we had too many dumplings.  When the bill came, they said we had to pay in cash, how come no one said anything when we walked in?  I understand that the power was out, but no explaination again.  Was pretty disappointed in them handling the whole situation.
