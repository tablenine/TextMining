Oh Joy Yee, land of gynormous portions and Tapioca Tea.  This is a good place to go if you have a serious attack of the munchies.  The portions are so plentiful that you are bound to take some home.  The menu can be intimidating for a newb, but just stick to the classics and you should be OK.  My personal favorites are:. . Korean Beef over Rice. Korean Short Ribs. Beef Cubes in Tomato Sauce Rice. Basil Chicken w/ Egg over Rice. Chicken Teriyaki over Rice. Lemon Chicken. . My main knock on Joy Yee is the service, and the food prep.  I feel like my experiences dining here have never been consistently the same.  Sometimes I get good service and the food is blah, or vice versa, or worse when both of them are blah.  The one thing I can say that always taste the same is the Tapioca Tea/Freeze.  They make them with fresh fruits and are always good to the last drop.  I always order the Mango Tapioca Freeze because that is just how I roll son!  If this place can remedy the consistency issue then this would easily be 4 stars in my book.  Right now I can only give it 3, but a 3.475 stars if you want to get specific.
