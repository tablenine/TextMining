you know there's something special about their house special lobster and french style beef cubes when every single table orders one. at this point i doubt there are many who haven't heard of this place, but if you've been living under a rock, here are some helping suggestions:. . -arrive EARLY (especially on weekends) as they don't take reservations. -parking in their lot is a mess so just find street parking. -going in a group is a must so you can try a variety of their dishes like:. . house special lobster (their small lobsters are usually a minimum of 3lbs so don't let the waiter convince you to buy anything bigger unless that's the only dish you'll order). clams in basil garlic sauce. pea shoots. bò lúc lc (french style beef cubes). fried fish in sweet and spicy sauce. yam leaves with garlic (a MUST if in season). . -their dishes can be a bit salty so balance it out with some veggies.. -keep an eye out for asian celebs who tend to dine later in the evening (like jay chou on 2/8)
