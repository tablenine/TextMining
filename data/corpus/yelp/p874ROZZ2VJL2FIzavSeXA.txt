So disappointing!. . I guess I'm spoiled having gone to the original Thanh Long in San Francisco.  But I was SO disappointed and rather deflated after having talked up the Roasted Crab I've had at the sister restaurant. Also, I was not expecting the snooty reception. Be forewarned you need to be dressy. Seems a little silly to me since this was a summery day in L.A. but they asked my date whether he had different shoes? WTF?  That was rude considering he was dressed well, but perhaps too casual for their taste. We noticed another patron dressed way more casual so how they assess you seems random.  Anyway, after some miscues, they finally seated us in the patio. At the very least, our server was nice and friendly. But everything else was subpar. The cocktails weren't that great and I detected some freezer burn on the Roasted Crab and especially the Drunken Crab. It was overpowered by the green onion so the delicate flavor of the crab was lost.   The garlic noodles weren't bad but they didn't live up to my memories of the garlic noodles I've had at the other place.  And then the final rub is that everything was overpriced, but I suppose we were in Beverly Hills.  If you've been to the original Thanh Long and really like it, definitely skip this place. There are other places to get great crab in L.A.
