I hadn't been here in years, but I returned recently to warm up and slow down on an otherwise cold and busy day in the city.  The Mexican latte was just the ticket.  Sweet, spicy, cinnamonny, chocolately perfection.  The only problem is that now I'm moderately obsessed with getting another, and I live 2.5 hours away....  Seriously, SO good.
