Landmark Grill is okay. Nothing really special. The food is that great for the high price and crowd was disappointing. Its an upscale Lincoln Park bar, which is rare since most bars in Lincoln Park are just sports bars. The drinks are too expensive . I gave it the extra star because of the decor and staff. I love the way this place is laid out and it has potential to really be a great lounge bar without the loud music. The staff is friendly, fast and I think they have the nicest bouncers I've ever come across. I won't go back unless I'm forced to.
