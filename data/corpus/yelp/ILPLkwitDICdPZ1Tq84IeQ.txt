I'm in love with this place and I'm so glad I was able to come here and completely, utterly pig out. This was the first stop in my SoCal visit last weekends and parking was surprisingly easy to find on a Saturday afternoon in this area. It costs around $1.00 per hour so that's something to be weary of.. . This place is quite small and narrow inside with little to no room for a large party at all if you have more than 4 people so not recommended for a group unless you're just grabbing ice cream to go. They have the largest variety of pre-made ice cream I've ever seen! Everything from drumsticks, cones, sandwiches and bars to wedges of ice cream in things I've never even seen with creative names like grasshopper.. . I had to get the blue velvet since it was so well raved, I also got the red velvet cupcakes. There's basically no difference here except the blue velvet cake was a little more moist and had whole blueberries baked in. The frosting was delicious! I also got one of their chicken salads (it comes with three huge chunks of chicken! not like your traditional chicken salads ...) and two sandwiches (not all to myself goodness!). . It was quite a lot of food and I didn't finish it all but it was ALL so good! Your sandwich comes with a side salad (mmm) and everything tasted very fresh and well made. Even though I was full to the brim, decided to share a soy vanilla ice cream scoop with the bf, again ... SO GOOD ... if only they had some NorCal locations!
