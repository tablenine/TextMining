Restaurant: SinBala Restaurant
Category: Taiwanese
I have been coming here to this yummy Taiwanese restaurant ever since it opened about 6 years ago.  They don't take reservations so be sure to go early if you don't want to wait, but the wait usually isn't too long because people eat quickly as it's Taiwanese small eats.  The specialty here is the Sausage Rice and Beef Noodle Soup.  The oyster omelette can rival ones in Taiwan (if you don't like oysters, there is a vegetarian one that is yummy too).  I love the Taiwanese brown sugar shaved ice here.  You can pick 5 topping of your choice, and you get a lot too!  What I love about SinBaLa is they never say no, and the owner Linda and the employees are all really nice.  For example, you can ask for garlic to go with your sausage rice, and it's free and they don't give you any attitude.  Overall, if you got the Taiwanese munchies, SinBaLa can satisfy your cravings till you get a chance to fly back to Taiwan for the real stuff!
