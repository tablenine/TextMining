Well~ this was my second time visiting this place~ considering the freakingly long lines in front of this store on holidays morning, the food should be good~ at least i supposed it was~ However, after giving this place two chances, I now conclude that the food here ,concerend with its price, is just overpriced. For example, the soup and salad combo, which costs around 11.95, served in small bowl of soup and 1/2 sized salad. I can get same thing with bigger portion at Doughboys across the street....with bread. And the food actually is just okay~ not impressive at all....and the drink~ an chailatte costs 4.95???? WTF....?? Anyway, the service in general was fine~ not very attentive but still friendly~ and that'sthe only reason why i didn't give it only one star...
