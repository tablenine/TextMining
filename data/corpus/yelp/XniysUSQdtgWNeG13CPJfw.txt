Came here for a last-minute dinner with a couple girlfriends, one of whom had a . http://restaurant.com.  coupon that was about to expire.  I had no idea what to expect, was just looking forward to some kid-free time, decent grub, and conversation (i.e. gossip haha) with friends. . . Little did we know it was a hockey bar and it was Blackhawks v Redwings.  Um, duh.  We could have researched this a little better.  The space is great, and it's an ideal place to watch whatever sporting event is going on.  However I couldn't give 2 sh--- about hockey :)  . . So they squeezed us in at a table parked in a passageway to the restrooms and a back way to the kitchen.  I sucked in my chubby self as much as I could while patrons and staff balancing things precariously on trays passed behind me.  We had a good time trying to talk over the game (and dang it was LOUD or maybe I'm just getting old), I only got knocked a couple times, the food was decent, and our server was very pleasant (though they forgot our app and brought it after our entrees).. . In my opinion, this is a great place to go on a non-hockey night if you live in the 'hood (or if you're a hockey fan of course); but please take this with a grain of salt because I'm a frumpy SAHM on the far NW side :). . Oh, and not sure if this place is really for kids, but there were kids' items on the menu.
