Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
Tucked away amidst Midtown residences, you stumble across a Cuban restaurant of all things. And what a discovery. At the corner of 5th &amp; Durant, it's conevenient for anyone intown.. . Our first time here it was like walking into our Cuban grandfather's kitchen. He greeted us ethusiastically, &amp; chatted us up. Normally I abhor chit chat, but he charmed even me into smiling &amp; babbling. He asked if it was our first time, &amp; when we confirmed, he sat down with us. . . We told him we were vegetarian (&amp; me, vegan), &amp; he clearly knew that menu. He offered suggestions for modifications on the menu, &amp; we took what he said. What a good call.. . The food was delicious! When we left he gave us calendars with Las Palmeras printed at the top, &amp; asked us to please, please, come back &amp; see him.. . The only reason I gave it 4 stars but not 5 is the small space (in winter, when patio dining isn't an option.) When it gets crowded it's noisy, a turn-off for me. Most folks are eating meat &amp; the ventilation is poor, so vegetarians, expect to smell the meat even if you're not eating it. Take out, however, is a very viable option in the winter months sans patio.. . For some quirky &amp; unknown reason, a limo is always parked behind the restaurant.
