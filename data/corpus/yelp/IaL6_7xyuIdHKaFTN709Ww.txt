Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
I generally only eat seafood, but the ropa vieja was highly recommended to me.  So, on a warm April evening, I sat outside at Las Palmeras and ordered the meat-filled entree with a milkshake made out of a fruit whose name escapes me.  Food was amazing, and the drink was both sweet and sour at the same time, which I found rather refreshing.  The server was a little lackadaisical, but overall, I enjoyed Las Palmeras and would love to go back.
