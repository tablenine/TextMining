Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
Anyone else remember that creepy close-up view they would do on "Ren and Stimpy" that showed popping veins and bloodshot eyes when Ren would be angry or Stimpy would be awake for days? That is exactly the look I get when I hear someone suggest a nice dinner at Tender Greens--but in a very good way. And probably less freaky.. . I may be a one-trick pony, but I've only ever ordered one thing each time I've been here. And that is the herb brushed albacore tuna with yukon gold mashed potatoes and rustic chicken soup with lemon thyme. Or as I call it, HBAT W/ YGMP A RCS W/ LT for short. I figure, why mess with a bonafide guarantee of a tasty dinner. I think at some point I'm going to have to try their salads for the pure namesake of the restaurant, but I'm just not that into salads. In any case, I love the food, I love the format of the restaurant, and I love getting surprised EVERY time the cashier miraculously knows my name when I check out (Oh, it's on my credit card). Now I know how my dead cat felt when I used to pretend to throw her ball when I really wasn't--it's just fun to ALWAYS be surprised.
