If you want to revist the flavor of 5th grade (in the best way possible), then walk in a single file line (no talking) to Silver Cloud in Bucktown.. . Order what I call "school lunch" - a sloppy joe sandwich and tator tots. If they sold milk in tiny cartons and had a woman with a hair net dishing out the grub, then it would be Union Elementary all over again.. . For those not wishing to revisit prepubescence, there are many other tasty items on the menu. May I recommend the spinach and artichoke dip? I may? Then good - get some, because it's rather nice.. . Combine the good food with a comfortable setting and a good staff and you have a 5 star review, my friends.
