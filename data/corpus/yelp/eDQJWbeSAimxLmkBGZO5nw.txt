I used to live in Japan where ramen shops are plentiful and I had been craving ramen for a long time before I finally made the trek to Little Tokyo for some.  I wanted to try Daikokuya but the wait was too long (but I plan on going back for it).. . The ramen here was delicious.  I got the medium spiciness (4) miso broth without any extras.  The service was fast and in ten minutes I had a huge bowl of steaming hot ramen noodles in front of me.. . Now, I've had a lot of ramen in my day, but I do not claim to be an expert in the subject.  However, I do have a couple complaints.  One, the noodles seemed under cooked.  While they were good, they were a little hard, I thought.  Second, the bowl was supposed to come with pork but all I got were two tiny, tiny pieces the size of my fingernail.  (I'm used to getting big slices included).. . That being said, the broth was one of the best I've ever tasted.  4 was just the right level of spiciness.  It brought back memories of sitting at a train station ramen shop in Kyoto, which is what I was hoping it would do.  I will definitely go back.
