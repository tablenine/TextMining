Since sushi is one of my passions, I like to start my life as a critique by adding to already numerous FANTASTIC reviews for Sushi Gen.  Yes, there's long wait; yes, there's no parking; yes, they don't take lunch reservation; yes, it's hard to stand around or sit outside while you wait for the table.  However, as a loyal customer for the past 6 years, I have to say that the consistency and freshness of quality of food is unbeatable.  I like the basics.  Sushi combo or Sashimi combo.  For a faster service, you can call-in to ask to put your name down on the waiting list.
