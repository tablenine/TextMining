Some of the best sushi I have ever had.  Start with the goat cheese infused crab cakes.  Don't skimp on the Asian salad and seafood soup - both might sound boring but are terrifically tantalizing.  The rolls are great but stay away from the special rolls at $28/per as they are good but not THAT good.  The drinks and Saki are excellent.  Bring your checkbook because you REALLY pay for your meal here.  I doubt I will return as I have a decent knack for finding great sushi without feeling the need to pay for the restaurant's rent too.
