I decided to check this place out with some friends today.  When I first got there, I was very excited.  There aren't too many New York style delis in Chicago.  The menu is pretty good as is the food.  I enjoyed my soup and sandwich and saw alot of other things on the menu that I wanted to try.  As far as the service goes, I feel like we were sitting there forever! Our waiter kept dissapearing and our food came out at different times. Fortunately, the owner was very nice to us and gave us some free food. I would definitely give this place another shot and hope that the service gets better.. . edit-. My rating for this place has gone done because of service. We went there, and they were extremely rude.  The service wasn't great and the owner wasn't very accommodating.  Its too bad because the food is actually pretty good.
