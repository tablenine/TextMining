super yummy.. cheap.. food comes really fast.. good portions.. cash only sux, but totally worth it.. . the crepe is rad.. everyone loves the homemade limeade.. my favorite is 17, where you get shrimp, steak AND an egg roll on the noodles.. their steak is really good, and they have the best egg rolls ever.. ever.
