Went here for dessert with after a great dinner at nearby Tank Sushi. The atmosphere is great and is perfect for date night or drinks and dessert with the girls. Despite the inattentive service from our clueless waiter, my experience was pretty positive. They had several wine flights to choose from and tasty desserts (try the sticky toffee pudding with Guinness ice cream) and cheeses that were a great way to end the night.
