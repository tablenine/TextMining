Yes, I've seen the long line many times passing by and I'm definitely a fan of Japanese Ramen!. . I was lucky enough not having to wait for our table the very first time I visited Daikokuya. It was a raining evening, and since a good friend of mine works in Downtown, so we decided to meet right after work for an early dinner at 6pm, the place is not crowded as usual, heehee... so waiting time is not a factor of my rating like some of the other yelpers here. . . I ordered the Fried Spicy Tuna as appetizer (ground spicy tuna wrapped in a shino leaf and fried in tempura batter) and the specialty Daikokuya Ramen with extra green onion (I'm a green onion freak!). Service were fine and speedy. The Fried Spicy Tuna were fresh and tasty, the shino leaf paired perfectly with spicy tuna, very aromatic. My ramen was very yummy as well. I thought it was very well portioned, not an huge bowl but def. not small. The ramen itself were delicious, one of the best I've had. But the soup were on the salty side I thought, very similar to the ramen I've had in Japan (Ramen in Japan were all on the salty side to me when I visited), so I guess you could say it's very authentic! . . Overall, I give it 4 stars because I wasn't impressed (maybe my expectations were too high after seeing the lines previously). Next time I'd go for the combo (Ramen + fried rice or various rice bowl) for a couple of bucks more. Most ppl do as I overlooked the other tables, and their rice bowls looked awesome! Oh, and don't forget to order your beer. There's something about beer and ramen, just simply can't do without =)
