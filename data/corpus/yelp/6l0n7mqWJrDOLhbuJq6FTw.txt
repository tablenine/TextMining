Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
i don't think i've had anything from Porto's that i DIDN'T like. my favorite item is the fruit tart which is so yummy and cheap to order a large size for parties. the fruit is always fresh and it's not too sweet. everyone mentions the cheese rolls for a reason- they're to die for and addicting at that! of course the lunch items like the potato balls are great too but i've got a massive a sweet tooth and i like to indulge in trying out their ample desserts. . . thank goodness they opened one in Burbank but i have yet to check that one out. i mostly have Porto's at parties and always look forward to seeing anything from there on the food table!
