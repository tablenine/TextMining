Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
I was vacillating between three and four stars, but decided to denigrate down to three, due to the price-to-performance ratio of Pizzeria Mozza.. . I had very high hopes as a few Yelpers whose opinions I respect were raving about this place. Apparently we should have tried some of the appetizers, but we went straight for the pizza...one Pizza Bianca with Fennel Sausage, and one Funghi Pizza (that's mushroom, to those of you who don't speak Los Angeleno). . . The Fennel Sausage pizza was very, very good: moist, flavorful, with a perfect crust and lots of fat. I'm happy to say that I've never experienced this particular combination of cheese, herbs, and meat, and I can see why this particular model is so popular. The Funghi Pizza - not so much; tasted quite average, overall. Disappointing, given the price.. . The filtered tap water: amazing. Probably the best filtered tap water I've ever had, bar none; much better than the filtered tap water in Pasadena, Beijing, Southern India, and Los Alamitos.. . Service was great: helpful, pleasant without being forced, with very clean socks. Ambience? Loud. Also, loud. The place looks nice enough, but don't expect to be able to whisper sweet nothings into your fiancee's ears while you drool olive oil.. . I feel that there is some hype at work here, from my perspective. The overall pizza experience was good (the average of one fantastic pizza and one rather lame pizza), but not the best thing I've ever had, and nothing that I find myself truly craving to get back to.. . When I got hit with the bill, I wondered how $45 could have happened. For two small pizzas that average out to be "good", that just ain't right. I would try it again, under the right circumstances - perhaps the appetizers and a luckier choice for both pizzas would change my view.
