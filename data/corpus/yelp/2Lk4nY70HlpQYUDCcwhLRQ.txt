Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Brazilian
This is another venue on my short list of "fast the day before go" restaurants. Fogo De Chao is a Brazilian restaurant where you pay one price to pretty much eat all of the meat, salad and sides you want. . . The restaurant has to keep about 100 people working at any given time (I asked the waiter) just to maintain the level of service they promise. I also noticed that almost everyone working in here is a man. The waiter told me that women generally don't last very long carrying the slabs of meat around from table to table to slice and dice for diners. He also told me that they probably walk a few miles a day just within the restaurant. . . I like everything and as long as you are a carnivore, you will too. For vegetarians (I can't imagine one getting past the glass door with the rotating meat on display) there is the full salad bar. It is one of the best ones I've ever seen in the city. . . Be prepared to pay a pretty penny for the prized selection of beef, pork and chicken that only Fogo De Chao can dish out. But I promise, you won't have to eat for 48 hours after you leave.
