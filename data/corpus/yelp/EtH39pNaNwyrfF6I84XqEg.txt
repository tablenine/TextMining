Category: Steakhouses
Fantastic!  Fantastic!  Fantastic!. . They really know how to take care of you at Mastro's and they should, it's not cheap!  Try the Lobster Mashed Potatoes they are excellent.  I had a Filet, Lobster Mash, Asparagus and a lot of Jack Daniels.  Winning combination on all levels.  I was so full when we left I could barely walk and it wasn't the booze!  The best steak house I have ever been to hands down.. . This is a great place to get FAT!
