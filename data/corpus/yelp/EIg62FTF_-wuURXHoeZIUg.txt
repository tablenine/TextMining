"I'm blue blue blue blue blue, da ba dee, daba blue blue blue!". That is what I started singing as I inched my way towards pissed-drunkenness for my birthday last year at Fogo de Chao. I don't even know how the song popped in my head, but it was so entertaining--with the help of a couple of pitchers of awesome sangria of course. And I vaguely remember making up a back-story for the song which was really funny--but what the hell was it? Oh well, the life of a lush.. . Like any other Brazilian churrascaria, I love the food!!! Stay away from the chickens, but their cow-based meats are so tender and delish. If you keep your little "come hither"-disk flipped to green, the waiters WILL swarm your table with their little scarves around their necks and huge knives holding their junk. And by junk, I mean, the best meat ever!! And by the best meat ever, I mean their sirloins, tenderloins, beef ribs, filet mignon, bacon-wrapped meat, aaaah.....uh, I think I hafta go now. And you can't go wrong with the classic Brazilian cheesy bread (how do I make this damn stuff at home?!). Oh, and there's a fairly big salad bar if that's your thing.. . The only down sides are that this place is uber-hectic and crowded, but even worse, uber-expensive. I don't know how we dropped a couple bills, but damn Gina! I feel violated!!**. . **Disclaimer: It was my birthday, so I didn't actually pay. So technically, I didn't feel that violated. Only slightly toyed with. Hence the 4 stars.. . Go here for really special occasions and that's it. Stick with Pampas in the Farmer's Market, M Grill in Koreatown, or Cafe Brasil in Culver for your everyday Brazilian needs. Except the waxing.
