Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
This place is usually a tourist trap so it is usually crowded, but however as an added bonus they have a waiting room that has all you can eat meat balls and a bar to drink your wait time away.  Once you get into the main dining area you'll see its a massive ball room type decor that really gives a fancy feel to it.  The prime rib is awesome, the sides are good, and if you haven't heard about their salad, they have their famous spinning salad where the waiter tosses your salad right in front of you and your guests.  Very neat, except some friends have told me that it can get messy.  Just find a server that knows what they're doing and you'll thoroughly enjoy it.  Nothing surprising here, you come to an upper level steak house, you're gonna get good results.
