It's 1 am ish, I just came back from OC. Â Me and my cousin went on a journey for these so called korean tacos! So we went to the placentia location and there was a turn about, we're like WTF! it's not here! we came pretty came close to turning back around and heading home, but we decided to press on in just mere hope that it's in the parking lot and well....at first all we saw were cars...but then, my cousin spotted people, "it's there! it's here!" and we found it! awesome! we parked waited in line, and order the short rib and spicy pork and a short rib burrito! OMG heaven in mouth! I must say the burrito was not as good. But the tacos were just out of this world. They were so flavorful and just well made! it was worth waiting in line and worth waiting for the food. My god I'm hooked! Now I miss...the tacos the most...I definitely would recommend this to anyone, this quite an experience!
