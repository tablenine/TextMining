When it comes to pho, the 5 star Yelp rating system doesn't really work for me.  Instead, I would like to introduce the Mama Q.  rating system.  I was raised on pho.  In Vietnam pho is a common meal, usually eaten for breakfast.  But I grew up in Texas and my mom only made it for us once in a blue moon.  You see, the prep and cooking process is usually no shorter than 8 hours and often runs overnight.. . Needless to say, my mom's pho is the best.  Because of the complexity of pho I've created a 10 point rating system.  The points in which I judge pho are not so easy to understand, but some of the qualifiers include broth color and consistency, freshness of the side vegetables, and the power and taste of the pho burp.. . The reason I go to Pho Cafe is that it is fast, close-by and relatively inexpensive.  But I must admit that it is more expensive than what I'm used to.. . This is a good place for a quick pho fix.  But it only gets a 5 out of 10 on the Mama Q. scale.  If it's any consolation I just attempted to make pho at home on my own.  I gave myself a 4.  Next time I'm shooting for a 6.
