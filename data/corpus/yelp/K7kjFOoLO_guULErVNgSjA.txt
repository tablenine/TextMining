Restaurant: Highland Tap
Category: Steakhouses
The stark contrast between my first and second dining experience at the Highland Tap irks me.  The first time, I had a wonderfully buttery, tender, medium-rare prime rib along with some yummy "steakhouse" type sides and would have rated the place a 4 or 5.  The second time the prime rib was so tough that I couldn't chew it at all.  Also, the sirloin was well-done instead of medium-rare (mine was the sirloin, husband's was the prime rib), and it took so incredibly long for them to bring me a new sirloin steak that we had to box it up and take it home.  My second experience would have received 1 star.. . I'm just too scared to try eating there again based on how they royally messed up 2 steaks the second time.. . We ate in the "white tablecloth" section and not in the crowded bar section.  Smelled like an ash tray coming out of there both times due to having to walk through the bar area.  The smoke is so thick you can cut it with a knife.
