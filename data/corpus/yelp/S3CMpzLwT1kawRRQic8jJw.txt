Delicious Banh Mi!  I was in Atlanta for a conference without a car, but it was worth the trek from downtown on MARTA and bus to eat these sandwiches.  The 39 bus takes you along almost the entire length of the Asian shopping and food district that is Buford Hwy, and it's worth getting a day pass so that you can stop at a few places along the way.. . The tofu sandwich isn't featured prominently on the signs above the counter but it does exist and is delicious - made with fairly substantial strips of deep fried tofu (as opposed to the shredded dried tofu you sometimes find, which I also like) and lots of cilantro and pickles.. . I personally liked the sandwich at this place a bit better than at Quoc Huong, but really they are just very different.  Lee's uses a clear (probably fish-based) sauce whereas Quoc Huong is really heavy on the mayonnaise.  Also they put jalapeños in the sandwiches at Lee's, which I like.. . My only regret is that I didn't buy more of these - they are only $2.50 each, and 6 for the price of 5 - to take home on the train.  They also have French style baked goods like croissants, which are okay but not great.
