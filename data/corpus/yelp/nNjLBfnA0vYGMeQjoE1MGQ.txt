Oh my god, yum.. . I tried this place today thanks to Yelp, and I knew I was in for a good day when the parking garage wasn't charging for the day (who knows!). I arrive, and the staff let my dog sit with me outside (thanks!) so we were off to a good start.. . For 10.50, I got the hot plate, which is your choice of a 'main' dish (I chose the herbed tuna. delicious, but the portion was a little sad), mashed potatos (YES they melt in your mouth) and a dee-lish spinach and goat cheese salad. I was stuffed by the end, despite the smallish fish, and totally satisfied. . . Great people watching on Culver Blvd, and the dining space is lovely. Pretty standard prices for a nice LA lunch al fresco, so I couldn't be happier.
