The food here is good, but I think you pay more for the ambiance/atmosphere.  It was really cool that Wolfgang Puck himself came out to say hello and ask if everything was good.  The skate was soooo good, and their sweet peas were the best peas I've EVER had.  They were so fresh and the right firmness. . . Their dessert menu looked good but we were too full to order dessert.  Overall I'd say the customer service here was superb, and the food was good, but I would not say AMAZING (but the peas were amazing).. . Parking is valet for $8, but if you go around the corner there is parking lot that charges $3 flat flee after 6pm.
