Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
For all the people that live in LA, I am sure that everyone has seen the line at PINKS. Yesterday i was driving by the line was short, and what a better chance to try to ALL Famous PINKS Hot Dog.. . What can i say "It was OK" maybe i hyped my self up too much. Maybe i just need to find the Dog that fits me.. . Dont Get me Wrong, PINKS has a Huge Huge Selection of Hot Dogs. I will give it another shot next time &amp; will change my review if it my taste buds start tot tingle. . . I suggest everyone to try it themselves and decided.. . For a First time i got the Chili Dog with everything. Next time i will get the Bacon Dog withe everything. . . If you are ever in VANCOUVER BC CANADA, you will have to find a Hot Dog Cart in Downtown called "JAPPA DOG" Seriously One of the BEST, One of the Best.
