This was the grossest food I can ever remember eating in Chicago while expecting something at least mediocre. The margaritas are okay, but nothing to write home about. I had chicken quesadillas...nothing tricky, I just wanted something easy to take home and reheat. That chicken was all yellow and covered in black spots. Not to mention dry. It was 9 bones for rotten chicken and a really small amount of cheese then three inches or so of tortilla. And thank god for that because it was all I could eat. My friend got the empanadas. She took a bite and left the rest. For real I NEVER complain, but this was straight gross. Not even coming from a 4am burrito place. Sick. Worst food ever.
