I have performed at the Magic Castle.  I just read the review that described how to get an invitation, and I felt I should chime in here.  . . If you follow their advice about contacting a performer, it's up to that performer whether he wants to go out of his way to help a complete stranger get into the club.  Our reputations are on the line if our guests make trouble for the staff.  . . There's no reason for a performer take the time and effort to get you in, other than good karma.  So, if I were trying that strategy, I'd make sure that my email to the performer was... at the very least... a really nice one.  If a magician helps you get in, remember that he's doing you a favor, since it's a private club that's not open to the public.. awhile back, I went out of my way to get a group into the castle, only to find out they were a bunch of jackasses with a sense of entitlement.  They caused problems for the staff all night long.  Honestly... these people couldn't have been any ruder or less appreciative.  So, they WON'T be coming back.  . . EVER.. . My advice for getting in?  Ask a magician nicely and be honest.  Describe how much it would mean for you to go there.  It's hard for us to ignore a heartfelt request.  If a magician helps you out, be gracious and respectful of the club and it's staff.  We love the place dearly, and the people who work there are our family, so please treat them well.
