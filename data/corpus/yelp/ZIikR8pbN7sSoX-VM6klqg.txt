I thought this was some of the best food I've had in a long time. I can't believe it took me this long to try it. Several people mentioned that this is a good restaurant so my expectations were high - and pleasantly met when I finally made it here.. . Everything on the menu looked delicious and the flavors were paired extremely well and in combinations I would have never thought of. My friend and I ordered two small plates - one was a ravioli with quail egg that oozes out when you break into it. It was one of the best tasting ravioli's I've had in my life. I ordered a fish entree served over ricotta filled gnocchi. It was such a good combination of protein and starch and didn't leave me feeling too full. . . The service was courteous and friendly and it starts the minute you walk in the door. The environment feels very zen-like...almost as if you're in a spa. It's on the expensive side but the quality of the food and the experience are in line with the prices.
