This review is geared towards the crab fest.  I have not had a chance to sample their regular menu, but after tasting their delicious treats at today's crab fest, I will definitely be back - especially for the burger.. . The crab fest is an annual event (this being the third time) and for $45 you get a 4 course meal, including all-you-can-eat Maryland crabs.  The first course was a phenomenal crab soup with cornbread.  The soup was filled with crab.  Who knew soup could be phenomenal?! . . The second course was a crabcake "sandwich" and it was the best crabcake I've ever had.  It was 99.999% crabmeat - not mayo-y or breadcrumb-y.  They also gave us corn on the cob but I don't consider that a course.  The third "course" was the all-you-can-eat part and we went to town.  MD crabs are smaller than your usual crab but sooo flavorful.  But you gotta work for those few bites of deliciousness.  Be sure to drink a lot of water because the seasoning is deceptively salty.  My lips were tingling after 9 crabs and that's when I decided to throw in the towel.  . . The fourth course was a yummmmy strawberry shortcake type dish but with plums instead.  It sounded weird but was delicious.  . . We made reservations for noon because we wanted to make sure there would be plenty of crabs.  The crowd was all ready to have a good time and there were many yummy sounding drinks offered as well.  . . You can park in the Borders complex and they validate 1 hour.  We parked a block south on Vine because we didn't want to deal with any potential traffic from the immigration rally.  I'll have to update this review after trying their regular menu.  Oh, and the servers were uber-friendly.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience.
