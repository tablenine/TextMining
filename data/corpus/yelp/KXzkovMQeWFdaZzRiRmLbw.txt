A week ago we went here for the second time for my wife's birthday. She is a much bigger fan than I am - I wasn't that impressed the first time. . . I am pretty knowledgeable when it comes to red wines, but we went with a Washington Cab recommended by the sommelier. She made a good choice, quite tasty. I started with the bone marrow flan, which I have to say was fantastic. My wife had the butter lettuce salad, which she also enjoyed.. . For our entrees it was the Nebraska corn fed dry aged rib-eye for me, and the petit cut filet for my wife. The steaks were very good, but not worth the small fortune they charge (sides, even sauce, are extra of course - but the armagnac and green peppercorn sauce is worth the small extra).  The side of fresh corn was excellent, but the fries with herbs were dry and overcooked.  We ended with coffee and a chocolate souffle.. . Part of the fun here is celebrity watching, and this night didn't disappoint. Our governor's picture was on the back of my wife's menu; two minutes later she noticed Arnold and the family dining nearby. A few minutes after that, Warren Beatty sat two tables over. I still think it's overpriced, but a treat for a special occasion.
