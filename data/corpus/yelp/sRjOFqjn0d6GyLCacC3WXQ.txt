Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
How does this ramen compare to what you'll get in Japan?. ...Well, honestly, I don't know yet! lol. My trip over to Japan is at the end of May, and coincidentally enough, I happen to be going to Fukuoka, which is famous for their "Hakata Raman." Once I have the cream of the crop, maybe I'll revise this review. . . When I first came here on a weekend, the line was fairly long, and we had to wait a good half hour. We started off with their gyoza, and I had the Hakata Ramen with fried rice. I still say Daikokuya has the best fried rice on the face of this planet, but let's move on to the soup. I like my ramen with bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, green onions, an egg, and soft noodles. I asked for medium-cooked noodles because I was worried that they might overcook them, and that my hot broth would cook them later in the process. Sadly, they remained somewhat medium the entire time, and I suppose that was a "my bad." The thing is, I like how Hakata ramen uses thin noodles, but they didn't taste like anything. The noodles reminded me of capellini. Call me crazy, but they did! You can tell that they didn't use egg noodles. Perhaps that's the more authentic way to make ramen, but I prefer having that extra taste to it.. Maybe I was missing out on some ingredients, so when I come next time, I'll have to decide whether I want my ramen topped with minced garlic, or spicy miso. Mmm, that does sound good, actually!
