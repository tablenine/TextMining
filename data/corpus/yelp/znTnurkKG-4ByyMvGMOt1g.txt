i went to this place for my sister's birthday last week. really cute and trendy place. food was pretty tasty too. try the protabello fries, really delicious. . so, why the low rating? well i'm sorry but i'm big on service and the service here is rotten. this place unfortunately doesn't take reservations and is pretty packed by dinner time. we were well aware of this, so we got there an hour before we expected to eat. when we signed up i asked the hostess how long did she think the wait was and she said 20-30 mins. ok, we went to the bar and had a couple of drinks. great drinks btw, but a little pricey. after about 45 mins of waiting, we still hadn't been called so i checked back in with the hostess and politely asked her how much longer because i was given a 20-30 min time frame earlier. she gave me such an attitude, told me that she had no idea how long it was gonna be and that they never give time estimates. she called me a liar! told me to have a seat and she would get to me. i was mad, but i didn't say anything and again sat back politely. another 30 mins went by and still nothing. i went back up to the hostess and again she was snotty. i told her we had been waiting for over an hour and asked to speak to a manager. she said there was none. kidding me?? ok, i about had it but then miraculously, they had a table for us. our server apologized profusely, but it didn't really make up for anything. i don't think i'll ever go back there again. even if the food was pretty tasty. maybe just at the bar. oh and another thing, the place is all marble so you have to scream to talk to each other.
