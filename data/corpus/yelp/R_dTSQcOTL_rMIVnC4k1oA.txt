Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Once again voted "Best Pizza in LA" in Zagat.  It is important to note that they are not rated for "Best Italian" despite having a large Italian menu, so stick to the pizza, and you may want to consider ordering out, as getting a table can take over an hour.  Also, for whatever reason, the mushrooms are canned.  Strange, but adds a little enigma to the place.. . All in all, this is the only place I ever want to get pizza, and just another reason North East L.A. rocks.  . . Check out more about NELA eating and drinking at . http://www.yorkblvd.com. .
