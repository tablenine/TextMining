Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
When I'm looking for some good comfort food, Smoke Daddy is the place.  The baby back ribs and their green beans are so yummy.   My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   The half slab of ribs with two sides was more that I could eat in two meals.  I had a great time taking my leftovers to work and watching my coworkers drool at the sight and smell of the ribs!  :)  You can't beat that!. The service was fast and friendly.  . . Don't sit too close to the street though, the exhaust from the Division bus can get a little overwhelming.
