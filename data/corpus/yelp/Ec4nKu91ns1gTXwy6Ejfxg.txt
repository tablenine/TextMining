Even though this place looks like it's full of atmosphere... I would say that was about it. It's romantically lit, always full, and fairly comfortable. . . But the food was completely underwhelming. Our table ordered some traditional classics... spring rolls, fried and fresh, some salads, etc. And wow, everything tasted AVERAGE. We were better off supporting a real non-poshy homey Vietnamese restaurant without all the "fancy" BS. . . P.S. I could not believe how much they charged for prawn chips! You can buy a whole box of prawn chips from Chinatown that you can deep fry at home for $2!!
