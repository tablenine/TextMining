The Early Bird Special definitely won me over. If you don't mind eating a little earlier in the evening, you are going to be thrilled with your delicious, non-bank-breaking meal. We shared the seared ahi tuna appetizer (amazing!) and the jumbo lump crabcakes for starters. We then each had steak entrees -- and mine was definitely the winner, a smaller sized portion of their signature steak oscar: filet topped w/ jumbo lump crab, creamy mashed potatoes, asparagus and b√©arnaise. I was not a big fan of the smoking at the bar, but if you sit towards the back of the restaurant you'll enjoy a smoke-free meal. Also, Fat Tire is on tap. Hooray.
