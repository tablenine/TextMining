The 5-stars is for their happy hour/bar area/bar food only, I haven't actually eaten dinner here.. . But I could not resist raving about this place.  Seriously.  First of all, great atmosphere - kind of darker inside but never too loud.  Great service as well and really good drink and food specials for happy hour.. . Second of all, they always serve you these warm, delicious biscuits with this amazing butter.  Try not to eat it - seriously.  Last night I resisted for an hour but then I caved.. . Thirdly, their martinis are always spot-on (apparently I just turned British), and if you are really smart you will find the one on the menu that is served with ROCK CANDY and never go back!
