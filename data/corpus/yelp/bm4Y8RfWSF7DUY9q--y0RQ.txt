I visited Bone Garden a few weekends ago with a group of friends. Many in the group had been before and raved about the food. Needless to say, I had really high hopes going in. Sadly, I was a bit disappointed. . . I'll start by saying the d√©cor and staff are both incredible. Fun atmosphere. Unique look. Great people. We hung out at the bar for a bit while waiting for a table. The drinks were tasty and reasonably priced. Up to the point the food was delivered, I was definitely on the "Yay! This place is amazing" team. Sadly, the food didn't live up to my expectations. I ordered the Pozole Blanco and was pretty bummed after the first couple bites. The broth had very little flavor. I love spice and am fine with having to add pepper sauce, but even that didn't help. The broth tasted really watery and while the ingredient quality was clearly good - the hominy, chicken breast and produce - it just couldn't make up for the lack of flavor. . . The reviews from the rest of the group were mixed - those who had been before and raved loved their orders (I guess you find your favorite menu item and stick with it), but a couple others were disappointed as well.. . I could have just ordered wrong, but pozole/tortilla soup/or some version thereof is a typical order for me and I wish I'd been impressed. I'll definitely be back for fun and drinks in the future, and maybe give the food another shot.
