I came here for Sunday Brunch with out reservations.  We were quoted a 45 minute wait, but it ended up being about a half hour.. . The bloody mary flight is incredible!  Some of best bloody mary's i've had ever.. Also - my breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg and cheese was delicious.. . I loved my meal but my breakfast companions seemed less excited then i was.  Apparently the omlette was a little bland.. . I would certainly go back for bloody mary's and to try some thing else on the menu.  . . Did i mention the bloody mary's?
