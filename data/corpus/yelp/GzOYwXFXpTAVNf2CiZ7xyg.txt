Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I side with most of the reviews I saw here about this place, as the top Google search result for Korean BBQ in L.A. area, I was a bit surprised to see most people here do not seem to like it too much...after I tried there myself, I totally see the reason. Part of it was because the noisy environment, poor service, and also not so tasty "all you can eat" meat. But it does have a good business, I went there two weeks ago on a Friday night, I waited 1.5 hours to get in, not that worth the waiting...I do not think I would go there again.
