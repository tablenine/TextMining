I think if I spent more time here I could go the full 5-star voter way....but alas I am a busy girl and don't get much further than my few blocks of Roscoe St.  All that said, I had the BEST iced coffee here.  I drink a lot of iced coffee at this time of year, and I have been known to commute somewhere for coffee before (from San Francisco to Cafe Fanny in Berkeley for a latte, from anywhere here in Chicago to Metropolis.) Now I have a new destination for my play book.   Iced coffee.  Seriously yum. (And the ambiance is awfully good, too.)
