Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
We had our hearts set on Mexican food and Margaritas at Pacos in Culver City, but instead we headed to Tender Greens. Something new, something fresh, something not Mexican - time for change.. . Tender Greens is just one of Culver City's popular hot spots. Right next door to Ford's Station and Ugo Italian Cafe. Tender Greens offers a pretty simple and straight forward menu. The set up is almost cafeteria-like, but the food is 100 times better. Everything on the menu is from $4-$10.50. I tried the Steak hot plate, which included a Cesar Salad and a heaping glob of buttery-velvety mashed potatoes. . . I also tried the rustic chicken and lemon soup. It wasn't lemony as I was hoping for, but still very nice to have on a cold night. You also have the option of having Fish, Chicken or Steak as a sandwich instead of a hot plate -- all for the same price. Wine and beer is also served; I tried the house Ale and it was quite heavy but paired nicely with the steak. . . Outdoor seating is also available and possibly a lot warmer to sit at than inside. There are heat lamps and tables/couches outside and if you go in the evening, the atmosphere is very warm and cozy. The wait staff is superb here and you will never find a piece of trash or dirty dish on your table as you dine. I love an attentive staff. . . I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu. Lemme know if you wanna go!
