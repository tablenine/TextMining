Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
It's tough to know what to rate Sushi Gen.  The place is a bit of a contradiction of terms.  On one hand they do fresh sushi extremely beautifully.  You can taste the freshness of the fish.  They serve it at the right temperature.  You can taste that they properly make their sushi rice--the whole bit.  They also have a nice sake selection.  The prices are above average, but not by a ton.  Then again, they are only *steps* away from the cold storage section of the city, where ALL of the freshest fish goes, so there's really no excuse for there to be ANYWHERE in Little Tokyo that doesn't have the freshest fish that money can buy.. . However, the service last night left a LOT to be desired.  Our server was curt, not particularly attentive, and even seemed judgmental of my order.  I mean, I was at a real sushi place.  Don't look at me all funny 'cause I wanted a California roll and asked to make sure it had real crab in it.  I thought it'd be fun to order one in a REAL sushi place.  Geez!  If you're gonna judge me for it, don't put it on your menu!  . . This wasn't the best fish I've had in LA.  That was definitely Sushi Zo, but then I've not had omakase here.  If nothing else, you'll know that you're going to get fresh, Japanese sushi and sashimi here.  Frills, service, smiles?  You won't.  But I suppose you don't always get those in Japan, either, so...enjoy.
