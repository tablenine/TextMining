Came here Sunday night for the first time in 3 years &amp; for some reason, it just wasn't what I remembered it to be.  Nevertheless, I love their large selection and maybe it was just what I ordered that night.  I got the chicken hearts yakitori, to the disgust of those at my table, but they were DELICIOUS. I also got the fried chicken leg which was good and agedashi tofu which was a lot more soggy than I would've like.  My whole meal including hot tea, tax, &amp; tip came out to be around $20 which I thought was a little steep for 3 small dishes.  I think next time I just have to order a bit more carefully.
