I've always walk in here without a reservation and manage to squeeze a table at the bar. I get pretty much the same thing every time: the chopped salad, the squash blossom pizza, and lime cheesecake. The margherita pizza is also delish.. . The menu descriptions of the dishes are underwhelming -- I think they do this on purpose (under-promise, over-deliver) -- but the flavors of the actual dishes are a small explosion in your mouth. Awesome (AWESOME) wine selection and fabulous service each and every time.
