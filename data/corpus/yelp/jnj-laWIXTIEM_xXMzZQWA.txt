Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
I went to Cobras &amp; Matadors last summer on recommendations from Yelp, and was really impressed. Though it is definitely scene-y (there was a supermodel there whose name wouldn't come to mind), there was something cozy about the noisy din. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves because the FOOD is extremely tasty and I was truly impressed. Holding its own against my Californian foodie standards for yummyness, friendly and efficient (and very busy) waitstaff, really friendly guy who runs the wine shop next door (waived corkage makes the extra couple of bucks for the convenience of buying chilled sauvignon blanc worth it) made our experience one to put a cap on a truly glorious 24 hour 'pit stop' in LA en route to Mazatlan. . . Going back to LA this week and even though I know there are hundreds more restaurants to try, I was so struck that I just made my reservation to go back! Try it, and I don't think you'll be disappointed.
