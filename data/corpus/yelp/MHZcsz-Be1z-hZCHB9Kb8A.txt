Category: Thai
I don't know, is this place even worth reviewing?  There are so many better options out there for "Pan-Asian" food.  I will say, though, that their prices are very good, but you get what you pay for.. . I had not been to a Penny's Noodles in YEARS, and my friend and I decided to eat there on Friday night b/c:. 1) it wasn't crowded. 2) we wanted something fast and inexpensive. and 3) it was just steps away from our next destination, Blue Line.. . We shared the Thai Spring Rolls as an appetizer.  Decent, but nothing special.. . I ordered the Sauteed Chicken Noodles.  Lacked any kind of flavor.  My friend ordered the Sesame Beef Noodles.  The beef was overcooked and tasted like liver, and the dish was comprised mostly of been sprouts!. . Won't be going here again.
