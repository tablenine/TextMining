HB is deelish with a capital DEE! We went for their Valentine's day four course menu, trekking all the way from Wicker Park in the snow and cold. HB certainly warmed us up. The cheerful reception, prompt service and yummy food was just what the awful weather called for. . . Like everyone else on here says, the beef brisket is oh so good, and the quail is nice and yum. I think my favorite part of the after-meal was the dried cherry bread pudding. "Melt in your mouth, not in your hand because you can't keep the fork away from your mouth long enough" type. I haven't said Â this in god knows how long but, wowsa! . . The owner is great - you can just tell he really loves his job. My boyfriend said he would go back just for that. I would go back for the food too.
