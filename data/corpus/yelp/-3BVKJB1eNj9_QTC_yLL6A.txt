zOMG.. . I came here with my close friend HIDEo [pun intended] on a whim today.. . The wait wasn't cute, but it's to be expected at a place that has great fish and great sushi.. . CASH ONLY - no joke. That's alright - the quality of the sushi will blow your @#$%ing mind.. . If you want to have Sushi in Los Angeles without all the bullshit, high prices, and the fluff - this is the place to go.
