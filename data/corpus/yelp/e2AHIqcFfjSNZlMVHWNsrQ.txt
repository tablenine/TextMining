I am not vegan.. . But one of my best friends is, and he swears by this place.. . It has been hit and miss for me the few times I have been there. . . This last time I was there I tried the El bandito Rojo, which was awesome. . . As far has healthy (Yes, contrary to what you might think it can be unhealthy) vegan food goes, I haven't had much better.
