I used to LOVE this place!   The service is terrible and unfriendly people work there.. . I ate on a slow Sunday afternoon.  Our waitress kept disappearing.  I had to bus my own table and she never checked in to see how anything was or asked if we wanted drink refills or dessert.  She chatted with her coworker in the back the entire time. I had to get up and ask for the check, which she never came to collect.  I paid at the bar and the bartender didn't even say a word!  friendly service, NOT.
