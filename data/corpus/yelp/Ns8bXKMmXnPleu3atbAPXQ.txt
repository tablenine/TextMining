I was going to give this place a 3 star, but "Meh. I've experienced better" really describes it well.  My husband had been wanting to go here for awhile, so we decided to have brunch there the other day.  I had the eggs Norwegian.  I liked how the eggs were cooked, but the bread was too hard which made it difficult to cut through.  The hollandaise sauce was on the bland side.  The plate looked so bare.  It could have used a little mixed green salad garnish - or something.  They were really talking up their amazing bread.  It was horrible - thin, dry and tasteless is the only way to describe it.  If you want to see how bread is done, go up to San Francisco and have brunch at Tartine.  Their bread is amazing.  To end on a positive note, the decor is really nice.
