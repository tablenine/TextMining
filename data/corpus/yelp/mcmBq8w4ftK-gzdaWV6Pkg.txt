Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
My friend handed me a news clipping listing the top 5 taquerias in Chicago and said pick one for dinner. She wanted an authentic taqueria experience and I pick the West Loop listing (De Cero) as opposed to one of the four Pilsen listings. . . Well, I couldn't have been more pleased with the food. Chips and salsa - delish. Cheese enchiladas in tomatillos sauce - outstanding! As a vegetarian, I was very happy with the side of black beans and white rice. The lime margarita was quite good although heavily laden with ice. . . My friend wasn't too impressed with her tacos - one pastor and one chorizo. She thought the white rice was odd. Needless to say, our opinion of the place is divided.. . The decor was cute although the warehouse feel resulted in major sound amplification. The joint is loud. There was some outdoor seating. I would definitely go back and hopefully find a seat outside. Oh, the service was pretty slow, if that matters to you.
