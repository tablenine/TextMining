Restaurant: Feast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I have been going to Feast since it opened, and I gotta say that it has just gotten better over the years. The food has always been above average combinations of flavors and portions for what I consider below average prices. There is still no other restaurant like it in the neighborhood. As for the service, my experiences have all (and I've had quite a few there) been just fine. I'm not saying that everything was perfect, but who expects that? I'm sorry if you only go out to eat twice a year and decide to forget that people, not machines, run restaurants, and also that you aren't the only person in the house. Okay, sorry for the side rant. Anyway, go to Feast. The food is tasty, fresh and huge for the price and the wine list is spot on. Plus the half-price bottle of wine nights on Monday and Tuesday are a nice bonus when you like wine as much as I do :) Oh, and sit on the patio while you can!
