Restaurant: Abattoir
Category: American (New)
I am not going to ramble like I did the first time, but since Abattoir has opened I have been there no less than 10 times and each time it gets better and better. The food is inventive and always perfect. The service is even better.  The restaurant runs amazingly smooth under the manager, Rick.  I almost feel spoiled eating there now with the attention to detail this place gives to its guests. Erin G. is hands down the best person at her job in any field - period.  Bo is right there as well. If you go in and ask for one of these two, you will have an amazing dining experience to go along with the amazing food. The menu changes daily (hence its printing on the place mats) but recently has changed quite a bit and the new dishes (scallops, brisket, eggplant) are as great as some of my old favorites (lamb liver fritters, potted chicken liver and fois gras, rabbit rillettes, coulotte). My understanding is that they are updating their offal in the very near future which will make for a wonderful Fall dining season for me. Already looking forward to my next visit which is about a week away!
