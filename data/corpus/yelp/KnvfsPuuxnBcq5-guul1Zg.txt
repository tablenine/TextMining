I don't go here much, but when I do, the bartender always remembers me and talks to me like I was just there a few days ago.  There's nothing particularly special about this place, but the service I've received has always been top notch.  That always worth many return visits.  I guess I'm showing my age.  The older you get, the less important price and ambiance become, and the more important service becomes.  The food is okay, the ambiance is okay, and the smoke can be heavy late night, but the service (at the bar) is great.
