REALLY not my type of joint and it is so out of place on Division! It looks like the North Face version of Wildfire.  Or a sports bar mixed with a mountain lodge.. . There is a somewhat impressive beer list.  The food was completely expected and I thought it was over priced. I spent more money here on some drinks, a burger that I split with someone, and an appetizer, than I have spent at Tank Sushi in Lincoln Square. That's saying a lot.. . The only way I'd hit this spot again is if they had a fab beer special or there was nowhere else nearby with an outdoor patio &amp; an empty seat.
