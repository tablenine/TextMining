#257. . New to Los Angeles... I was craving greek food so I searched on yelp and Papa Cristos popped up. So off I went to see what the hype was all about.. . It was last week... the week of finals! My friend and I came here 3 times in 1 week (and I live 12 miles away) ! 1st visit: we both had gyros. 2nd/ 3rd visit : we shared a gyro and the shrimp plate. The hummus is yummy too! Love the guava juice and baklava!. . On my 1st and 2nd visit... Â they gave us coupons for $1.50 off a sandwich or plate. So we came back and used it.. . We finally met Papa Cristo! He's super friendly! After talking stories with him, he ended up bringing the both of us his signature baklava with pudding dessert (I forgot the name). Talk about yummy! He even cleared out our rubbish off the table. I asked him what part of LA we were in and he said it is right next to Koreatown. In my opinion it's in the "rough on the edges" part of LA.. . Free parking in a private parking lot and enter from the back door. Indoor and outdoor seating. I like eating out on the patio. Order your food and tell them you want to sit in the patio and they will bring out your order to you.. . Meal for 2 is right under $25. Worth the drive and the money spent. Casual dining... plastic patio chairs and tables. (They served our shrimp on a plastic power puff girls plate.) They also sell greek food products. Lots of yummy desserts!. . This is the best greek spot I've ever been too!. . 5 stars for Papa Cristos! (Thanks Papa Cristos for the yummy dessert!) I'll be back as soon as I get back to LA from summer vacation! I'm a fan!
