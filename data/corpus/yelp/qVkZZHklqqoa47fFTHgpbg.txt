Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
Let me be clear: I hate Mexican food. With a passion. Always have, and probably always will.. . BUT -- and it's a big one -- this joint is jumpin', and I loved it!. . I'd go on a weekend night when it's buzzing in there with frenetic energy, and they're spinning the freebie wheel. I had a kick-ass margarita and some tasty soft tacos. make sure to get guacamole for the table, too, because it's some of the best I've had.. . Finally, I implore you: do NOT leave this restaurant without having the Mexico City Grilled Corn in lime mayo side dish. OMG - it is slap-yo-mama-twice good. They list it as a side, but order it with some chips for a starter and I guarantee you'll write later and thank me. :). . I had a blast here, and finally... a place where I can enjoy Mexican (to the extent possible for me).
