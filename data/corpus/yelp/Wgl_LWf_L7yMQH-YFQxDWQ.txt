Restaurant: Mr. Pizza
Category: Pizza
i really would have given this place a 5 star... but last time i went, i went with friends.  we were driving by when we saw a huge sign that said like 20% off pizzas etc on it... so we went in, i like their rustic potato gold pizzas anyway.  but when we went in, they said that the promotion was over the past week and that they could not honor that special.  . a few days later we drove by and they still had that sign up. i  would think if its driving the customers to come in to the restaurant either 1. honor the special or 2. take down the poster as soon as you realize that it is still up there... but they didnt do either.. . i have been going to mr.pizza for a while because of my love for sweet potato... i asked... practically begged them (i wrote the corporate office in korea for the sweet potato bread sticks and when i was in korea i went to mr. pizza there in myung dong and asked them to put in another request for the sweet potato breadsticks).. i think its paid off because last time i was there, they had it!  i just wish it wasnt as thin and hard.  i would prefer the breadsticks to be softer but no complaints here, they finally made one! :)
