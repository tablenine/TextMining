Restaurant: Sura Thai Bistro
Category: Thai
The vibe was completely different then any other Thai restaurant I've visited (very Austin Powers as other reviewers put it) and because of that I was hoping we'd get a unique twist on Thai food.  Unfortunately the décor was the only thing that separated Sura from other Thai places.  We had the steamed dumplings, lettuce wraps, Black Noodles, and the Udon Noodle Soup.  The presentation was good but taste wise the dishes didn't offer anything over any other Thai restaurant.   The service was ok (except our server had a hard time hearing over the music) and the prices were comparable to other Thai restaurants.  I think it would be a good place for an all-girl outing, but nothing about Sure would make me recommend it to a friend.
