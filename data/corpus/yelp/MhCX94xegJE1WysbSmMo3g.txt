I love coffee but I wouldn't say I'm a connoiseur. That said, the Hong Kong milk tea is yummy as is the Americano.  The cappucino is also lovely.  . . I'm a pretty basic bread and butter kinda gal - even though I'm a foodie. I judge based on the basic bread and butter service. LAMill does a great baguette and butter side dish that compliments the coffee well. . . I've seen people work through several cups of coffee there and I've seen old friends meet up. The decor may seem a bit much to a SoCal-er for a coffee shop, but it's really a great place to take time out of the day for yourself or with a few friends.  If not for the wonderful organic coffee menu, for the decor and ambiance.
