I'd give it 5 stars, but the wait is always ETERNAL. But that is a good sign of great food, isn't it? And my friends and I always wait.. . If ambience is more important to you than food, this is not the Katsu-ya for you....drive over the hill, get hair extensions, some press-on nails and off to Katsuya Hollywood you go!
