Had the surf-n-turf. Lobster and Fillet. Nice! Pricy and not fabulous mind you but nice.. . They don't have a large wine list and what they do have is pretty sub-par. Don't know if they allow BYOB but it would be good to ask. Pair the fairly decent food with some good wine and you'll have a good time.
