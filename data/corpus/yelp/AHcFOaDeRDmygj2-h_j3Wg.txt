If yelp had like a super 6th star for favorite places Katsu-Ya would get it. With so many reviews its hard to write something original and unique. But I don't care. This place is that good!. . Two dishes are a MUST... Creamy rock shrip tempura...*droool* and this dish I don't know what its called b/c a friend ordered it, but its like a rice thing with a jalepeno on the top. its SOOOOOO GOOOOD. Â This is the best sushi I have ever eaten too.. . I usually stick to the basics like tuna, salmon, or california rolls b/c well more exotic types are hit or miss. However Katsu-Ya is so great you can try anything on the menu and it'll be eatable. I've been to places where I've tried less common sushi and got sick. Here you can eat everything and not get sick! man oh man I wanna go back.. . Oh and famous people sit eat there. I saw the guy from X-men. You know Cyclopse. The whimpy guy... he was there with wife and child. Plus some American Idol guy. My friend noticed him. It was cool. . . Nice atmosphere AMAZING food and not bad prices. You gotta try it!!
