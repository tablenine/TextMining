Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
When it comes to pastrami I am there.  Yes, I have a thing for this particular sandwich.  So, I had eaten here just about a year ago.  Could not get this pastrami out of my mind. The price is way up there.  I mean like a $10.00 pastrami.  Well first off the meat is not chewy fat or greasy.  It is tender.  This sandwich could be shared....but not when I am having one. I ate the whole thing and I am under 115.  I like that the mustard is on the table so you can make it your way.  The fries are okay, but I am not a fry fan so what do I know.  I really did not care for the onion rings.  A litle on the over fried side. The place is cash only.  They have an outdoor patio and a cool fire in the middle that is lit on the cold days.
