I had lunch here with my boss and a client. I don't eat a lot of sushi, but the client frequents this place and ordered for everyone. I was impressed. Just about everything I tried was terrific. The yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos was probably my favorite, with the warm crab rolls and spicy tuna on crispy rice close seconds. It all melted like butter in my mouth. The only one I didn't care for was the sea bass.. . The menu would have been tricky to figure out if I had been there by myself, but the prices were reasonable, the service unobtrusive and prompt, the atmosphere pleasant (if a bit forgettable), and the food incredible.
