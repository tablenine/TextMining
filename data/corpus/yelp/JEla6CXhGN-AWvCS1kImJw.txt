Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Alcove is owned by the same folks who own the lovely Aroma coffehouse in Studio City (Tujunga Village). . . While the quality of the coffees, teas, baked goods, breakfast and lunch fare are exactly the same as Aroma, parking at this location is really a nightmare. . . It's a great addition to the neighborhood, if you live in the neighborhood, but if you're driving, there are a lot of other quaint, comfortable places with great food that I'd reccommend as an alternative. . . But not under Alcove's listing. Because that would be tacky.
