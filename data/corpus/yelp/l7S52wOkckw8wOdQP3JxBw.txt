I know, they name is a bit kitchy and it may be off the beaten path, but it is worth it!  There is always a line of people waiting, but it moves pretty fast.  One day, I got there before they were open and there was already a line!  . . Freshly made soups, salads and sandwiches all with a gourmet  sophistication that make them outstanding.  I have not had soup from the soup Nazi in NY, but I am assuming that Souper Jenny is just as good if not better and the staff is wonderful; you can tell that they enjoy what they do.  Make sure to take cash because they don't take cards and there is not an ATM within walking distance.
