Update - still super tastay! I ate dinner here last night.... . I totally ordered the Beef Bowl cut, medium, with sauteed mushrooms, mashed potatoes, creamed corn, creamed spinach, the salad and two diet cokes.  Oh and had the tasty meatballs and chips in the lounge as appetizers before being seated.  So good.. . Strangely enough I weighed myself today and I weigh a pound less than yesterday.  I dunno what's up with that...  I guess if you want to lose weight on a tasty diet, order what I did.
