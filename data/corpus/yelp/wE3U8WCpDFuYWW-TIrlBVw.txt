Restaurant: Green Zebra
Category: Vegetarian
2.5 stars to be exact.. . I'm a vegetarian with meat-eating friends/relatives, this place was suggested to me by my Mother who is always on the look out for restaurants I may enjoy. . . My Mother, best friend and I were excited to give the Green Zebra a try, the decor is rather lovely and the service is above average...........but the food............. . The food is nothing to write home about, nothing hearty, nothing amazing, nothing I would ever order again. One should be warned that the chefs there feel their food is an art(which is fine) and very rarely will they allow sustitutions or serve a dish sans an ingredient. While I deeply respect the art of others, on a personal level I often wish to have my meal served a certain way, with or without a certain ingredient and not being allowed to do that does not endear me to an eating establishment. Also I must warn others that the average adult would need about 3-4 dishes to create a filling meal.......leading to a very expensive bill at the end of the evening. Having not known this, we all went to the Cheesecake Factory for dessert/a snack afterwards.. . The Green Zebra is an expensive, trendy place. As a 20-something student, I would rather spend my money at The Chicago Dinner and leave full and relaxed than pay for atmosphere and decor.
