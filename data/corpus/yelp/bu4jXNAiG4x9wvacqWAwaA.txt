Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I want this location of Father's Office to improve, not go away, because their burgers, as widely touted, are delicious. The need for a friendly tavern in this area is strong. And my willingness to drive all the way to Santa Monica and fight the hordes at their primary location is nil. That said, I have an issue with paying $7.50 for sweet potato fries (however tasty). And there's something about this operation always leaves me cold. I can't put my finger on it, but it could be a ratio of attitude:value. And in a tavern...that's bad. Work on it, Father's Office. I'm going to check back on you soon.
