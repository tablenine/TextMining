daikokuya over orochon for me. spicy challenge feels a little gimmicky, but like the spice level descriptors.... guess you can't compare the two directly though. here had a giant bowl of . shio 6 with pork, egg, bamboo, sprouts. (some of the additional toppings are already included, so don't need to add onions, etc.). wait is usally long but if you come before 12, it's pretty quick
