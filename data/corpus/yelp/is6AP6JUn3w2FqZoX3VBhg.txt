Order the big half-yard glass once for the novelty of it: and then stick to pints. Unless you really like pouring beer down your chest. . . The beer selection is awesome, and unlike other places with HUGE beer selections, they always have their menu items available.. . Service is pretty decent, and so's the food... neither are amazing though.
