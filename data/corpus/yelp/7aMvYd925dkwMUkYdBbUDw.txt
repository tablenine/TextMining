I've been here probably 20 times since my last review and it never really disappoints.  Service is usually pretty quick and the waitresses are very nice and attentive.  I've only been here for weekday lunches and it's rarely packed to the point where you have to wait at all.. . The Wednesday A-B $5.40 lunch combo is really tough to beat in the area.  You start out with some miso soup and then get a bowl of beef and radish along with a plate of macaroni salad, tempura, lettuce, and small portion of cold noodles.  I've also had the Nabeyaki Udon and it's probably one of the better ones I've tried in Little Tokyo (Oomasa's is pretty good too).. . Cheap sit down restaurant with good food in the heart of Little Tokyo.  Not much more you can ask for.
