I had my birthday parties a Tank three years (?) ago - friends planned it, and while I remember very little (too much SAKI!) I vaguely remember having a truly fabulous birthday. . . When I had the opportunity to go again, I jumped at the chance. It wasn't as great as my memory. Maybe that's because I didn't get an ipod this time as a gift. . . The wine was decent, the service was passable, the maki tasty and the ambience fun and trendy. But for $110 for 2 people, I expect to be wowed. . . Im interested to try the 1/2 price on weekends - seems like it'd be a great/more reasonable value for what you get.
