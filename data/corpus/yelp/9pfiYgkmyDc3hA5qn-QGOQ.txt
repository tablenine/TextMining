I just came back from brunch here.  Yes, they do have a small brunch menu.  Mostly omelettes, but today's special was some sort of french toast.. . I had the crab and spinach omelette, which was good.  The potato griddle cakes that came with it were FANTASTIC.  I could've had a meal just out of those.  It also came with a small fruit salad and a cinnamon twist, so you get a lot of food for your money.  . . My friend had the crab melt sandwich, which she really liked.  It was a good portion of crab for the money you pay.  It came with some rather bland fries and yucky coleslaw.. . Our waiter was weird - Michael was his name.  he'd disappear for ages at a time and then hover incessantly over the table.  I paid my $23 bill with $30 in cash, and he didn't bring any change back.  Yes, I was going to tip him, but I thought it was very rude for him to presume that he was getting a $7 tip.  That alone makes me not want to come back.
