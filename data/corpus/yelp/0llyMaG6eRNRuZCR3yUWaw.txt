Restaurant: Green Zebra
Category: Vegetarian
My favorite restaurant in the city. Unique flavor combinations, fresh ingredients, delicious food. Every bite of everything I've ever eaten there has been some sort of mouth adventure.. . Not the bad kind of adventure where you wake up in jail with a headache and a new tattoo... the good kind of adventure that culminates in you taking a photograph that you'll frame and put on a wall somewhere in your house. Then, when you walk by the photo, sometimes it will catch your eye and you'll pause, for just a moment, to remember what a fantastic time you had that day.. . Please note: I've never taken a photo of myself (or any of the food) at Green Zebra.
