___UPDATE___  7/21/09. . I moved back to the neighborhood so I now I wind up at Daily Bar a lot more often.  Out of all of the bars around here with food this is still my favorite.  Check out their turkey burger...it really makes you not miss beef at all.  It's all smokey and delicious.  The corn dogs for kids are a big hit.  The sloppy joes are fantastic and the southwestern salad (I can't remember the name) is so good that men like it too!. . ________________________Original post_________. . I don't go as often as I used to...and the last time I went it was really crowded and not as nice...but I've had some great meals here.  Their portions are huge - maybe too big but that's ok.  I love their burgers and I substitute out the house salad for fries (that dressing is my favorite).  Their grilled cheese is awesome.  Their chili is great.  Their fries are abundant and huge.  Their nachos are gigantic and great.  I know I'd have other things there that I thought were great too.  I thought the mac n' cheese wasn't that awesome and I'd get the fish &amp; chips down the street instead but seriously, this place is really tasty and I'm pretty sure it's non-smoking now which was nice.
