After first hearing about this new Korean taco craze a year ago, I FINALLY found the truck with a short line (20mins). I tried their chicken, short rib, and spicy pork.  While they were all pretty decent, my fav was the spicy pork.  If I ever come across the truck again, i'm going straight for the spicy pork burrito. This week there was talk of a special pacman burger with all 3 meats paying tribute to the pacquiao x cotto fight. Unfortunately, I didn't see it at the truck I found. Sorry SFand SD, kogi is only available in LA for now.
