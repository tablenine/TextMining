Ok, This was my second time to Houstons and I just cannot get over the price...expensive for what you get.. . I was also disappointed with the service at this location.  My tea was empty most of the lunch.  I asked for dipping sauce for my fries and they never came.  We had to ask other servers for service and that disappointed them since they were busy.. . $50. for lunch for 2 people (2 sandwiches, 2 fries, 2 iced teas) is crazy unless you have the service to back it...they don't!
