Pretty bad sushi for a place with a japanese name.  Bowl of ramen should be avoided at all costs.  Instant ramen would be better.  Spider roll wasn't cooked all the way through.  Tempura platter looked like an Awesome Blossom, but that's not really awesome in this context.  Food took forever to come out.  I will not return here.  wow, i can't believe how bad this was.
