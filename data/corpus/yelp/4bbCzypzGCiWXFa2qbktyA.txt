Sadly, as a vegetarian there is only so much I have been able to eat here so far. BUT I know that they have recently received their vegetarian brats and can't wait to try them. I have bought and enjoyed their fries with the unbeatable dips multiple times--curry ketchup, chipotle aeoli, garlic parmesan mayo. Yum. The beers are all interesting and tasty (great variety!). The only bummer is for Muslims/Jews who don't eat pork--they definitely use pork casings, but will apparently use lamb for some in the future!
