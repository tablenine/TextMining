Love, love, love this place.  Went here last night with a Groupon and a friend.  Not only was I so excited that the weather was nice enough to sit outside in April, but I hadn't had a really fabulous meal in a while.  The place is super cute when you walk in and you know you're about to have a great meal.  . . We started off with the Saint Germain cocktail.  I think it's my new favorite drink.  I wish I knew how to make cocktails because I would make that all the time.  For appetizers we split the wild leek soup and the scallops.  The soup was fantastic.  I like a soup that has no cream and can still be rich and flavorful (at least it didn't seem to have cream).  The scallops were also rich and creamy and perfectly cooked.  They do come out with this foam on top, and my friend's initial reaction was "hmm, scallops with spit."   That's literally what it looked like.  Luckily it tasted so much better than it looked, but I think they should stop putting that stuff on it.  It ruins the presentation of what I have to assume would otherwise be a beautiful dish.  . . Moving on to entrees - I ordered the skate and she ordered the fluke.  Both were amazing.  I can't tell you which one was better so I would say you just have to order both.  We also split a bottle of white wine which was the cheapest on the menu, but still very tasty.. . I think this may be my only 5-star review so that tells you what I thought of this place.  I can see how it could be considered a bit pricey, but having the Groupon made it seem just right.  We each paid about 60 bucks and felt like we got our money's worth.  One thing to note though is that I wouldn't recommend sitting upstairs.  I went to the restroom after our meal and was very happy that I wasn't seated up there.  It didn't have the same light, airy atmosphere.  I would love to come again and sit outside!
