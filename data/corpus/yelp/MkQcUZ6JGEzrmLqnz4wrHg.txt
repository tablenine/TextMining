Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
the sashimi tuna dip at ping pong is one of the most delicious things i've ever eaten.  and the margaret cho's chicken is wonderful every time.. . the service here can be so aloof at times that it's almost funny.  my servers usually never even acknowledge my existence.  i mean, he'll take my order, bring my food, etc., but i'm pretty sure the whole time he's just thinking to himself  "wow, i'm so beautiful and thin... wait, who are these people?... ewww, whatever"  . . so, i usually get takeout.  and it's delicious.
