I saw a sign for Sunday Brunch when I passed by this place and thought it might be a nice change from the norm.  Things went bad from the very beginning.  First, we had to pay to park across the street, there may be street parking, but it is nowhere in the vicinity.  Second, don't plan on coming casual or wearing a hat without asked to change your clothes or take off your hat and being made to feel out of place.  Third, there was nobody else in the restaurant, so I guess maybe other people figured out this place was bad before me.  Fourth, the brunch menu is very limited and the portions you get for the price they charge are way too small. Asian influenced brunch = not so good.
