I'd been wanting to check out La La's for quite some time now... Every time I drive by it always looks so packed, warm and inviting. The outdoor patio is perfect - location wise and and in respects to the ambiance. Anyways, it was more than what I was expecting - to be honest, I didn't really know what to expect. The food was excellent, especially for the dollar (It was a lot less expensive than I'd imagined). I mean you can get a great, huge meal - marinated chicken/steak, tasty rice/french fries/salad, salsa for around $12.You also get the bread and dipping sauce that everyone has mentioned which is good. Pair it all up with an imported south american beer and you're set. Food tasted fresh, service was on point (didn't hurt that she was cute too) and it was nice just being out on the patio taking it all in with everyone else. . . if you're looking for a good meal at a decent price in a great location look no further. . . street parking can be a tricky one though
