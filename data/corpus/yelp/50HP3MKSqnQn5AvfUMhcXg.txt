Pros: Yummy, fresh sushi - awesome huge bowl of sunomono with shrimp. Super fresh tasty scallop sushi. Friendly staff. Inexpensive - a GREAT deal for the price!. . Cons: Cash only, busy, doesn't take reservations.. . The menu is short, but just try anything on it. It's seriously good. They have most of the usual sushi and rolls (except the ridiculous american rolls with cream cheese - ugh. Thankfully they don't do the americanized rolls).
