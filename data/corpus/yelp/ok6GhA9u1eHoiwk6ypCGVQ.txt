Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Good Burgers on both my visits, but the third visit we were met with indifferent service, or rather none as we walked out due to not being acknowledge by staff and we think owner. Plus the A/C was off and it was scorching hot inside. Owner appears arrogant.
