The flavors of the food here are incredibly complex and delicious.  I was wonderfully surprised that even on the first visit, they would trust me when I asked for "very hot" and it came out that way.  Most restaurants don't trust their patrons on that issue.  Opart didn't even ask me if I was sure.  I appreciated that.. . I had the Tod Mun and the panang curry.  Both get A++ for the meat.  I was only a little disappointed that there were not a bit more vegetables in the curry.  But all in all, I'm very impressed and will be back often, I'm sure.
