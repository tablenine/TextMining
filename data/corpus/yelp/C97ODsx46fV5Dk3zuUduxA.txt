Bloody Marys... DUCK Benedict off their special menu Was AWESOME!!! French press coffee?? TASTY! Bloody Marys.... FAB... I like pickles in mine but that is maybe just me.... . This place is cute.... intimate.... perfect really for a coffee shop and I was surprised at the food offerings! . Not one person disliked their food. We all loved it and i loved the creativity that was put in to their dishes! Service was stellar.... I wish this was just up the block from my place! I had a great meal great drink and it was poppin! . Soooo glad we had a reservation!
