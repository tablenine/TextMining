Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Dropped by Alcove to pick up some desserts on the way home from the Griffith Observatory. The cute little patio seemed welcoming; different story on the inside! The place was cramped and everyone was all up in my personal space. Nothing behind the counter was labeled, so I was pointing to everything I wanted, hoping it wasn't cheesecake (one of my palate's sworn enemies). It was so crowded and hectic I didn't even bother to ask what anything was. After it took them forever to ring me up, I grabbed my bag and got the hell out of there. When I finally got to eat the stuff, I was pretty disappointed (flavor, where are you?). It was like eating $6 blocks of wax. Ugh, never again...
