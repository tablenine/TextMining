Huge portions and decent carne asada and shrimp.  The fried whole red snapper is great!  Chips and salsa were good and much different than most other places in Chicago.  The margarita was a bit weak and too sweet, almost tasted like lemonade.  Overall a good experience, though I would stick with beer.
