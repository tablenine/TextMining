Went there for a night out to have some BBQ. We have explored other places before and felt that it was time for variation. They have a good bar and a great selection of beer. The servers have character and are great fun. . . We went there on a week where they had a special offer, so it was very busy. However the meat was barely eatable. The meat was charred not grilled. It does not take an expert to see that it was too much and really not suited for human consumption. One of the dishes were replaced, but overall this was not much of an experience. . . There are many great BBQ places in Atlanta and they need to step it up if they want to be in the game.
