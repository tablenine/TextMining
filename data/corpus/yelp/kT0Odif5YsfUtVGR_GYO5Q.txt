Versailles, who?  . . A friend of ours took us to this place years ago after we couldn't get a table at Versailles.  Since then, 9 out of 10 times, we usually hit up Gloria's vs. Versailles.  . . The Pollo Jerez is delicious.  It was the first dish I had there, and it was sole factor that got me hooked on this place.  But eating off of my friend's plates over the years, I can safely say that everything out of that kitchen is pretty darn good. . . The wait staff is super nice.  Gloria can be a bull sometimes, but it's her place, so don't piss her off and you'll get treated warmly.  She never uses a pen/pad to write down our orders, and she's always had our orders right.  Again, it's her place, she knows her restaurant inside and out. . . The next time you're thinking of hitting up Versailles, save yourself the wait, go east 100yds,  and check out Gloria's.  You'll be glad you did.
