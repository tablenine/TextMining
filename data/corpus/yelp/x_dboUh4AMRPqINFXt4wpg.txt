Pancakes Pancakes and more Pancakes... HUGE portions... all choices delicious! Definitely makes sense for you to run about 20 miles or even better, perhaps break in a quick Iron Man session before heading to breakfast here. Did I mention the pancakes yet? Delicious. Went with a large group and everyone enjoyed their pancakes. French toast was good too. The lighter eaters could definitely split one plate of pancakes, but I doubt anyone does. French press coffee is great and the service was too. Outside seating is ok, but a bit noisy and from Sunset and please don't mind the folks skulking nearby, waiting patiently for their table and the start of their own pancake feast. Definitely come here if you haven't and enjoy some pancakes.
