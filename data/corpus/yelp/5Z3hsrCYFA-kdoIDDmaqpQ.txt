So this is what it feels like to be underwhelmed! The best part of this experience was actually the lone appetizer on the menu - the tapanot. A kind of deconstructed tapenade, it was fun and tasty. Plus I've always been a fan of customizable diy food. The rest of the meal was, well, blah. The cocktails were the biggest problem - the only common denominator was that none were up to par. Beer was pretty good though. And the pizza (I refuse to call them flatbreads) was fine, but nothing amazing. Maybe it's because they have the tagline of producing organic pizza, I've found that most places that try and put a twist on a classic always fall a bit flat. Too many fantastic pizza joints in this city to spend time munching at Crust.
