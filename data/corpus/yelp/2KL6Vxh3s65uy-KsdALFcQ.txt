G-dang. Maybe I had N. Southport all wrong.. . Naaah. This place is just really good. I'm still getting a lil' hot and bothered thinking about the mash that accompanied my boyfriend's pork tenderloin. Jaysus benedictus rectus hosanna in the highest father son and the holy ghost blessed virgin fruit of thy womb and so forth. TASTY.. . Places like this make me get The Grossies. You know what I'm talking about. That couple in the restaurant that sits on the same side of the booth, shares all their food - may as well only have one fork for the entire table. So here I am, holding hands across the table, making gratuitous sangria toasts, coy smiling, giggling, enjoying live jazz quartet but all the while thinking to myself.. . "I am the kind of person I would want to punch in my own restaurant.". . Shit man, I don' give a FUCK. I am having a great time at Coobah. I just ate a diver scallop the size of a hockey puck. I'm slugging this sangria pitcher like it's a juice box. I got Sexxxy McBerfday sitting across from me. It's dark and there's a warm breeze blowing in. I feel like I'm on vacation. Mama likee.
