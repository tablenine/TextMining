Restaurant: Taka Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
So my husband has been reading this blog, Sushi&amp;passion, that's written by Taka. Taka owns a tiny sushi restaurant in buckhead where he is owner, head chef, and head sushi chef. We decided to pay him a visit and do the Omakasae. Omakasae is where we ask the head chef to prepare whatever he feels like to give us a feel of how good his restaurant is. So, we had I think it was 6 dishes brought out one by one, of raw fish, fish salads, cooked lamb, and cooked fish. Finished with a chocolate mousse. It was beautifully presented, looked like high end restaurant presentations. But the atmosphere was quiet, it's a very very small restaurant, but so quaint inside. The Oolong tea that he suggested to us was wonderful. It's the only brand that he drinks. We went out to the store and bought some for ourselves. It really is great quality. So my hubby had an absolute blast there and says he's ruined for anywhere else. The sushi and sashimi was that spectacular, the service was wonderful, Taka is talkative, he goes and sits with customers who are regulars, and knows most people by name. It was over all a good experience and I will enjoy going back.. . I post pictures of the dishes and descriptions on my blog, so please feel free to see what we actually ate there. The food really is amazing!
