Category: Pizza
When I think about this place, the first thing that comes to mind is their longstanding refusal to accept credit cards.  I can't think of any reason why they are so obstinate, nor have I been given one by the staff or in-store signage.  Therefore, I'd just classify this issue as an annoyance purposely uncured by the management.. . Second in my mind is the long lines of people always hanging around outside, waiting for a table.  I've been here twice and have never personally waited in those lines, but just the sight of them keeps me from going back.. . Third in my mind is the food, it was just ok.
