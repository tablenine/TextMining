Pushing 300 reviews, so really, this review is for just for ME!!  (But I suppose if you haven't already gotten enough tips or heard enough praise from the other reviews, you can read this one, too...see? I can share.). . Things I like about Over Easy:. . * SUPER energetic greeting (particularly appreciated after coming from the DMV). . *Very good coffee--and if you come while there's a wait, they'll give you some to help keep ya happy--and refills are always plentiful. . *Sassy eggs.  For a girl who is very sick of eating eggs all the time, these restore my faith that eggs can actually be really darned tasty.. . *Banana rum cream french toast thingy.   MMmmm!  French toast? Good.  Bananas and rum? Even better.  Pastry cream-type filling thing?  We've hit the tri-fecta ladies and gents.  Sheer French toast bliss.. . *Blueberry crunch pancakes?  Don't absolutely loooove the cinnamon spice with them (maybe in the butter?), but all in all, a very solid, well-executed dish.. . When it comes down to it, eating at Over Easy just makes me really happy (especially when we come on the weekdays and there's no wait!  Yippeeeee!).  Definitely the leader of the Chicago brunch pack.
