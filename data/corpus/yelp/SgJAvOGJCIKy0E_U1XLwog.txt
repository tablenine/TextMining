We came here to try the DineLA Restaurant Week menu, but was tempted by their brunch menu, which means we'll definitely have to come back. We ordered the Winter Citrus Salad and the Sturgeon Confit for the first course. The sturgeon was interesting, fun, and the leeks made the dish memorable. The salad was fresh and full of flavor. I'm not a big salad person, but this is something I'd order again (and pay full price). For the main course, we got the Fish and Chips, which was outstanding. It came with fried cod, fried asparagus, french fries and onion rings, which were all perfectly fried and surprisingly light and not greasy. We also got the Artichoke Risotto which was rich and hearty and better than most risottos I've tried. The dessert was great with Chocolate Covered Cream Pulls with Toberlone ice cream and Butterscotch Pudding. Those cream puffs were awesome and would put Beard Papas to shame. And I need to find where they sell Toberlone ice cream because it was incredible. The pudding was a fairly big portion and was smooth and creamy and just delicious. I also want to mention the great service we had with a very attentive waiter and a plethora of people to clear our table, refill our drinks, and just check in on us. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the quality of food and felt the prix menu was a good bargain.
