For my first Yelp review, I shall write about a Chicago favorite of mine, Rodan. . . What's not to love? The food is excellent. I come to this place exclusively for the Tempura Green Beans and $3 Lychee Royals on Monday. Mondays are also fun for another reason; grab a window seat and watch all the inappropriately-dressed underage gals skip to Rehab at Debonair, just down the street. Don't get me wrong, I go to Rehab now and then, but Rodan is the perfect escape...a pseudo-Japanese oasis in the middle of Milwaukee Ave.. . They also carry some amazing brews and while the liquor selection is not vast, they have what I like: St. Germain's Elderflower Liqeur and Hendrick's Gin. And for some reason the PBR always tastes sweet here; it's on tap which I guess explains it. . . The Togarashi Burger is heavenly...a fine patty of beef (or ground-up vegetables, I've had both) covered in sprouts and a tangy Asian sauce. My friends are partial to the Wasabi-dusted fries as a side, but I prefer paying for the 'bean upgrade.. . Late at night everyone here may or may not be on drugs, which may or may not explain the one-seater locking bathrooms. But I think it's all part of the atmosphere. Rodan is five-star to me.
