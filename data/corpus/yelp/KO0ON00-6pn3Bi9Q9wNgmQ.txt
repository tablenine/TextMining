I realized that I uploaded a photo of a salad, while my old review was for a "chickin" burger, which might be confusing. The salad pictured was from one of my return visits, and thank goodness I gave in to my good side and ordered that instead of my standard order. The All Hail Kale salad is now the standard I will henceforth use to measure all other salads. It was a perfectly-balanced mixture of ginger papaya dressing, kale (marinated in the dressing, to lessen the natural toughness of the green), red cabbage, roasted corn salsa and walnuts (I added the blackened chickin for a couple of bucks). Â It was so good that I busted out some Interneting skills to find the recipe and make it at home... while it turned out good enough to satisfy my craving for that week, I will most definitely venture back to VG to get the real deal.
