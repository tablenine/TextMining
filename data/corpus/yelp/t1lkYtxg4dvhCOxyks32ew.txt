This is the place where my love for authentic ramen began. I love this place. The wait is usually at least half an hour or so, but it's worth it. Their thick pork cuts on top of the noodles with the bamboo shoots? Oh and I can't forget their hard boiled egg in there. Can it be any more scrumptious? And their combination plates are delicious. And I've never had problems with their customer service, ever. (My count to this place is more than the digits on my hands and toes.) . . Best time to come here, when it's raining. Regardless of the time and weather, there will always be a wait. But I've been here a couple of times when it was raining and the taste just sang to me. It was lovely. :). . Bathroom 3/5 A bit dirty but I'll settle for it.
