Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I don't get the hype.. . The wait is long, the place is TINY, the service isn't that splendid, and the best part of the meal is that they bring the toast out before the main dish.. . My omelet was up to par, but definitely not something to write home about.  And I couldn't stand all the screaming kids -- early may beat the lines, but it means you're dining with young families, and that's not my thing.  At all.
