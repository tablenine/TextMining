Heard this place from a friend of mine and what attracted me even more was the fact that it was opened by the inventor of Koji truck!. . Location/parking: pretty close to the 10 freeway, avoid traffic hours if possible.  It was a bit difficult to find since is located in a small plaza.  Parking can be difficult since it is in a small plaza. You can try parking near the neighborhood but be aware of parking restriction if any!. . Service/Selection/Prices: self serve place, you order whatever you want and they will give you a number and you are responsible for your own seats.  Line wasn't long when i went though and that was a friday afternoon!  Limited seats available, recommend one person ordering and other person grabbing the table. Price was fair!. . Ordered: pork belly bowl, grilled asparagus, and korean bbq bowl. One of the biggest flaw of their rice bowl is that the rice was     wayyyyy toooooo soooooggggyyyy.  Especially when you dig into the bottom of the bowl, the rice taste like porridge.  When the rice bowl has nasty rice texture, you know they failed.  The pork belly wasn't as succulent as i imagines.  I personally find it a big tough and not easy to chew.  Although the meat and rice was just ok, the side condiment paired well with the dish.  The grilled asparagus was just ok, nothing special about it.  The korean bbq bowl was a bit better than the pork belly because the meat was more tender and juicy.  The rice, again, taste the same.  Didn't order anything to drink except water since i didn't see anything special about their drink selection.. . Overall, I think Koji truck is still way better.  I know the owner is trying to invent a different type of cheap korean/fusion dish, but this one fail to exceed customer's expectation after koji.  Definitely need great improvement on the way they cook their rice.
