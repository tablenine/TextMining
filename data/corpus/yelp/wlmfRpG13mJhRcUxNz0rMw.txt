I only went in for drinks but this place was a great place to hang out, the atmosphere was friendly, there was a great assortment of beers to try and the service was great. Â  Plus the shuffle board table is awesome!. . I live in the neighborhood and I'm happy there is a place to go, and watch sporting events. I realize this might not be for everyone around here but its a nice option when all you want to do is chill on a weekend afternoon and take in your favorite team.
