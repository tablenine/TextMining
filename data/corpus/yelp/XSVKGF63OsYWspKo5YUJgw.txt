Restaurant: The Varsity
Category: Fast Food
It's been many many years since I've been to the Varsity, but I didn't have Yelp then either...  I appreciate the history and tradition behind this place, the fact that it has lasted through the years and is still a well known spot in the city.  However....  ew.  . . I wasn't impressed when I was a kid, wasn't impressed when I was 18-ish, and  would never consider stopping here again if I were in Atlanta.  I guess one of the main draws to this place is the fact that you can get chili slopped on just about anything, but me personally I just like a plain hamburger.  Ketchup and mustard only.  So seeing as I only got meat and bread, I was actually able to taste what was not great quality food.  If I"m gonna eat fast food hamburgers, I would go to Wendy's or Burger King over the Varsity, no question.  Fries are unremarkable.  Actually, what is remarkable is that I have such vivid memories of this oh-so-gross meal more than 10 years later.  . . Just about the only recommendation I can make is to go, get a milkshake, and enjoy the bustling atmosphere, the hard-working burger flippers, the "what'll ya haves," and then leave and eat someplace else.
