Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but when I do get it, I usually get chicken enchiladas - which is one of m favorite dishes ironically.. . This place has the BEST chicken enchiladas! The mole is not heavy and bitter like a lot of Mexican places I have been to. The tortillas are fresh, as you can see them being made. If I'm ever feeling like Mexican...there is no other place for me!. . BTW, the chile con queso rocks!!! . . 4 stars for Uncle Julio's!
