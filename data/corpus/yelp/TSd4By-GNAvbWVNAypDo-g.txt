I haven't written a Yelp review in a long time.  Actually, I haven't written a Yelp review in eons.. . I've been meaning to get back to the keyboard.  And the first place to come to mind is Daikokuya.. . This ain't no Top Ramen.  The ramen is cooked just right - "al dente", if you will.  And the soup and pork are delicious.. . A couple of side notes:. a) Yes, you usually have to wait.. b) If you go here during the summer, it is bloody hot inside.. c) The teriyaki chicken, something I usually avoid, is quite good - not the afterthought of a dish most restaurants generally throw onto the menu to appease finicky, unadventurous Caucasian patrons.  The chicken is fried and covered with a very nice sauce, served piping hot.  They say on the menu that it's how it is done in Tokyo - never had teriyaki chicken in Tokyo so I can't provide any assurance on that one, but I can confirm that it is good.
