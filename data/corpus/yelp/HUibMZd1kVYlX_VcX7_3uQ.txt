Sigh . . . . this place is so good!  There are times that I crave some of the items from here late into the night.  . . I can't get that foie gras or Chinese pork buns out of my mind.  Then there's the fish and chips with that pickled watermelon rind that just hits the spot, or the very delicious duck, and the steak that's cooked to perfection.  . . Then there are all the desserts - zeppoli's, tarts, ice creams, tempura figs . . . all divine! . . Whatever the seasonal menu, you can't really go wrong with anything.  Sometimes I want to walk straight into the kitchen and thank him for such tasty food!
