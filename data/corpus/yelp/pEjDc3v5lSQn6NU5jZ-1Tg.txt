a fantastic pizza joint...but so expensive.  It's brick fire style.  I wish they would put some more cheese and pizza sauce.  Pizzas in New York are still better (and cheaper! yes NY cheaper then LA?  unheard of!), but this place serves good food.  Try the chicken liver (yes I said it).  My friend ordered it and i was a little upset because I thought it was going to be disgusting, but to my pleasant surprise, delicious.  It is Mario Battali's and someone else's spot, so its good.  They had a cab blended w/ a merlot wine that was probably THE best red wine I have ever consumed.  It's called Joe's Rosso.  Take a date!
