Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Hey Phillipes, I got a bone  to pick with you.  Fire your power hungry rent-a-cops, who, instead of welcoming you into your historically rich establishment, choose to be A-holes and dick around with your customers at your parking lot.  Getting out of my car and walking three steps in the opposite direction of the restaurant DOESN'T mean I'm looking to leech off of the parking lot and loiter around Chinatown.  These lame rent-a-cops even peered into the windows to check if we were actually "customers." . . Enough ranting.  As Will Ferrell says, "EVERYBODY LOVE EVERYBODY"  That's the way it should be here, (except for the parking po pos).  A really diverse place full of young and old, rich and poor, all ethnicities.  Sometimes it feels like a cafe to me, sometimes it feels like a prison sitting at the wood benches cafeteria style.  . . I especially love the Lamb dip sandwich and pickles.  Price is cheap for some things, but it can get over $10 if you order a hearty meal.  I'm sure back in the heyday you'd be spending less than 20 cents here.  Stinkin' inflation!
