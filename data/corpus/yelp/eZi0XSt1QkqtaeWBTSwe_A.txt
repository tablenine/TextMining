The absolute best taro slush! They use real taro at the bottom of the drink and then the fake purple taro slush for the top 80% and it is an excellent combination. My wife loves their mango yogurt drink and their grape slush is always good. They really make great drinks which is surprising because they focus on being a restaurant and not a cafe. Their drinks are almost a meal in itself so keep that in mind if you are eating as well.. . The food is standard Taiwanese cafe with fair sized portions and quick service. Take-out is especially popular here and I can see why since there is always a wait for dinner and the parking lot is crowded.. . They stop taking orders at 9:30 PM which is unfortunate if you are craving a late night drink.
