Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery

Before coming here, you need to know several things: 1) there is valet parking in the back accessible via a tiny single-lane driveway, 2) the  cake portions are huge; you should get your own slice only if you and your mate come to an impasse, 3) it's crowded, 4) it's kind of on the expensive side.. . It's the type of place where you wait in line, order at the counter, jockey for an open table, and position your placard holder in way that the server can find you. If it wasn't for the brown Alcove t-shirts, you wouldn't be able to tell the customers from the employees since both exude hipness, piercings, and that carefully orchestrated disheveled look.. . My fiance and I only had a gigantic slice of cake, a cheese plate- it was very good, but the counter help that night wasn't familiar with the cheese selection, darn them-  and espresso drinks, the type of which I can't remember.  . . That said, Alcove is a really cute, cottage-like place with outdoor seating in front, under the trees and Christmas lights, and an outdoor patio on the south side of the cafe. If you sit inside, there's a table towards the back with a chessboard top and drawers stuffed with little notes  and random thoughts written by past diners and left for your voyeuristic pleasure. . . I'd definitely like to go back and try their food sometime.
