Brett Schulte says: Found this great place on Yelp, I'm a new enthusiastic customer!  Have to start by disagreeing with the negative review I read from Max W...there's nothing sweet on the burger, I even asked the waiter because you scared me.  The sweetest thing is the grilled tomato.  Also, the bun wasn't greasy at all, though it's brushed with clarified butter it didn't stand out to me.. . I'm a burger geek, and I loved the place, instantly in my top five (though my current favorite is the Kobe sliders at Provecho downtown). But I digress.... . Everything was excellent here, burger, fries and onion rings.  No beer, but you can bring it in from the liquor store across the street for a $5 corkage fee... "unless it's cheap beer like Bud Light - then no charge".  Um... OK?. . There are only two waiters (it's a small place) that share tables but they both were knowledgeable and friendly.  Way better than the Father's Office attitude.. . Only down side is the "bar" seating in their tiny side dining room.  Picture a small bedroom, with four tables, then add to that seating facing the wall.  Crowded, uncomfortable, and even the staff hates it.  Dumb... fix it guys, oh and open that back patio!. . EDIT:  Second visit 5/19, different waiters, not liking them as much.  Still thinking about stealing their cool salt shaker (they really only have one?).  Tried the Port &amp; Stilton burger (yum), the 3 Pork burger (still yum), but the fries were portioned too small and tasted under cooked.  Place needs music.
