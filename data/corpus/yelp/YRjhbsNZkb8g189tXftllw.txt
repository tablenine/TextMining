Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
After hearing lots of good reviews about this place and finding out it was relatively close, JT and I finally made a stop in early one Saturday morning. They'd just opened so everything was fresh and it was fantastic. I tried both the fish and the shrimp and they were both good, just depending on what you were craving at the moment. I love how you can add condiments and toppings to your liking. . . The key I think is to go during a bit of an off-time so it's freshly made. JT said he had gone before and was unimpressed with the shrimp, and I think it was because it may have been sitting out a bit, if they were busy and frying in larger batches. . . Right after, we drove to a Del Taco and shared one of their fish tacos for comparison (hey, it's equal opportunity) and BFTE is definitely better ... just FYI haha.
