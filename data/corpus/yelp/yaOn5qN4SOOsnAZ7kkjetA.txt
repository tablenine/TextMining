Restaurant: Rose Angelis
Category: Italian
Five years I lived in Chicago and never made it to Rose Angelis.  Finally, this past week,  I took my client there while visiting.  The building is very deceiving... when you first walk in... the space looks so small.  I asked the host if we were the only ones in the restaurant (it was a Tuesday night and no one was in sight).  He said that there were a couple of people in the back.  He led us through the many dining rooms, and finally we entered the last two remaining dining areas.  All of a sudden we saw several tables filled with customers.  I definitely recommend sitting in the back rooms if you can... it is so much scenic and cozy than the front dining areas.. . The food, in my opinion, was nothing to rave about.  Everyone claims how great the dishes are here... I thought mine was ok, but not fabulous.  We had the baked baby eggplants as an appetizer (tasty).  I had the linguine with seafood in a tomato sauce.  My client had the stuffed chicken special.  Both entrees were overflowing with food.. . The service was excellent and on Tuesdays, the bottles of wine are half price.
