Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
This place is great.  Only three items on the menu.  Fish Tacos, shrimp tacos and driinks.  I came in the morning (was supposed to open at 11am but was more like 11:30) and had 3 fish tacos and an orange fanta.  The whole meal was under 5 bucks.  Tacos were kinda small and three tacos left me wanting more.  Definitely would go back for an easy, cheap meal.
