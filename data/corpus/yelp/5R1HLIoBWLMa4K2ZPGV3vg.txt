Category: Tapas Bars
Found this place in one of the magazines at the hotel. Was pleasantly surprised. Is a rather small place, and didn't make reservations, but didn't have to wait long for a table for 2. . The tapas selection is fairly small, but the items were very good. Was disappointed that two of the items we wanted were not available. The service was great, though, the ambiance was quite loud. . Overall, a very good quaint tapas restaurant.
