Been there many times. Have tried porterhouse, bone-in rib eye and it tasted great!  Tried the primerib one time and portion was huge. Served on hot plates so make sure you don't touch them. Atmosphere is good, it's a little dark and it's loud but it's a happening place. Great place for star gazing if you're into that.  Top 5 steak places I've been to for sure.. -would I go again?  --- absolutely!
