Tap has a ton of good things going for it. Stellar location, decorating, (ok) food, drinks, and patio, but its missing one thing, quick service. I genuinely like this place and would like to give it four stars but the 3 times I've been there have been filled with long periods of time going by with little or no service. When they do get to you, you are taken care of, but it takes too long.. . If you want to hang out in midtown on a beautiful day, this is the spot. But if you are looking to do anything more than relax for a while, this is not the spot. Bring a lot of people, because no matter what, no single person can keep your interest for that long of a time.
