Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Saturday morning, we had the cravings for some baja style tacos.. . Looks like we found the right spot, here with Joseph at the Best fish taco in Ensenada or shall I say in Los Feliz.. . I walked in all excited, that I finally made it out to this small taco place were everyone comes to. . I spoke to the gentleman (Joseph) behind the register and mentioned to him that we were going to order a couple of tacos to try them out. . . Then we were going to drive up to Yucca's for further experimentation. . Each one of us got a taco a piece just to try them out. . Joseph suggested that we should try the horchata drink, he even guaranteed it would be the BEST HORCHATA we ever had!!!. He was right it is the best we ever had....well come by and try it for yourself if you don't believe me ( remember I am mexican after all !!). . These darn tacos were Awesome...we never made it to Yucca's we just decided to order more fish and shrimp tacos.... . Well, Duh that's all they sell here.
