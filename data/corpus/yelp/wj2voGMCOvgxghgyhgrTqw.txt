I can't understand why been getting such great reviews.  The garlic chicken, which I think is their specialty, was really good.  The plantains were also amazing.  But everything else was just ok.  I think I'll need to go one more time before I make any concrete opinions, but so far 3 stars is all I can muster.  . . As always, the company was great though!
