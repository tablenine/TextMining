I have to say I was very disappointed after my last visit. THe first time I was there was about 1 1/2 years ago. I had just recently started eating fish &amp; seafood again after a 12 year hiatus so it was one of my first forays in to sushi. I remember thinking it was good, but I was so inexperienced with sushi I didn't feel qualified to really judge. So the second time I was there a few weeks ago, and after eating sushi for awhile now and experiencing some great sushi places in this city, I just don't think Kamehachi ranks up there. I was with two other people so we ordered probably 8-10 different rolls, along with a couple of apps. All of the food was just pretty generic and dare I say, somewhat bland. The fish did not taste as fresh as I've had at other places either. Its not that the sushi was horrible or inedible, I just think there's half a dozen other sushi places that are way better. And for the price, I don't think its worth it. . . The one thing going for this place is they do have great, attentive service and a good location in Old Town. The patio is really cute too and would be a great date spot. But, I can't justify spending $100+ on sushi for just the location &amp; atmosphere.
