Hmm, I think I don't quite understand the hype over this place, though it is a relaxing and pleasant place to eat lunch amidst shopping on 3rd. That's ok, I'm sure it'll do fine without me. I had the chicken salad and while it was ok, it wasn't great or particularly special. The selection of cheeses and other deli items looked really delish though, so I am sure had I been a little more adventurous with my menu selection or took something home I might have had a happier tummy. The atmosphere here is great though. Very chill, despite its location and reputation as a hot spot. Their chocolate cupcake was yumminess, though it was so moist it literally fell apart and I was made to scoop it up with my fingers, cuz psssht, ain't nothing keeping me from my cupcakes sucka. For the cuppy cake it earns a 4th star.
