I'm torn between 2 1/2 and 3 stars, but completely willing to give Fred another try.  The Brit and I stopped by for lunch after our V-Day horseback ride at Sunset Ranch . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... .  It was a beautifully warm sunny SoCal day and we nabbed an outside table easily.  We fought over ordering the same dish and finally in the end, The Brit let me get the same thing as him.  It was, after all, Valentine's Day.  We both had the Waldorf Chicken Salad sandwich, but we were both left feeling disappointed.  The bread chewed away at the roof of our mouths and the salad mix didn't have any pizazz to speak of.  We sat observing how this spot could be so trendy, how they honed in on their target market with borderline vulgar t-shirt logos and a mix of early 90's rock.  We just weren't that impressed, but I can't help but wonder if we just ordered the wrong thing.
