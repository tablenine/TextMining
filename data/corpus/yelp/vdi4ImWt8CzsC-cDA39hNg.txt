I really like this place. Its small but man they get the food out and the food is great. Its a neighborhood place you can depend on. I am a noodle freak, so usually I will order a BOWL. They come in many flavors and additions. Cool, crisp, fresh, yumm. The waiters are excellent, and this place believes in service. I love that. Very hip crowd of Xers' and that makes me feel young. Anything that makes me feel young has my vote!
