I liked it.  You can me a follower, I don't care.  I'm not a foodie, and don't like seafood.  I have a girlfriend who I don't take food adventures without; she acts as translator/nay-sayer (she's learned what I can and cannot do.)  I'm not afraid, I just prefer to understand what I'm putting in my mouth.  (to note: I ate a fried worm at a Thai place just to prove myself.)  Anyway, Urban Belly.  Unique, and honestly kind of hard to understand setup.  You order at the back and hope for a table.  They've got yummy fruity sweet sodas and water, and it's BYOB.  I had some sort of dumplingy things, some sort of soupy thing with some beany things, and a giant bowl of yummy yummy noodly things.  Yum. I suppose for the atmosphere (really casual) I would expect the prices to be a little lower....but still.  Yum.  I liked it all.
