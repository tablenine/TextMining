Came here on Easter for a Sunday brunch and our first clue should have been that it was fairly empty.  We started with sweet potato fries with goat cheese fondue which I liked.  For my entree I had the huevos uncommon which I had been assured was not too spicy (I asked b/c I am a spicewuss) but it was.  But it wasn't only spicy, it just didn't taste that great.  The accompanying potatoes were way overcooked (a few were even charred to complete blackness) and not flavorful.  My friend's cinnamon raisin french toast was overwhelmed by far too many raisins to the point of being comical.. Service was lovely, but the food is not enough to return for.
