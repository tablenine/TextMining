Had lunch here today. I have to say... southern pork ribs sure are delish. A few things make Daddy Dz fabulous:. . 1) The meat falls off the bones. It's smokey, tender, juicy, and crispy on the outside all at the same time. . 2) Sauce is mildy kicky, which is good for me.. 3) Corn Bread. Danm that shit is good. It's basically the best corn bread I've ever had. EVER. I eat a lot of corn bread. Think chinese sponge cake-like consistency with specs of yellow corn and a nice golden brown crust on top. Yumm-O!. 4) Service - There be some nice peeps here. . 5) History in the Making... the owner is closing the place to film a movie there on Wednesday. How awesome is that?. . Anyway, you should check this place out. It's worth the drive if you are in the greater Atlanta area.
