Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
It was worth the drive down the 405 S. I arrived at Tito's Tacos on a Tuesday night around 8:10pm. The restaurant was full and there were endless lines. You can stand in line if you're dining in or you may order through a large window outside for take out. Stood in line outside and 20 minutes later it was my turn. I said to the not so friendly lady at the window, May I please get (2) Tito's Taco with Cheese (cheese is an additional .50 cents) the lady said okay. About 3 minutes later she handed me a box and said total is $4.48. Two delicious hard shell tacos with shredded beef, shredded lettuce and shredded mild cheddar cheese. Complimentary chips and house salsa was so worth it. . . Pros: good Mexican fast food at reasonable prices . . Cons: staff not very friendly, CASH Only . . But I will definitely drive back!! (only have after the traffic rush)
