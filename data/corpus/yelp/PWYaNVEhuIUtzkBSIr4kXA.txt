Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
We drove about 80 miles to try Spago. Of course, the place appeared overflowing with bling blings and noses high up in the air, but we were equally treated with superb service in our less shiny facade. For starters, the sushi/sashimi lightly bathed in some sauce was mouth watering. For the lamb medallions, all you have to do is close your eyes for your tongue to filter the wonderful taste. Try the duck...a truly unique, adventurous taste! The waiter had suggested a wonderful complement of wine. When I dropped a knife, a new clean one mysteriously appeared. This one time visit was worth every mile we drove! We shall return!
