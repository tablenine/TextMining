As a fan of volume along with quality (honestly, volume actually outranks quality in my book...), this place is amazing! I went here back when i lived in ATL all the time as a kid and we'd do family style dining with a big group, so when i came back to ATL for a few days this past december, my parents, boyfriend and i invited a couple people to come with us, and did the family style dining again.... to be honest, i was skeptical that the portions would really be that filling (most all you can eat type places will bring you refills of like miniature doll sized portions), but this place truly exceeded my expectations (as it did back in the day too..)! Â Although I must say that the appetizers we picked were far better than the entrees (calamari, fried mozarella and something else...vs. entrees of gnocci, salmon (i think) and lasagna (to be fair, i didnt pick anything other than the salmon, so i didnt think i'd necessarily like the entrees we picked)...desserts were also great, and i actually dislike dessert generally (we got some apple pastry and creme brulee)...if i go back to atlanta, ill be goin back to maggianos! also, a nice enough place, which you usually dont get with all you can eat style dining...
