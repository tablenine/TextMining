Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Umami Burger???  Yes, please!. . So I heard about this restaurant a few months prior and was dying to try it.  So one day when I was in the area, I decided to stop by for lunch with a friend.  It was delicious!  Wasn't too pricey for a gourmet type of burger and definitely worth the money. . . I got the Umami Burger, which was their special.  I thought this burger was super tasty.  I really liked the parmesan chip that they had inside the burger, gave it a nice touch and a little bite!  The mushroom in the burger also gave it a nice finish as well.  The only thing I could definitely have gone without was the excess of ketchup in my burger.  Although, this is definitely a personal preference.  I just don't really like my burgers drenched in ketchup.. . My lunch date ordered the White Truffle Burger and that was DELICIOUS!  We actually split each burger in half so we could try a little bit of both.  I think I enjoyed this burger more for sure.  There was such a strong truffle flavor in the burger that definitely made it melt in your both.. . Both burgers were good and cooked to perfection.  . . We also ordered the fat french fries and onion rings.  Their onion rings are good!  Battered up, fried and served with the dipping sauce of your choice! Yummy!. . I definitely recommend this place.  Service was pretty decent too.. . Only bad thing:  The restaurant is SUPER small.  So if you're going during a lunch or dinner rush, be prepared to wait a while.  This was kind of a bummer... but it was worth the wait.. . Don't forget to get the little cake things they have at the register on your way out!  They had this cake with peanut butter, chocolate and marshmallow.  It tasted like a ding dong with peanut butter inside!  SO GOOD!!!
