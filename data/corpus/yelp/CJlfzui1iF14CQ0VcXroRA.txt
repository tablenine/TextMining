Great chicken, portions were outstanding, place was packed but we got seated quickly.  All in all it was a great experience, can't complain.  Make sure you try the mac and cheese and the greens.  Both fantastic.  Cornbread was average but the chicken made up for it.  . . We took my brother in law who was in from out of town and he loved it so much he bought a shirt.  It had been awhile since I had visited but I won't wait that long to go back again.
