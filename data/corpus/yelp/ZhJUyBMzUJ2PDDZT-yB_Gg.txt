I've been here twice on business lunches and the food was quite delicious.  . . For lunch entrees I've tried the wagyu beef cheek, the scallops, the beef shortribs, and the skirt steak - all very tender delicacies.  . . In addition, for the sides I sampled the mushrooms, asparagus, and potato puree - definitely sparked my taste buds and complimented the entrees.  . . The appetizers including the salads and sashimi were also fresh and were a great addition to the satisfactory lunch rolls/bread.. . Finally the desserts, especially the donuts would satisfy any sweet tooth.  I personally enjoyed the banana cream tart, but the same type pie is a better value at apple pan.. . Although this restaurant had all-in-all tasty food and decent service, I would have to give it less than 5 stars because of the exuberant pricing.  Yes, it is suppose to be a high-class restaurant owned by Tom Colicchio.  However, the portions served are too small to fill any average adult male paying out of their own pocket unless they order what most of us cannot afford.  This goes for most fancy restaurants, but not for all (for instance, how much I spend here may get me a lot at a fancy steak house like Mastro's, despite the fact that I'm now comparing apples to bananas with a steak house and an all-american dish restaurant).. . In summary, this restaurant has tasty food, descent service, and variety of choices.  However, I would only come here for a very special occasion such as an anniversary, or when business can expense the meal.  Otherwise, I would probably leave this restaurant still hungry and/or empty pocketed.
