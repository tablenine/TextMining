Restaurant: Top Flr
Category: American (New)
Top Flr is one of those places that seems to be unique to Atlanta, where the menu is vaguely Southern, with a fancy twist (this ain't yo mama's macaroni and cheese). . . The atmosphere is chill and swanky; it kinda makes you feel like you're in an episode of Sex and the City, complete with authentic New York pricing. I don't really understand why appetizers, salads, and entrees should all cost the same in the first place. (I do plan to come back on a Monday to try the $15 three-course fixed price dinner. This I can afford.). . The food was good, but didn't "wow" me. On the other hand, I thought the cocktails were amazing. First I had a Yellow Roses, which includes lavender-infused vodka. If that sounds ridiculously good, that's because it is. I followed that with a Boy Named Sue, which included Jim Beam. 'Nuff said. Still, being priced between $9-11, they add up quick. Y'all know I be eatin' ramen every day for a reason (so when I do go out, I can afford places like Top Flr).. . Since I'd already resigned myself to dropping at least $40 that night, I decided to go for broke and order dessert. I picked the flourless chocolate-espresso cake with butter pecan ice cream. HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. I only wished it was bigger! . . My overall experience at Top Flr was pleasant, but nothing exceptional; normally, this would warrant three stars from me. However, I am giving four stars because of the surprisingly orgasmic dessert.
