After reading all the rave reviews here on Yelp, I think perhaps P'cheen deserves a second shot.  Unfortunately, my first visit there was a total strike out - the waitress was bad, the service was INCREDIBLY slow, and the food was entirely underwhelming.  . Our waitress took our drink and appetizer order and never came back to the table.  We had finished our appetizer and had it cleared from the table and sat there for a good 15 to 20 minutes.  Finally, when she walked by,  we asked if we could order, she gave us a very awkward look and said "sure" nonchalantly, as if she hadn't just left us there waiting to order for a prolonged period of time.   . It wasn't busy at all, but our food took another 20 to 30 minutes to come out.  Two people at our table ordered the burger, medium rare.  Both burgers came out way over cooked.  I had the smoked mozzarella ravioli and was a little disappointed.  I thought it'd have a little more pizazz, but instead it tasted very... ho-hum.  The food runners did apologize for the delay, which was nice.  . When the waitress came to take our cards, we tried to explain to her how we wanted to split the bill, but she walked off after the first word or two.  I'm sure that it wasn't intentional, but it definitely left our group a little dumbfounded.  Our total dining time was over 2 hours.   . . I'm totally disappointed in this place.  I'd be willing to give it a second shot, but not for a good long while.  Poor service and mediocre food just doesn't leave me wanting to run back for seconds.
