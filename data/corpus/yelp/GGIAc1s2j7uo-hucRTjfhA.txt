Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Once upon a time one could really look forward to going to Pinks to choose from a vast array of artful, substantial and appealing creations de'doggie.  But, then came the lines.  First on Sundays, midday.  Then midday, EVERYDAY.  Then every NIGHT.  Then 2 o'freakin clock in the a.m. on a stinking cold and smelly Tuesday.  Thats it, I've officially given up on Pinks, sadly enough as it is to say.  . . My take on it is they are perfectly capable of expeditiously handling the crowds as they are not understaffed, but rather someone calling the shots is forcing the slow-down to draw attention and curiosity to the heavily travelled sidewalk-scene on LaBrea, upping the coolness factor on the joint.   For food up/5,  the line lands them a zero.
