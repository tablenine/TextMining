I have wanted to try Mozza since it opened but for one reason or another always overlooked it when picking a place to eat. We were in the neighborhood yesterday and it was getting late after leaving a work event. Mozza popped into my head so we headed over at around 9:30p.. . The smell of butter and the sight of meatballs hit us like a gust of heaven as we walked in. The small space was packed. Go figure. When it's good, it's good no matter what time it is. We waited for 15 minutes and were seated at the bar. Perfect. Communal dining and a view of all the action.. . We shared the meatballs al forno and Bianca pizza. The meatballs came in a trio with 2 slices of buttered toast. I could do without the toast {a little on the salty side} but the meatballs were so good. Fork-tender and so flavorful. This is not your average meatball.. . The pizza was also delicious. We went with our server's suggestion of adding a meat selection to the Bianca. We picked prosciutto which was good but next time I'd go with the fennel sausage. The crust Â was unreal. Paper thin but not soggy. Good with the dough, these guys.. . For dessert, we had the butterscotch budino. I've been kind of obsessed with the whole butterscotch/creme fraiche/salt combination lately and this did not disappoint. Rich, creamy, and sweet with a bit of salt to counter it. . . Service, from the host to all 3 of our servers, was wonderful. Really sweet and friendly. Better than most places in LA. There, I said it!. . Must come back to try more pizza and their bone marrow!
