Revised as of 11/6/06 :: Went here the other night after craving a few glasses of wine and I have to say I was pretty bummed at what we had. 3 glasses for $40 and nothing was really worth writing home about. I got to talking with the winetender and he even admitted that as far as by the glass the wines tend to live on the feminine side. Meaning, don't come here looking for a hearty or robust or spicy wine by the glass, because they really don't have it. Unless you upgrade to the bottles, but they will cost you a pretty penny. Just thought I'd include this so you know what to expect here. With that said, I still give this place 5 very deserving stars! :). . Of the 6 or so times I've been here, I have never ONCE had a bad experience. It's beautiful, delicious and did I mention beautiful and delicious. I usually go with the scallops or whatever yumminess they are offering as a special that night and if you are into wines, this is the place to go. They have opened my mind, palate and senses to some incredible varietals and boy howdy, it's worth every penny you spend on the experience!. . Did I really just write boy howdy? Wow, I guess I did.
