Restaurant: Dynamic Dish
Category: Vegetarian
Dynamic Dish...what can I even say?  My favorite restaurant in Atlanta, this place serves sophisticated, unique vegetarian fare with a conscience.  The produce is local and organic whenever possible, and it's shown off proudly in beautiful seasonal displays on the counter.  Not only that, almost every time I go in, I learn a new fruit, veggie, cheese, or dish - and I'm an informed, avid vegetarian.. . In many visits over the past year or so, I've never been disappointed in the slightest.  The staff is warm and personable, and the BYOB policy means I've always got exactly the beverage I'm in the mood for (even if it does require a little planning ahead).  My only complaint is how much I miss the weekend brunch.  . . Never leave me, Dynamic Dish.  My dining options, and I'm pretty sure my whole outlook on life, would be bleak without you.
