"Bait and Switch". . Pros:. 1) Friendly Staff. . Cons:. Here is the Bait and Switch:. 1) We ordered a small lobster (@ $16/lb) and the waitress said most lobsters were 1 - 1.5 lbs.  Once the order arrived the waitress say, oh all we had was "3+ lbs lobsters", it would have been nice if she had said that before they brought it to the table cooked.  We would have ordered something else!!!  We really didn't want a $55 lobster you have to eat with your hands.  Very unappetizing!  . . 2) The lobster was rock hard and very difficult to break apart.  This ruined the whole meal experience, it was more about digging for your food.  AGAIN at $55 for one lobster without any side dishes etc, it was a RIP OFF.  You can do much better at a good seafood restaurant. . . 3) The place is a mess.  You have to eat with your hands.  This place is an e.coli haven.  You eat with your hands and you share catsup containers and paper-towel rolls with other customers.  Gross.. . 4) The famed seasoning was not anything special.  It's just Cajun spice.  In fact it seemed to have MSG because it did speed up my heart rate.. . 5) Limited menu, if you are with someone who does not eat seafood the only other option is chicken wings. . . I gave it one star because this place is the exact opposite what I look for  in a good dining experience: it was crowded, messy, salty, limited menu, overpriced, greasy (fried fish/fries), and you leave smelling like you work there.
