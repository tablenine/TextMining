Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Adam Richman from Man vs Food is an incredible food critic, but sometimes his recommendations are incredulous...like Philippes famous french dip sandwiches.  My girlfriends and I traveled to this highly exclaimed LA landmark on a Saturday afternoon before a Dodger game, and there was absolutely no parking available in their 2 lots (that's how crowded it was).  I had to park deep into Chinatown (blocks away) because there was nobody was leaving.  It took a lengthy 45 minutes to get the food and boy, was the bread dry and the deli meat bland.  For four petite girls, the rip-off meal cost us roughly $35 for the sandwiches, water, and chips.  This place was defintely rustic, dirty, and totally understaffed.  . Adam Richman, I'm disappointed in you...but you've taught me a good lesson.  No meal should ever replace the Dodger Dog, beer, and garlic fries from Dodger Stadium.
