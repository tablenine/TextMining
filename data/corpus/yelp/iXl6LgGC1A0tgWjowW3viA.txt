I went here for dinner and I must say its a different type of japanese food. I would say its more traditional. Few rolls and more main entrees and sashimi. The food was delicious and they gave you plenty. Service was superb. Food was fresh and the tea was yummy! I would go here again if I was in the neighborhood. I was not disappointed.
