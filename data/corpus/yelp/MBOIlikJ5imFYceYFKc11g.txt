Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
There are a lot of positives about this place but I'll start with the negatives. I couldn't figure out if I was at a restaurant or a club the whole night. Music was too loud for conversation yet no dance floor. second service was tad bit slow but really cant complain because our waitress was pretty friendly and well informed on her Saki knowledge. Food was good considering that i do not fancy myself a sushi expert but really overpriced for my liking. Positives would be that visuals were pretty neat and rotating tables were cool but just could find enough positives to put this place over the top. Seems that Hollywood's finest come to the Geisha House so if this is what they indulge themselves in then i am happy to be a regular Joe at a Yard house
