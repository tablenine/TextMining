We came here for bunch yesterday and I couldn't decide what to eat. Everything sounded delicious. Our friend, who frequents this place, raved about everything, especially the sloppy joes. I hadn't had one since my schoolgirl days. Â But I also wanted breakfast, so I ordered the sloppy joe, zucchini and carrot slaw, and a blueberry pancake. . . Success! The bun didn't sag, the slaw was oil and vinegar based instead of mayo which is tops in my book (mayo is the devil), and the blueberries were plump. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their meals. Service was slow at best, but the food made up for it.
