Restaurant: El Carmen
Category: Bars
If you like la Lucha, you'll like this place.  This place pays tribute to mexican wrestlers, with pics all over the walls.. . This place also boasts a massive selection of tequilas, the whole lineup behind the bar looks like it's almost all tequila.  . . Since I'm not a big drinker, I can't comment on the drinks, but I have to say that the potato tacos here ROCKED!!!!  . . This place is good to stop for happy hour or a place to lounge and throw back some drinks with just a few friends. The seating fills up pretty quick.. . Another plus-some neat litle restaraunts line the same street El Carmen is on, including Dough Boys, which I will eventually try...
