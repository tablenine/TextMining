A little disappointed with the soup.  It seems some parts of the soup was not as hot as other spots.  This was the first time I have ever a noodle soup like that.  My girlfriend said it was because they put in vegetables or slices of meat that were not uniformly the room temperature.  Maybe they just got it out of the frig and mixed it.  Don't know, it's not bad, but I wouldn't wait in line for this.
