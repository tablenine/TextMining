Restaurant: Everybody&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
After years of pizza joint hoping in Atlanta, I landed on Everybody's some 15 years ago.  Another place my father had never frequented, so we headed there before the Georgia game one Saturday to enjoy a pie.. . I insisted on ordering the Fresh Baked Garlic Parmesan Breadsticks with Cheese.  It comes with a side of marinara sauce - nice and hot.  While we nibbled, we checked out the Tech game (rooting for them to lose, of course) and waited for out pizza pie.  . . We decided on the Everybody's - which is mushrooms, pepperoni, green peppers, Roma tomatoes and extra cheese.  We had them add black olives for a little something extra.  Once the pizza came out of the kitchen, we forgot about football and enjoyed the piping hot slices.  . . The beauty of Everybody's Pizza is how crispy the crust is on the bottom and how perfectly cooked the topping are.  The pizza was delicious as usual and I also ended up taking half of it home...as usual.  As we ate, I flagged down the waitress and ordered a personal size pizza with mushrooms and onions to go (for Mom).  It took a bit too long to get the to go pizza, but at least we had something to watch on the TV.. . If you want good pizza and are in the area, Everybody's is the place.  Just be sure to place your to-go order early enough so you aren't stuck waiting around too long.
