Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I usually despise fish tacos but I enjoyed this place- I do think they could have used a little more flavor, maybe marinated longer in lime but still really good. The salsa bar left something to be desired though- the condiments looked like they had been sitting there all day. Someone should have replenished them. . . Overall very tasty, but docking a star for presentation.
