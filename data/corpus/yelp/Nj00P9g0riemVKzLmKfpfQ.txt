Restaurant: Front Page News
Category: American (New)
Big greasy portions, watery drinks, and service that will leave you wondering how you ended up spending so much money for a meal that you didn't enjoy. And yet Front Page News is always busy and has been around for ages it seems.. . The food is sub par, especially given the other options in Little Five Points nearby. The best thing that Front Page News has going for it is that it has the most accessible parking of any spot in the neighborhood. When having a big parking lot is your claim to fame, there's something seriously wrong.
