I have only eaten here once, and I should say that I was quite impressed. Â I had the Lemon Poppy seed pancakes and they were fantastic... I mean they were lemonylishous, which means they were quite good.. . This place was quite crowded, but it did not take too long when I visited to get a seat... I can not imagine how this place would be on a weekend brunch.
