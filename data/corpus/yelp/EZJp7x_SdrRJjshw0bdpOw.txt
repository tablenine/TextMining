Is it just me or... oh wait, I think it is JUST ME here.... that think "Meh. I've experienced better"?. . I have to say, I came here with a friend because another friend recommended this place, especially their Hainan Chicken. There were quite a bit of people outside too. We got seated a bit after we got in and we were seated inside packed and closely to everyone else. The inside is EXTREMELY small. My friend got the Hainan Chicken while I got the Seafood Pasta. I have to say, the Seafood Pasta is nothing fancy or great about it. It comes with these ugly plain bread that taste exactly like how it looks, plain. The Hainan Chicken was just okay on my book too. I don't see what's so special about this place. The service was nothing great either, it was just okay. Everything else is just so so. That's about it. . . Maybe I should try their Hainan Chicken again and request to seat outside this time while battling out with the rest of the crowd.
