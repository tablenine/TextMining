Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
I grew up on Lou's so I am quite familiar with the food here. Everything is really good. When you dine in, there is nothing like fresh deep dish from here. The portions are large and you'll have left-overs. . . A word of caution...each location has a slightly different menu. For example, the Lincoln Park location does not have a fryer, so no cheese sticks or cheddar cubes here! The pizza is always about the same at each store but some of the other menu items are different or not there.
