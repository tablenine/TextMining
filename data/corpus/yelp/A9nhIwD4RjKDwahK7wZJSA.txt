some friends of mine from school introduced this place to me about 3 years ago, and i've been a fan since! i've tried to introduce this place to as many people as possible. i even got my boyfriend hooked, and for awhile, we were eating there at least once a week! . . the place is tiny and the average wait is about 45 minutes, but most people don't seem to mind. (though i wouldn't advise going there if you're completely starving, cause the wait could drive you mad.) and because of the small space, smaller parties would most likely end up sitting at the "bar", which is fine, but because i don't like putting my bag on the floor i end up wearing it and it's a tad annoying while eating.. . i always get the kotteri (sp?) style ramen, the one with extra (pork) back-fat! it makes a huge difference. since going with my boyfriend, we've made it a habit to order a side of gyoza and a plate of fried rice. the gyoza is really good and the fried rice has a really nice taste to it... probably the back-fat as well. . . the ramen consists of bamboo shoots, which i like, savory pork meat, onions, and their egg. OMG, the egg. i LOVE eggs, and their egg is perfect. the taste of the soup is stewed in, and the yolk isn't fully cooked--not raw, but still orange and a little soft. in other words, perfection.. . i've tried other ramen places but none have compared to this, although rumor has it that shinsengumi in rosemead is way better! i'll be the judge of that.. . this place is probably intended for smaller groups, 5 people at the most. their booths seat about 4 and they can bring around an extra chair, but most of the larger groups get separated. . . definitely a place to stop by if you're ever in la!
