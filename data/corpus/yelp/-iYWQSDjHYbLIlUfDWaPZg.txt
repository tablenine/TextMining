I've been here twice now- loved it each time. Last time I got the porkchop which was served over risotto- I am still salivating. . . Cool little tidbit- Valerie Jarrett was sitting at the table next to us- which impressed our friends from San Jose. . . Oh, the only thing- hard to find the door. But that makes it fun.
