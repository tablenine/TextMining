Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
Great, fresh, local food.. . My first visit to Square One was during a visit to Los Angeles from New York. I was immediately struck by how fresh the ingredients were. In new york, really fresh vegetables are sometimes difficult to find yet everything I ordered at Square One was unmistakably made of REAL FOOD, grown in the ground, cooked by actual people. The menu rotates with seasonal specials acquired from local sources.. I believe my first meal here consisted of a breakfast sandwich with a side of grits. The sandwich was excellent. While it came complete with applewood-smoked bacon and a healthy serving of avocado, the fresh-baked bread on which it was served made the difference. The texture of the grits invoked an image of corn ground by mortar and pestle. My date had an excellent sausage omelet with perfectly fluffy eggs. The coffee, by Intelligentsia, Â was also notably strong and good.. Now that I live in Los Angeles, it seems I've had more applewood-smoked bacon than in my entire life prior to moving and the novelty of the freshness has worn off a little. I've also experienced some service flubs and some more run-of-the-mill dishes at Square One. Still, it remains one of my favorite local spots for breakfast or lunch.. On a side note, Square One is an interesting spot for people watching as it offers a clear view of the Church of Scientology compound and the comings and goings of it's uniformed members.. .
