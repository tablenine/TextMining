Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
The atmosphere is definitely nicer than most Korean BBQ restaurants. It is very clean, new-looking and well maintained.  We ordered Galbi, Bulgogi and Chicken.  They gave you lots of sides and the meat was very tender and good. They give you tea, soup and sides galore! Lots of food. They do all the cooking for you, which is different than most places. The kim-chi isn't very spicy and isn't fermented all the way, which I wish it were.  I would come again, but if I am looking for a meal just based on the BBQ then I would opt for Soot Bull Jeep, but if I am looking for a whole atmosphere - wait staff, ambiance and food then I would come here.
