Restaurant: Souper Jenny
Category: Caterers
This place is my new discovery. I love the place. It's so homey they have a couch like "Friends", that comes together with soft cushions and a wall full of private pictures of Jenny and other staff. And no to mention the mix-and-match crockery. . . The food uses quality ingredients and really comes from the heart (with weighwatchers guide), they don't try to rip you off, so everyone is satisfied. Plan ahead because there's always a line for lunch, or they sold out of their food. . . Lunchin' at souper jenny fills you up with goodness you will carry on the whole day its like youre in Oprah world. This is the type of restaurant i wanna work in!
