Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I love how LA'ers love to hype up a place just because it's hyped up somewhere else like a food network or on yelp.  I don't get the greatness that is Father's office.  . . You want a selection of 7-10 beers for about 10 bucks a pint?  If selection's what you want, go to a yard house.. . You want a salty burger ground up from leftover butcher scraps?  That you can't add anything on?  If you want a decent burger, go to apple pan, fatburger, or in n out.  Ketchup, optional.. . You want to stand up and wait forever to wait for a seat to open up?  Go to Disneyland.
