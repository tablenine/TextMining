There's a parking structure underneath, don't park at the shady lot across from it. I tried Special #2 and once I got a waft of that burning, I decided against the challenge. I just tried to eat everything in it. I don't know what's in their special powder, but there are 6 scoops of it in that bowl. It's a big RED bowl of pain. I managed to eat everything, but I drank maybe 2 spoonfuls of that soup. It was an interesting experience... . . But I got to try everyone else's soups too and the soy sauce is my favorite I think. The optional butter slab is so weird. My friends said it was amazing the first few sips and then pretty much blah since there's only one slice of butter for the entire bowl. (unless you are crazy and order multiple butter slices)
