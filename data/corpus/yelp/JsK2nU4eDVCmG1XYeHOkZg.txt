The Lechon Asado is to die for!. I have had my share of cuban food! And Versailles by far has the best lechon and yuka I have ever had! and most that know me would agree that I am not a big fan of pork. But as most :) I make my exceptions!. . Everyone goes for the famous garlic chicken which is also great, if you haven't had the lechon asado its a must, put it on the bucket list!. . If you like the mojo that is on the chicken know that you can ask for a side of that mojo and you can add it to anything you want...I like to add it to the bistec empanisado (breaded steak) and even sometimes on my moro (mixed rice and black beans). . Nice big amounts on any plate! ENJOY
