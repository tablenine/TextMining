Restaurant: Busy Bee Cafe
Category: Soul Food
I wanted soul food in Atlanta and I landed at Busy Bee. At the crowded counter I ordered fried chicken (yes I love fried chicken) with collard greens and black eyed peas and tried to beat the summer heat with sweet tea. The lunch diner next to me smiled knowingly as I inhaled my meal. There was no room left in my very happy belly to eat dessert so I took a slice of sweet potato pie and red velvet cake to go. My hotel room had the smell of sweet baked goods that afternoon. . On MARTA take Peachtree to 5 Pts. Switch to the East-West line headed east. Get off at Ashby station.
