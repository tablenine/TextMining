Restaurant: Co&#39;m Vietnamese Grill
Category: Vietnamese
This place was on a 2007 50 Best Restaurants in Atlanta list. I checked it out. Food was average. Big portions. Attentive service.. . Would not choose to go again. If I were with people who wanted to go there, I would use all the powers of persuasion available to me to change their minds.
