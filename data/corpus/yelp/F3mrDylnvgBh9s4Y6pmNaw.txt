Came here for brunch last month hoping to sit on the patio and enjoy one of the first warm Sundays of the spring.  Wrong!  Everybody else had the same idea and either were smart enough to make a reservation or didn't mind the 45 minute wait for a table on the patio.  We, on the other hand, opted to sit inside.  The interior of Einsteins is open which made sitting indoors more tolerable on this lovely day.. . I ordered the veranda platter which consisted of three scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuit and brunch potatoes.  The eggs were bland, but the potatoes had a nice seasoning and were tasty.  The biscuit, well, was a biscuit.  I didn't eat the bacon - Adam, was wishing you were there because I knew leaving it on my plate was just wrong.  . . As far as this place goes, the food and service is okay.  The real draw is the patio and next time I will be smart enough to make a reservation or hope my brunch companions don't mind killing the wait time with a few mimosas.
