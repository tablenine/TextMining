The crowd of people as you drive down 1st street can only mean one thing: dinner rush at Daikokuya. . . Environment:. The wait is inevitable, unless you go at 9:30pm at night or right when it opens. Parking is street or the Japanese Village Plaza structure. The place is small! About 4 tables and the rest is counter space. Once seated, they do take your order right away and your food is served fairly quickly.. . Food:. Good ramen. The broth is killer! Sweet and salty and not too oily. The depth of the broth is rich and tastes meaty/hearty. The noodles are soft and chewy, cooked perfectly every time. I like these noodles better than Shin Sen Gumi's because SSG's tend to be too thin, too doughy, and not chewy enough (undercooked?). They load your bowl with green onions, so beware. My bf likes the kotteri broth, which is a richer, meatier, fattier broth that he orders every time without fail. The iced green tea is good too!. . Why four stars?. Best ramen in jtown/downtown, just not as good as Santouka.
