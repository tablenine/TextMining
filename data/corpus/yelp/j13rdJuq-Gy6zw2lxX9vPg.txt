If you live in Chicago, don't come here. Let the tourists have it and hit up one in another neighborhood. This place was a madhouse at 6pm on a Saturday. Picked up some pies for a soiree. Can't go wrong with a stuffed spinach pizza although the crust at their competitors is way better. Don't waste your time getting a thin crust here. It's not bad but pricey for thin crust that isn't much better than the greasy corner joints in your neighborhood.
