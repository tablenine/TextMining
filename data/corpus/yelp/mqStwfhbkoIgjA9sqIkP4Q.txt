This is one of my favorite Marisco/Seafood joints! NOT!. . The appeal is definitely the ambience... it's cool &amp; inviting atmosphere but the food alone leaves alot to be desired. I was very impressed with the decor and presentation of the food but the taste was way off. The meat was tasteless / unseasoned, the veggies were over cooked, the seafood tasted old like it had been frozen for a long time.. . Between 2 adults I believe we spent well over Â 50.00 and left the restaurant a bit unsatisfied. This is a great place to dine for two because of the seating.. . The staff. Service was ok but nothing spectacular. Would I go again? Probably only to try their drink menu! They appeared to have lots of top shelf quality alcohol! For the seafood, I think i'd rather go to red lobster. NOT!!
