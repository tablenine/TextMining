Love this place!. My friends and I went here for dinner late Saturday night.. Although, there was a long wait, 45 minutes, we filled our time with a drink at the bar and a stroll through their deli/market secetion.. The attention to detail is amazing!. Everything was perfect. Â They have an open view of the kitchen, so you can see how everything is prepares. That is how I found out about the Louie Salad! Awesome!. We had a 1/2 sausage and 1/2 cheese pizza and the Louie Salad. . For dessert the Freddo is fab!. The manager is pretty tasty too! . The servers we very pleasant and served with class.. The prices were a nice surprise. this place is totally reasonable Especially for what you get.. Con: It's pretty noisy
