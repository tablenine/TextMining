Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
The fish tacos at this joint are plain awesome. The prices are very cheap and that's a plus during this recession. The fish tacos are $1.50 and the shrimp tacos are $2. Two tacos are enough to satisfy you and three if you're pretty hungry. You get to put as much cabbage and salsa as you want so you'll taste and eat exactly what you want. . Wahoos fish tacos are closer to where I live, but I'd rather go here. So everyone out there, if you haven't tried this place yet, please do.
