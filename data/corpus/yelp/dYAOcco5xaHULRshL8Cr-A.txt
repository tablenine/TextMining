Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
Bossa Nova is an excellent choice for a late night meal, as they are open 'til 4am every day of the week. Cute place, friendly service, not too bad of a wait, even with a crowd outside. I tried the Coxinha (shredded chicken and cheese, breaded and deep fried) as an appetizer and had the Bauru (Brazilian grilled sandiwch w/ ham, mozzarella, egg, lettuce, tomatoes) as my entree. Next time, I would opt to order tapas style and share a couple appetizers instead of ordering an entree.
