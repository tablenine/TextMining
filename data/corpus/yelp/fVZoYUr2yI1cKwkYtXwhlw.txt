Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Dude, I grew up on hotdogs. Ball park franks, oscar meyers w/ oozing cheddar cheese, vienna sausage, shoot...throw in chinese sausage why don't you.... you name it. So, coming to Pink's was gourmet cuisine in my eyes. . . After a night of drinking, what better way of sobering up by having a couple chili dogs, the Harry Potter Dog and the David Hasselhoff. Bust out the white linen and silverware, we're eating good today.. . Line? what line. 11:30am, I don't see no stinking line.
