Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I'm well aware that it's terrible for you, but I can't help but love Roscoe's. Their soul food is delicious, and my pre-conceptions were confirmed when I found out that chicken(fried)+waffles(maple syrup)=delicious.. . Oh, if you haven't, try the lemonade and orange juice mixture. So good.
