Restaurant: Hae Woon Dae BBQ
Category: Korean
Hae Woon Dae used to be one of the best Korean Restaurants in the ATL.  However, it's been a while since then, and with so many Korean Restaurants popping up all over, this isn't top of mind anymore.. . With Cho Sun OK within walking distance of this place (quality meat, much better), why even venture in Hae Woon Dae anymore?. . Part of the problem I believe, is that Creative Loafing still somehow believes that there is only one Korean restaurant in existence:  Hae Woon Dae.  . . Creative Loafing is a joke.  I don't even have to get it and I already know their 'best of':  Pizza:  Fellinis, Korean:  Hae Woon Dae, Breakfast:  Flying Biscuit.  Yawn.  . . The 'Best of' section is good for one thing only...but these days it's hard to run out of TP.
