Been coming here for years now.  Too bad this place wasn't around when I was still in high school at Fairfax.  French toast and pancakes are the best.  Well worth the drive from SGV.  The bread they use is so gooey, and who can beat the huge portions. Gets super busy on weekends though -- go early and get a seat at the round bar.
