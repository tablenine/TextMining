Here is the beef on a place with pretty good food. I wanted to give this classic place 4 stars, but I just got back from there,and I've been reminded how run down they let the place go. The waitress that sat us was as old as the decor, not that its a bad thing, but she was just spent. She had the "been there done that" attude and just didn't seem like she wanted to be there. Ok, on to the food. I loved my midnight Ruben sandwich and the food itself gets 4 1/2 stars, but I just don't like walking into the place anymore. The bright and stark lighting gave me a headache, but once again, the food might be worth it for most. Oh and the pastries are excellent. Ok, ok... let me upgrade this to 3 1/2 stars. Damn, I just cant decide can I?
