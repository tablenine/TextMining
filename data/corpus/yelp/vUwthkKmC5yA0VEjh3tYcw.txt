3.5 stars for Saturday/Sunday from 1:30 - 6pm. 3 stars for any other time.. . Tip: their 50% off ALL maki on Sat/Sun before 6pm is one of the best sushi deals in town but still can be expensive if you eat too much like me.  . . *** HUGE EDIT: They changed it so most of the good rolls don't count now... only on 'select rolls' do you get this... sigh going to have to lower the rating to 3 stars because no more dragon rolls special.... . They make the best dragon roll I've ever had, it's good.  The Ocean Sundae is alright and interesting to try but it's so-so.  Their miso is perfectly blended with interesting chewy tofu versus the soft kind I'm used to.  The alaskan roll is alright and so is the philly roll.. . Decor is warm and comfortable.  Dunno why weekends are mostly guy servers... I like female servers better but guy servers do a good job too.  . . *edit: read the other reviews and service seems to suck usually.  I only go during the special Sat/Sun between 1:30-6pm so there aren't many people and my service is good.  If you go at a different time, you could get screwed over. . Not an amazing sushi place but their dragon roll is the best I've had.  Their tempura shrimp with unagi = dragon roll heaven in my mouth.
