Wow.  SO many beers on tap!!  Just that alone makes me happy.  But the food.  Oh the food.  :). . We were feeling adventurous and decided to go exotic with the sausages.  I got the rattlesnake and my date got the alligator.  We also shared some fries.  We both LOVED the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage with the grilled peppers and onions.  Seriously, I could have a bun with only the grilled peppers and be totally happy too.  The alligator was pretty good, but it seemed a little too crispy and so did the casing.  Fries were good, especially with the chipotle aioli dipping sauce.. . The verdict: AMAZINNNGGGG!!!!
