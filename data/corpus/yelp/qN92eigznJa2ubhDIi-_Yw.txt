Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Great food but AWESOME prices. Plus, the service is quickly... and they deliver!. . Palms Thai is a regular place for me because of its speed, convenience, and my fondness for the singing Elvis. Where else can you listen to Elivs live over pas see ew, while screaming at your dinner mate when you are trying to have a conversation. . . Only gripe is the valet parking - don't get me started.
