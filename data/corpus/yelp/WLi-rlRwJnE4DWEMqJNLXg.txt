This was a five star rating originally, but I require close to perfection for five stars, and the wine experts lost them a star.  Still, this was one of the BEST dining experiences I've ever had.  . . Seriously, I've been here twice already.  I did both tasting menus and a great prix fixe as well.  I've been to Le Bernadin, and this place is hands down better in my opinion.  . . By far, one of the best meals of my life.  If you're doing the tasting menus, be prepared for a 3 hour meal.  It's worth the wait.  Don't go with the wine pairing though.  You really can't fit the room.  . . My recommendations?  . Cauliflower Panna Cotta: heavenly and subtle.  . Seared Sullivan Country Foie Gras: changed my mind about foie gras (stay away from the poached foie gras though) . Tuna and Scallop Tartare: memorable to this day. . Pennsylvania Duck Breast: incredible . . I definitely recommend doing the tasting menu.  It's not that much more and it is definitely forgoing another night dining out to splurge on this.  Ask the captain to let you swap out a few items though:  particularly the poached foie gras, I think it's called Terrine.  I can't stress this enough, take out any non-seared foie gras and replace it with either a seared foie gras or definitely the panna cotta.  . . Take a date.  The long meal will give you plenty of time to get to know each other.  . . I removed a star simply because the wine experts really don't give you too much advice.  . . CAVEAT:  the bar room is a different menu.  Most people who complain about the food at the Modern are talking about the Bar Room.  It is NOT the same menu.
