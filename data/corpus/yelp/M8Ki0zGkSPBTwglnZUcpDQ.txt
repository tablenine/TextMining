Restaurant: Holy Taco
Category: Mexican
Been back lots more since my original review, and I like Holy Taco a lot. I discovered the "buzz-arita" which is the $5 version of the organic margarita (I think - one day a friend told me to order it instead so I did.). . Although I don't eat pork, all my friends rave about the pork belly taco, so I'll go ahead and give it my vote of confidence. I've had the veggie tacos and the chicken tacos lots of times and they are YUM! I usually order two tacos if I'm having a "meal" but many of my friends will order three. . . The staff is always really friendly and will stop by your table and chat, which I appreciate. As mentioned before, the space is pretty cool, and I can't wait for warm weather to come back so I can sip a 'rita out on the patio.
