When I go to such a busy popular place on a holiday weekend I almost always expect some slippage on service and quality but Osteria absolutely proved my theory wrong! . . We recently went on a very busy Valentine's weekend and the service started as soon as I walked in the door. As we waited for our table the sommellier approached me and asked to take my bottle of wine that I brought. Being that I brought a $150 bottle I was reluctant at first -thinking what would happen to my wine? How would they know it was mine? My paranoia and the wine went away shortly after, with our wine being decanted at our table when we sat down. . . The service was friendly and not pretentious, however the food was still the star. After sampling many different dishes my perfect meal would be: . - The Burrata with Bacon: the high quality cheese and oil was amazing, but add bacon to just about anything and get out of the way of my drool. . - Grilled Octopus: While I'm not a huge fan of the odd looking creature, I do like they way he tastes in my mouth. . - Porcini Rubbed Rib Eye Bistecca served with 25 year aged Balsamic Vinegar: Now that is an F'n steak!!! This thing is so big it comes out on its own cutting board. Great flavor, cooked to perfection with a bonus of dipping sauces, aged vinegar and some delightful olive oil. . - A bit of a twist for dessert...head next door to the Pizzeria for the Butterscotch Budino. One of the best desserts I've ever had!. . I love this corner of town on Melrose and Highland, and so should you!
