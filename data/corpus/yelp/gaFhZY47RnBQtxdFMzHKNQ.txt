i almost ate it on the way in...i swear they have that floor waxed up like a greased pig. . . getting that outta my system, the food was excellent, as expected. the spinning salad bowl is so cool, and the sauteed mushrooms/baked potato were well worth it. the main event was a juicy, wonderfully rare and unparalleled slab of meat. creme brulee for dessert did not disappoint, and they even threw in a little raspberry cake for my (couple days late) birthday. . . no complaints here.
