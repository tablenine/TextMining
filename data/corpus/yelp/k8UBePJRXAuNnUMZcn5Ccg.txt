I went there for the first time today and I loved it. The concept of communal dining is great. The staff was professional, the ambience was creative and contemporary. But most of all, the food quality was excellent. Chef Bill Kim comes from an extensive cooking background and his food has clean and distinct taste that will satisfy all palettes of your mouth. I would come and eat here everyday if I can! . . Try their fried rice and ramun. Out of this world!
