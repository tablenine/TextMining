Restaurant: Maggiano&#39;s Little Italy
Category: Italian
I've visited this location on several occasions and I've never had any bad service nor received a sub-par meal. Most people say that this place is just like Olive Garden, but I think it's more like Carrabba's (. http://www.carrabbas.com. ) than any other place. The pricing is slightly high compared to the other "Italian" places, but I have enjoyed the atmosphere and believe the difference is worth it. Usually there is a band or pianist livening the place up which is nice. Even though this isn't a steakhouse, the steaks are excellent.
