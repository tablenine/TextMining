Well, they do have some interesting varieties. But I probably won't be back to try them. The mac &amp; cheese pizza was only ok. It didn't have much flavor. In fact, as sad as it is, the m&amp;c pizza from Cici's Pizza Buffet is actually better. So that says a lot. We also had the lasagna, steak burrito, and bbq chicken slices, which again were not very exciting. We actually ended up throwing away our leftovers instead of taking them home. And only offering overpriced cans of soda instead Â fountain drinks always knocks off a star.. . Maybe we came on a day when the guy who doesn't make very good pizza was working? Maybe this place would be better if you were drunk? Either way, for $3.75 a slice I wouldn't willingly choose to eat here again.
