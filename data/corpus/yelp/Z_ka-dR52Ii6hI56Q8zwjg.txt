Oh dearest Savoy.. You're where I met my girlfriend and you'll always hold a special place in my heart.. Yes indeed... . And your Hainan Chicken Rice still doesn't suck.. In fact, it's quite excellent! Your Shrimp Egg Rolls leave a little more to be desired, but your Chrysanthemum Tea still serves as a great compliment to my meal.. Yes, yes, keep up the good work and I'll keep coming back..
