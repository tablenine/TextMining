I attempted to eat here with some out-of-town friends the weekend of my 21st birthday, but we gave up when faced with a 90 minute (!) wait (to be fair, it was thanksgiving weekend.) I came back ages later with my girlfriend, and we had a (comparatively) shorter wait at 45 minutes. . . I was sort of amazed when I got the menu, because there are maybe a dozen things here altogether. I got an italian sausage grinder, and we split a salad, which came with some delicious homemade dressings. . . This place is tiny, and I wasn't initially prepared for the cash only policy (should have yelped it first, damnit), but the food is great if you don't mind waiting. The wait was made tolerable as we managed to snag seats at the bar, but I could see people getting agitated if one had to stand for the entirety of the wait.
