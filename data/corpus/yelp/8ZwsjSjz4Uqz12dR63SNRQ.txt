We were really hungry and in a rush because baby was sleeping. We decided to go for the bar instead of wait and I'm so glad we did. . . Fish served at the tables is excellent, but I think that they reserve some of the extra special cuts for the bar. When you are willing to shell out a little more, do it. . . For example: Got the Scallop sushi at the bar. Seasoned just right with lemon and sea salt, it was so much better than the same order I received at a table. Also, get the Toro. OMG. I had a flashback of Tsukiji. . . Tip: I have a better experience with the chefs in the middle area. I do not mean to disparage any of the other chefs but the older guy and the lean handsome chefs in the middle were so good to us. The perfect combination of friendly and hard core.
