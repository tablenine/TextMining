I do the 1/3lb beef burger on a honey wheat bun. . Toppings I like: Greek feta (yes, please), red onion, mixed baby greens, roasted corn and black bean salsa, and roasted red peppers. I have done the avocado and the bacon and have been happy every time! So good!. . The 1/3 burger is huge! With all of the toppings, it is an adequate meal ...sometimes bigger isnt better!. . I always get the Peppercorn steak sauce. It is similar to an Au Jus ...which you almost dont need because the burger is so juicy, but I roll with it anyways. I am a creature of habit. . . The place is great and good for crowds! Tons of choices and everyone gets what they want. A little on the pricey side, as a note.. . Dont try driving, unless you have a neighborhood decal. Walk or take the CTA.
