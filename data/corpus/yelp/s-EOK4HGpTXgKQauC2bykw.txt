Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Rule #1 You don't want to eat at an empty restaurant!. I've been coming here for a while now, and still love how people whine and complain about not being able to change their burger or can't find a seat... GOOD! This place is packed because it's good, I hate a lot of the ingredients on the Office Burger on an individual level, but somehow someway IT ALL WORKS BEAUTIFULLY... like the first time you saw a Cinemax late night film, you were confused, titillated, and happy in the end.. So go on off-peak hours, no happy hours or weekend dates... random Sunday afternoons or super early in the weekday will work for you!
