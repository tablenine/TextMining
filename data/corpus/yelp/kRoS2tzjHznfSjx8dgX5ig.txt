I see no reason to come here unless you're drunk and/or starving for another reason at 3am.. Never order anything but eggs/sandwiches and fries.. . I ordered the southwest salad- how badly could you mess up lettuce with fried chicken on top? Well, it was so bad I couldnt eat it. There was so much dressing (two kinds) that the lettuce was literally swimming in it. Â I would have sent it back- something I've never done, if the waiter had come by ever after bringing the dish. By the time a busboy appeared and asked to clear the table, I was no longer in the mood to eat.. . Oh, and $2.69 for a soda?
