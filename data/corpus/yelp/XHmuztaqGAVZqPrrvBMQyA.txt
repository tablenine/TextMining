First off, yes the pizza is a must try. I went with a group of four, we split two pizzas and two small plates (plus booze, of course) and all walked away happy without having overeaten. There's a good range of food too, from calamari to stuffed artichoke. . . All the waiters, hosts etc. were exceeeeeedingly nice (so nice, in fact, someone in our party thought she must've known me because no one is that nice to a stranger). Truth that they are all somehow magically good looking, but not in an intimidating way. Makes you feel like you're in a sitcom-- beautiful people! Everywhere! . . Service was pretty quick. We had to wait a little bit for a table but we were able to sit in the bar area in the meantime and soak up the lemon drops. For the atmosphere, location, and the quality of food you'll be getting, you'll be surprised when you get your bill and it's not there-goes-a-fourth-of-my-paycheck expensive. . . Be forewarned, this place is LOUD. Not exactly the restaurant you want to go to have an intimate conversation, but not deafening either. . . There's a ready-to-go section of the restaurant with pre-made dinners and all sorts of baked goods that I aspire to try one of these days. Certainly tempting!
