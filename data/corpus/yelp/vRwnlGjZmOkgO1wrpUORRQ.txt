Restaurant: Panahar Bangladeshi Cuisine
Category: Restaurants
There is seriously nothing better than their Thursday lunch all you can eat. They have a great variety of food selections, including desserts. The prices are so reasonable!!!!. . I went to eat here not very long after my cousin's wedding.... And let me tell you that the food was just about as wonderful as the catered Indian/Bangladeshi cuisine at the wedding. . . The restaurant itself is very cozy, and the staff there are just amazing. . . I love this place!
