Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
delicious! i liked the truffle burger the best (also tried umami burger and manly burger). the burger patties are thick and substantial and juicy. buns are good too. surprisingly liked the fries even though i don't usually love steak fries. tempura onion rings were good. house made ketchup was kinda watery and nothing special. aioli was okay, house spread was too sweet.. . must return to try the rest of the menu.. . NOTE: no longer BYOB, at least as of 8/18/09. no liquor license yet either.
