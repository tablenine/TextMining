Restaurant: Green Zebra
Category: Vegetarian
Appropriate name for a fabulous vegetarian restaurant, "Green Zebra"  Definitely a mealy fruit compared to any other vegetarian restaurant.  I know I always say this, but seriously if someone cooked for me the way Green Zebra did, I really would go back to being a vegetarian in a heartbeat.. . Blessed to have shared a wonderful experience of about 11 dishes and a amuse bouche, with my beautiful friends.  I thought about listing every dish I tried and describing what I loved about them, but instead I'll talk about my top three and you can experiment with the rest.. . Cauliflower - it comes as a spread with subtle hints of garlic and tahini, accompanied by perfectly toasted pastry.  Maybe it was the surprise factor that I fell in love with...who knew?. . Grits - I love how they take simple comfort foods, and bring them to a whole nother level.  Creamy wild mushrooms left me wanting to lick the plate.. . Desserts - order as many as you can.  They are the best desserts I've ever had and I don't have a sweet tooth, so when I say it's worth it, its worth it.. . Beet...one last beet!  As a beet lover, I typically order beets whenever I can.  It was pickled, crunchy and almost like a relish topping.  I'm still dreaming about them.  Ship them to me!!!  Better yet, open a franchise in SF, we have TONs of faithful tree hugging vegetarians.  Ok...maybe not tree hugging, more like it's the new yuppie;-)  But seriously come show the vege restaurants how it's really done.
