Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
Sushi + Thai food + BYOB may just be the best dinner combo ever!  Butterfly has always been our go-to place for group and birthday dinners.  The sushi rolls always look and taste good!  We always get the Godzilla Maki-- and the name pretty much speaks for itself.  This roll HUGE! I think that I'm a pretty big eater for a girl, but I would never attempt to eat this thing by myself.  Always make sure you bring some friends with you to share.  We also always get the pad thai and the beef pad siew.  These are not only delicious, but they give huge portions too.  Although they are usually busy, the wait staff have always been prompt and attentive.  The fact that they are BYOB, again, makes this a perfect place for a group birthday dinner.  Lastly, I can't get enough of those little almond roll cookies they bring with your check.  I haven't tried their new location yet, but word on street is that it's the same as the original location but bigger.  Sweeet.. . Oh Butterfly, I love you for simply existing!
