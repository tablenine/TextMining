Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I have not eaten dinner at Ugo, but I have gone for wine with meats and cheese and it definitely gets thumbs up for that.  I try to eat a meat and cheese tray whenever its available (well duh, I assume everybody does) and Ugo put the biggest stacks of meat on theirs that I have ever seen.  It was awesome - for $13 we had 3 different, all delicious meats, with about 8 slices of each - big slices, like what you'd put on a sandwich.  The cheeses were really good, too, and pretty big portions, plus came with the standard fixins - nuts, honey, fruits.. As far as the bar goes, they had a lot of really good wines and the setup of serving yourself one ounce at a time is really fun.  Plus, it helps with the mingling because everybody is walking around and reading the different descriptions and talking about the wines.  Also, if you get sick of paying $3.50 and up for a tiny taste, you can always order a glass of a more budget-friendly selection from the bar.. The atmosphere is cool - mostly 25-35s out for a casual night, but when we walked in last Friday there was one group of waaasted chicks giggling all over the place.  Also, if the weather is nice, there's outside seating and of course it's in downtown Culver City, so it has all that charm.. I can't speak to the dinner, but for a chill place to have some wine and cheese and MEAT, Ugo is cool.  Also, I'd definitely recommend it for a date because it's small and dark inside and it gives you a little bit of an activity to your drinking.
