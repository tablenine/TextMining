Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
One of my co-workers suggested this place for lunch and, having never heard of it before, and being somewhat in the mood for Chinese, I jumped on the chance!. . First off, this place is the epitome of, "Don't judge a book by it's cover."  From a rather nondescript exterior, with a sign on the door mentioning the business upstairs, I wasn't completely sure we were in the right place...  But once you get inside, it's BEAUTIFUL!  The seating was comfortable and the staff was unbelievably quick.. . I can be a rather picky eater...  O.K...  I'm a seriously picky eater.  I've always referred to myself as a meatetarian and I always order Chinese food without vegetables.  When our soup arrived, even though we ordered the same thing, mine had no vegetables!  I was seriously impressed with this attention to detail.. . And the rest of the food?  WOW...  It was done to perfection, the portions were big but not overwhelming and I walked away feeling full, but not stuffed.  And of course fact that lunch cost us each under $10, only makes it that much more impressive (If you go for dinner however, it will NOT cost you under $10.). . The only complaints that I can even think of are that the music was loud.  (I'm sure I could have asked them to turn it down, but it wasn't THAT bad.)  And the chopsticks were stainless steel.  Which, I've never seen before.  I'm used to wood or bamboo...  And these were rectangular, didn't grip the food well and sort of cut into my fingers with their edges.. . Regardless...  I can't wait to go back!
