I just discovered that this place is ridiculously close to my work!. . On my second visit to this establishment i decided to come on my lunch break today. It was nice and mellow (last time i came was on a friday night when it was loud and boisterous). I ordered my Mango Jalapeno. Half-way through waiting i realize i didn't tell them i wanted to go. So i told the server and cook about this and they gladly changed the order. I sat back down only to hear the cook say he'll put the brat on the grill immediately because he assumed i was in a hurry. I told him i wasn't and that there was no need and he could take the time he was originally going to take. . I was so taken aback by the cook's and server's concern! I usually find at other places that when you fail to let them know its take out they get really ticked off. Quite the opposite here! Such a surprise considering its in asshole-hipster central.For that - I give them an extra star!. . That story aside, this place is a great find! It reminds of the great late night brats and fries with the awesome awesome curry ketchup that i had in amsterdam. However this place's curry ketchup doesn't come close to the kind i had at the amsterdam flea market. . . *note to the owner/manager. the bar stools at the entrance are really uncomfortable. Get some better ones.
