We went there every Thursday for $5 pad thai. We went on a Monday for all you can eat sushi.  When we asked to take it home we were told we could not only to have them wrap up some sushi and charge us for it on top of the sushi.  They then explained they should have charged us more to take home the california rolI. should mention we had close to $50 in drinks.  We were looking at for our rehearsal night dinner but with the treatment we have decied to look elsewhere.
