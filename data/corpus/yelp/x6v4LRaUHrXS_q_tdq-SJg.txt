So after hearing about the infamous kogi truck, I was super excited to try it. Lucky for me kogi truck was in town and alas I could try the korean style burritos.  The menu is pretty interesting, ranging from kimchi quesadillas, short rib tacos, and even tofu burrito.  I ordered the short rib burrito (which has kimchi, egg, and spicy sauce) since people were saying that that was the best item on the menu.. . Unfortunately, I don't see the hype. The concept is an awesome idea and now there are plenty of other asian style trucks roaming around LA.  But the burrito itself, not nearly as tasty as I've imagined.  I've actually tried the fake kogi truck and thought that was better (they had rice in it)!  Now I will no longer be excited to hear when the truck comes by again... worth a try, but that's about it
