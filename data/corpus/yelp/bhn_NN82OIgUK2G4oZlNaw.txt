This place is amazing.. The one bad thing i could possibly think of and say is that it gets REALLY busy and full, so thats not good if your impatient, but in a way, being full is actually a good thing, because their food really is to die for.. Ive been coming to the Burbank location since it opened up because it was a freaking mission to get to the Glendale one and then there was way too many people in that one.. Its a very clean place and they play actual salsa and merengue and bachata, but they dont turn it up loud but leave it up just a bit to go with the atmosphere, so great job there.. And yes, they have amazing deserts, but their sandwiches like their Media noche and the Ropa Vieja are classic Cuban sandwiches and incredibly mouth watering. Even some of their less Cuban sandwiches like the pastrami are amazing.. Hands down one of the best bakeries around, and even if it is packed, trust me, the wait is totally worth it.
