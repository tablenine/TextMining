The CONs:. Parking in downtown is a pain in the a$$, so if you can mentally prepare yourself to get kicked in the pants by the parking fees ($4 an hour at a meter and an average $6 in lots), then you're golden. . . Don't make this the  place if you're planning a lunch meeting or catching up with a friend. You can't hear a thing.. . The PROs:. Everything else. The minute you walk in, it's like you've been transported to Europe (without the smokers). The white walls, marble counters, the variety of food in the deli area...ah. And the variety of food to choose from on the menu is fantastic. It makes it hard to choose. The meatball sliders were melt in your mouth good and the fries were fantastically seasoned. The price to everything isn't honestly that bad considering you can get a pasta dish with jumbo prawns or rib eye for $10-12.  The portions are smaller than U.S. standards (cuz we eat like pigs), so many may think they aren't getting their bang for their buck, oh but the food is oh so good. Desserts are $8 (which seems standard these days), but with the bakery up front, you have the option of picking up a pastry at the bakery area if you can't stomach the at-the-table price. . . If you are familiar with my reviews, you know that I take the restroom's cleanliness into account when I'm rating -- and I'm pleased to say that Bottega's is not only clean, but pretty with more white marble and fresh flowers to boot.
