Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I brought my mom here, who can depict less-than-stellar thai food in a heartbeat, and she liked it a lot! Not the absolute best in thai food, but DEFINITELY "VERY GOOD"! There's always a crowd (thus the new location!), so be prepared to wait! Personally, the only drawback for me is to loud music/karaoke towards the front of the restaurant. If you are unlucky and get a table near this area, you're going to wish you brought earplugs! The Tom Ka Kai soup is very good here, and if you can't handle the heat like myself, make sure to tell them you want it MILD! :)
