Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
Been to Lala's a few times now. I have to say...each time, I've become more impressed with this eatery, the service can feel a bit rushed..and the waiter's attitudes are hit or miss. But most of the time they have a sense of humor with just a touch of cynicism.. . Their food is delicious and consistent...chimichurri is good- albeit im not a big fan of oil, i prefer the chunkier stuff but I wont hold it against them. . . What got me last time was their white sangria. Deelicious! Light, fruity, and a perfect companion for a group of friends chatting the night away.
