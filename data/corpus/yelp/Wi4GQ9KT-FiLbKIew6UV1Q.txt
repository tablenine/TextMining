Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I'm so excited a restaurant such as Bottega Louie's has opened up in downtown LA! It's in a great location with delicious food at decent prices and on top of that it's just fun to be there! The restaurant is very spacious and clean. I love the simple white walls and high ceilings. I feel so refreshed just stepping into Bottega Louie. Now, onto the food and service. The restaurant was packed on a Friday night. We waited for approx. 15 minutes but didn't mind a bit because the waitresses are honestly just so friendly. Once seated, our server greeted us immediately and was so thorough on her service that I just want to go back again and make sure she services my table again! The artichokes were average, nothing too spectacular; however the lasagna is simply one of the best I've ever had. My mouth is just watering remembering how delicious it was. The clams and mussels were a good choice too. They are not stingy on their portions because my entire bowl was just full of CLAMS &amp; MUSSELS and nothing else. Very satisfying meal. I can't wait to go back to try their pizza now.
