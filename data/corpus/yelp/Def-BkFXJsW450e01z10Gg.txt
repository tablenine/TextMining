Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Food &amp; Ambiance is what you are paying for when you dine here. . Fogo de Chao is a beautiful marriage of buffet and upscale dining ambiance. The best of both worlds. I love big (and endless) portions, and I love swanky, upscale restaurant settings. . . PROs. Chargriled/broiled Meat, meat, and more meat. Service - constantly offering you more meat. Fire Pits . Ambiance. Salad Bar. . CONs. Pricey (but hey you get what you pay for). Snooty Crowd
