Went here with friends who come here frequently.  Definitely had an excellent experience.  Highlights include the Cucumber Salad and the fried tofu appetizers.  The fried tofu comes with a tasty barbeque-esqe sauce instead of the peanut sauce, which was quite good.  The noodles, curries and sushi around the table were excellent.
