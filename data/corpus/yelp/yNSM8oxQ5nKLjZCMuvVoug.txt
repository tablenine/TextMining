Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
When my friend suggested dinner at Spago, my first thought was "oh how delightfully 90's!" I'd never been to Spago though, so I went along with it.. . Pros: We sat out on the patio and it was absolutely gorgeous. The entire place is impeccable and will definitely leave an impression. Spago manages to be a large restaurant, but intimate at the same time. Our waiter was excellent and very knowledgable. Now for the food...I ordered the special sweetbreads appetizer which were crisp and perfectly savory. I also loved my shared dessert which was some sort of beignet type donut. Seriously, one of the best desserts I've ever eaten. Oh...and we saw Gwyneth Paltrow!. . Cons: Uh, pretentious much? Another friend was a little lost on her way there and called for directions. She asked them if they were east or west of some street, to which the girl replied "we're by RODEO." I also had the most overpriced bowl of soup. I think it was pushing $30. Sure it had duck confit and the waiter came and poured it out of a kettle, but it's SOUP! . . Spago is really a nice place, and I guess everyone should go once, but there are so many other great places to discover in LA with ambiance and better food.
