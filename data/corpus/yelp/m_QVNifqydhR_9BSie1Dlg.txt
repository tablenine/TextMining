My friends and I just had the most amazing meal at Sola- definitely a 5 star review!. . One of my friends just had dinner here this past Wednesday and liked it so much that she suggested we go back tonight.  I'm glad she suggested it because it just may be one of my new favorite restaurants! . . The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful and the service was great from the minute we walked in.  The drink menu alone got me excited and I especially enjoyed one of their specialties of black cherry effen and cream soda (my 2 favorite drinks combined).  We started with the lobster shitake dumplings (yum!) and then moved on to our entrees.  My friend and I shared the miso cod and the seared scallops. Both were unbelievable, but I preferred the scallops, which worked out well since my friend was all about the cod.  The other people at our table were also quite delighted with the tuna and shitake pad thai.. . The dumplings, delicious bread basket, and entrees would have been more than enough for us, but we still felt the need to go to town on the sides.  How could we possibly say no to truffle Parmesan french fries and mac &amp; cheese.  The fries were especially good...I was so full, but even thought about loosening my belt just to make room for more fries.. . Sola is by no means inexpensive, but I found it to be reasonable for the quality of the food. Our meal for 5 people was enough to feed 10 people and it came out to $50/person.  I will definitely be going back to try more things on the menu, as well as for some more truffle Parmesan fries!
