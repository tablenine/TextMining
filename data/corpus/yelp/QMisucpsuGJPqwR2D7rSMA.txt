I like this location for take out and I think the white pizza has been the best here. I've even gotten the salads to go and I haven't been disappointed. Pizza is my favorite food, so as I usually say it is hard to get it wrong with me, but I do distinguish between what is just okay and what is just darn good pie. This is darn good! . . This location also has a nice patio where you can pass the time munching on pizza and people watching the comings and goings along Ponce De Leon.
