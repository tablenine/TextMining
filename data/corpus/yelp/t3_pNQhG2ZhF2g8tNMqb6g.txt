I was visiting some friends who go to UofC and we decided to check this place out. Recently attracted the attention of food lovers and Obama lovers when it was revealed that Obama liked to dine here when he lived in Chicago. We came here on a weekday afternoon and we had to wait around 30 minutes for a table. We didn't mind since we weren't in a rush. We sat near the entrance and admired the wall filled with people's writings in permanent marker. The entire wall was covered with signatures, sayings, quotes, and just silly comments. If you come here make sure you bring a permanent marker with you so you too can claim a little spot on the wall for yourself. There are many other places to write as well, so bring a Sharpie and have fun doodling. When seated, my friend and I decided to order 2 dishes and split half with each other. We decided on the Han's Smoked German Ham pizza and Garbage Hamburger. Both were delicious especially the pizza. The pizza was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside and the just enough sauce without being too saucy. The hamburger I felt was good, but not great. All in all the food was pretty good. We also decided to order an apple pie to share among the four of us. The apple pie was one of the best I have ever eaten. Served warm with the crust soft but still a little bit crispy oozing with rich apples inside. Simply delish! The atmosphere is what makes this place exceptional to me. This is a good place to meet a friend for lunch and update each other on what has been going on in each other's perspective lives. It's coziness and comforting atmosphere makes this place a keeper. . . Interesting Note - Out waiter told us that Obama's favorite thing to order at Medici was the Garbage Pizza. And he would sit on the second level next to the balcony overlooking the first level. Us Chicagoians love us some Obamarama!
