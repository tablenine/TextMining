Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Red vinyl booths, families, and pizza/pasta. How can you go wrong? I had a combo pizza and pasta arrabiata (split between me and my friend, of course!). Pizza had a good crust, generous amount of cheese, and was just yummy. Pasta was... well, just fine. But the pizza is definitely the star at this family-owned establishment. Staff was warm &amp; friendly. Expect a wait for a table, though...
