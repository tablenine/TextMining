It was probably a week before her birthday and my sister had no idea where she wanted to eat.  I know how hard it might be to get reservations at this place but nothing stopped me when the question, "Where should we eat for my birthday?" was asked.  I enthusiastically (and sarcastically) replied, "Why don't we go to Cut?"  I saw my sister's eyes light up and knew right away I made the right suggestion.. . \We all spent the next day reading all the reviews and trying to get recommendations on what to order.  Kobe sliders and Wagyu steaks are very prominent in most of these reviews so we didn't skip those.  Although the other items we ordered were less memorable, we didn't get anything we didn't like; everything was great.. . When the steaks came out, mine was a bit charred and as I understand, that's how they're served.  I ordered mine medium but when I got it, I thought maybe I should've ordered medium rare.  I mentioned something to the waiter but said it in a way that I didn't want it to seem like I was complaining, because really, it was a bit charred to my liking but still tasted well.  Five minutes later, he comes out with a steak that was probably the greatest steak I've had in all my life.  I'm grateful to him for doing that and it was then that the $1200 meal was justified.. . There were 8 of us and $1200 at any other place would seem like a lot; this place is the exception.  I would not hesitate to recommend this place again when the same question comes up.
