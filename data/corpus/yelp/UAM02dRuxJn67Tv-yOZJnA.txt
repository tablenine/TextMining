I love this place. Simple modern decor, newly installed cooling system, lovely bulbs, beautiful flower arrangements..... . My new fave dish is the (organic)chicken pho. It has a very clean broth and comes with a garlic fish sauce to dip the chicken in.. . Also a lot of interesting looking people to stare at... Â : )
