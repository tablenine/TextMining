Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
To truly experience Din Tai Fung... line up on a Sunday morning at around 10:30 am and order the Sunday-only special Taiwanese  style dumplings.  The miniature juicy bursts of yumminess rocked my palate.. Their sunday special dumplings are limited so make sure to come early...and have your entire party with you.  It's delish and worth the wait!
