Although I did have to laugh at the prospect of calling yuppies in this hood "Dunlays"  I have to throw the smack down on the other yelpers.  This is NOT  a chain!  There is but one other Dunlay's and they own 4 others totes.  That is a small business peeps. Support them.  . . And that is a juicy burger!  The good is food and you know what I mean.
