Authentic Korean food makes for a list of interesting/entertaining things. Note that your meal comes with whatever you order from them menu, plus approximately 4 times as much food in appetizers. Suffice to say this is excellent if you have a good sized group, way too much if there are only two of you. Your meal includes:. . One whole fish, dropped directly into a fryer then right onto a plate.. Several bowls of  vegetables you may/may not have every heard of, in varying states of  "cold," "vinegary," and "squishy". A bowl of rice cooked in a burner. This is normal, but you can also opt for tea to be poured into the burner for it to soak into the leftover rice along the side. I call this "tea/leftover rice soup.". An egg for you to break open into and cook inside your scalding tofu bowl.. . Other things of note:. That's quite a zany guy on the cover of the menu. Wonder if it's a metaphor (for the zany food).. . Nice signing pad at the cachier!! (this is an important part of any meal)
