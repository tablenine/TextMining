Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Got this for takeout one night, as I live practically around the corner from it.  AMAZING.  I can't even describe how good this pizza tastes, other than to use the word SAVORY.  And crave-worthy.  It's so busy that it's hard to even get a phone-in order during their peak times, so this place is definitely a treat for me.  I'm not a huge fan of thin crust pizza, but Coalfire is doing something right.  I can't get enough of the stuff.
