i had the martha stewart dog and it was aaaaiigght. the line moved pretty fast but i don't really have a desire to wait in line for a run of the mill dog smothered in random toppings and named after some celebrity.. . frankly, i get more excited about the polish dogs at the end of a long day of Costco shopping... although now that i think about it, the lines at costco snack bars might be just as long..... . =/
