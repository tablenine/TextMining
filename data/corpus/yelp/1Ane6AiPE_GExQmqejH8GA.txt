This is my midtown brunch standard, even though you may have to wait a bit for a table on the patio during the spring. Their Bloody Mary bar definitely makes the wait go by faster and of all of the "Bloody Mary" bars I've experienced, I have to say Einstein's is by far the best. My Bloody Mary always ends up looking like some sort of funky contemporary floral arrangement w/ all of the asparagus, celery, little swords of olives, and pickles hanging out of it BUT the point is that they GIVE YOU all of these options, plus any spices and flavorings you can imagine. (I will suggest they add bacon salt next time.) . . The menu is a bit helter skelter but everything that I've ever had there has been GOOD and interesting. Lots of different flavors and good portions...I really just go for the bloody mary bar, though, that's my #1 prerogative. Brunch in a glass. . . I love the atmosphere of this place; I've been when it's dead and when they're busy and I always feel sexy. Probably still the Bloody Mary but I still love to be here. Will always return.
