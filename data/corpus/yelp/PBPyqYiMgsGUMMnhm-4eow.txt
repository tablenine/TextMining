The wait wasn't as long as we expected- about 15 minutes for a table for 2 on a Sunday morning. Although the outdoor coffee was empty, it was eventually refilled during our wait. Once inside, we had plenty of time to decide what to order. The menu has a lot of yummy sounding food. We eventually chose the huevos ranchero and the big boy benedict. Yum! Both dishes were incredible! The best part of the meal was that we were sitting right next to Tom Skilling from Channel 9. Can't beat an awesome breakfast sitting next to a superstar weatherman!
