Restaurant: Gato Bizco Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The cozy Gato Bizco is located in Candler Park, directly across the street from the Flying Biscuit.  This place has a very quaint feeling, which can be nice.  The food is not a "Flying Biscuit Killer" but is still very tasty.  I sampled the sweet potato pancakes, which were not too sweet and had a bit of spice to them, although I must admit I preferred the sweet potato pancakes over at Rise 'n Dine a bit more.  The veggie omelet was cooked well (ok it wasn't beautiful like an omelete at Food 101)  and hit the spot with black beans and sour cream.  I believe the omelet was cooked in cast iron, which is a plus in my book.  If you're in the area, I would say this place is worth checking out.
