I was at Yuri Japanese Cafe last night and decided to try Kogi to see what the hype was all about.  Their menu is very simple and easy to order.  You either choose tacos or burritos and you have your option of chicken, pork, short ribs, or even tofu for vegetarians.   . . They took a great concept, Mexican street tacos and Korean BBQ and decided to marry them off.  Definitely something to try at least once and possibly more if the line isn't too long.  The tacos are tasty, I personally liked the BBQ short rib ones.  I think these would be great finger "licking" foods with a cold beer!  It's one of those foods that leave your taste buds making you want another one.  I can see why people line up for it.  It's a new concept to the original street tacos.. . If anything you must try it at least once!
