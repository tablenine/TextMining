If you love spicy food, then you've gotta make the trek down here at least once. The bowls come out steaming hot, and if you order the spicier ones you'll end up clearing your sinuses with every inhale, not to mention their portions are gigantic. You can order your dish to your specific taste, which is always a plus. Not the best ramen place in the area, but definately worth a try if you've never been.
