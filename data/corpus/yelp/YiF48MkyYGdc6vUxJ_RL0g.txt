I've gone here more times than I can remember, all on the drug companys' tab.  I think that says alot about the type of food that they serve and that I like.  Sure, it's tasty and all, but what large slab of meat and sides drenched in butter and lard isn't?  The more important question is, however, would I pay for this out of my hard earned (and fixed) income?  Probably not.  You can definitely get better food elsewhere for what you pay here--something like Nook immediately comes to mind.  Sure, you won't get a half a bloody cow on your plate, but maybe that's not such a bad thing.  Anyways, despite my less than glowing review, I'm going again (!) next Thursday.  I know, you may be thinking that I'm a spineless hypocrite, but I couldn't agree more.  That's what happens when you're paid almost nothing, work a ton of hours, and fork over a ton of money for rent.  Thank god for pharmaceutical companies and the (supposedly) young, impressionable minds of the resident physician.  Three cheers for bitterness and no scruples!
