We did the Chef's favorite tasting menu, and there wasn't a single low note the whole meal. It can be difficult to rank meals but if this wasn't the best meal I have had in Chicago it is certainly up there. Each dish was flavorful, complex, delicious, and thoughtful. For example the pairing of perfectly seared and caramelized scallops, with rich, tender oxtail is not one that I thought would work well, but the subtle sweetness of each complemented the other perfectly and brought out flavors not there when eaten separately. The sum of each dish was better than the parts. Everything was executed to perfection.
