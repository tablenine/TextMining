I'll be very honest.  They try to put too many people in here all at once.  I felt as though the tables were on top of each other!  I'm not a huge sushi person, however, the group I was with was.  They loved their sushi.  I had the tempura and it was good.  I felt as though this place was way over priced.  They have an extensive drink list that was mighty tasty, but again, I felt over priced.  I doubt I'll be back, much in part to me not liking sushi and the feeling of claustrophobia.
