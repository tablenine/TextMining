Restaurant: Market

Their unique ways of presentation are actually quite annoying. The nachos came out on a akward stand with multiple layers for the dipping sauces that just ended up making it hard to navigate and messy.. . Some of the menu items are creative and fun, yet in my opinion, its overpriced for what you get....especially for that area. I'm sure Market was a good concept in theory, but in reality, they try too hard....and fall short. The food is good, I guess, but nothing worth the battle for parking.. . I have been here for lunch twice, so maybe they are more of a night spot.
