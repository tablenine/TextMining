the other day i had the tuna sandwich, baby spinach salad and tomato-bread soup.. . the soup was good, but not noteworthy. the salad was weak. . . however, both of them were overshadowed by the sandwich: the seared tuna sandwich is to die for. the bread was soft, toasted but not shrapnel-in-your-mouth crunchy, and the roasted red peppers complemented the tuna. perfect. absolutely perfect.
