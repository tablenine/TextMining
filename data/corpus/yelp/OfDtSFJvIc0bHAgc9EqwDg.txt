Endive Apple Salad Goat Cheese was delish!. . I went with a few friends and we tried everything from Diver Sea Scallops, Braised Beef Short Ribs and a bass dish. Scallops were perfect, the short ribs were over cooked. Â . . Ended the night with decadent chocolate banana bread pudding, Sorbets and a berry tart. . . Loved the service, our waiter was great!
