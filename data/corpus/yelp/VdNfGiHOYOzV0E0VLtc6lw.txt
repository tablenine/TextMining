Ate here again over the weekend, and although it had been awhile it was still a great experience.  For once didn't have to wait for a table, every table in this place is always filled.  Food came out at lightning speeds, I always order the lemongrass steak with cold vermicelli noodles &amp; shrimp.  My friend ordered the same and had only 1 piece of shrimp in her bowl, and they are still a cash only joint, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall their spring rolls are still my favorite item, they have great jasmine tea, and this is a great family owned restaurant (if you don't mind waiting for a table).
