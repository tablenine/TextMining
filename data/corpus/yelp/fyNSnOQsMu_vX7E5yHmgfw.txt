located right across the street from union station the place is an LA landmark.  that is why i think people will be easily swayed by it's history to give it high marks.  look it is good but the meat can sometimes be quite dry.  that's probably why you gotta soak it in the sauce.  cole's tastes better. . . if your in the mood for a quickie hot beef injection then come to philippe.   a no fuss sandwich cafeteria style with the cafeteria style sides and all.  the sides taste like they came from costco.  not that it is a bad thing but they just aren't much to fuss over.  . . it's packed at lunch so come here later in the evening to avoid the rushes.. . recommendations:  the horse radish mustard
