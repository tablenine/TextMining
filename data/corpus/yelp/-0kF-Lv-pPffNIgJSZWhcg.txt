Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I really like this place. i think Soowon Galbi will be my go to place for Korean BBQ. I've been there twice (two days in a row) and just from my experience it was pretty consistent.  The folks are very nice and accommodating. We got there kinda late (10 mins before closing) and they welcomed us graciously and didn't rush us during dinner. They even seated two other tables who came in after us. The cuts of  meat is very tasty. We usually go to Chosun Galbee for Korean BBQ.. and this was a great change from that. I wanted to find a place that was as tasty as Chosun but a little more low key and Soowon was a perfect for that. They have pretty good banchan and I really love the rice paper and the paper thin Turnip/Radish(?) that came with it. They also give you a large salad and soup. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the vents aren't that good and I kept getting smoke in my eye every time someone came and out of the restaurant. Also, the grill is very close to the edge of the table and I kept getting hot oil splatters from the meat onto my hands. . . Overall.. It's tasty, so go.
