This place is truly an experience.  Each table is in its own booth, closed by a small curtain, which is always gently openned by the servers saying something cute in Japanese when they enter.  (Although the bf said it reminded him of being in a horse stall because he used to raise horses when he was younger.)  You would never tell from the outside that it has three floors!  It's definitely a nice place to impress a date.  . We ordered the omakase...which is a great deal for all the food you get!  It's one of those meals where you look at the small servings and think that you're gonna need a slice of pizza afterwards, but we definitely were nice and full by the end of the last course.  Everything we had was delish, I would name each course, but they change up the menu every 5 weeks, and what we had is not on the menu anymore.  One of my faves was the dessert!  We had this sake cheesecake that was INCREDIBLE!  Something about the sake and creamy cheesecake just went SO well together!  It was undescribable!  This omakase has a mixture of sushi and cooked food...I kinda felt like I was on Top Chef!  It was great!. This is a great place to take your fellow foodie friends and also a place to impress a date.  You have to go!
