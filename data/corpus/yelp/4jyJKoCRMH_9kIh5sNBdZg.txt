OK, so there we are walking downtown on a Friday afternoon becuase we got out of work early. Were headed for the famers market by my buddies apartment, and as we round the corner (holy $#!+) there is the KOGI TACO TRUCK!!! And whats that you say, NO LINE! NO WAY!!!. . We run over and dissect the menu with our eyes, while the men are at the grill ready and waiting. . . "Can you believe it?". . "Giggles" (like little school girls). . "WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?" I ask my friends. . .Were all laughing, and giddy. Carl squeeled, and Brian snorted.. . "NO REALLY I INSIST YOU GO FIRST" I say to my friend.. . He steps up and begins to order, and the gentleman in the truck says (wait for it):. . "I'm sorry were reserved for the afternoon, by a private firm.". . I almost passed out, Carl dry heaved a little, and Brian started crying. After everything I have heard about these trucks I never thought it would go down like this.. . Maybe someday, although after reading the reviews I will not wait in line for an hour. Possibly 15-25 mins but not over a half hour.. . Maybe next time the Kogi gods will smile upon us.
