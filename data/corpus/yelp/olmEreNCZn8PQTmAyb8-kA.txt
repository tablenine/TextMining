Not as good as mom makes, but still pretty good. Try their Pollo al Ajillo which is juicy and delicious, and will promise to keep the vampires away with the amount of garlic... especially that annoying Edward. Their plantains and yuca are a little dry but that probably means they're not cooked in lard like grandma used to do. I also enjoy the Chuletas al Carbon for a spin on American-style pork chops. Try the fig and flan dessert if you can fit it in.
