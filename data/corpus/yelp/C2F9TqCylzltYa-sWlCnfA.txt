I've been brunching at this place twice now, and I love it! They serve a great breakfast thats delicious and reasonably priced. Next time there's time to kill before class and I'm pondering about a Dunkin Donuts breakfast meal, I'll think again. There you get a sandwich and a coffee, here you get the whole she-bang for an extra $2. Sorry DD.
