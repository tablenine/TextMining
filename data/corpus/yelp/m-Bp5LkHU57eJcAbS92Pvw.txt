Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
I've been wanting to try CUT for the longest time, and I finally came here last Friday. I wasn't actually all that impressed with the American Wagyu, it was fatty and tender but I can't call it amazing. My friend who ordered a medium-rare steak turned out to be well done, they still made him another one after he finished half of it. The sides were alright, the mac and cheese was a little thick and salty, but the appetizers exceeded expectations. The tuna tartare and pork belly were so goooooood. The food took forever to come, but they had 5 waiters laying down the steak at the same time (there're 5 of us) which made me feel special.. . But, seriously, wasup with the chairs???? They look like office chairs. I know they're going for a contemporary design, but the chairs are just so out of place... . p.s. Check your bill, they accidentally charged us a bottle of sparkling water which we didn't order. Our waiter happily adjusted it for us.
