I've only been here once, but it was enough to make me want to return again and again.  My date and I came early on a Saturday, with a reservation, so getting a table and prompt service was not an issue.  We also brought our own bottle of wine.  Although it was a bit small, I enjoyed the decor. . . But what I REALLY enjoyed, were the chick pea cakes!!!  They were soooo delicious.  As were the sweet potato fries, asparagus, and mushrooms, but the chick pea cakes really took the...... cake.  :)
