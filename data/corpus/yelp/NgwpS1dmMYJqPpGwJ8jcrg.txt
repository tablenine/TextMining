I definitely like this place better than the original mostly due to the extra space and extra people to take your order, they also appear to have more beer and hard drinks.  Also parking does not appear to be an issue at this location.  Food is the same which is to say that it is amazing.  I won't spend too much time on the burger and that horse has already been sufficiently beaten, but I would give it 6 stars.  Tried the oatmeal stout ribs and they are unbelievable, we had with La Fin Du Monde which is a Belgium style Canadian Ale, outstanding combination.  I will be back often.
