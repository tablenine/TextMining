Note: This review is ONLY for dessert! . . We stopped here for dessert today. I got a peach fried pie and a frosted orange. Yum! The peach fried pie was tasty and smelled amazing. . . The frosted orange was definitely my favorite though. This is sure to be one of those things I can't get where I live and will miss and have to go to when I visit the city. It tastes just like a push up ice cream from when I was a kid, but you can drink it through the straw. Try it so you can be addicted too :)
