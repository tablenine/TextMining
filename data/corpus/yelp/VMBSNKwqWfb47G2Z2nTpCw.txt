Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
We just returned from our dinner at Parker's on Ponce. Wonderful experience.   It's located in the old Mick's building, across from the Starbucks in Downtown Decatur.. . We both had the house salad, a nice field green mix with dried cherries and a Gorgonzola vinaigrette. Yum! For my entree I had the special, a blackened Cajun rib eye with asparagus and potato wedges. My partner had the 6 oz fillet with sauteed spinach. Both were cooked perfectly and seasoned well.   . . For dessert we split the house made bread pudding with a white chocolate/Maker's Mark sauce......needless to say there was nothing left on the plate! . . The service was pleasant and professional. The only negative was that we were seated next to the front door and it was freezing! But the food made up for that! . . I'm already looking forward to our next visit.
