I love going to places like this! Casual and quick. . . I suggest calling ahead to make a reservation. A party of 6 or more is the key. There was definitely a line outside. We walk right passed the people waiting outside as they glared at us. To our surprise we had our own private room (at back) with curtains to shut out the busy crowd.. . 3 0f 7 ordered the omlete topped with caviar (sorry can't remember the exact dish). Awsome! The services is great and the people are friendly.. . I need to come here again!
