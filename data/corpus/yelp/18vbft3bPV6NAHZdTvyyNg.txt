I was eating lunch in here today, thinking, "I gave this 5 stars, didn't I?". Okay time to update. 5 stars for "as good as it gets" meaning as good as pho gets. For beginners, its noodle soup. Not exciting, you think? Well, its a particularly delicious broth, into which they put very thin slices of raw beef. Its so hot the beef cooks. They bring you a plate of accoutrements. I put in all the bean sprouts first to soften them up. There is fish sauce in Kikkoman jars to season, and a slice of lime to squeeze in. Â Then tear up the thai basil and sprinkle in. I love the thai basil, and if you don't then I am sorry for you. There is a little bowl, pour a bit of the barbeque sauce in, and some sriracha pepper sauce to taste (just watch everyone else). You dip your sliced beef in that before devouring. Pour some of the sauces into your soup too but first enjoy it pure! If you are feeling extremely cool you can get the meat raw and dip it in yourself to cook it. Thats what the natives do. I suggest if you are new to order #13, with "rare sliced beef". I get large cause I am a gannett, but even small is large. Almost every customer is Viet, which tells you that it is good. It is super efficient and you will get your food FAST!.  I was sitting there thinking about how much better Atlanta is in 2009 than when I arrived in 1975, with all the great cultural diversity here. My complaints? Straighten out the bathrooms please, and put a smile and a thank you on the face of the check out girl, I come here really often! Just say thanks!
