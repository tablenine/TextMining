These people have been doing this for a while. You would imagine they have this thing down. But no. The truck arrived more or less on time and we had to wait and wait until the guy decided to start taking orders as if he was writing  down an essay . No menu was visible but they passed fliers which is just plain dumb. And most of the coin counting and napkin hangin' could have been in advance.  They were scheduled for noon and it took them 45 minutes to serve 5 people. Never again Kogi truck. . Oh, mmyeah, the food. Sure, it was good, on the smallish side but tasty. Not worth the aggravation when you can just as well go to nice location and eat even better korean food quickly and sitting down. They either get their act together or this is a fad that will die a sudden death.
