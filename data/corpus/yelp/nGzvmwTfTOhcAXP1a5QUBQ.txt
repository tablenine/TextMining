As an avid sushi fanatic, I have to say that Nakato is without a doubt my favorite sushi joint in Atlanta. Why? The most important reason is the sushi is fresh and delicious EVERY time. Definitely take a seat at the sushi bar so you can get a view of the chefs working their magic. Secondly, the service is consistently good. The servers are very attentive and helpful if you want a suggestion on what to order. Third, the prices. They're extremely reasonable. A few recommendations: try the Crunch roll. It is so delicious - just the right blend of shrimp and crunch to take your tastebuds over the edge. You will gobble it up in 4 seconds flat. The rock and roll is an eel roll with avocado and a wonderful sweet drizzle on top. The spicy tuna roll melts in your mouth and isn't so spicy that it's overwhelming. It has just the right amount of kick. Actually, every roll is excellent but I'm hoping to try some of the other things Nakato offers like Hibachi - if I could only get past the sushi bar.
