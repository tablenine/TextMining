Be forewarned...this place will cause one serious case of whiplash.. . From the amazing looking plates being carried to every table around you to the ridiculously, ridiculously good looking people (I think I envisioned about 8 future family Christmas cards while dining there), you feel like you are watching a really fast-paced tennis match.. . Instead of opting for a breakfast item (since was almost 3 pm), I ordered the Jalapeno Chicken pita (hummus, grilled onions, tomatoes, etc.) with onion rings. Note to the ladies: this is not a date-friendly dish, it looked like I had taken it out back and roughed it up a bit by the end. Things were spilling out from everywhere...not cute, but definitely tasty.. . To end the meal on a sweet note, I split a chocolate peanut butter cupcake with my friend. I'm not a huge cupcake fan and neither is he, but we didn't even let a minute pass and the entire thing was devoured. Â Clearly we both weren't going to let such a good thing go to waste.. . Funny enough, neither of us had toast.
