"Let's go inside and eat," says Frank, who proceeds to walk behind the truck.. . "Aww...sweet, they actually have a sitting area inside the truck?  That's totally cool, I've never seen any truck do that," says the naive Debbie.. . "NO Debbie, inside the bar," Frank grumbles.  . . "Oh," says Debbie who obediently follows behind Jane K and Frank.. . How I got through college I don't know.  But, what I do know is Kogi (or so I thought was Koji) is freaken awesome.  . . 1 Spicy Pork Taco. 1 Short Rib Taco. ---------------------------. $4.00 (thanks Jane for treating me!). . These things are packed with flavor, so you must get it with soda, or purple drink ( sorry Dave Chapelle's episode on purple juice just popped in my head).  I took off 1 star since it wasn't as crispy on the outside as I'd hope.  Also, if you're a girl and haven't had dinner yet, eat three.  If you are a pig and your name is Debbie, eat 5.  If you're a skinny girl name Jane, eat 10.  If you're Frank, just steal from others.. . We also had kim chi quesadilla.  It tastes exactly how you'd imagine it.  Not sure how much it costs.. . Come prepared with gum, listerine, and lemon to kill the aroma on your hands.  I wish this wasn't so far  and that it wasn't like a cat and mouse chase trying to find this place.
