After reading the reviews, I think I came to Cleo's with unrealistic aspirations.  I had high hope for the food and I found it to be mediocre at best.  The fries were standard and my portobello sandwich was meager for the price.  They had some fancy beer but the selection wasn't overwhelming.  Why all the starts you may ask?  The decor was so fantastic and cozy that I could see myself becoming a regular.  It just felt so darn comfortable.  The people in the party I was with all had hamburgers and thought they were delicious.
