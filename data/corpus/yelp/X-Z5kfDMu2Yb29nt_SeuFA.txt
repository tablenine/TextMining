Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
My friend Evan put it perfectly:. "Food wins, Service loses. Did I get a amazing burger? Yes! Did my server huff glue before approaching our table? Probably. WIll I go back? Yes.". . 4.5 for awesomely tasty &amp; unique burgers. -2 for service.. . ALL IN ALL: Awesome food, shitty service (so far...only been once). If you're onn/near La Brea. Go.. . Service: really, really bad. Yes it was semi-packed, but yes there are 8 tables, between 3 people. on a Sunday. It's not hard to check in with us every 15 minutes, or maybe get us water after you ask us what we want to drink. both servers were very inefficient and out of it. even with the manager(owner?) there.. . Ambiance: nothing special- not bad, just nothing fancy. simple. decent bathroom.. . Food: awesome. such succulent burgers. the MANLY BURGER is what I got, and what you should DEFINITELY try when you go. so awesome. just so filling (for ingredients check out someone else's post, it's been posted a bunch of times).. . And how is it VS. 25 Degrees you ask? 25 is a little pricier but all in all I'd rather go to 25 degrees- though it depends on the situation. Umami is a lot less frills in terms of environment, and not 24 hrs. Foods about the same quality, maybe a little bit better ingredients at umami, but not as much variation.. . TIPS: . -so even though you're like, how can i survive off of 8-10 fries? the burgers are so filling, that you really don't need much more. 3 girls and I shared one thing of onion rings and one thing of fries and we were all very satisfied. . -you might want to bring your own ketchup &amp; bbq sauce. their ketchup is sort of weird, albeit homemade. -there's no diet coke. so uh, byodc? too.. -there's a liquor store caddy corner to it- so if you forget to bring booze, there is a booze outlet conveniently placed.
