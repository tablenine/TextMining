I had lunch here with my best friend today.  Nice chinese restaurant.  I had shrimp lo mein and wonton soup.  My friend also had the shrimp lo mein  and egg drop soup.  Both the egg drop and wonton soup were good.  Service was great, we were seated right away and our food did not take long at all.  . . The shrimp lo mein was good, but also with the meal they give you one fried chicken wing.  I didn't understand this? We also got an egg roll, which that makes sense, but one chicken wing?. . Pros: good food, quick, dine-in/carry-out, good service. Cons: it went right through me, the one chicken wing?
