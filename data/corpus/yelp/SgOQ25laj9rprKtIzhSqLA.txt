Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
All-u-can eat Korean BBQ. That pretty much sums it up.  Eat your entire weeks portion of meat here and go veg the rest of the week to stay healthy.  As for the meats stick with the boneless BBQ and the brisket. .   I went on 6/10, and it was $16. This place will definitely satisfy your craving for meat.
