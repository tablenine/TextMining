I almost canceled my reservation today and did not go after reading some of the bad reviews... luckily, I did not. My boyfriend has been wanting to try this place since his birthday February but we weren't able to get a reservation large enough for eight people. We finally decided to make it out for our anniversary and we were both very pleased.. . Since we were on a budget, we kept it simple with tap water and no appetizer. (I must say though... Bone marrow al forno and Tricolore with Parmigiano Reggiano &amp; anchovy dressing both sounded very tasty!!). . It came out to $45 and we had:. -Pizza alla benno: Speck, pineapple, jalapeño, mozzarella &amp; tomato $16  - spicy/sweet combination was great!! I love when a dish has a pepper in it and you can feel the kick!. -Coach farm goat cheese, leeks, scallions, garlic &amp; bacon $16  - The leeks and scallions on the pizza were an excellent combination. It gave it a sweet and earthy taste and the bacon was not overcooked or too crispy, nor was it greasy!. -Butterscotch budino, Maldon sea salt &amp; rosemary pine nut cookies $9 - which I decided to try because of all the reviews and boy, was I pleased!! The salt with the sweetness of the butterscotch and caramel was a wonderful, melt in your mouth, balanced combination. . . Service is not spectacular but luckily the food was good and I LOVED the thin and crispy crust. The crust is nice and crispy too and as others have said, do not let the pizza get too cold.
