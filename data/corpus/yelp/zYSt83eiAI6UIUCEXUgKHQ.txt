If there's one thing about me, I LOVE Japanese food. Most of the time i'm a part-time vegetarian but I seriously cannot stop myself from horkin' down everything at this little place. . . Yes. I know the wait times are ridiculous. 2 hours is about average wait time. I know it's kind of a small place, the staff isn't the sexiest and the shop isn't the cleanest, but they really make up for it in hospitality. The staff is very friendly and definitely try their best to accommodate everyone. Also, do not attempt to have one person wait for them to call your name after 2 hours. They will not seat you if all of your party isn't present. It's always packed, you're never going to run into a day or time when it isn't. . . Anyway, I always get the large plate of meat, it's so delicious with the sauces. If this is your first time, it's ok to look around and figure out how to get the meat cooking. I've seen the older man give a quick tutorial to other guests if they look too lost. Don't be intimidated :]. . . I'm a sucker for the rice. It's so moist and perfectly cooked, I down about 4 or 5 bowls when I'm here, in addition to polishing my plate. Delicious.
