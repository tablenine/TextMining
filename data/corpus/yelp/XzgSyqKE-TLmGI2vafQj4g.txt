Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
It had been a good while since I'd been to Buckhead Diner, and yesterday I enjoyed a return visit over a business meeting. My companion is very much a regular so we were treated to excellent service. We also went around 4pm, which is perfect if you're looking for a good time to talk and to get lots of attention since you'll be between the lunch and cocktail/dinner crowds.. . While I've enjoyed entrees like their sea bass on previous visits, we noshed on two of their best apps - the homemade potato chips with blue cheese (healthy? nah. delicious? yep!) and the calamari. Their calamari is sort of marinated in a sweet apricot-like sauce (rather than having any dipping sauces on the side, as often is the case) and has a slightly spicy flavor thanks to the peppers cooked in with the squid. Very good.. . The booths are cozy and perfect for laying out papers and quite conducive to conversation.. . At this time of day, valet is optional, which I kind of like. It was nice to be reminded of a spot I'd not thought of in a minute, and I've put Buckhead Diner back on my to-visit-for-dinner-soon list!
