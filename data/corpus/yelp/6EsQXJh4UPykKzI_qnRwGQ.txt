The food makes this place so hard to review. It's great, the food, but everything else is so damn weird. Tons of employees, and they all seem a little lost, like you stumbled into a place that's supposed to look like a restaurant but isn't one. The music was better on my most recent visit than prior ones, something a little more palatable than the Eighties b-side parade that's usually streaming by. What's consistent, though, above all, is the quality of their brunch. It's four-star eats in a two-star package.
