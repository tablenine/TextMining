Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
I got invited to my boyfriend's family dinner at the last minute, and I had never heard of Ford's Filling Station prior to this dinner, so I didn't know what to expect at all. Looking at the menu though, I could tell that the food would be "different." . . Food was indeed different and interesting. Some things were very delicious, while others were more interesting than tasty. Service was great, and the food came out quickly and well-prepared. Atmosphere is relaxed and casual. . . FOOD. (1) Salted Cod: Interesting. It's a mixture of potato and cod that you smear on tasty garlic toast. Subtle flavors, so nothing too overwhelming. Worth trying. . (2) Bacon Wrapped Dates: Delicious. Great combination of salt and sweet. Small portion, and a must-order. . (3) Cured Meats: Salami was the best. So thinly sliced that it melts in your mouth. They didn't have headcheese when we went, which was disappointing, but I heard it's delicious. Maybe next time. . (4) French Fries: Slightly better than the usual. Nice to snack on, but you don't have to get it. . (5) Kobe Cheeks: Meat easily tears apart. No need for a knife. Too gelatinous for my taste, so I wouldn't get it again. . (6) Onion Rings: DELICIOUS. I don't know how they fry 'em, but they're SO good. Gotta get an order for the table!. . I'd definitely go again to try other items on their menu.
