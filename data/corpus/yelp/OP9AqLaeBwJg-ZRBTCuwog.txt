Innovative flavor for foodies looking for an different kind of spicy tacos.. . I've known about Kogi for a while but hesitated because of the rumored hour-long waits. Got to the Torrance location at 8pm on Saturday and there were two trucks--one for tacos, burritos, and quesadillas, and one for just tacos and burritos. Felt like I won the lottery when I saw the tacos and burritos line had only 2 other people!!. . LESSON: upon arrival, make sure you send one of your minions to hold your place in line, and another one to scout for the secret second truck just in case :). . Not super hungry, we ordered 3 short rib tacos and one each of the spicy pork and spicy chicken tacos. I'm pretty sure 95% of the people would fail a blind taste test because all 3 meat types taste roughly the same due to extreme heaps of spices and veggies, and lack of meat. You would think at $2 a pop, they can afford to spare some more meat!. . With that said, I LOVED the flavor--not too spicy or salty, and VERY JUICY. Two of my guilty food pleasures are Korean BBQ short ribs and Mexican food, so for me the mix was heaven! My favorite part of the tacos are definitely the tortillas, which are slightly crispier than normal. This is definitely one of those things I would crave every once in a while.. . Would totally give it 4 stars if it were meatier.. . A fun side note: go with an open mind and you can meet some hilarious people and bond over your taco stalking experience.
