Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Cute, tasty and fun.. . I absolutely love the look of Bottega Louie.  High ceilings, white marble, and black leather booths.. . I absolutely love their french toast.  Huge slices of brioche, fresh berries on top and syrup. Couple this with a soy cafe au lait and it is heaven!  The salmon eggs benedict is really good too.  As well as the steak and eggs.  Their portebello mushroom fries are great and their chocolate souffle is to die for!. . Parking can get a little tricky, but this is LA.
