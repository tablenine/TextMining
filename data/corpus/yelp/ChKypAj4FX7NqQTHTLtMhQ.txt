Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Wow!!! Gelato love definitely exists here... especially since Ugo sells more than just gelato. Some great coffee, and little pastries also reside here.. . If you live in Culver City and have some time to kill (maybe you just stumbled out of chicken coma from Honey's) definitely stop by Ugo and have a seat... people watch. But whatever you do, do not leave without trying their gelato. Definitely the best in the area....
