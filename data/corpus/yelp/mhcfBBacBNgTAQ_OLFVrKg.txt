I have been wanting to try this place from the reviews, but I thought this place was just ok. Not disappointed. I just don't understand what the hype was all about. The food was satisfactory, service was ok, the place was clean. Sure, better than those chain breakfast places but their menu is more extensive (ok of course heheh).  Worth a try.
