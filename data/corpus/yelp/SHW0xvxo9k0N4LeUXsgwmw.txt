Went on a trip to Chicago and loved the deep dish pizza, but still needed my Asian food fix for the weekend. My big sis had the kimchi fried rice, which is amazing... and I had the Tom Yum soup. If you haven't tried it yet, I definitely recommend it. The menu is HUGE... so huge with so much variety that making a decision on what to order kinda stresses you out :( haha but regardless of what choice you make in the end, I guarantee Joy Yee's can satisfy any craving! Cheap prices, delicious food. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!
