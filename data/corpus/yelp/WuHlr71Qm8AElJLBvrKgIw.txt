Gentlemen, if you want to get lucky (not sure in what way but whatever you got in you head) this place is good if you want to impress.  Yeah, if you got a client in town, this place ain't bad either.. . Not sure how great the food is, but there's something amazing about  an unexpected restaurant popping up in the hills with all the city lights in display during the night.
