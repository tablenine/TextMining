After being a yelp visitor so many times, and that as a reviewer, I wish there were half stars.  I feel like craft was more like a 3.5 star restaurant. I am giving it a four because the ambiance was great and the service was stellar, but the food while for some dishes were fantastic, foie gras anyone? For others like the sturgeon, the dish was considerably subpar.. . The second thing that really knocks off that full star from a five to a four is that I really would not have an interest in going back.  I had a great one time experience and that's all it would be.  I would have to be invited by someone to head back to this place cause the prices were just above what I thought would be reasonable.
