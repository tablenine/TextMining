I came here after reading all the great reviews because I am always looking for a great salad but none of their salads sounded that great to me, so I had the angus flank steak sand which with a simple salad for $10. It was ok, but I've had better steak sandwiches. I'm not a healthy eater so maybe that is why I did not care for this place, but if you are a healthy eater you will probably like it. I'll stick with the steak salad from Damon &amp; Pythias in Westwood.
