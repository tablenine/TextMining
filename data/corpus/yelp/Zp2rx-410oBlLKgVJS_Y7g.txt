Restaurant: Gioco
Category: Italian
Gioco is my favorite higher-end Italian restuaraunt when I'm not in the mood for fettucine alfredo or a huge bowl of spaghetti. (In those cases I turn to the Rosebud on Taylor Street) The ambiance is lovely, the wine list has plenty of great by the glass options &amp; the food is wonderful. I always seem to order the ricotta &amp; spinach toretellini but the daily risotto has always been tasty (creamy &amp; flavorful!), the veal entrees are perfectly cooked, &amp; even the pizzas are light and full of flavor. I love the open kitchen, and I have to recommend the "fried" eggplant appetizer. I've never been able to save enough room for dessert! It is also nice that they have valet service &amp; spacious bar to sit in while you wait for a table.
