Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
you dont know pastrami until you have it here.... most places serve you a grease bomb with pastrami and call it good. and i actually have eaten it many times... its great when youre looking for something to absorb those shots of tequila you took all night... but for lunch, unless you want to pass out at your desk the rest of they day, you want something 'healthier'.... the pastrami here is not greasy at all, thinly sliced, soft, and delicious... . the french roll they serve it ons is nice and soft too.... the pickles and fries are good also.... granted, it comes out to 16+ for sandwich, fries, drink... but damn its great pastrami!
