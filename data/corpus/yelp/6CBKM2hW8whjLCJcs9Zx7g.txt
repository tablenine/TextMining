The Skate Grenoblaise and an excellent waiter made this visit better than it would have been if either hadn't been up to par.  Throw in a complimentary glass of bubbly and it was bumped up to a very good experience.. . The decor is an updated spin on the Brasserie, but it still has the din/roar of diners chatting.  On one side it's an ear splitter, on the other side it is possible to have a private conversation if you lean in over the table.. . We came in during the lunch rush, but still got very good, friendly service.  The food came out quickly and as ordered.  My lunch date had the French Onion Soup and Steak Frites.  I had the Salade Frisee aux Lardons followed by the much desired Skate Grenoblaise.  We finished up with the Brioche Pudding (splendid) and the Tarte Tatin (not great...but taken off our tab).  It was a little pricey, but we did the full experience, one cocktail, appetizers, entrees, desserts and tea.. . Our wonderful waiter and the support staff were extremely attentive, professional and friendly.  On our way out the manager or owner, a very dapper gentleman, thanked us for our visit.  It was a very nice way to spend a few hours.  The next time I've got a yen for back home favorites, Comme Ca will be on my short list.
