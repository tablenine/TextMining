Restaurant: Pure Taqueria - Inman Park
Category: Mexican
So much potential.  Such a great location.  But OMG, SO !@#$%^&amp;* LOUD.  Seriously, I registered zero enjoyment of my first (and last) meal at Pure, mostly due to the fact that I couldn't hear myself think, let alone carry on a conversation with my husband.  The food was decent--crab fritters were too heavy on the spicy sauce, enchiladas were fine, and my quesadilla had fresh ingredients (even though I didn't like the corn tortillas)--but jeebus, I just can't handle a place where I have to scream my order to the server and then pray that it all comes out correct.  Maybe I'm an old fart, but I don't want dinner to induce a migraine.  The tequila is supposed to do that.
