Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Fathers Office is as good as they come.  The burger is phenomenal, the beers are great, and the sweet potato fries are off the hook.  I love this place so much that if you told me that I wouldn't be able to eat this burger unless I gave up one of my kidneys, then I'd be on the surgical table within minutes.  So why only 4 stars?  Well the "toastiness" of their bread is sometimes questionable, and I'm very picky about my buns (especially when they're holding my burger).  Other than that this place is deserving of a Best of LA sticker!. . I'd recommend getting the Hinatachino white ale while you're waiting for your burger to arrive.  Its got all the character of a Belgian White and goes down quite smoothly.  Plus its pretty hard to find, so when I see it get a bit wet. . . Say what you will about Fathers Office, but it is truly one of LA's best burgers.  It can get a bit crowded at times, but what place worth a damn isn't.  The staff is friendly and the bartenders are cool so grab a burger, stay for a few drinks, and enjoy this not so secret LA gastropub.
