best, cheap(er) sushi place in LA! portions are great, prices are great. service = ehhhhhh, but forgivable. wait = sucks. atmosphere = typical japanese-y restaurant. . . cash only is the worst part. cash only sucks, but they have an ATM in there at least, so you won't find yourself having to run 5 blocks over to get cash to pay for your meal.
