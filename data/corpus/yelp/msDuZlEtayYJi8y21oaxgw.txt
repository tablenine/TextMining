Hmm I've been getting the distinct impression that people either love or hate this place.  I'm try to be the exception.  I tried this place during the dineLA month of January.  Okay for some reason I was only one of two men in the place.  Women out numbered men 10-1, not bad odds, then again all the waiters were men.  Good decor, but strange music for a tapas place, I don't normally figure alternative in a spanish tapas restaurant, now onto the food.. . - Lomo Embuchado and Garocha - cured pork loin &amp; aged goat cheese on raisin tostado.. (This was fantastic, powerful flavors, really wakes up your palette, the raisin bread was interesting, can't say I completely enjoyed the raisins, but I'd get this again; comes with 4 pieces). . - Wood Oven Fired Flat Breaded with caramelized onion, egg, pimento &amp; manchego.. (Not the greatest thing, just a jumble of all the ingredients, I'd consider this filler and wouldn't order again; cut into 2 pieces). . - Bacalao Salt Cod Cakes with aioli. (Mild in taste, nothing extraordinary about this dish, looks like mini crab cakes, only the flavor was lacking; comes with 4 to an order). . - Spanish Style Barbequed Skirt Steak marinated In Orange Juice &amp; Paprika . (Fantastic bold flavors, tender and juicy, large portion, can be shared with 2-4 people). . - Paella - Mussels, Clams, Prawns, Chorizo, Chicken and Saffron Rice.. (Rice was cooked perfectly, the paella was pretty standard, which is good cause at least you know you not getting something bad.). . Dessert. - Churros and Chocolate. (Not one of my favorite dishes.  The churros themselves tasted pretentious and over cooked.  . . - Flan. (Fantastic, very tasty, thick and give you a grand ending to a great meal). . Service:4. Food:3. Decor:3. . Would I go back?  If I was in the area and had a hankering for tapas, then yes I'd go back.
