Went back to Bossa Nova last night for dinner. It was chilly, but it was nice because they had their heaters. We got there around 9 PM and it was still pretty crowded. They told us 20 minutes... we were seated in less. Hooray!. . I ordered Gisele's favorite and my boyfriend ordered the grilled lamb chops. The chicken I ordered was flattened out, still very juicy and had a delicious creamy mushroom sauce. It was served with mash potatoes and asparagus. The mash potatoes had a great texture, it wasn't too creamy which is perfect for my taste. Asparagus was cooked well.. . The lamb chops he ordered were chewy, not so much savory. But he ordered medium-well... which I will forgive but it is still possible to make it juicy at that level. The beans that came with his dish were meh. Loved the bread they served... well, I like the taste and how soft it is, though the bottom of it gets kind of moist which is a thumbs down for me.. . Still, a good experience. Still good food. Our server was excellent, very nice and helpful.
