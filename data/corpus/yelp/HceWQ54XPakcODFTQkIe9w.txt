Look, pizza is one of those things that you are never going to get people to agree on, like the perfect burger or the best barbeque. Having said that (Curb fans!), this is the best pizza I've had the pleasure of consuming. Period. The crust is what really makes this pie. Yes, at times the center is a bit soggy from the amazing ingredients used on top of the pizza, but that can really be forgiven, in my mind, when the balance of the crust is this good and the ingredients are this awesome. I do often worry about writing reviews that are too glowing, as it may build up the experience too much for some people and lead to disappointment. But hey, if you appreciate true Neopolitan pizza, you won't be let down. Try the Diavola, it's nice and spicy!!
