Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
So we all know about the Burger, Sweet Potato Fries, No Ketchup, Ordering at the Bar / Fighting for a table, blah blah blah ... all the things that make FO wonderfully unique and undeniably fantastic really.  And did I mention the burger ... . . BUT!  Did you know the new location, has COCKTAILS?!. . I recently went on a kick for Manhattan's and have been drinking them all over LA / OC.  Thanks to the advice my fellow Yelpers, I bravely ordered one on my last visit and I think so far, Father's Office has the best one I have had (outside my own home) of course.. . Next time you stop in here forgo that first beer and order a Manhattan, Negroni, or an Aviator.  They are classic cocktails that all the bar tenders are surprisingly (for a "beer bar")  well trained in mixing.  . . You won't be disappointed AND you will be different than all the other hip LA types vying for that table from those girls in the corner who look like they are almost done pushing their beet salads around their plates and are getting ready to leave.  (What a novel thought!)
