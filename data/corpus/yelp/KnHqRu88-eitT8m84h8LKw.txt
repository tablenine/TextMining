I love que!! On my second trip to this cozy little shack I enjoyed a hefty plate of pulled pork, okra and potato wedges. Â I love the pull on this pork, it is not overly stringy like most pulls, its more a mix of pork chunks and pulled pieces. Too many places soak their smoked meat in sauce, defeating the purpose of a good cut of meat. Daddy's does it just right, drizzling some sauce on top as an added bonus, not soaking the meat in a tub of flavor. The wedges are a great homemade variety with a super flavored crisp skin (I don't know what they flavor it with but its super salty and delicious). A plus Mr. D!
