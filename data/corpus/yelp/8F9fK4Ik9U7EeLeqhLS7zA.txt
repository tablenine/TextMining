It's exactly what you expect. Nothing more, nothing less. It's a pink neon diner dive with really delicious waffes and fantastic fried chicken. No garnish, nothing fancy. Good, hearty, sinful and deadly. . . LA baffles me though, and I really couldn't tell if it was a good neighborhood or a bad one. It did look a little dodgy to me though.
