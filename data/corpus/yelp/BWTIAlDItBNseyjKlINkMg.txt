As an after dinner lounge for drinks this place is perfect. I went for my first time this past Friday night for dinner and drinks with my boyfriend. The food was good. He loved it more so than I. He is also a true meat eater. I was a vegetarian for 10 years, so all the red meat was to heavy and too much. The rice was great! The bread they serve is awesome. AWESOME. . . I went back the next with two girlfriends for their birthdays. We showed up fairly late for drinks and hookah, and were seated between two parties, not sure if it's the atmosphere, or the drinks but everyone was very friendly. Â I think this is a cool lounge/bar. I'll definitely go back. Especially since they are open to about 1.
