Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
I like this place.  It's not amazing in that I dream of the Hacienda that Uncle Julio built, but it reminds me of Chevy's a lot.  I used to eat a ton at Chevy's when I lived on the west coast.   . . So, the food is more Fresh-Mex instead of real authentic mexican food.  I prefer their combo fajitas and I know I'm paying for the Crate and Barrel crowd.
