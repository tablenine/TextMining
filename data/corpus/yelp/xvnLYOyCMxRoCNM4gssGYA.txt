Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. We got there a little early for our reservation but they said we could sit at their "sidebar" for a drink and they'd come to get us when our table was ready. We ordered drinks and the hostess came to get us in like 5 minutes telling us our table was ready. We asked our waitress to close us out bc our table was ready...it took her about 10 minutes to bring us the check. Then when we got it we realized it was the wrong check. And then it took her another 10 minutes to bring us the right check. Finally the hostess said-we'll just add it to your dinner bill. We had a great table and the little cheesy puffs they bring you are sooo good. I wish I could have had more. My boyfriend got the Japanese wagyu filet-omg didn't even taste like steak-it was something like I have never tasted. So soft, rich, delicious. I got the American Wagyu which also was amazing but not as good as the Japanese one. We also got a banana cream pie/creme brulee and it was really really tasty. It definitely is pricey. But the food &amp; impeccable service were worth the price paid. If people don't want to valet, there is a a lot of metered street parking (free at night) around the hotel.
