Restaurant: Ann&#39;s Snack Bar
Category: Burgers
Okay.. so let me get this out of the way.  The burgers are awesome.  They taste good.  They are humongous and priced well.  You get to sit there and watch Ms. Ann prepare them... it doesn't look difficult.. she uses ingredients that you probably have at home.. but I have no idea how to make my burgers taste like that.. . So, why only three stars? (I was actually going to make a lame joke about what my "beef" was but thought better of it.)  As good as the burgers are I'm not sure it is always worth the wait.  Even though I'm sure that Ms. Ann is happy to have a steady stream of business it is just  bit much to have to wait outside and then wait inside too.  When she fixes burgers she essentially fixes an entire counter's worth at a time which means that even after you make it inside you have to wait for her to fix 7orders worth of burgers/hotdogs, etc.. . It really isn't her fault (and I don't think she cares - as she points out Checkers is down the street waiting for you) but it is a super small "restaurant" with a massive loyal following.  It just isn't always worth the 1.5 hour wait for a burger.
