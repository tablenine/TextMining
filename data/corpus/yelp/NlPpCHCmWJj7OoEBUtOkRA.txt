Is it pathetic that "Scott Baio Is 45 and Single" reminded me how much I love the Dresden Room? Yes. Do I care? No. . . I'd love this place even if there were no Marty and Elaine but thankfully they're there every Monday - Saturday to croon and perform and take this swanky old lounge to another level. I love the Dresden because of and in spite of the Swingers fame. I love sitting with a group of friends in a large vinyl booth, relaxing, catching up, and enjoying a cocktail Â  -- really there's no better place. . . I've never dared to try their food. Parking isn't always easy but there are options. To me the worst part about the Dresden is that it will fill up quickly, and early in the night, and if I get there too late I'm denied entrance and left out on Vermont with dashed hopes and no where to go.
