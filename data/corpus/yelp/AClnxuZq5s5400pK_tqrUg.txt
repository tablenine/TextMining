RuSans on Edgewood hardly needs another comment, but here's a brief one: The sashimi is usually very fresh -- especially salmon and tuna -- and the Cajun Maki never fails to please with its spicy taste. We'd call this place dependably good, rarely disappointing. And we've filled ourselves up with fresh fish without running up a bill exceeding $20. We're not much for buffets, preferring to order sashimi and sushi off the menu, but the lunch buffet (for under $10) is a bargain. Service is quick. So what's not to like? Well, actually it's that gosh-awful techno-pop music that blares out disconcertingly over conversation. Someone's idea of high energy, we suppose, but it's mostly annoying. Take it away and we'd give the place four stars.
