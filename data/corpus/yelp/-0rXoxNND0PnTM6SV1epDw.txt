Restaurant: Ann Sather
Category: Scandinavian
I can't believe I haven't written a review on this restaurant before. I ADORE Ann Sather's. This is the place I take anyone I know who is visiting the city- I couldn't count on all my fingers and toes how many times I've been here. . The cinnamon rolls are to die for. They are the definition of maganificent. You get two when you order them as a side- but don't share them, eat one (or both) there and save the other for when you wake up from your food coma. The service isn't anything to write home about but they are friendly, to the point, and have never ever messed up an order. . If you like Ikea's scandanavian meatballs you will love Ann Sather's. They serve authentic scandanavian breakfast foods as well as typical American. I've had the eggs with their amazing hash browns as well as Ann's Darling oatmeal- those two are my favorite. My boyfriend loves the biscuits and gravy, and we both appreciate that we can eat there for under $20. Today our bill was $19.99.. But no matter what you get you have to eat the cinnamon rolls- it's against the law not to.
