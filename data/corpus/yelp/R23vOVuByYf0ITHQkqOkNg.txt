My recent visit forced me to lower my star ratings from a 4 to a 2.  The sushi was edible but not tasty, the noodles were greasy which gave me a stomach ache and I shared the meal with three others so I didn't have too much.  . . Highlight of this place is that it's BYOB-probably the ONLY highlight.. . Once again, great place for an afordable place to hang out with friends but not if you want good sushi/food.
