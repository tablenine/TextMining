Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I can only say two things about Roscoe's:. . 1) the food here is absolutely delicious and definitely what I need for a Sunday hangover. . . 2) After eating the house special (chicken &amp; waffles for you slow kids out there) I can't move, nor does my body function normally, for the next 8 hours due to a massive food coma.
