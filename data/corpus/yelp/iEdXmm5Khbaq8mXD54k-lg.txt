Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Some of my fondest memories growing up have revolved around food. Lawry's The Prime Rib has been THE place for countless family gatherings throughout my life. Although the dress code has become more relaxed (I'm not complaining), the food has been consistently delicious!. I always get the English cut, medium rare, with mashed potatoes and 1/2 creamed corn and 1/2 creamed spinach. The Yorkshire pudding is lovely! Made from the drippings of each mouthwatering roast! Yum!. The only things that I would suggest that Lawry's bring back to their menu are the pumpernickel bread that used to arrive alongside the equally delicious sourdough, and the strawberries with Grand Marnier cream (desert)! I miss these items terribly!. Also, don't forget to have an after-dinner coffee as Lawry's serves Apfell's!. Some people complain about the noise pollution in the main dining room, but I love it! It just wouldn't be the same without the clanging of plates and silverware as fellow diners tap into their carnivorous side!. Delicious and not to be missed!
