It's a Five star place when it comes to Hot Dogs.  I hate ketchup on dogs and just try and ask for it in this place.  if you like ketchup stay away!   The place is hopping every hour that it's open.  There always seems to be line, at least, ten people deep no matter what time it is....  the Dogs with fresh cut fries on top are so good.  It's super Cheap and you can stuff yourself!  it's  10 minutes from O'Hare Airport.  When ever I fly in after a long stay out of Chicago I have to stop and Grab a Bag full of Dogs!!!   the Home made fries with skin still on are the best around too!!!!
