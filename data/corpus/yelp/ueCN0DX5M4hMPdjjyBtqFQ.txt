Not sure what the big deal is about this place.  Yes, the chilean sea bass was so freaking delicious, but does that make up for all the other mediocre dishes that were served?  MM... methinks not.  . . My experience here was pretty forgettable, and I probably wouldn't recommend this place to others.  If you do decide to go, though, stick with the chilean sea bass.
