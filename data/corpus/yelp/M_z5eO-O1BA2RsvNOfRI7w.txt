Restaurant: Alon&#39;s Bakery &amp; Market
Category: Bakeries
A week before Thanksgiving 2006, you could hear a collective gasp across North Atlanta when Buckhead Betties and Dunwoody Desperate Housewives were forced to scramble and make last-minute plans because Eatzi's abruptly closed their doors, and would not be making good on their turkey orders. I, for once, still miss their rotisserie chicken, tasty greens, mac&amp;cheese and flavored lemonades (Green apple, how I miss thee).. The Buckhead location is still dark, however Alon's has headed up GA400 and opened a second outpost in this location in the soon-to-be city of Dunwoody.. . Eatzi's its not. They've got a great bread selection, gourmet takeout is still available but with a smaller selection than the big E. My favorite chocolate chunk cookies make an appearance in the bakery section, along with a great array of breads. New to this location for Alon's is a gelato station that takes center stage (R.I.P. What's the Scoop?) and a wine bar section (coffee available too). . On my recent trip I took advantage of their brunch and tried the Shakshuka, listed as an Israeli favorite on the menu which featured two all-natural fresh eggs cooked well in a spicy tomato sauce. I added the turkey sausage and made it a meal. . It was all very good, I was happy to see that the neighborhood was enjoying Alon's, albeit on a rather gray and rainy day. And yes, I left with a bag of cookies
