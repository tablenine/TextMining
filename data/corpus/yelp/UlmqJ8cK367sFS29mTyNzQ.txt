Does passing off mediocre food in a semi quasi nice dark setting do something to your brain that makes you think the food is better than it actually is? . . I looked around and the answer is yes. What do you expect from an upscale Applebeez? My company holiday dinner took place here...I guess it's better than last year at Brio...maybe not. . . Flat bread was weak, beef carpaccio was mushy and stringy, edamame with green tea salt were well...frozen edamame you get from the market. Even the soup du jour tasted like soup du last week. Looked thru the menu and nothing was a stand out, so I got the standard issue 6oz. filet with your standard sides of mash and roasted garden vegs. The asparagus was the thickness of a McDeez frie, the whole carrots has been sitting in a hotel pan over a oven all night and dried to a crisp. Who woulda guess that a filet would taste much better with glazed butter under a salamander?!  . . And the desserts, boasting low calories, it sure tasted like it.  With "Seasons" in the name of the resto, I kinda expect the food to be, well....seasoned. It'll be another 52 weeks before I give it another shot. . . Thank baby Jesus for grey goose.
