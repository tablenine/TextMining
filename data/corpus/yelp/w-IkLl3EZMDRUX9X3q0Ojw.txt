"Eat food.  Not too much.  Mostly plants."  -Michael Pollan. . I've had my share of what I consider to be pretty good food, but I did not realize food could taste anything like this.  I'm still reminiscing about this meal more than 24 hours after the fact!  Also, I feel like I need to adjust the star ratings of most of my other reviews.  They now feel terribly inaccurate and much too high.. . Highlights of our 5-course tasting menu were the beet dish and the smoked mushroom tortellini.  . . To all the reviewers who've complained about portion size/value -- really? Get a grip.  This food is artistic, creative, and skillful -- this is not the kind of restaurant at which to gorge yourself and yet still take half your meal home with you in a styrofoam box.  Go to appreciate the food,not to eat in unnecessary excess.  Sadly, this culture has come to accept the latter as the norm.
