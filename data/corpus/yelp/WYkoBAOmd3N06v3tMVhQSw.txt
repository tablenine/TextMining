Restaurant: May Street Market
Category: American (New)
May Street Market is a fairly large restaurant which somehow manages to maintain the perfect level of dining intimacy. Rustic, intimate and inviting. . . I've learnt from everyone's favourite foul-mouthed darling Mr. Ramsay that the best restaurants do not have a sprawling menu, but a handful of options they excel at. May Street Market is no exception. . . Let's start with the bread, because... let's face it. We fickle diners start judging as soon as the bread is out. Well, it was warm and the truffle-infused spread was diiiiiivine on that crisp warm bread. And the mussels. Oh, the mussels. Mussels mussels mussels. Tomato white wine broth and quite possibly the greatest french fries my little lips have ever had... this was by far the highlight of our meal. It's been a few days since we've dined there and I am still thinking about the mussels. Yes, really. . . As for mains, I had the short rib with tamarind sauce and vanilla potato puree-- heaven on my tongue. My boyfriend had the stuffed pork loin with chorizo and beans... and it was on the salty side, taking a star off what would have been a 5 star review. . . Overall, May Street Market is a solid restaurant, and one I would want to see thriving 5, 10, 20 years from now. The food is innovative and a circus for your taste buds. Go. Now.
