Obsessed.. . My friend Ari showed me this place on friday and im bummed that I havent been eating here more often!!!. . This place is open til 3. We had an amazing midnight dinner here. I got a combo with pork katsu, gyoza, and 2 eggs over easy. It also came with salad, rice and soup. Ari got veggie tempura, and we split a large sake and after splitting the bill, we each paid 12 bucks.. . I cant stop thinking about going back here. Id even be down to eat here alone. Think...Japanese diner. Its on.
