What's the deal with the lobster love? It's good, but it's not mind-blowing! There are so many other underrated options on the menu like the Frech-style beef, the On Choy, or even the delicious fruit-based smoothies.. . I'd give it 5 stars except the restroom was a frightful mess the last time I stopped by. It looked like a King Taco patron made a deposit into the wrong receptacle. hint: poo in urinal.. . Whatever - the clams are great too - especially during lunch hours.
