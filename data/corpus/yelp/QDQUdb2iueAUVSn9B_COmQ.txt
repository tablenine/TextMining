Last night's Yelp party was terrific- what a crowd and what great service. This was my third event at the Landmark, all for different organizations- I have been downstairs, upstairs and last night's main floor right in the center of it all was great. All three times the service has been terrific. The mojitos were just o.k., kinda watery for my liking, but I broadened outside what was offered as part of the party and had two different martini's which were exceptional! . The place was packed, and usually when it gets like that the service tends to be hit and miss, but not this place- the service is always ON! and the food terrific. Can't say I have ever experienced a 'Risotto Bar' before, but what a great idea and how yummy. . Check it out!
