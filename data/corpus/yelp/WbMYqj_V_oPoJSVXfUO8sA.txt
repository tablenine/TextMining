Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
After reading these reviews I had to put my opinion (or warning) for Pinks.  I agree with people that waiting 30 min+ for a hot dog is ridiculous that is why I only stop by if (1) I'm in the neighborhood and (2) there is only a 5 min line, and there are times this is possible.  The hot dogs are OK but the combos they make are what makes the food unique and possibly good.  One thing I always found confusing is when others say the famous chili is great , I thought it was bland and can do without it.  So my advice: it's a nice place to visit but I would not make it a destination spot.
