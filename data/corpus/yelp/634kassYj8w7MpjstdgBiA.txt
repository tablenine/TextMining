My burger was good, but I'm not used to paying this much for a burger. Â I can't remember how much it was, but it in the double digits. They won't give you ketchup for your fries even upon request. That's some smug, pseudo-Dutch shit right there. I'm not even that into ketchup on fries. Still: PRINCIPLE. But I did try the mayo and I have to admit it was good. . . On the other hand, it has a very good and interesting selection of beers on tap.
