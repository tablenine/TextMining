Later Cracker style thin crust, I need not deal with your patheticness anymore!!! . . NY Crust- YEAH!    ..:::..   *shimmies, shimmies....slides*   ..:::... . Didn't like the mac and cheese, Loved some veggie topped goodness,. though. Sure, they are pricey. But way cheaper than flying home!. . The steak and cheese pizza makes me miss beef though and I haven't had it in 11 years!
