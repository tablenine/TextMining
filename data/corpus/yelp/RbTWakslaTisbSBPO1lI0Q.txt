every dish's main component is allowed to let it's flavor sing out.. fish courses- excellent.. 4 course vegetarian prix-fixe- outstanding and more local establishments could take a cue here.. service - knowledgeable and precise, if a little off in timing (hey it's week one for the new digs). atmosphere - great acoustics, a little beige on the color palate.. deserts are world class.. extra entertainment last night courtesy the hammered dude who fell over backwards at the bar and the queens next to us who bitched with unwarranted verve about the service (they were wrong).. and bonus entertainment, the wine steward who glides around the place in a different time signature than the hustling staff and still gets the job done with a wry smile.. go.
