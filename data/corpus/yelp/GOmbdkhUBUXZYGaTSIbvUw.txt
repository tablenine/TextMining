Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Famous for no reason. A horrifying occurrence that's been turned into an art form in recent years, especially in the Los Angeles area. And I'm not entirely sure that the trend didn't get its start right here at Pink's Hot Dogs. . . That's right, Pink's, you are the processed meat version of a drunken, empty-headed heiress. . . How did you get your rep, again? Why are we lined up fifty deep? "Honey guess what? I got us two tickets to Pink's for tonight!" is not a phrase that should ever be uttered. I waited in a shorter line to get my iphone. Holy Hell, could all this really be for that sorry excuse of a dog you serve up? . . Yes, as appetizing as the de-boned pinky finger of a morbidly obese man, complete with the mark from where the ring once was. Skin twice as thick as should be allowed by law, requiring the jaw-strength of a steroidal pit bull to puncture, only to give way to run-of-the-mill hot dog filling within... No thanks. I'll stick with the places not requiring a lawn chair, five AM stakeout to get served.
