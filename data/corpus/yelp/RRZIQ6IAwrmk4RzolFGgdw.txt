The first time I visited this restaurant and it was for Midtown Restaurant Week.  It's located in the W Midtown and there is complimentary valet parking through the hotel.. . The decor and ambiance is amazing.  The staff is extremely helpful and well-versed.  The papad and chutney to start us off was great and so were the two appetizers we tried: the charred beef skewers and the spicy chicken samosas.  The sauces that came with the appetizers were as good as the dishes themselves!  The entrees were very underwhelming, however.  The so-called "spicy" shanghai noodles with the silken tofu was bland, cold, and greasy.  The salmon was not flavorful or distinctive.  For a great salmon, see my review of Mitra (a true midtown gem).  However, the desserts were amazing!  The green tea ice cream may be the best green tea ice cream I've ever had and I've had it in Japan.  The Ovaltine Kulfi is more than a gimmick and is quite delicious too!. . I would give the food 1-2 stars if it wasn't for the tasty appetizers and the heavenly desserts.  Maybe the non-Restaurant Week menu is good.
