On a tip from NY Magazine, we opted for the 5-spatula burger. The place was a little trouble to find as the door blends in so well with the front of the restaurant, we thought it was closed, since the door adjacent was locked. They could benefit from an "open" or "welcome" sign. Tastefully appointed, of course. Ourselves and another gentlemen showed up at the same time and did the same thing. Good thing we didn't walk off as we were about to do because the meal was a must.. . After a semi-long wait (my guess is the burger takes awhile to cook), we were treated to one of the best burgers either of us have ever had. The meat itself was juicy, flavorful and rich. I opted to add a little mustard, which I somewhat regretted. It did luckily compliment the flavors. My wife added ketchup, which looked homemade, to which I decried that it was a cardinal sin to use since it masks the flavor more than the mustard. Nonetheless, the sprinkling of onions and melted gruyere, I believe, added a wonderfully, warm and gooey texture to the mass of goodness.
