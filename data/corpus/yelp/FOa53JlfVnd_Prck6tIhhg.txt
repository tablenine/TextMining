Pretty damn awesome every thing we ordered was tiny but very delicioso in my mouth. I did have to much sake and ended up throwing my chopsticks since I was using them as drumsticks and hit the tallest asian dude ever who just looked at me and said something that I did not understand, I apologized and said sorry but I am kinda drunk and may I please have my chopstick back he did not give them back as he also did not understand me. . . Good times where had by all and I would definitely go back and try to hold on my chopsticks. ( why are they called chopsticks if you don't chop) why can't they be called eating sticks.
