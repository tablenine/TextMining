Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
Granted, I don't eat a lot of pho. But I've been to some shady places for pho...and this one is definitely not in that grouping. Imagine that you go to IKEA one day only to find that no longer are there magical little Swedish cooks in their restaurant using beautiful little lingonberries. Instead, you come into the blinding white and find... Vietnamese people? That's this place. Very attractive little hole-in-the-wall with minimalistic plastic chairs and futuristic little pendulous lights. Egg rolls were fan-freakin-tastic. Little expensive, but definitely worth it....we ordered 2 orders (if memory serves, the order came with 3) I got the pho and my girl friend ordered the noodles ...they were both beautifully prepared (and quickly too) My pho broth was not murky nor yucky looking...the beef with beef ball one came with savory looking pieces of meat and had a lovely balance of noodles and sprouts and various tasties.  Expect to hoof it for parking if you're not one of the lucky ones who gets a spot in the 6-spot lot. Makes for an exciting night when you get to jay-run for your life across Sunset. Oh, and they have a bafroom with a neat-o green light in it. Makes going number 1 (or number 2 if you're nasty) all that more exciting!  . God I hate the term "hipsters." It just seems so fricking lame and trendy to use that. But what else are they called? They DO love this place. But I do too. And I'm not one of THEM. So go, k?
