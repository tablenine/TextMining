I love Hide.  Great little find on Sawtelle.  Sushi is really fresh, clean, and delicious!  Worth the wait, friendly staff, but it does get tight in there!  My personal favorite is the salmon avocado roll, and  fresh water eel and cucumber...yum!. . Lost a star because of cash only policy (I hate cash), and the fact that it is so small, making the wait quite long!
