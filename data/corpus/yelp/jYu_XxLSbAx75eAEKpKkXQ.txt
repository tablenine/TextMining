I visited Souper Jenny's for the first time today and I'm in love! My chilled soup was unusual and tasty, and my greek salad was incredibly spot-on!  I finished every bite, along with the roll that came with!  For the cup of soup, salad, and roll, it was $10 - be careful though, only cash and check, no CC!
