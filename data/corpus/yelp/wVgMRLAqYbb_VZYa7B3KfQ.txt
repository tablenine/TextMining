Restaurant: Nava
Category: Tex-Mex
My dad got those tickets you can buy that get you to go to new restaurants all over Atlanta.  Not sure how they work, but my dad took us to Nava.  . . It was a beautiful restaurant, and the service was great.  The valet was prompt, and the outdoor patio was lovely and just far enough from Peachtree Street to keep the traffic noise down.. . I will say that I usually hate going to fancy restaurants because they usually WILL NOT cater to a vegetarian, nonetheless a vegan.  But I do have to credit them for actually trying their hardest to make my veggie plate more appetizing than what was listed on the menu, and made sure it was vegan as well.  So big props to them for good customer service.. . I will probably never go there again, as Veggieland is down the street, but carnivores- my meat-eating family loved their meals and vowed to go again!
