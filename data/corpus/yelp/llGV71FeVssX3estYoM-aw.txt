The food is great. They have some of the best deserts, muffins and sandwiches that you will find in Atlanta. But why oh why should a muffin cost 3 bucks??? I'm just saying. The staff is mediocre. It is my personal belief that this usually happens because of poor working conditions. Any who, I will definetly remain a customer.
