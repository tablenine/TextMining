Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
This is a pure slice of the post-war Los Angeles boom, the wholesome Americana and hopefulness, a sign of this country stepping away from a mournful Europe and saying - "Hey, we have our own thing going on. Burgers, apple pie, soda pop, suburbs, &amp; swimming pools. We don't need no tenement or city centers, we don't need no crepes. This is Los Angeles, dude.". . I've been coming here since childhood, and my grandparents took my dad there since it opened in 1947. He was three. Â . . But, cultural and personal history aside, the food is phenomenal. I would walk through the Mojave desert in August for the hickory burger. I would swim to Catalina Island for the delicious, cinnamony slice of apple pie (with REAL whipped cream). The sodas are still served in wax cones, just like when I was a youngin'. . . Some people say that Los Angeles has no history, that it's a blank slate. The Apple Pan, tucked in across from the giant, faceless 80s monolith of some mall, holds steady. Los Angeles's history is long and bejeweled. Go taste it.
