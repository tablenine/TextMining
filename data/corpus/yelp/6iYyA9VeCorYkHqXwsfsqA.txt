Grilled Cheese- they fancy shmancy it up with grilled onions and tomato, but not just so they can say, hey our grilled cheese is fancy schmancy...it's to make you say, Mmmm fancy schmancy tastes good! Â And if you order grilled cheese more than any adult should, you know you aren't eating any old kindergarteners sandwich.
