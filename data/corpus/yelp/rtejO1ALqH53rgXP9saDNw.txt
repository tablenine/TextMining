Exec summary: The views were nice, the drinks were strong, the service was ok, but the food was meh.. . I went for lunch, and getting there means finding their desk in the hotel foyer and waiting (a while) for an escort (not the tall blond kind) to the top floor.. . Even though there was plenty of space, all the groups were seated close together, which was a downer, since the table next to us have a very loud chatter box. I don't know how he ate and talked so much at the same time.. . I had the strawberry mai tai, which was fantastic.. . My filet of beef was nice, although my wait-person specifically asked how I would like it, told me that the chef recommended it medium rare, and then got it totally wrong. It was a sliced up beef filet, if it doesn't come out medium rare, it's pretty obvious.. . It's nice to go once for the view, and I'm sure it makes a great panty-peeler when the moon is out, but but it's not that amazing an experince.
