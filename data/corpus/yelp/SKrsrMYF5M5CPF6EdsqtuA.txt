Most Americans have misconceptions of Chinese food.  The truth is that Chinese food is light , healthy, and amazingly flavorful. . . This place is amazing!!!!! There is one in Taipei, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Arcadia, go figure.. No menu, just a check list.. Must have the green beans!. Must have the Shanghai Rice Cake!. Other than that, get any dumplings that sound good, It's mostly pork and shrimp, but the vegi dumplings are fantastic as well.  Careful because they all have hot liquid inside and will spray if you bite, the method is to put them into the spoon and make a small hole in the side to drain the liquid into the spoon, then slide into your mouth dumpling and broth together.. . The shredded ginger is the beginning of a great dipping sauce.  Pour mostly vinegar onto the ginger, and a little soy sauce, perfecto.  For those who like it hot they have a house made chili oil that you sometimes need to ask for.  It's amazing, try more of the chunks in the bottom and less oil for the goods.
