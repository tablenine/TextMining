Good food, attractive surroundings, excellent service. The decor, dark and heavy on the red, is kind of funky and really sets the mood, which is that you're not about to have your typical Chinese food here. We were here last night for a birthday dinner, and started with the golden shrimp, which was very good. I had the short ribs, which were delicious but tasted more Indian than Asian, and my friend had the special, which was sole. We were both pleased with our choices. We also had minty drinks, served in martini glasses (can't remember what they were called), and quite potent. :) Between carrying on an animated conversation, opening birthday presents and taking phone calls, we couldn't have been easy to wait on -- especially not on a busy Friday night. Yet our server and the busboys struck the perfect balance of being available when we were ready but not hovering annoyingly or interrupting. Also, even though I paid for the dinner with a Swoop, Opera still comped our dessert (a creme brulee) in honor of the birthday girl.
