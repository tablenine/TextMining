You cannot call to make a reservation.  The phone, 818 985-6976, is either off the hook or they do not answer.  I've called 100 times and gotten a busy signal, the three times it rang it went unanswered.  Once, I called the number at the restaurant, standing with the manager looking at the phone.  I got a busy signal although no one was on their phone and it didn't even ring.  They just didn't care.
