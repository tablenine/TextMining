Restaurant: Twisted Taco
Category: Mexican
If you love the flavor of chipotle, this is your place.. . They use it in everything, and lots of it.. . If you dislike it, you might want to skip the restaurant altogether.  There's no getting away from it.  I tried.. . Now that I have that out of the way, on to the menu.   Twisted Taco takes its tequila selection seriously.  You might know how to order your margarita at On The Border, but that won't help you here.  Don't be afraid to try something new for your beverage.. . The mind expansion of Tex-Mex knowledge continues past the dizzying array of drinks and on to the food.  Just about any food you can think of has been dressed up as a taco here, yes even crab cakes and chicken parmesan.  If you're a purist, you can order the original., just ask for The Hills Run Red.. . There's also salads, wings, appetizers, blah blah blah.  Televisions hanging from the ceiling, Old West decor.  Opt for takeout if you want to focus on the food and avoid the scene and service.
