So absolutely yummy.  I tried the pre-fixe last Wednesday.  Wow, what a great appetizer with bananas.  The entree was super delicious.  The dessert, which would be easiest with bananas, was just ok to me.  Howard had a really great piece of steak and the yummy potstickers.  Great beer list and great wine pairing.  The whole bill was $120,not bad!!!    Great deal, would love to see what they have next month.
