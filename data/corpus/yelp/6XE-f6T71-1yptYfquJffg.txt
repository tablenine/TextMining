Purchased: 2 short rib tacos, 1 spicy pork taco, 1 chicken.. Threw away: 1 short rib taco, 1 spicy pork taco. Â . . I'm not a big fan of wasting food but ew. After forcing down two of their tacos, i thought enough was enough. I don't need to take another bite to realize these were pretty gross. First off, the meat quality isn't the greatest. I didn't expect juicy steak and i'm not an "authenticity nazi" by any means but I didn't expect it to taste like they got a big vat of meat from Costco labeled "Korean Flavored Beef" either. . . The chicken is dry. The short ribs are too tough and sweet. The pork was just weird tasting. Plus they layer all the tacos on your dish overlapping each other which makes for messy eating. The cabbage (salad) was an overload.. . 2 stars for no line. Minus 3 stars for crap food.
