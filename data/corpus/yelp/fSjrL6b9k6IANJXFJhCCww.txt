ok... this was the 3rd and last time i'll ever eat here. If you're not hungry and thirsty, its perfect for you..        I decided to give it another try, since it is in my neck of the woods.   We went on wednesday for  "all you can eat taco",lets actually say, all you can eat if you have 2hrs to eat 6 tacos! Yeah, pathetic. I thought to myself, you can't mess up tacos...right?  Wrong, the service was slow, the food extremely bland, the drinks incorrect  and even the check wasn't our check!.         I was excited because they had a selection of vegan and vegetarian items. I should've stayed home and made my own.How can you mess up a soft taco? Next time, i'll buy some tequilla, and go to taco bell. At least i know it will have some flavor and they can make it vegan too!.         It's very daunting that such a wonderful location and building is wasted on such horrible food, drinks, and service. The owners should really think about revamping their menu and hiring more staff, because obviously the current staff can't handle medium volume at best. I really wanted to enjoy this place, but the only time i will go back, is when i take my daily jog past it.
