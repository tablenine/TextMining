Wow - I haven't been to this place in ages, but I remember it being DARN good. I used to get the fried chicken sandwich which was absolutely delicious.  Not too much breading and not greasy, at all.  Doesn't hurt that they also happen to have THE BEST honey-mustard dressing E-V-E-R!  I sure hope they haven't changed that recipe.  My ex used to work there which is why I stopped going (that was stupid, wasn't it?), but I definitely need to get back there. It's worth the drive on the worst road in Atlanta, Lenox Rd., too.  I hate that road - why do they keep building on it, but never widening it? I digress..... . And the corn bread is almost as good as South City Kitchen's (you know I had to get that in there, guys!).
