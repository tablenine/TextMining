Beautiful restaurant, friendly staff, if the food catches up it could easily get 5 stars:. The newest addition to Carroll Gardens (for now Frankie's up the street just unveiled a new building &amp; everyone is a buzz what may be coming to the hood next).  I really like the thought behind EVERYTHING that has gone into this establishment.  From the name (after the channel of water connecting governors island to BK) to the map on the menu that explains the name, to the bistro style menu - lots of options.  Supporting the local (and I mean very local merchants the italian shop Caputos &amp; the pork store on court street here in carroll gardens) and great lines.  . They only take reservations for parties of 5 or more and luckily we were 5 on a Tuesday night however, we had to reschedule or reservation to Friday.  When we arrived they didn't have the reservation on the books however handled it very very well. Comped us drinks until we were seated.  As for the Food it is good - not amazing, not compelling but good.  For a area that has become a foodies dream the food needs to step up a little.  Sweet potato croquettes too fried not enought goat cheese sauce, schnitzel was amazing, fried chicken texture over fried but flavor very good, nimen ranch steak rubbery, warm lamb salad good.. We passed on dessert but had a great digestive - the mistletoe; try it you'll love it!
