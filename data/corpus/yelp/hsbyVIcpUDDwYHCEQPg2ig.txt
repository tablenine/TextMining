Restaurant: Opera
Category: Chinese
Opera was one of the very first restaurants I hit moving into my neighborhood, and I'll always come back. Their menu is always creative and the atmosphere is lively and fun... good for a big group of friends or a date. I have had lousy service maybe two times out of 20ish, but both those times the place was packed. Not an excuse, but I'm usually happy overall. As one reviewer pointed out (and I completely agree), the Peking duck service entree is excellent!
