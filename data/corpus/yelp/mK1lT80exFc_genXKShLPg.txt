Now, there are was a lot of hype about this place a few years back.  I was thinking "A Vietnamese Cuisine in Beverly Hills?"  After a while I never heard about it again, and forgot to check it out, until I was searching for potentially good Vietnamese places to check out.  . I set up a day to go with a few friends that also appreciate good authentic cuisine.  . First of all,  I had a problem reserving a table that night, I was hung up on two times.  Dont know what the deal with that was.  Bad start, I didnt even get there yet!. AMBIENCE: We got there, the setting was quite nice, fish tanks with koi walkway was a nice touch.  They seated us in the front walkway where there was  a massive amount of traffic.  Not good, considering there were at least five or six other tables open.. FOOD:  after looking through the menu, it looked like it was a fusion of Chinese/Vietnamese... The Garlic Noodles were the highlight of the meal.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THE GARLIC NOODLES.  GREAT!  everything else??? Horrible!!!  Eggrolls were cold and mushy, soup was cold, crab was mediocre.  They mentioned a secret kitchen, I bet it has cobbwebs.  Dont know if they put in work for a while.  . . First and last time im comin here. Over priced, but I can understand because of the location and  the setting.  If you can order the garlic noodles a la carte, i'd recommend that, One extra star for that alone.
