A really simple little concept and yet it excites me. . . Make a great salad, supersize it and offer 10 variations, or have a half salad with 4 options of entree to choose from with mashed potato for carb on the side, or make a sandwich of the 4 entree options (meat, fish, chicken or grilled veggies) and add half a salad. Keep the price the same for all options, $10 bucks! Add several soup choices for $4 and finish with desert choices for $3. Can you beat that? . . Add a warm, woodsy, modern design made with recycled timber, throw in some cool trac lighting, build a huge outdoor patio for boulevard dining, offer some good wine or beer at reasonable prices, then keep the produce as local and organic as possible. . . My sherry vinaigrette on the tender greens salad was everything that a French dressing should be but very seldom is, the Angus flatiron steak was cooked medium, flavorful and tender, with only the mashed potatoes lackng in inspiration - a little bland.The Belgium draft was excellent. However, I find the cafeteria style ordering and waiting tedious. Speed could easily be remedied by adding another cashier. But that's my only complaint.. . My only question is what took me so long to come here? 4.5 stars
