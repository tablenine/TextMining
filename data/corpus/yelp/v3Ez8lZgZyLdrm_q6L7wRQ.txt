For whatever it's worth I think that most of the exotic sausages taste exactly alike, so I've stopped experimenting. It's very simple - I get the bratwurst, it's perfect. And then I drink beer. And I stop drinking beer when they close. That whole neighborhood there is great. It feels like some entirely different city. I can't really explain. I'm very jealous of the owner. He has tapped very effectively into the soul of the modern man. Great bratwurst. Amazing beer. NO WAITERS. Communal tables. Great great great interior design. Great crowd. Great music. The prices are far too high, but why not? He's selling an experience and he's winning. I applaud his pricing. Nothing that good should be cheap. This city would be a better place if everything became more like Wurstkuche. Bravo.
