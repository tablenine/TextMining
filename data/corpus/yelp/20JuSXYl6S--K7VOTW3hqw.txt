tasty food for sure.. we all got something from each of the dinner categories (seafood, beef, vegetarian, chicken). Everyone said it tasted real good, but of course you come here for the grilled beef - which got rave review from my friend.. And for 4 people with a couple of appetizers and just water and soda it came out to $70something!
