We came here on Easter Sunday expecting it to be crowded, but there was no wait around 10am.  We entered this cute lil egg-decorated cafe and were seated immediately.  The atmosphere was relaxed and there was some upbeat music playing.  . . I ordered the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, which was delicious.  To drink, I had the freckled OJ, a tangy mix of strawberry and orange juice.  They also had a blackberry OJ, which I plan to try next time.  My boyfriend ordered the Sassy Eggs, which he absolutely loved.  The portion sizes are also decent, but I think the only downside to coming here was that I didn't notice anything else to see/do in the immediate area.  Overall, I wouldn't mind taking another drive &amp; coming back here with some friends for brunch.
