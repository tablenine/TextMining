Not bad.  I think this is probably one of those places where you have to come a few times and try different things before you can really judge.  I came here for lunch with my friend around 2 pm to avoid the weekend crowd and found it still fairly packed.  There was no way we were going to find a table for ourselves so we settled on the long, communal table inside.  . . The layout of the place is a little confusing.  Which door do you go into?  Which counter do you go up to?  Why are all these people here? How come it's so loud?  What do you do if you just want a sandwich? Why are we surrounded by fridges?  So complicated.... . But we finally settled in.  And the price for the food wasn't too expensive.  The dishes were pretty simple and tasty.  And at the end of the day, it was an LA experience that was worth it.  I had the small Baby Greens Salad, which wasn't anything too impressive.  I could make the same thing at home easily if I wanted to.  The bread was blah.  You can get better at Vons.  At least it was free.  . . I'll try something a little more fancy next time.  And maybe some dessert too.  . . This place is definitely an ordeal but can probably be easily maneuvered once you get used to it.
