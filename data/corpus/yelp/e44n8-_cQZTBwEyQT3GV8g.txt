Taste buds and sensibilities can be lost effortlessly at Canoe.  The cuisine,  wine, and view all contribute to a short, yet spectacular, euphoria.. . I've only been here once-a week after I had broken up with my ex boyfriend and he decided he wanted to take me to someplace to smooth things over.. . I had the waitress order me my wine- it was probably the best pinot gris I've ever tasted. On principal I ordered the scallops, which were then the priciest thing on the menu (he needed to hurt).  The point was, that while the scallops were slightly over burdened by heat (don't overcook your scallops!) they were cooked with in maple- something rarely seen outside of New England cuisine, and delicious.   My then ex's seared tuna was perfection, and still the new thing.  I ate most of it.  Neither of these are on the menu currently, but the skill and imagination in their execution was clear.. . One important note- this place is tricky to find.  Like Peach Tree, Pace's Ferry is everywhere!  Bring a map!. . We didn't get back together, but we both love each other.  And Canoe.
