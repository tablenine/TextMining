Restaurant: Twist A Tapas Cafe
Category: Tapas Bars
Twist has excellent tapas and great sangrias. I recommend sitting in the raised area with couches and coffee tables. I give it 3 stars because once I went with a date and would rate it a 5. Another time I went there with a large group for a birthday. We were fortunate enough to have the front section all to ourselves but I have to give it one star because for the restaurant to insist on a $3/person cake cutting fee after running up a $700 tab was rather ridiculous. What's more, we were LECTURED by the "manager" that since people don't bring beer to a bar that we had to pay the cutting fee at their restaurant. So we left. We would've easily gone through many more pitchers of sangria if they were savvy enough not bring up the cutting fee.
