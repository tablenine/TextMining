Ok, so we might have had to wait a few weeks for a reservation but it was worth it.  First, the parking...I luckily found a spot right across the street from Mozza so that was super nice!. . We sat down and gout our 3 little bread sticks and bottle of water.  We ordered the squash blossoms and bruschetta.  For our meal we had the Gorgonzola pizza with fingerling potatoes and rosemary.  So good!  It was the right amount of each.  You could taste the gorgonzola but it didn't kill the flavor of the rosemary and potato.  The crust was so light.  I asked for crushed red pepper as I love spicy things and it was so fresh.  Very red and spicy.  I also had half a carafe of Barbera wine which was really good.  My friend ordered the meat lovers pizza and my partner ordered the prosciutto pizza.  All loved theirs.. . For dessert we had the trio of gelato.  We got espresso, pistachio and hazelnut.  All three mixed together really well.  I recommend them!. . I would definitely go back.
