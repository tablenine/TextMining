Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The best "juicy pork dumplings" I've ever had.  The succulent broth that explodes out of the dumplings when you bite into it was packed with so much flavor.  It wasn't too greasy, as these dumplings can sometimes be.  And the vinegar/soy/shredded ginger that accompanied the meal was a perfect counterbalance to the rich pork.  . . The service was also great.  The workers looked kind of like Secret Service, with everyone having headsets that coordinated with the front desk, periodically muttering into the microphone a new set of updates.  Our table was literally just cleaned and prepared as we sat down.  It was very impressive to see such a huge place so well-run.  And the service was very good, considering it's a Chinese restaurant.  Expect a line, but you can pre-order while you're waiting, cutting down the time you have to wait for your food once you finally are seated.  And while you're waiting, you can see into the dumpling room, where a bunch of cooks deftly fold and pinch and stuff dumplings...it's mesmerizing to watch.. . I'm getting hungry just writing about this place!
