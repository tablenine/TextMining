Category: Dim Sum
Dim sum is probably my all time favorite Chinese food and having had it all over the world, I'm pretty sure I know what's considered good dim sum!. . Anytime you ask a Chicagoan where to go for dim sum in Chinatown, they'll recommend Phoenix. Was it just all hype? I figured I couldn't go wrong and with a fairly long wait outside, it had to be good! But of course, that isn't always the case.... . Once we sat down, our tea was served quickly and our first round of plates were easy to order. However, after that, it was hard to flag down a server or find anyone passing by with a cart. We weren't sitting in some obscure location back in the corner either. Maybe there were just too many customers or we had come at a bad time? And when we did get our food, it wasn't anything to ohh and ahh about. . . So all in all, I had an ok experience at Phoenix for ok food. I'd go there again if visiting friends wanted to go, but otherwise, I'll choose another local restaurant that serves great dim sum without the wait!
