Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
I was a bit upset when my boyfriend told me that he was only eating a little of what I had made for dinner because he was saving his appetite for the grilled cheese truck.  Obviously after a move like that, I had to try what he brought home (cheesy mac and rib.) It kind of reminded me of the time my brother and I got high on Thanksgiving after our folks had gone to bed and made sandwiches out of all of the thanksgiving left overs in the fridge.  It seems like it should be a carb overload, but somehow the pasta works as a true sandwich ingredient; it's al dente and the cheese sauce perfectly gooey and flavorful.  The pulled pork is legit too, and the sauces are not to be ignored.  I only wish it came around earlier, because I'm old and am usually in bed by now.  Will definitely hit again.
