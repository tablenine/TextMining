Better than the best NY pastrami. I went to Langer's about 6 months ago, right before I moved to NYC. I thought NYC would have something better, being the deli capital of the world. . . I first went to the famous Katz Deli. I can't complain, but I can't say that it was anything of the ordinary. And those huge meat portions in the sandwich....are they insecure about the quality of their food?. . Then I tried David's Brisket House in Brooklyn, a place agreed upon by several reviewers at . http://Chowhound.com.  as being the best pastrami in NY. I made the trek and liked the sandwich....but it was still no Langer's.. . The Langer's pastrami is simply greater than the sum of it's parts. I can still taste that salty meat/sweet coleslaw mix, mixing with fresh baked rye with the crispy edges.. . Can't wait to go back.
