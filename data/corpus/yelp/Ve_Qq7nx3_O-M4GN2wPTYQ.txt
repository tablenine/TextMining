Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
I had high hopes for this place. . . Made reservations the day prior. There were only three times available, but when I arrived, half the seats were empty. . . My table had three pizzas. They took a long time to come out. One of the pizzas was too crunchy, almost like a cracker. The other two pizzas were good, but not great. One of the pizzas was supposed to be their most popular. Go figure.. . For the size and the flavor, the pizzas were too overpriced. Three pizzas and a soda for about $60 after tax. Ridiculous. On that note, the valet is too expensive, too. It ranges between $8.50 and $10, depending on the time of day. . . I'm going to try another pizza place next time.
