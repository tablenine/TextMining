As a huge Top Chef fan, I made it a point to go here while I was in Atlanta for business. The atmosphere is amazing, very natural and welcoming. The lighting is nice and soft and the bar area is very nice too. We only had to wait five minutes for a table and the bartender personally came over to ask us if we wanted a drink, while the bar was half-full.. . The dining area is huge and you walk by a small kitchen, immediately smelling the wood burning stove. The smell is seriously intoxicating and when I got the menu, I made sure I got something "wood grilled" so it could have that flavor. . . Our table was close to the kitchen so we could see Kevin working and he was very cool when people would point and stare (due to the Top Chef thing) and take pictures of him.. . The menu changes daily so it's tough to recommend but the prosciutto wrapped arugula was amazing and the caramelized apples were too. I had a main dish and it was very filling, without a side.. . All of the food is amazingly fresh and really, really tasty.. . My only complaint, Kevin did seem to get annoyed after a while of people pointing, which is understandable and while he was there to see, he wasn't as engaged with customers, or only certain ones.. . And, my clothes REAKED of wood burning stove for three days. I seriously had to fluff them in the dryer to get that smell out. Not QUITE what I expected.. . But the food was still really good.
