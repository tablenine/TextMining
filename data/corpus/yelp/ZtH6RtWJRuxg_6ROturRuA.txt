Restaurant: Ru San&#39;s
Category: Sushi Bars
As a vegetarian, I love RuSan's!  So many choices for me and my people!  I gave the Piedmont location 5 stars.  This location doesn't quite seem to have its act together though.  Service was really spotty.  We started out with 2 waitresses, neither of which was doing a great job.  This location is just as loud, if not louder than Piedmont.  The outside dining area is a total mess.  There's very little room for the tables along the walkway, making it very difficult for people to walk in both directions as people are eating.  Given the choice, I'll stick with Piedmont.
