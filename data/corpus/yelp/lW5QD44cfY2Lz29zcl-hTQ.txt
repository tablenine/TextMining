Every time i come here, the wait is fucking ridiculous.  i come here on a monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday, whatever fucking day it is, you gotta wait atleast a half an hour.  of course no reservations, and they won't seat you till 3/4 of your party is here.  yet i still keep coming back to this joint.  why?  the shrimp is fucking awesome.  that's basically all we order here, and the cajun fries.  they have crawfish, and crab, and king crab legs, and fried catfish, and other stuff, but ain't nothing like the shrimp.  go for the garlic seasoning, they got other seasoning, but garlic is the best, and make sure you go mild, cuz if you order hot, that shit will make you sweat up a storm.  i'm talking little mexican yellow peppers that you find at those hamburger joints spicy hot.....times 2!  and if you don't want to wait, just order it takeout, and eat it at your house or something.  but definitely is a must try joint.
