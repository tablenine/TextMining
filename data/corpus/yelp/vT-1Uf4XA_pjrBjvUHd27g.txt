Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
A quick review... more later.... . I'm not the biggest pizza fan... it's all the same, ya know?. . Until Casa Bianca. I ordered the pesto pasta so the others could enjoy the average pizza I expected them to get... and then fought them for the leftover pizza. It was so good, words don't do it justice. . . All that plus cheap wine (if you like that sort of thing, I do, especially if it's $13 a carafe) and did I mention the pizza rocked my socks off? . . I'm drooling now just thinking of it.
