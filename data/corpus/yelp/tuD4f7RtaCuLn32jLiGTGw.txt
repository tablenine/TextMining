What more can I say about the awesomeness of Porto's? I love this place! Even when it's crowded, I can't complain too much. Everybody loves Porto's!. . For a pre-holiday treat, I decided to get some Porto's goodies for the five folks I supervise. I planned to simply drop in on the way to work one day this week and get some Potato Balls, Chicken Empanadas, Meat Pies, Spinach Feta Pies and a few assorted sweets. My BIG mistake was letting other people in the office know about my plan ahead of time.. . Now, it's a full-blown, informal office shindig and I'm picking up enough Porto's to feed an army. No big deal, though. I called Porto's and spoke with their friendly customer service rep. I placed my order, got a total, and now all I have to do is collect the money from everybody who's supposed to pitch into the hat. We'll see how that goes.. . I did have to call Porto's back and double the order of Potato Balls because I'm told there are people in the office who will definitely bogart them. That doesn't surprise me. Those things are delicious and I could eat a dozen my own darn self. Mashed potatoes filled with meat, rolled up in a little ball and deep-fried. It's like an entire, tiny, compact meal in your fist. Who came up with that concoction? A demon? . . Porto's is ALWAYS popular and you just can't go wrong with a big batch of their wares for an office party or meeting. Whenever I bring in Porto's, people get all giddy and excited--like little kids on Christmas morning.. . Good stuff!
