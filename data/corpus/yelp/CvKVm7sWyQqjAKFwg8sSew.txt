OK while i still think the food is good... I finally went at night. The bartender was awesome, but to get in we had to wait in line!? We would have left but there were friends inside waiting... They were letting 1 person in for every 1 who left .. or so they said.. Inside was douche mania like Lincoln park threw up their undesirables .... Â yea that bad.
