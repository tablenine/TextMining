Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Fantastic bread, generous portions of pasta with fresh high quality ingredients, decent prices and ..(happy sigh) limonata.   I couldn't have been happier if I'd actually been in the Village or Italy itself..because then I couldn't have walked to that cool Giant Robot exhibit after!  . . Arriving 2 hours early for the show, my buddy and I decided to grab some dinner. Taking advantage of the lovely weather, we walked around Culver City, quickly coming to the downtown area. Nice in that yuppy/tourist/don't-want-to-live-but-really-like-t o-visit way. I really don't leave the echo park/silverlake area enough. Wandering the block, we window shopped the menus a la goldilocks [too expensive, suspiciously inexpensive, too crowded, too empty]..and then, Cafe Fuego: just right!. . The hostess had that perfect italian mama thing going on.  Nice service, although our swiss (?) waitress felt a bit odd!  He had the Fettuccini Primavera (light, fresh vegetables and delicious just-made fettuccini noodles), I had the Rigatoni alla Sorrentina (Smoked mozzerella, lightly grilled eggplant and a lightly spicy sauce).  We each had 2 imported italian sodas, no appetizers; walked out stuffed, with leftovers for $30.  Although it looked crowded, I'll probably be back for the adjadcent wine-tasting-bar soon.. . ...and yes, the Scion Gallery was about a 15 minute walk away..which I NEEDED after emptying those 2 bread baskets, thank you very much!
