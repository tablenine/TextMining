I really like this place; casual, yet not too casual, fun atmosphere, good food. I've been twice and ordered the mini-burgers both times. When I return to a restaurant, I usually make sure to try different dishes, but those little burgers are so good! They have one of the most extensive beer menu's I've ever seen. On my first visit, we were seated next to the huge keg room, which is enclosed but visible through windows. If you're not into beer, they have lots of other drinks, too, including a pretty good list of "martinis". Â I could see going to this place to sit at the bar and watch a game, or for a meal with friends. Or just to have drinks and mini-burgers...
