What an awesome place! The people that work here are so nice and genuinely appreciative of your business. They offer as many free samples as you need. They make their own nut milk which serves as the base for most of their delights. They have several flavors to chose from. Most are nut based (almond milk) rather than soy, which makes it taste better and more like traditional ice cream. They also do soft serve! The prices ($3.75 single &amp; $5.25 double) are a little high, but for such a delicious vegan treat you can't get many other places, it's worth it! This is a good place to take people that say, "You're vegan? What do you eat... tofu? Salad?"
