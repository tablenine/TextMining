Restaurant: Savage Pizza
Category: Pizza
Little 5 points. Atlanta's little bohemia. On every corner theres a clothes shop, a bookstore, a pub and ..a pizza place. . . Comics is the theme of Savage Pizza. On the walls are posters and blowups of various comic books and heroes. Large plastic figurines dangle from the ceiling. Smaller collectibles line a shelf on wall. Most are  easily identifable some are a little obscure.. . Theres lots of wood here.  Some of the chairs look like church pews.  Solid but comfortable.  . . The atmosphere is friendly and the waitresses were helpful. The menu did feature quite a few meatless offerings but I decided to get the chicken ceasar salad. The salad had almost as much meat as greens..mmm.. I also got a small pepperoni pizza which was also good. Oh yeah, the place is non smoking. . . If you want just a sample and get pizza by the slice, make sure you get in before 5pm.
