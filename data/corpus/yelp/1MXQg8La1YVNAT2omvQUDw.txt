This interior of this place is very cute and sitting next to their spacious windows makes for great people watching (or people watching you back as you inhale your food during your lunch break...), but I have to say that I wasn't very impressed with the food itself. While it's not *bad*, it's a far cry from authentic Thai food. I always measure a Thai place by their Pad Thai first, and theirs was... Well, it didn't actually taste like Pad Thai at all. Cilantro? Chicken that resembled beef due to heavy marinating? Light, soy-based (?) sauce? Like I said, it wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't taste like Thai food in the slightest. Didn't have the right texture or flavors. I guess they're trying to "Americanize" it or something.. . While I don't regret going, I also don't think I'll be coming back. If you find traditional Thai food to be too heavy or spicy, this place might be for you. Also, it is a little cheaper than other Thai places, which is a nice plus.
