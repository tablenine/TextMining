Restaurant: Taco Mac
Category: Sports Bars
This is by far the worst of the Taco Mac locations. It's much smaller than all of the others, so there's usually a wait (I've been there 5+ times and I've had a 10-20min wait each time). . . Maybe I only go here when they're super busy, but the servers are really inattentive. The most recent time I went, I asked for a Sweetwater Blue. The server came back 15 minutes later only to tell me they didn't have any... super disppointing. . . Their food is on par with the other Taco Macs, so they earn some points there. However, when I want to go to Taco Mac, I always pick the Decatur location.
