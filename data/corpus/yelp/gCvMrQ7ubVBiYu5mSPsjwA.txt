Restaurant: Mirai
Category: Sushi Bars
A dessert-gasm.. . That's what I have every time I eat the green tea souffle with warm chocolate sauce at Mirai. . . Never in a million years would I have thought that one of my favorite desserts of all time would be experienced at a sushi restaurant, of all places. But I suppose stranger things have happened. . . The sushi, service &amp; atmosphere here are all stellar. A+. But I mainly come here for the dessert-gasm.
