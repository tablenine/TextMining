Great place to go when you're in the mood to dance. I went with a few girlfriends for a Friday night out and we had a blast! The place gets packed for dinner so we grabbed a few drinks at the bar before the dancing began. Free lessons begin at 9, and the dancing begins at 10. Even if you don't know how to salsa, the lessons are so helpful and you can always find someone on the dance floor willing to teach you. Everyone there is so nice, you'd really have to try hard to not have fun!. . They of course have plenty of tequila to choose from and the bartender was great about explaining the differences and even gave us some samples to taste before we ordered. If you're not a tequila drinker, go with the tropical mojito, it's the best.
