In this economy everyone is searching for value. Let's hope they keep with their business model of delivering delectable cuisine and fair prices. I saw a sneek preview of their menu and it seems more reasonable than other local area restaurants. Some things may be on pricey side, but when you factor in the ambiance, exotic foods and service, it is great. Their service is wonderful and the staff is attractive and friendly (that combo seems impossible in LA, but so far it is working here!). . The restaurant, delicatessen section and bar opens on Monday. I look forward to avoiding Starbucks like the plague and ordering my coffee and morning carb/sugar rush energizer here, esp. since it is the same price! Oh yeah, and try their triple shot Carmel Macchiato and Almond Butter Puff Pastry. Yum!
