CRAB...LOBSTER..... the best... you want something oniony, garlicy, peppery, and yummy.. come here.  everything else was great also.  clams, fried rice, and also service. these guys are so nice and seem so happy. . right when you walk in this place and you smell the aroma's and see these giant lobsters on tables of smiling and laughing customers you MUST EAT THIS.   thank you newport, thank you so much.. i will come back over and over and over again even if i have to wait an hour or more.
