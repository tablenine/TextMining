Its worth the wait.  I'm from Northern Cali, and I always come here when I come to san diego or LA.  XLB is perfect: skin that is tender , fresh and doesn't break easily, and a super hot soup that is not too salty... just right.. The wait is worth it.  Just walk around and get a bubble tea while you wait.
