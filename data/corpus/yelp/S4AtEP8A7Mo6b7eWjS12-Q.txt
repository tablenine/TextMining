I normally don't like ramen, but I LOVE it here.  I don't know what they put in it, but it is great quality stuff that mixes so well.  Mm.... . I haven't really gotten anything else here because I'm willing to go through the hour-long wait when I want good ramen.  They give you a really good-size amount too, so I usually don't even have an appetite to try their other stuff like gyoza (even when I go in starving!).  I hear the cold noodles in the summer are good though.. . If you're looking for something quick, you probably shouldn't come here (unless you make it in right when they open).  It's usually anywhere from a 30min-1.5 hour wait.  Sucks I know, but like their sign says, they don't want to sacrifice quality for quantity.  So suck it up and wander around Little Tokyo for a bit.
