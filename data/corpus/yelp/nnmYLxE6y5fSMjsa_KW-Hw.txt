Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
The food here is so tasty, and if you don't go wild with the ordering, it's actually not a very expensive restaurant!  (1 appetizer + 2 pizzas + 1 dessert wine + tax/tip was less than $60). . First of all, you MUST call a month ahead of time for a reservation any time on a weekend.  I know, it's ridiculous.. but I was there from 2:30-3:30 on a Saturday and the entire time every single seat was full!  I've heard that for weeknights, you only need a few days' notice, so I'll have to try that out sometime.. . The house-made sausage and meatballs are must-orders here.  The meatballs appetizer and the fennel sausage pizza were good enough to make a vegetarian cry.  The pizza crust is also heavenly (the restaurant is co-owned by the founder of La Brea Bakery), with a deliciously rich flavor and a nice chewy texture.  I would suggest going wild and ordering the more eccentric-sounding pizza combinations, because while our proscuitto pizza was well executed, it wasn't worth it to go to a slighty hyped-up, specialty restaurant to eat it. . . My only regret when reading the pizza menu was that I hadn't done more research on the obscure foodie/Italian terms: Guanciale? Speck? Caciocavallo?  I know it will be delicious, but I'm still so confused!
