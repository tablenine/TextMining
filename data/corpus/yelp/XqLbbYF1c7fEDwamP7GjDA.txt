alton brown + johnny royale + meats/cheeses + pimms cup + mexican coke + burger = full with a bunch of shitty iphone pics.. . the burger was fucking ON last night.  at least as on as it can be nowadays.  not sure if it's quite what it used to be, but I enjoyed the fuck out of it last night.  and not just because I inhaled my alcoholic beverages which caused Luke (bar man) to give me a sideways look.. . I'm guessing the hotness that is Alton Brown may have kicked things up a notch.  maybe not.  whatever the deal.... he was there giving Linton Hopkins some kind of shiny plate.  I couldn't fucking read it though.  too busy cramming burger in my pie hole.  the other one.. . anyway let me know if you see me on TV, I still don't have one. . . 4.5+ last night? fuck... I was happy.  let's not dwell on numbers here.
