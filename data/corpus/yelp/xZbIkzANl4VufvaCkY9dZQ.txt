I spy the Kogi Truck! Follow them on twitter &amp; you're mouth is just watering for those sliders, specials, and tacos! I believe they barely started going to Monrovia because when I first went, the line was at least a 30 minute wait. I thought it was worth it though! If you're as patient for some Korean BBQ food on the go, then you're most definitely in for the win. Their sliders are a MUST-HAVE! It's so flavorful that I wished they served more than just 2 for $5. I got the Korean Spicy Pork Taco &amp; the Korean Short Rib Taco, each $2. I've heard some don't like the tacos &amp; are a little spicy, but I love the spice. You can pack &amp; go or eat it in your car. I also tried the burrito, it could be better. Don't be fooled by their picture, it looks so good, yet not as flavorful as described &amp; thought it would be. Late night food or even noon, you gotta have yourself some Kogi's!
