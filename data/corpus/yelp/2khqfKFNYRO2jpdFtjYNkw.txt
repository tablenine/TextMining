Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
My boyfriend went to Taste for the first time on a date...Our server was wonderful, the atmosphere was great, but the food was underwhelming.. We started with the fried rock shrimp.  They were pretty good, The sauces were okay, and the batter on the shrimp had no flavor - almost like doughnut batter.  The wasabi sauce was way too liquid, it should have been thicker..  I ordered the cumin pork chop which comes with the truffled mac &amp; Cheese.  I have to agree with other reviewers that the mac &amp; Cheese was really bland...the pasta was either too greasy, or there was too much moisture.  The baked cheese on top was extremely rubbery after it sat a while, and the cheese mixed with the pasta was watery and not seasoned enough.  You could definitely taste truffle, but the type of cheese used should have been saltier and creamier.  . . On the over-seasoned side, the cumin chop was way too salty and dry.. My boyfriend ordered the steak, which was cooked perfectly, and tasted great.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.
