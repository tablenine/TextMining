LOL... Ok so funny story... I actually went to Twisted Taco last week to visit my friend who was doing a Brittany Spears Listening Party (he's a marketer so it was his job LOL)... It's not hard to believe that know one was there for the Brittany Spears celebration. . . The fries were horrible and they gave me a thousand ketchup packets instead of a bottle to pour LOL. The fries were dry and tasted like the kind you get out of the grocery store. . . The margarita was lousy, I've definitely had better. . . WOW, I think this could be my first BAD review. . . I probably would not go back to Twisted Taco anytime soon, unless my friend decides to "throw another party" there... Â  ;)
