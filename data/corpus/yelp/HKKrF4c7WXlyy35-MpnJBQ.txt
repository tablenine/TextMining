I am quite surprised that such a combination of food actually tasted pretty good. I had heard of this place of dining before, but did not think it would actually taste good. I'm glad that I was wrong in this case. The service was great, the staff friendly, and the food was wonderful. I loved the drinks (of which I forget most of the names) but mixing things like lemonade, orange juice and sprite is quite inventive. The only problem I had with the place was that you cannot have separate checks, so we were stuck splitting the bill onto various credit cards, instead of each having our own bill. I would recommend everyone eat here at least once, even if the combination of food sounds a little off.
