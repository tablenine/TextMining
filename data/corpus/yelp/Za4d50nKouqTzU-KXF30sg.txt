Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Last night I went to Pizzeria Mozza to see what all the fuss was about. After seeing the write ups and reviews I was curious to try the pizza here. As soon as I walked in I was overwhelmed by the amount of people waiting and dining. It was PACKED. I sat at the bar and was quickly served by Sean P. He was a great server! Patient and well informed on the entire menu/ wine selection. After 20 mins. of pondering I chose to try the Mushroom pizzette. It is a smaller pizza but so rich and full of flavor. Perfect for one person. Also, had the wine and house made gelato. Everything was awesome! Want to go back again with friends. The atmosphere is great, you will feel transported to a restaurant in Chicago or NY. Doesn't have an L.A. vibe. The only thing I wasn't very happy about was my total cost for the evening. $10 valet, $40 bill, $10 tip. I think $60 for one person having some pizza was a bit much...
