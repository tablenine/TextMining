Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
As someone who grew up as an avid ice cream indulger, I was more than thrilled to hear of Milk. They make real, home-made ice cream - none of that Pinkberry/Yogurtland fro-yo stuff. . . Parking can be a bit of a pain, depending on the time of day, and it isn't exactly cheap, but all in all I don't think you will be disappointed.
