this place has a bomb ass sashimi dinner for 12$. . you get 11 slices of sashimi but you can only pick between maguro, shake, and hamachi...i always get the shake and hamachi...those are my favorite..this is such a bargain meal...large quantity, good quality, lovely pricing....well only for the sashimi dinner...everything else is pretty normal priced.. . OIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
