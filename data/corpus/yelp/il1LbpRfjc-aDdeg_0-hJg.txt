Oh man! This truck had amazing food!  I ordered the Korean Tofu tacos, and a tofu burrito.  in the burrito there was cabbage, tofu and a little bit of cheese. The tofu was a little bit spicy, but there was so much flavor! Not just spicy flavor.  The tofu tacos had cabbage and tofu and those were not as spicy but just as good! We had to wait a little bit, but it was definitely worth the wait!
