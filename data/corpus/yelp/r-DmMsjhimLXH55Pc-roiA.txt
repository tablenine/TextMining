Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Comparable to the location in Gardena?  Hell yes.. . I never knew there was a Shinsen Gumi in this plaza... until a few years ago when I ate at a Chinese restaurant near there with family.  It felt kinda weird since... I've never had Shinsengumi ramen when almost.. 90% of the patrons there were Chinese hahah.  Felt more like a Chinese restaurant rather than Japanese ramen spot but what can I say?  Chinese people love their noodles!. . Nevertheless, the ramen is as delicious as always.  Great soup base, can be customized to each's own liking, and the combo of ramen &amp; fried rice still hits the spot.  Same menu essentially as the location in Gardena.. . It is a smaller location so expect it to be PACKED over the weekends, especially at night.  Both times I've gone I had to wait over 40 minutes.  I really wish they can just buy out the shops next door and convert it into a bigger shop haha.
