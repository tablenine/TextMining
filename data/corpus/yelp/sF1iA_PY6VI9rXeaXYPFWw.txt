Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
My first tryst with Argentinian, and I loved every bite. Arroz del Campo con Pollo - so yummy, contrasting flavors and well balanced, delish and rich but not too much. La Empanada with cheese and onion, I'm no expert but the best I've ever had. I played it sober, but the Sangria was calling my name and will definitely be on the list next visit.. . Very reasonable prices, good service, and a relaxed atmosphere (traits not always forthcoming in LA).. . I'll see you there, darlings!
