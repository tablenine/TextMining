A permament spot on my anti-Atkins rotation since 2002.  Thank God you were never open when I returned home from work.  While others may have had a budget for Starbucks coffee, I proudly had a budget for Bari's subs.  Try the Italian, tuna salad, meatball and roast beef and cheese subs.  . . Buyer beware: the middle aisle that leads you directly to the deli will leave you surrounded with chips, some varieties which I have not seen in years.  Go down the right most aisle.  The left aisle is just as dangerous.  Also, that damn candy bar rack at the register.  I've never had so many impulsive Snickers and Kit Kat purchases in my life!
