Restaurant: Atlanta Fish Market Restaurant
Category: Seafood
I so love this restaurant! I had a great time thursday night at the Atlanta Fish Market. Soon as I got off of work, I went home and got all dolled up to entail a wonderful date. The food was impeccable and the wait staff was very impressive. My server was very much familiar with Celiac, so he did a wonderful job in helping me select an entree that was gluten-free. Atlanta is a hard place to find good seafood.So, if you are on a scavenger hunt for seafood, I would highly suggest the Atlanta Fish Market. I also like the fact that they included sushi on the menu as well. It's a great combination to have when you are in the mood for good seafood.
