Fruit Tart - AWESOME. Almond Croissant - FABULOUS. Sweet Croissant - CRAP :P. . It was my first time visiting this gigantic bakery.  The displays are beautiful &amp; almost everything looks delicious.  Saturday mornings are craaaazy busy here!  I think I had about 30 people ahead of me just to order up some pastries.. . I'm sure with additional visits they'll earn their 5th star.  I really want to try the cafe side &amp; some more yummy desserts :).
