I was not expecting to feel as classy as I did when i walked in here. Call it a character flaw if you will. I went here for late dinner and was impressed with the ambiance. I liked the booths and the lighting. There was a Brigit Bardot montage playing on the screen and I enjoyed the music. It was a bit loud for conversation. . I got some wasabi fries and the rodan pizza w/ tomato and asparagus. I agree that the fries don't taste very much like wasabi, but they were good none the less and plentiful. Pizza was good. Some of the tomato slices were a bit large for one bite, which severely took my classiness down a notch. . I can't comment on the quality of the other patrons, I didn't really notice. It wasn't all that busy because it was Monday night.
