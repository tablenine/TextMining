All I have to say is thank god they're open after 4am!!! It's a healthy (somewhat) option to those after the club munchies. Me personally, I'm a Beef and Broccoli guy/ shrimp Lo Mein guy. It's new, and clean...  Ahh.. remember the days it was on 14Th street next to the little motel? Good times!  Glad to see that even though the Atlanta nightlife is changing some thing remain the same.  . . I've been told though, that we are not supposed to always touch the Buddha!  I'm always told... "You don't me petting a statue of your GOD do you!"  Lol... Go Buddha!
