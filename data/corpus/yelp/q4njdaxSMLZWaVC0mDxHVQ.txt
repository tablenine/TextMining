Two words: OVER HYPED!. . If you insist on having Cuban food, perhaps you're better off going to Habana in Costa Mesa. Otherwise if I was on Venice Blvd and in the mood for some Latino Cuisine, I'd go to Cafe Brazil down the street instead! I ordered whatever their house-special was [the pork version], and it was so salty that I couldn't bear to eat it. I'm generally easy to please, so usually I'll eat anything. This was one of the few times in my life that I could not bring myself to eat any of my food. I also ordered a mango smoothie, and typically I'll like anything with mango in it no matter what-- well, this was Â the ONE time in my life that I did not like something mango-related. The smoothie was too thick and not very sweet. I couldn't bring myself to drink my smoothie either. . . Perhaps my experience was a fluke, but I don't plan on returning to find out.
