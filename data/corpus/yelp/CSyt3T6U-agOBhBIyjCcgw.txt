Restaurant: Grindhouse Killer Burgers
Category: Burgers
In the perpetual search for a great burger, I found Grindhouse.  It kinda reminds me of In and Out Burger - has a distinct taste (sauce based) with different ways you can order the basic burger.  It's a little more varied than In and Out with their sweet potato chips (very good) and onion rings (very good) and chocolate malts (meh) but otherwise this is a high quality, low priced burger.  I normally don't love crinkle cut fries but they manage to actually cook them right (till they get a little crispy) and spice them up bit for interest.  . . You need to get there a little early if you want to sit at the counter as there's not a lot of seating but the food is worth a little pre-planning.  . . Definitely will return.
