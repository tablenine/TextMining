Yes, you will find a line.  And for some reason, the line is what intrigued me about this place, and I am on a quest to find the best taco in town!  We waited for maybe 15 minutes (so, don't go when you're about-to-pass-out-starving).  We tried the brisket tacos (amazing) and the margaritas are excellent too.  The service was quick, not necessarily friendly.  The outdoor patio is nice on a cool night.  I have mixed feelings about going back.  Maybe if it's 9 pm and no line outside...
