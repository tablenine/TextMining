River Grove did not do me well this weekend.. . Are there ex-cons/druggies staffed at this place? Perfect! And if so, then you'd think they sure as hell would know how to dish out an effin hot dog!! . . Yet ...why am I wishing I went to Felony Franks instead...?. . Anyway...yes, Â the prices are cheap, but damn where is the dog? They shove french fries inside, wrap it all up, throw in an onion. And tell you to keep moving.... . This plus that Hala Kahiki place on a Saturday night makes for some great conversation starters...
