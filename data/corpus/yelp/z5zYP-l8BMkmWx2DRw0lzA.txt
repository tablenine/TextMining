Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I ran 12 miles Sunday and decided that I was DEFINITELY treating myself to an Umami burger! I mean, shoot, what's the point of running if i can't load myself up with tons and tons of juicy fatty calories, right? I had the Hatch burger which included 3 different types of chilies and lots of cheese. On first bite, I'll admit, I thought i was biting into a slice of pizza... something with the peppers and cheese, but after that... of all good things hamburgery and tasty!!!! The meat was perfect! Juicy and tasty and the perfect texture. . . The burger itself was really good. I really didn't care for the fries. Sure it was cut and stacked kind of cute in a geometric way, but honestly they were soggy and I regretted ordering it. Skip it and try the onion rings. They looked better. . . I'll definitely come back and try their other burgers though... can't wait!
