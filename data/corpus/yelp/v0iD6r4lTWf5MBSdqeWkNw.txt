Eh, not really won over by this whole deal. Food was pretty decent - got the enchiladas, which had a nice melange of flavors topped with some melted cashew cheese. And maybe this is where my problem started. I've never really been a fan of fake food. If I order something that's supposed to have cheese on it, well, then, give me the cheese dammit. The yellow cashew puree that was being passed off as cheese tasted fine by itself, but don't call it something else, that's all I'm saying. . Ranting aside, RFD does some great fresh juices. I tried a blend of beets, cucumber and apple. And it was everything I wanted it to be.
