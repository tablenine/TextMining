This is the first time going to Boiling Crab during crawfish season. It was also the first time going to the location in Alhambra. One important tip, even though you don't see a crowd of people in the front, there will be a wait. We waited in the car across the street for our other friends to show up because it didn't look too crowded, then walked up to the storefront and noticed that everyone was waiting in the back. The back patio area was cool, it seemed like someone's backyard with benches and plenty of hungry people. It was about an hour wait, but well worth it.. . We sat down and got right to work. 2 lbs of crawfish and 2 lbs. of shrimp and one dungeness crab, whole shebang sauce. Mmmm. The crawfish this time was fresh, not frozen and I could tell the difference. It was a bit more than the frozen kind ($7.99 a pound vs. $3.99), but well worth it. . . The shrimp was also good. Since the sauce was thick with all the garlic sauce, the sauce didn't seep into the shrimp as well. It's all good though, we just peeled the shrimp, then dipped it right back into the sauce.. . Same thing with the crab. After getting a hold of the meat, it's beneficial to dip the crab right back in the sauce to get the flavor of the sauce. Mmmm.. . The corn was excellent. Every time I've been here, it's been very consistent.. . All in all, an excellent experience. I'm getting really good at eating these crawdads. Don't plan a night out clubbing or anything after eating here for dinner though. We tried to and just never made it out. Eating here makes up all for it though. Fun times!
