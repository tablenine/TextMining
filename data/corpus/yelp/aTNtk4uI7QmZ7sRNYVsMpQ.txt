The hubby and I woke up really early on a Sunday morning, and wanted to get some breakfast. I have been hearing a lot of good things about this place so we had to check it out. We got there right at 8:00 am when it opens and it was nice since there weren't that many people, but slowly the place started to fill up quickly. I wanted to sit outside, but on this particular day it was really really HOT, so we decided to sit inside. The first table we got was by the window but then we noticed there were a lot of dead flies which grossed me out so we moved to another table.. The hubby got the chorizo omelet, and I got the eggs benedict with canadian bacon. Both dishes were good. Fresh, tasty, and just yummy.. The hubby wants to come back and try their french toast. . I would have given it 5 stars, but parking kind of sucks.
