OH MY FREAKING GOD!!! The best banana cream pie i have ever had in my 28 years of living. and i really mean that!!! it is the best thing on earth. perfectly made and chilled just right. Besides that the salivating hickory burger with dripping sauce as you bite into it and nice crispy fries. OK, now lets talk about sitting and parking hard to get because this place is always packed so be prepared to wait but its well worth it.
