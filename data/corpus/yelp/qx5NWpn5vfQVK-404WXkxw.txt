Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Believing the hype and my foodie friend who has never steered me wrong, my bf and I trekked to Casa B for pie &amp; pasta one night for takeout. So excited, we started digging into the pizza in the car and I almost turned it around to ask for a refund. Are you kidding me??? Reminds me of cheap college pizza you order at 2am after night out. Can't decide what was worse - the pizza or the spaghetti bolognese, they were both so bleh. Who &amp; when the hype began is beyond me but it is time it stopped!
