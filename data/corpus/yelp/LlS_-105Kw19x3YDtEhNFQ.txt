Restaurant: RuSan&#39;s
Category: Japanese
This is the only sushi place I have eaten at Atlanta, but as far as sushi goes in all the places I have traveled and eaten sushi it was decent.  What makes Ru Sans so great is the awesome lively and LOUD techno music playing, the friendly waitstaff, and the happy folks having sakebombs and good times in the restaurant.  The menu is also insanely expansive.  I have a particular fondness for ume-bashi and shiso (plum and mint) and not only did they have a few sushi rolls that featured these ingredients but they also had a noodle dish with a plum sauce.  The $1 sushi menu is also very cool.  I highly recommend, but if you don't like loud techno - don't go there :)
