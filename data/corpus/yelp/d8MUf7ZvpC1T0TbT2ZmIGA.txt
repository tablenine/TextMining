Some of the best margaritas to be had here.  The mojitos are rather tasty too.  It's true that this place can fill up rather quickly, but you can conveniently wait at the bar across the street.  Tapatio will call you when your table is ready and the bartender will even pour your drink into a plastic cup to carry back across.  My favorite dish is the crepas de espinachas.  It's just a classic.  The fajitas and carne asade are also favorites. As for appetizers the shrimp cocktail and nachos are definitely at the top of my pick list.
