Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Our party of 6 was seated pretty quickly for a Friday night and service was very efficient.  I ordered the salt ramen, spiciness level 4, because I'm not crazy.  I didn't add any extras in it either (which I would come to regret later).  Initially, I was impressed when the waitress brought out the huge bowl of ramen.  But there was something missing... Where's the meat?  Oh, the one-inch squares floating in the broth? I don't think so. The noodles were alright but had to be pulled apart towards the end.  Def. come here if you want your photo on the wall of fame, but not if you're looking for a basic, chopstick-lickin good bowl of  ramen.
