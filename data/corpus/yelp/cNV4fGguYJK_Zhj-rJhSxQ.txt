Yes I give frankies a four along with some restaurants that are far superior in many ways, but you get what you come for here.  Pure east village.  small bar, brick walls, 14 seat long community table.. . the roasted fennel in garlic cream is nice and most of their pasat dishes are very very good. Pizzas light crispy just the right amount if sauce and delicious.  I was there night before last, light snow at about 11pm.  good crown in the front bar area and a full house in the back.
