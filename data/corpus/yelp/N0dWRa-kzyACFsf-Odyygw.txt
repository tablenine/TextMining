Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
LOVE The Stinking Rose. This place is great for any occasion, or no occasion at all. The atmosphere is whimsical and meticulously thought out, not leaving a corner without embellishment. The food is a garlic explosion, right down to the chocolate-covered ice cream dessert. I had the rabbit, tender and delicious and to-die-for. This place is absolutely GREAT.
