Avoid the redheaded server at all cost. Seriously, if you get stuck with her as a waitress MOVE TO ANOTHER TABLE. You can thank me later. That said, I've been going to Moody's for years. Their beer garden is THE place to be in the Summertime. Go here for the blue burger, fries, and sangria. I wouldn't take a chance on the other menu items.
