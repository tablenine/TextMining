Restaurant: Furaibo Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Good: . + cheesy tofu dish. + generous servings of fuzzy oyster stuff. + yummy flavor fish. + no wait for Asian people but white people had to stand by door for ten minutes while being ignored by hosts. . Bad:. - no pictures on menu. most restaurants on sawtelle have nice shiny pictures on their menu.. - don't understand what's so good about these chicken wings; thought they were too dry and not very meaty. - ribeye steak was kinda plain tasting. - fish serving was too small. - shochu drinks tasted kinda cough syrupy; no real bar. . Overall, it was good but it probably helped that 1) we were drunk, and 2) they must have messed up on our bill because it was only $32 for 2 drinks and 6 dishes.
