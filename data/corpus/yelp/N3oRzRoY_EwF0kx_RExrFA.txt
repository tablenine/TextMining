Restaurant: Yard House

i dont understand. why is the service at every pasadena restaurant absolutely terrible? yardhouse = no exception to what is rapidly becoming a serious rule. sigh.. . our server = rut. she wasn't a rut. her name was rut. at least that's what it said on teh name tag. . . all i know is that she was slower than molasses. brought out the wrong drinks twice. had to chase her down or ask other servers for tapatio/ketchup. just. awful.. . they may have an amazing beer selection, but unless they hire servers that are quick, efficient and CARE, i will not return.
