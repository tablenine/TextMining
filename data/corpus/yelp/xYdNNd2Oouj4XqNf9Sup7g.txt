With Bossa Nova's new Executive lunch specials you don't have to make a CEO salary to eat and be treated like one.  For a mere $7.50 you can get a full sized skirt steak with rice, black beans, salsa, and your choice of fries or plantains which normally runs $12-$15 for lunch and dinner.  Other options included chicken, fish, and a vegetarian selection.  Salad lunch specials are $6.50 and both offers are available 11a-5p M-F.  . . Per usual for Bossa, the service is impeccable, the portions are huge, taste delicious, and they have best iced tea in all the land.  I still can't believe how great of a deal this is.  Easily the best bang for your buck I've come across and I highly anticipate weekly stops here for lunch for the foreseeable future.  And while I greatly sympathize with the struggles of people during the down economy, I have to say with these types of deals I'm loving this recession.
