This is the type of place you see on TV.  Food served in small portions with names you sometimes don't understand and upscale, snobby, downtown LA city dwellers to boot.  Don't even bother to bring your kids as this place is not kid friendly at all.  . . We went on a Saturday night and I really wasn't too impressed.  Although my vegetarian plate made up of side menu items was great, i wasn't too impressed with the food or $80 dollar bill for me and my hyna.  . . Only cool thing was that we went up there in a stretched out Excursion Limo and hid from the wind in the tunnel next to the restaurant while waiting for our ride.
