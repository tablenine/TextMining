I had the pastrami with swiss and russian dressing on rye....overrated. I doubt that by foregoing the coleslaw in the sandwich I completely missed out. Canter's, unless they are having a terrible day, is much better. Oh and please skip the strawberry shortcake, which is a mountain of whipped cream with a few traces of defrosted strawberries and a slice of dry pound cake that tastes more like any regular slice of white bread.
