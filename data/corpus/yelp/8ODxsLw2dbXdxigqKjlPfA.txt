Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
My family is incredibly picky about sushi so when my sister tells me that I HAVE to try a restaurant, I know I'm in for a treat.. . Katsu-ya is definitely among my top five sushi restaurants of all times. Â  Reservations are a must and bring cash for the valet parking since there's little street parking and it's always packed, but what great restaurants are easy to get into?
