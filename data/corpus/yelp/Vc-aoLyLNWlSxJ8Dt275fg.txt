I was a little excited when I moved around the corner from this place, but after two visits I'll probably never go back.  Nothing revolting or offensive (aside from the TWO tip jars in front of me at the counter at a fast food joint with no table service), just overpriced Chicago style stuff that I've had much better versions of in other neighborhoods.  The fries in particular are really lousy.  As for the 'you only go there after drinking anyway' line, there are much better alternatives within a couple of blocks, i.e. Mexican or the 24-hour diner one block up the street.
