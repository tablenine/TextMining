The T-bone burger (served medium) is the best burger that's ever had the privilege of entering my mouth (Second best is Father's Office in Los Angeles).  Yes it's expensive, and yes it's worth it.  The fried are great too.  I prefer the criss cut fries.. . Go here, order the T-bone burger, and cherish the memory for the rest of your life.
