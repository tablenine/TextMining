Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I wish I'd realized that the only option was a crunchy shell -- in my rushed decision to go visit Tito's, I found myself deeply disappointed by the only available taco shell option. And then came the meat. With out any real guide as to what kind of meat they had, I was left under the impression that all was available was not carne asada or even chicken, but something generically titled "beef". That ended up being somewhat gooey and heavy -- not what I expected and definitely not something that impressed me. I have no idea what all the hype is about.
