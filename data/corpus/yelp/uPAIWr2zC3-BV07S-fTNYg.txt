Great location which was fairly busy on a saturday night.  There were 8 of us, but we found a large table and got our food quickly.  You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you.  All the staff members have great personalities and are very helpful and friendly.  . . The food was great.  Most plates come with 2 sides for about $11.  The mac and cheese was some of the best I have ever had.  I didnt get the fries, but they were supposed to be good and the baked beans looked killer.  Good portions too, I dont think anybody finished their plate. . . Great for lunch or dinner and also very quick in and out....If you want BBQ in the emory area, you cant beat it.
