Restaurant: Flash Taco
Category: Mexican
I don't really get the 2 star reviews either. . . But then again, I have yet to have flash taco while I am sober. I have stumbled in here in a drunken haze after making a complete fool out of myself (as usual) at the flat iron on one too many occasions. I love the chile relenos. How could a green pepper stuffed with cheese wrapped in a tortilla ever be a bad idea?! Delicious. . . Or at least I thought so at the time, when I was wasted. This is my favorite drunk food joint. By far. . . Could I live without it? Yes. But I could have probably lived without the 10 shots and PBRs I had at the flat iron too. Or making an ass out of myself after consumption of said alcohol. But how much less fun would that be?. . So go get wasted and then go to flash taco. You will go home a happy person.
