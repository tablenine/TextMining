Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
A friend of mine had a beautiful idea of going somewhere "new" for part three of her birthday celebration. When she mentioned Dolce as a nightspot, I was a little perplexed about the choice. I'd been there once after the kitchen closed and Dolce doesn't work as a lounge at all.. . They fill the spot to greater than capacity. We couldn't hear the music. There's honestly nothing worse than drinking and having to be elbow to elbow with a stranger, than doing all of that and not being able to dance.. . So yeah, I've never actually eaten at Dolce. That may be a better experience. The ambiance is pretty cool so it may make for a good date spot. I just wouldn't suggest it for a night out with the crew. Best bet is to head upstairs and hit the dance floor of Ten Pin or across the way to Strip. . . Yup.
