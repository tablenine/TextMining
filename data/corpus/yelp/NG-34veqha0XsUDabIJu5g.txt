Restaurant: Zaya Mediterranean Cuisine
Category: Greek
Let's start out by saying that I love Mediterranean cuisine. I think it is delicious and flavorful and healthy. I've been here for lunch and that was fine. . . but good god, don't go here for brunch. My boyfriend and I stumbled in for brunch and were completely unimpressed with both of our dishes. The warm pitas and exotic-tasty dip were yummy, but by eggs in hell were supposed to be nestled on a bed of hash browns came without their bed. My kibbeh (which I usually LOVE) was diced and burnt and greasy and not good. The server finally came and asked about our meal and when I asked about the hash browns, he told me that it didn't come with hash browns. After reviewing the menu, he brings me hash browns. I understand he was trying to make it right, but it was kind of late. . . I'd already eaten my greasy nibbles. Not impressed and a little irritated about it.
