Restaurant: Ciudad
Category: Latin American
So my first thought was the Chuck episode where there's that terrorist, code name Ciudad, and it's a female terrorist who tangos with Chuck.. . What is this restaurant made for anyway? Upscale drinks after work? So went there on a Saturday night. There were plenty of tables, but no room for us because they were all reserved. Even when we left the restauarnt wasn't full. Harumph.. . Anyhoo, Ciudadis perfect for pretentious drinks and appetizers. Actually, it's more like they're trying to be hip and pretentious, yet fail. Entrees were upscale takes on various popular Latin American dishes ($30 for lomo saltado?!?), or, in my case, steak given an exotic yet accessible sounding name: the Argentine Gaucho steak. Which I chose based off the yelp reviews. Good thing I did!. . It was tender, a true medium, and good piece of charred cow. It better be for $33. Mashed potatoes were nothing special. The chard was ridiculously salty. You know, the whole meal was ridiculously salty. I think they do that so you order more $10 drinks. My white sangria was very enjoyable, but it wasn't the giant fruity TGI Fridays sangria I was imagining. Instead it's a few cut-up pieces of fruit and white wine in a wine glass. The seared calamari was more like calamari rings and white beans soupy sauce in a bowl. If this were a Rachael Ray recipe, it would be called something like spicy squid stoup. Everyone else's dishes, the grilled fish with tamarind glaze and skirt steak looked underwhelming and not filling.. . The decor is fine. But you know what's not fine? The bar stools!!! There's no bar or ledge or anything to rest your feet, so I ate dinner with my legs dangling, which was SUPER annoying.. . So if you must eat dinner here, get the gaucho steak. And make reservations.
