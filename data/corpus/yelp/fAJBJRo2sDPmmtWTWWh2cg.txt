Surely, there wouldn't be any problems for a table for two at 10pm on a Thursday night?. . We valeted the car and popped inside to see a bustling, busy, and loud scene of young LA urbanites out on the town. Lucky for us, there was ONE small table for two and we didn't need a late night reservation. . . After being seated and greeted by our friendly server, I was excited to try something new and something that many of my virtual food friends have raved about. Unfortunately, both of us ate earlier and weren't too hungry. . . We opted to share a Burrata mozzarella cheese pizza with squash blossoms with a glass of red wine. The pizza was like nothing I'd ever had before - crisp and refreshingly light, it's deceiving. After one small slice, I thought I'd only have a little bit more. But in the end, kept cutting small slice after small slice until there was just one little small sliver left. . . The buzz on Pizzeria Mozza and Mario Batali, Nancy Silverton, and Joseph Bastianich are all true. I will be going back for more soon.... . Enjoy the hype, enjoy the vibe, enjoy the pie. But remember to call ahead for a table!
