Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Hide was not for me whatsoever. I firmly believe that the sushi bar I call home up in the Bay may have ruined sushi for me from anywhere else, but nothing - from the service to the prices, to the fish, was impressive. The flavors seemed to lack a freshness, and it took about ten minutes to merely get the attention of a server to receive my check. . . I ordered albacore, which ended up being tataki (not noted anywhere), salmon, which lacked a fresh flavor, and the special scallop was really just spicy scallop nigiri (and not a great example at that).
