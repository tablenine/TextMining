Restaurant: Bonnie&#39;s Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
I like Bonnie's Grill. In the din of all the restaurants on Fifth, in between the giants of Blue Ribbon Sushi and Al di la, sits Bonnie's, windows open, the smell of a grill and a deep fryer luring you in like no other sensation.. . A really tasty burger, and an equally tasty turkey burger, as well as tasty fries, tasty coleslaw, and tasty wings. Everything's pretty tasty. . . It's no Corner Bistro, but this ain't no diner, either.. . When the weather's nice they'll also usually keep their doors open; it's perfect for a beer and a little bit of American food to bring back memories of springtime in New York.
