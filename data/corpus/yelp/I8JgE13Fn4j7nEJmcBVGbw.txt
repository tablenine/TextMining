Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
Ay, Papi!. . One damn good Cuban sammich. Cheap, HUGE, and filling. That's how I like my sammiches... and my men. But I digress.. . Fried plantains = Heaven. . . The dining room wasn't packed on a Sunday afternoon, and my food came out in literally 5 minutes. Papi's sweet tea doesn't taste like the typical Lipton-brewed stuff. I'm not sure what's different, but my tastebuds are pleased.
