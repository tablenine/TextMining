If you are looking for a really nice place with a great atmosphere to take your girlfriend or a date to, this is the place. Just don't expect high quality food when you come here. . . I took my ex-gf here for our anniversary dinner on a beautiful, clear, Los Angeles night. Yamashiro is hidden in the Hollywood Hills and sits on top of the hill overlooking the whole city. The view is amazing. You can walk through their Japanese garden and enjoy the view of the city on a clear day. It really is a sight to see. . . If this review was solely based on presentation, it would definitely be a 5. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the hype. For appetizers, we got the Seared Ahi (which was actually pretty good) and some of the sushi (spicy tuna, albacore, etc.... which was just OK). We also ordered the Rainbow and Crunchy rolls, which I was not impressed with. I usually judge a place that has sushi by these 2 rolls, and they were not even in the top 10 of the best that I had ever had. We also got another Entree which we shared (but I dont remember what it was, which means that it was not too spectacular).. . Great atmosphere and mediocre cuisine for a pretty steep price. That pretty much sums it up.
