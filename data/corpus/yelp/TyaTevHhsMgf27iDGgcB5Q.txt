Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Ok. I'm a dork and I've watched a documentary on hamburgers! LOL! Its actually really cool because a lot of the fast food culture came from LA! The Apple Pan was one of the restaurants I've been meaning to try ever since watching this program on the history of hamburgers, drive-ins, and fast food.. . So what did the documentary say? The Apple Pan prides itself in using top notch ingredients. For example, they use only a small percentage of an iceberg lettuce (the middle part) in thier hamburgers and all their burgers are made to order. This same buildling has been profitable since they opened in the 20s and even to this day, the family owned business has refused to sell! What a story!. . After knowing all this history, I went VERY eager to taste this legend of a burger! :) Ordered the ORIGINAL Steakburger ($6.20) w/cheese (+$0.50) with an order of Fries ($2.00) and a Diet Coke ($1.50). . Truthfully? I was a bit disappointed. The ketchup/onion sauce was WAY too much and killed the taste of the burger. I might be biased because I don't like too much sauce in general, but the entire time I was eating, I was thinking "In-N-Out" is soooooo much better! LOL! Plus the servers weren't friendly and the whole ordering/seating process was just so freaking confusing.. . However, the restaurant had a old time feel with the U shaped counter, paper cups, paper wrapped hamburgers, old school cash register, the workers with thier cute little hats. Definitely worth trying at least once :). . I may come back again.. and ask them to hold the sauce!! AND supposedly thier apple pies are GOOOOOD :)
