Woodfired pizzas, fired squash blossoms, and playing The Bends in its entirely while I dine... how could I not love this place?. . My good friend Marisa I. took my and fellow SFer Jenny S. here when we had a girls weekend in L.A. and this was the perfect dinner spot.. . The only down side was that we had reservations but still had to wait a half hour for our table, but the pizza, appies, wine and butterscotch pudding was def worth the wait. Such is L.A. I feel like everywhere in L.A. makes you wait just so you can be reminded of just how exclusive it is or how lucky you are to get in.
