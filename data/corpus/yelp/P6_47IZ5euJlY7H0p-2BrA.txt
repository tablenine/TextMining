So I'm not much of an Italian food person. But Buona Terra rocked my socks off.. . My girlfriend had her rehearsal dinner there on a cold Friday night, and it was warm, cozy and very friendly. Our dinner was family style, and there was enough food to feed a small army.. . First of all, lets comment on the bread. Hell to the YES. Not only is the bread thick and crusty with a soft center, but the garlic spread might be the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. If I didn't have to wear a bridesmaid dress the next day, I could have polished off a whole loaf of bread for dinner. Can I buy it in bulk or have the recipe??. . Moving on, we had the Panzanella Toscana - vine ripe tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and basil in a gorgonzola vinegrette. It was good, not great. Next was the fried calamari. That was polished off pretty quickly. . . Next was the Pennine al'Arabiata - It was perfectly cooked with just enough spice. I don't like pasta too much, and I thought it was delicious.. . For the main course, we had Paillard di Pollo al Palio - a pounded chicken breast in an herb sauce. It was very good and perfectly portioned.. . For dessert, we had a platter of pastries and cakes. Definitely try the tiramisu and cheesecake. I hear the cannolis are also very good too.. . Service was stellar!. . I will be back for sure... even if it's just for the garlic spread.
