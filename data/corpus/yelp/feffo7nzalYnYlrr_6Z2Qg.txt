I hate to give such a low rating, but I guess when it's bad - it's bad. I happen to live directly across from Adobo and thought I'd give it a shot for the first time last week. I walk in and was pleased to be immediately seated though the place was packed. After reviewing the menu our waiter comes to the table and asks what we'd like.... . SIde note - Being a vegetarian I often have somewhat odd requests - i.e. a club sandwich without meat. But I've NEVER had an issue with my requests in the past. They might seem odd, but if I'm paying the full cost of the item, who cares? . . So I decide on the shrimp tacos without the shrimp, which would be tacos with guacamole, lettuce, tomoato and sour cream..sounded great to me. Well apparently the waiter found this request extremely offensive because he looked at me as if I had just called his mom a bad name. He says he doesn't think he can possibly do that and goes back to ask the kitchen their opinion...comes back and says the chef doesn't see the point in shrimp tacos without shrimp. NO SHIT SHERLOCK. I KNOW it's not logical to a non-vegetarian, but it is to me. It's a simple request. I want to pay for it. But you won't give them to me. . . SO I go with the soup, which was fine. But the service just did me in. The dining experience is supposed to be about the customer, not the waiter. . . Adobo, I give you one star. I hate you.
