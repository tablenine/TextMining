We went on a Saturday night and it was packed, with a line out the door. . They kept the line moving and by the time we had ordered some tables had opened up.  There is seating indoors and outdoors.  In my opinion, outdoors is way better, especially given that they had two flat panel screens inside showing TMZ. Bummer.  This might be a good thing if a sports team you care about were playing.. . The outdoor seating was nice and our order came fairly quickly.  We had a pastrami sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich.  Both were great.  We finished off with a coconut cupcake and a PB&amp;J cupcake.  Yum!  We will have to go back to try out the milkshakes and some of the other great looking items on the menu.
