GARLICKY! Bagna calda is so pungent that I swear I smelled like garlic the next day. But it's crazy delicious. I love garlic like whoa, and everything tasted so yummy. The prices are holy frijoles, but for a nice night out - the bill is fair. Baby back ribs were tender and moist and well seasoned, mashed potatoes = creamy goodness, garlic fries??! YES YES YES. I liked everything, even the gnocchi with basil alfredo sauce. DO IT.
