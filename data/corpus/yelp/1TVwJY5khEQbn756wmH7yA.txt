This restaurant is beautiful. It's hard to tell what it looks like from the outside but once you walk in, it's like this huge open space. It wasn't crowded at all the day we went. Our server greeted us right away. I have to say this restaurant itself is amazing and I would definitely go back but to the bar area. Dinner was just "meh." Nothing was special about the dishes we ordered. They were all bland and the side of fried rice is so not worth the money. We also had sushi and the rice was kind of hard. The drinks were pretty good though. Food was overpriced and we didn't feel very satisfied at the end of our meal. Go for the decor and drinks. Get better food somewhere else.
