I suppose it's all how  you make it, if your concoction tastes Blah you have no one else to blame but yourself. And this is what happened to me. If you have ever been to Mongolian grill it's the same kind of concept. Pick your meats, and veggies, take them to the cooking station where they stir fry your creation, and then your meal is delivered to your table.  If you are a big eater then I would suggest this place, you can't go wrong with endless trips to the "buffet" for an additional $1. . . After our second trip up, we returned to our table to find everything cleared off for the next customer; my drinks, silverware etc...were gone! This would not have bugged me so much if my coat, and my dinning companions coat were still hanging off the backs of our chairs!  The food is good, but I probably won't be returning anytime soon.
