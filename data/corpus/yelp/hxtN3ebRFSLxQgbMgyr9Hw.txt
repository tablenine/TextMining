Restaurant: New Wave Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
The world needs more places like New Wave. . The coffee itself is excellent. I was at first disappointed that they do not have Intelligentsia but the dark Metropolis is as good as anything they put out.. . This being our first time there we split a little of everything. The vegan soup was densely flavored while the veggie sandwich had a nice mixture, but maybe a little too heavy on the onion. We also tried the scone and cheesecake. Both went great with their coffee and are highly recommended.. . The prices are lower than average for this type of place. A bottomless cup of coffee is $2 which is the same price for a medium to go. Sandwiches range from $5-$6, a cup of soup was around $1.50 (cheap!) and pastries were around $2.. . It has a relaxed atmosphere with quiet music, and acoustics that don't let it get too loud from other people's mindless conversations. It was difficult to find a seat on Sunday afternoon, but I'm told they will add more tables. The staff was friendly, but I guess everyone is when they start a new job. I'll check back in a month or so to see if they become embittered by the unwashed masses asking for coffee at 10am on Sundays.. . As mentioned in another review, there were an incredible amount of MacBooks. I would estimate that I saw ten notebook computers and nine were made by Apple. They must come free with every brownstone rental on Logan Boulevard.
