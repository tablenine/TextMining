I must admit I am partially biased as one of my favorite restaurants in all of Chicago is another of Shawn McClain's handy work, Custom House.  If I could eat this vegetarian all the time, I could give up meat in a heartbeat (maybe not bacon).  . . I could go on about everything but the combination of flavors and presentation of everything is just spectacular.. . No complaints from me other than the distance from the L but on a nice night it can be a great walk...
