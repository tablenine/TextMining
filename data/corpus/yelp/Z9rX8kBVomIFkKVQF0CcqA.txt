I live a good 20 miles away from MILK, but I had to stop by because I couldn't resist a) the reviews! and b) the decor! The website convinced me pretty fast that I was destined to come here and stuff myself senseless (and with NO shame!). . The decor is absolutely wonderful! I love the way everything is set up and the food comes out on 5-star looking white ceramic plates. My boyfriend and I both ordered the roast beef sandwich...which was absolutely delicious. I tried their Thai Tea and was pleasantly surprised and absolutely approved. Instead of a liquid base they give it to you as a smoothie so it tastes a lot thicker and creamier. For dessert we had the chocolate-chocolate chip ice cream sandwich which was big enough for the both of us. I was tempted to take some food back home but 20 miles is quite a ways to go if you don't want the stuff to melt. Unfortunately this is a place I'm just going to have to go and eat a dozen different types of pastries shamelessly.. . The only part about MILK that I was upset about was the fact that it's in a permit-zone. This means that if you want to come here after 6PM you have to find yourself lucky enough to get a spot on the side street. We couldn't find a single space (it looked like a pretty busy street that day) so we had to park in their 4-slotted parking lot to the side. After 6PM this valet guys comes over and haggles you for a measly $3.50 for parking. But seriously, you forget about it once you step into MILK.. . MILK also serves a variety of chips, fresh fruits, ice cream sandwiches/floats/mini bon bon ice cream, fresh baked cookies, cake, etc. etc. Also, if you live far and you're looking for an excuse to come here, about a mile down the road is the Beverly Plaza where you can spend your money recklessly.
