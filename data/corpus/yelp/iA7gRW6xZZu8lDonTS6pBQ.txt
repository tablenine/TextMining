A Latin American brunch hot spot?  I'll give it a try.. . Flo doesn't take reservations for brunch, so expect to put your name down and wait.  We chitter chattered for 45 minutes before being seated.  . . I went for the smoked hash, two poached eggs over a turkey hash with an abundance of veggies (surprise!).  I thought the hash could have used more potato cubes and less celery.  Kudos for the default side dish being fruit vs. your typical pancakes or hash browns... though, I guess I ordered a hash to begin with.. . Overall, nothing to write home about.
