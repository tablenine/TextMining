This place is great. First I wanted to touch on the beer selection. They have a all the classics and then for bolder people they have the beer that was imported in from the UK made by monks that's 12%. All the people who work here are either from Ireland or some part of the UK. Its great. If you're into a meat pies and , a pint and maybe some sports on the TV, go to the The Grange.
