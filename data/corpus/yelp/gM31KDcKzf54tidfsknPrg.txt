Category: Steakhouses
It's been five days since our meal at Mastro's and I still get excited about it. In these past five days I've been trying to process what I enjoyed. Was it the just perfect Oyster Rockefeller? Well-balanced Chilean Sea Bass? THE Ribeye? Gorgon-delicious Mac N Cheese? Delicately pleasing Creme Brulee? Or the simply named yet tastefully created, Butter Cake? You decide since I'm getting hungry and full again just by the thought of it all!
