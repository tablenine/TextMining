I tried the Nutella ice cream, it was rich and heavenly.  I think this one was a special flavor, but they always have a selection on unique and yummy flavors, as well as the classics.  The lunch/dinner menu is equally as good.  I had the Roasted Chicken Sandwich and it was excellent.  The Salads are very large and satisfying, yet healthy.  Service is speedy and friendly.
