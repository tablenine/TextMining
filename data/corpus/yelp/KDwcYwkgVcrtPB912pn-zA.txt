I went there for a small dinner for work. I was very underwhelmed by the food, but the atmosphere was nice. It was not too loud, and the staff was pretty friendly. It looked like they had some seating out back, but I didn't get to see it. They had free valet parking directly across the street, which is nice, but it was not clearly noted. The person I met at dinner missed it altogether and drove around looking for a street spot.. . The portion sizes were good, but the food itself was just so-so. I had a piece of fish that came with potatoes and onions. There was a simple butter sauce, but it was very bland. My colleagues also thought their food was pretty bland. The menu itself, though, was pretty varied, and as a pasta snob I'd have to admit they seem to know how to make pasta (a rarity in Atlanta). The wine list was OK.. . I'd probably go back for a business lunch but not for dinner.
