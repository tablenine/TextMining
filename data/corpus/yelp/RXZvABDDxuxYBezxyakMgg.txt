The good things first: the atmosphere is cool, the service good, and since it was our first time, they gave us free flan. They need to improve their menu. The food is way overpriced and not very good. I'm glad I went to experience a new restaurant, but would not go back again. Â One entree, half an app, and two drinks all together $75 with tip.
