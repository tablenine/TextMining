OK, simple review here.... I like it! The food is always fresh, staff and atmosphere are fun without being too noisy or obnoxious. A true neighborhood bistro. Perfect spot for a bite before or after a movie. Nothing better than to sit on the patio with wine and cheese on nice spring and fall days. Very cozy inside for the winter months.
