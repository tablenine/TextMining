The name of the game at this restaurant is to see how much meat can you stuff in your mouth .....they have people running around with all types of meat from beef (ribeye was really dry), pork (dry, not recommended), chicken, rack of lamb chops (which i went a little crazy and ate like 7of them and got maybe itis afterwards)  and of course bacon wrapped filet.  . I wish they had flags on the table instead of those red/green coasters cause either way, the waiters just bombarded us with meat left and right.. . They also have a salad bar in the middle of the restaurant for people that wanna stuff themselves full of greens.  For 60 dollars per person, I did not touch a single piece of green.  My philosophy of the night was if it wasn't pink, pass it on cause I'm not putting it in my mouth.  Steak people!  . . One cool thing is we went for a friends bday and the manager lady was very friendly and gave us dessert on the house.  I was surprise they don't give all desserts for free for 60 dollars, but I guess they have to earn more money.   Overall, I would rather enjoy eating a good piece of meat at a nice place for the amount they charge instead of forcing yourself to drown in OK meat.  Or if you are on the akins diet, this is your heaven!
