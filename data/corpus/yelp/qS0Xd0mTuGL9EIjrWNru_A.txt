This place is has one of the best menus I've seen in a long time. They have a great selection of small plates, pizzas, pastas, and principle plates. We ordered the beef carpaccio (melts in your mouth), the clams and oysters, pizza, salad and a couple different pasta dishes. My favorite dish was the Spaghetti with caviar. This dish sounds pretentious, but let me tell you that I would categorize it more as "nouveau comfort food." The sauce was simple, maybe a bit of butter and olive oil and it had just the right amount of caviar to give it flavor without being fishy. The broth the oysters were served in was also amazing. Portions were just right. The pizzas are a good size and a good buy at only $15. . . The only negative was that the service, while friendly, lacked precision and coordination. No sooner would someone drop off a plate then someone would be coming around to clear the table. I suspect it's because they were so busy. Also, our pizza came out AFTER we had finished eating and one dish never came out at all. The management compensated by giving us complimentary dessert (AMAZING!), but I would have preferred to have received better service rather than desserts as an apology. This is the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars because this place is right up my alley. Good food, great vibe, and the price is right! This place is a really great value for the type of food they serve and I highly recommend it. In fact, I'll be going there to sample the breakfast/brunch menu this Sunday!
