Stopped by here on our way back to the Bay Area so that we could pick up some pastries for the road. The lines were out the door (good sign!) but it moved pretty quickly. Grabbed four guava and cheese, two spinach and feta, and two coconut glazes. Total: $7! What a deal! In hindsight, we probably should have doubled our order.. . Each item was absolutely delicious. Totally worth braving the lines. This place is a Must-Visit and a Must-Return-For-More! Next time: potato balls and sandwiches.. . Summary: 5/5 stars. +Mouth watering pastries. +Excellent value. +Great service. -Parking and lines
