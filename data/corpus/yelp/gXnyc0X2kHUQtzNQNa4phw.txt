Swanky! . Cutie servers! . Not 'too' cool to just drop-in on (can be a danger in this area).  . . Excellent tuna sashimi (I wish I could bold words here!).  I ordered my first ever hand-roll here; the spicy scallop mayo hand-roll, and I will definitely be trying more of that!  (Once more for emphasis) Really, really good tuna.. . Great atmosphere too.  I'm a sucker for the warm washcloth before meals and the fancy cut orange after.
