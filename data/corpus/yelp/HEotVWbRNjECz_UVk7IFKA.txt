I went here inebriated after bowling at Timber Lanes expecting some good drunk food. I ordered the Chicago Dog and Cheese fries. For some reason we didn't even receive any rude service or called any names like I have read in other reviews, maybe the staff only does that during the drunk rush.. . The cheese fries were absolutely disgusting, there isn't even real cheese on the cheese fries, it's supposed be cheddar but it's really it's what you would call "cheese product" which is a legal term for food items that contain less than 51% cheese. The cheese had a chunky texture to it as if it wasn't even thawed and melted all the way.. . The Chicago dog wasn't even good either and that's not even a hard thing to screw up. I can see why people rated this poorly and I was really disappointed with my meal. There are much better places to get a late night bite to eat then this dump.
