This place is really good for the price you pay.. . When we got there we ordered the fish claypot and rice paper wraps.  It was actually the first time for me to try the rice paper wraps and I just found really cool and unique.  It was fun wrapping for 2 minutes and devouring for 5 seconds.  They could've done more with the fish claypot like add more stuff to the pot.  . . Customer service was really good too and the two servers took extra care of us!
