Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
I went to David Burkes and Le Lan for restaurant week, and I have to say, David Burkes was a million times better!. . + everyone liked their appetizers (lobster bisque, crab cakes, the wedge). + entrees were delicious (I'm not a steak eater so I got the chicken. It was very good.). + The creme brulee was to die for.  It was seriously so good. (We also tried the chocolate cake which was good, too.). + The option of a mini martini is nice since the drinks are so expensive. The mini martini was really cute, and strong too...so for $5 I didn't mind that it was so small.. + Our waiter was friendly and gave good suggestions.. . - The family style side dishes were really tasty, but so tiny. Luckily it was only us three girls. If we had had another person, we barely would have gotten a taste of everything. I don't think the side proportions are adequate at all!. . - The girl working at the front of the restaurant was really rude. It was pouring rain so we were a  little late.  She gave us so much attitude eventhough we called to tell her we were running behind.
