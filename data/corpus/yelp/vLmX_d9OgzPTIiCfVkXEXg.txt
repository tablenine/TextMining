I love this place.  Sure you have to wait long to get a table most times, but it is so worth the wait.  Their food is outstanding.  They make their tortilla's fresh before they're served and there is a drink that they're known for "The Swirl". They're awesome!!!!!!!!. . Definately a place to check out for a date. ;)
