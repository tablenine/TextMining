I really want to give this joint 4-5 stars but read on.... . No doubt, very good food- it sets itself apart from other asian restaurants.. I don't want to repeat what others have already said on how good the food is.. . But, it is not cheap.  It's pricey for asian food.  I would like to go and eat there more often but I can't justify paying $8+tax  for a small bowl of fried rice and a couple pieces of short rib.   Noodles are expensive too $13+tax? too much.. . The short rib in Joyee's is about $8-9, it is not as good, i admit! But you will have a full belly and lunch the next day.
