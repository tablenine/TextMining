How long has this truck been around?  Its kinda funny (in a 'oh interesting' way) how it took so long for this fusion concept to come out.  well, in hindsight if you think about it..... . ...anyway, onto the review.... . So my friend is tracking the kogi truck on facebook (something called Twitter??) and last night she says, 'the kogi truck is in Silver Lake, let's go", so how do you say no to something called the 'Kogi Truck"!?  So we drive ourselves to the kogi truck in silverlake at midnight and the line is long....we wait about 15 minutes in the cold and then my friend orders for me.  Two kogi tacos please.... . I've been to many (i'm not kidding), MANY taco trucks in my life and this is easily top 5.  I might be biased cuz I am Korean, but still, the meat was cooked well and very tasty.  I'm someone who LOVES kimchi with cheese, so the kimchi quesadilla was DELICIOUS (I'm thinking of making it at home).  I laughed that they had Korchata...which is pretty much hot horchata (i suggested that they call it "hotchata").   I'm surprised they don't serve soju at this truck.  LOL. . So all in all, I enjoyed my first time at the kogi truck and I might add the twitter application on facebook so that I could track this truck also.  We'll see.... . Pros:. - cheap (well it IS a taco truck). - delicious. . Cons:. - hmm..didn't find any. . What I Ordered:. - 2 kogi tacos. - 1 soda. TOTAL:  $6 (I'm not totally sure because my friend paid). . What my friends ordered:. - kogi tacos. - pork tacos. - kimchi quesadilla (yum!). - korchata
