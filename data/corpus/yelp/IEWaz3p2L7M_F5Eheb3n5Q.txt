About 2AM after a show at the Knitting Factory, my newfound "buddy" and I were tipsy and starving. Torn between Bossa Nova and the usual ghetto dog carts, we ended up coming here instead. My bootsy friend, in a full afro with chops and zoot suit ensemble (don't ask), and I probably looked like an odd couple, but being in Hollyweird, no one gave us a second glance. . . Per usual, my food was fantastic. Their perfectly grilled salmon fillet with sweetened plantains, simmered black beans, and fluffed rice always hits my sweet spot. Finish it off with some caramelized bananas a la mode, and I can die happy.. . Unfortunately, my spur-of-the-moment date missed my sweet spot by a few miles. Tales of a crazy ex-wife, two kids, and a former drug habit, though entertaining, didn't exactly captivate my heart. To make a short story shorter, bootsy got the boot...and the bill.
