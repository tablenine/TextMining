This bar is pretty cool for being in Alaska. . . Get it? Because its cold in Alaska and uptown is far away? LoLphin safe tuna! (that's my new, horrible catch phrase when laughing at my own jokes). . . The bar was very spacious and even though it was pretty crowded it never got to the point where I felt claustrophobic. The music was OK but i really am not a fan of the "DJ" standing at a lap top playing tunes and not really mixing. That isn't really a "DJ" its more of a guy taking requests but it worked for the place and its cool with me.,....kind of. . . The first round of drinks were really weak. Although i tipped well and the drinks increased with potency as the night went on. However I really think the strength of the first drink is how to gauge the fairness of the drink price. . . The girl at the door was really nice but she looked like she could throw down at a moments notice. I liked the back and forth banter when I would go outside to increase my chances of an early death from cancer. Customer service on all fronts here was pretty good. . . I guess they have food. I was there to get drunk. I hadn't really drank since Halloween and I wanted to catch a buzz. They provided the buzz albeit a kind of expensive buzz. . . I also liked the fact that they had televisions everywhere. I don't care what others say, I'm not in this kind of place for intimacy or ambiance. I am here to get drunk and watch television, the greatest American past time since Baseball. . . *Note to self. Do not, I REPEAT do not eat Burger King at 2 AM and not expect to wake up at 7 AM thinking you are going to have a stroke.
