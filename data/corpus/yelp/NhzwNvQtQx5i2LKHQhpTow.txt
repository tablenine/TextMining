I'd really like to just give this place 3.5 stars, but I'll move it on down to 3 because of the wait to get in.  I think if you come to this place thinking it's a BAR and not a restaurant, you'll be leaving much happier.  It's fend-for-yourself once you finally get in, so if you have a few people, send some to hunt for space to sit and the rest to the bar to order your food.  It was really busy when I came here on a Saturday night, but we spied some people finishing up and waited while staring pointedly at them (just kidding, we waited patiently... of course) so we found seats pretty quickly.  The burger IS really good (and even better when you think that it's really just bar food..), and they have a great selection of beer.  I would definitely recommend trying it at least once, but my visits to FO will probably be few and far in between just because of the wait and having to hunt for a table.
