I went to Wurstküche this past week due to my brother in laws recommendation. You will not be disappointed. Exotic sausages, fantastic beer selection and communal tables; what more do you need?  I highly recommend for the first timers the rattle snake and rabbit sausage with the sweet peppers. Also there are a wide assortment of dipping sauces for the fries which is just another reason to go.
