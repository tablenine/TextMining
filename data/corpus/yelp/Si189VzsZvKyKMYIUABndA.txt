This place is so cute.  It's across the street from the big blue penitentiary-looking Church of Scientology, which inexplicably makes me nervous.  The eatery itself is so laid-back and chill, it makes for a wonderfully mellow dining experience.. . Been here twice and both times I got the French toast with bourbon and pecan topping and their classic eggs benedict with potatoes.  The French toast is amazing.  Take some home in a box, and it makes for a deviliciously good warm and sweet midnight treat.  The eggs benedict were decent (I've had better), but I've found that the potatoes are really hit or miss.  Most of them are tragically blackened and overcooked.  I'd recommend choosing the side salad or fresh fruit instead.. . And the complimentary water?  Love the bottle, but please please please...this girl needs ice in her cup.  Lukewarm water fail.. . The place is great but it's kind of on the pricey side, so I'd be prepared to stuff your belly and empty your wallet.  You can see for yourself afterwards if massive food coma trumps being down a few bucks.
