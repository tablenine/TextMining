After 1/2 a year of reading about the Kogi truck in Newsweek, the New York Times, my friends' twitter and facebook statuses... I finally got the chance to try it myself on a recent visit to LA. It took awhile to track down the truck. There was no line when I went (on a Thursday night), so that made me happy. I got three tacos: Korean short ribs, spicy BBQ chicken, and tofu. Each had a unique flavor and they all were very good. I like the tofu the most - it was slightly sweet which was unexpected. I wanted to get more food (kimchi quesadilla? dessert??) cause when would i get an opportunity to return? But unfortunately, I had gone to a potluck for dinner and after 3 more tacos, I wasn't hungry anymore. Oh well. Probably better that I don't stuff myself at 11 pm. But yes, I had high expectations and waited so long to eat here, so I can't exactly say that this place wasn't good, right? =)
