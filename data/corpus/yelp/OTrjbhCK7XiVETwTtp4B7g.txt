I was skeptical bc I was not a fan of Urban Belly (glorified overpriced ramen), but I was pleasantly surprised. . . I really enjoyed the kogi sammich and tostones. The kogi sammich was a little salty but it could be overlooked. And they give good sized portions of all their dishes. . . It's conveniently located underneath the western blue line but you'd never know it cause it's absolutely sound proof inside. They have 2 tops along Â the perimeter of the space and a large communal table in the middle. . . I'd definitely come back again, looking forward to trying some of the other dishes.
