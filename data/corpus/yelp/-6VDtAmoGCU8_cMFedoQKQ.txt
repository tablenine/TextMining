Chicken doner sandwich is delicious.  the bread is sooooo good.   And each thin slice of chicken melts in my mouth.  I like to cap it off with a passionberry iced tea.   You know those scenes where donuts dance in Homer's head?   In mine, you'll find dancing sandwiches.   What is that delicious sauce inside?  Simply addicting.  . . Go to Spitz, it's not just any sandwich.  Oh and there's another one in Little Tokyo too, location is larger and just as tasty!
