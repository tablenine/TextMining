This place costs an arm and a leg, but was it worth it?  Yes, but for a once in a lifetime sort of thing.  Even if I had tons of money, I wouldn't necessarily keep coming back to this place because I wasn't that impressed with the food.  Presentation was amazing, obviously, but I felt that a lot of dishes were lacking in bold flavors.  . . The service is what you are really paying for, in my opinion.  There is no experience like it and it was definitely worth a try to have come here and experienced it first hand.  I had the Chef's course and was unimpressed with most of the flavors.  The desserts, however were a different story.  WOW, the most amazing desserts I have ever had.  Big applause to Gale Gand for her amazing and delicious creations.. . I am glad to have been here at least once, the experience itself was really amazing and stays with me to this day. I really can't describe it, you have to be there to experience the whole thing.  Food itself was a disappointment and I personally think it's ridiculous that anyone would drop two to three hundred dollars for one meal, but if it's a special occasion and something you'll do just few times in your lifetime, I say go with Tru and enjoy yourself!
