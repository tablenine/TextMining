Absolutely worth the wait. My friend suggested this place when my bf wanted something that was unique to LA for lunch today. We drove up from Newport Beach, picked up my friend and made our way over to Kogi's location that morn, at the Best Buy. . . We found semi-primo parking and then waited in line. My bf and I got 3 short ribs tacos and 3 spicy pork tacos. I also splurged and bought a t-shirt. . . We then proceeded to tailgate (some beers would have been nice) on our rental prius. The kalbi tacos were good, but the spicy pork was even better. It had good flavor and is not what I would call spicy (I like it numbingly spicy), and was also very tender. Three tacos were just right to get my contented but not stuffed.. . A great find and we'll definitely hit this up again if we find ourselves in the area!. . As an epilogue:. We then made our way over to the nearby fruit stand where we got heaping bags o' fruit (watermelon, cantaloupe, orange, jicama, mango, pineapple, and cucumbers -- mixed in with lime, salt and chili powder) and finished off said lunch at the beach.
