Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Great space.  I felt like I was in a Chicago restaurant.  It's nice that downtown LA has a restaurant that is different from the smooth modern (which I love) dark look.  This place is cavernous, loud and busy busy.. . If you are thinking you can take a client here for lunch to close your next deal, think again.  It is way too loud at lunch.  Pick breakfast or dinner where people are more relaxed and concentrate more on the food.  . . The pizza is really good and most of the small plate items are more than filling.  The food is above average.  Check out the deli which has the feel of a NY deli, but with EVERYTHING.  . . The wait staff is a little frazzeled, but I would be too if I had to manuver in such a large space.  The management walks around and does acknowledge the guests, so if there is a wait issue they will promptly address it.  In Los Angeles we are used to not waiting very long to be seated.  We are spoiled.  If you go to any other top 20 city you can wait sometimes for up to 2 hours. . . I would highly recommend Bottega Louie.  Supporting establishments downtown is important as well as adding a different vibe.
