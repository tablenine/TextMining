I wore my yelp hoodie to show them what was up. . . Feel. The. Burn.. . (Also, I wore it cuz it was cold and I didn't have my poofy jacket.). . So yeah, I dunno what to make of this place. We shared the Asian squash and bacon dumplings. Uh... fecking weird. They kind of grew on me though. We also had the shrimp udon which was decent, but not especially impressive. The best thing was the short rib and scallion fried rice. I don't know what they did to that rice, but if Uncle Ben were there, I would have gotten all up in his grill and been like, "Fail! You fucking dickbag, why didn't you invent this? I've been eating your shit rice all this time for no reason." If you're his nephew you can let him know I said that.
