They only take reservations a month in advance and the lines open at 10am so I would call at like 10:09 and give them the date of exactly one month later and they'd only have like 4pm, WTF!!. . I was so determined on principal alone that I called every day at 10am for a week until I got a reservation.  After a week I still only got 5:45pm on a Saturday so I took it.  There was to be a group of four and we all concluded that this pizza better be orgasmic.. . We arrived about 5:30 and were seated right away.  The tables are very close together and it's quite loud so we had to shout to each other.  Our waitress recommended an excellent wine and we got 3 appetizers.  The Risotto meatballs, a squash thing and beet thing.  We also got a Tricolore salad with Anchovy dressing.  All were amazing.. . We got a ham pizza, sausage pizza and a white pizza.  The white was the best I think.  They are only 10 inches so you can get one per person or share between 2 people.  For dessert we got the Butterscotch pudding, some gelati and a caramel thing.  All were excellent.. . By the end of the meal we agreed that it was well worth the effort and the wait and that we'd be making another reservation for a month later.  I gotta say not only was the food unbelievable but so was the service.  Which is rare since I'm quite persnickety about service.
