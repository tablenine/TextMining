This place has enough reviews that adding one more seems kind of superfluous, but I've been coming here since 2004 so I feel I've earned my right to review.  Overall, I really like Kopi, though I managed to sort of forget that it existed for about a year.  That actually pretty much sums Kopi up - pleasant and convenient but not knock your socks off memorable.. . I've tried a variety of menu items (sandwiches, panini,  the MONSTER awesome nachos, bagels, scones, etc.)  and they've all been a-ok to great.  Word to the wise, though - Kopi has no stovetops or industrial ovens, so they're cooking everything either in the microwave or a toaster oven.  For this reason, I've avoided ever ordering eggs - I'm just not convinced they can be prepared properly off a griddle.  Prices are fair with a few items being notably pricey - the guacamole and fruit and cheese plate come to mind immediately.. . The drinks are awesome and coffee refills come frequently.  The staff (including the two owners, one or both of whom seem to be here at all times) are typically really friendly and laid back - the overall hippie vibe of the shop seems to rub off on them.  The little shop in the back is cute and it's fun to browse, but as others have mentioned the prices are really high and I've never purchased anything.
