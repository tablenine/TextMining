they have great food but yeah it's pricey...so if you're starving and you want good eatssss dont eat here...but if you're trying to impress a date, this place is great!  just make sure you ate before you come here.  Their tuna is so good but how i wish it has a bigger serving...it was so small that i finished eating it in less than 5 mins...left this place still hungry, but hey what can we do, this is one of the high end restaurant in north center.  But ive been to lots of expensive restaurants, they dont give you this small serving tho...ill give it another try tho...taste wise it's delicious, servers are great...
