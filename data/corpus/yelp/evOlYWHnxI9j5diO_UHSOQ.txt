Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Living in LA all my life and never have gone to Pinks is something most say I should be ashamed of. Well I beg to differ. After hearing all the rave about this place, I decided to go one night. While their hours are great for night time munchers the hot dogs themselves are just okay. I was prepared to wait in an hour line for the "best hot dogs ever," but luckily I only waited about 10 minutes. After seeing a menu full of different types of hot dogs and placing my order it was only minutes till it arrived. When I took my first bite, I was very disappointed that I didn't experience some life changing moment. It was then I realized, Pinks is just like any other place, only they have a history in LA.
