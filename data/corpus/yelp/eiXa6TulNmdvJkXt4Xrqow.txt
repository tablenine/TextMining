Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Better than average but not worth the hype. Ive lived in Harlem before and have had better from hole in the wall places. It was possibly an off day, a restaurant has them every now and again. The chicken tasted like it sat around for a few hours, like as in the bins from KFC. The waffles however were simply delish, crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside, I'd assume the breakfast is the bomb but havent made it there in the AM. Going back to my stinginess of appropriate portions, 10 bucks for a piece of chicken and a waffle, to say it metaphorically I want DD-Cups not a B-Cup breast. I'm a hungry guy, I need my meat. Wont be going back any time soon but I'm sure there's plenty of tourists and celebrity wannabes who will still pack the place. I hear there are other locations which are better than the Hollywood location, I'll give those a try.
