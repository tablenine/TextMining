I have to say Shabu Shabu House is the best shabu shabu I've ever tasted.  I'm a big time shabu shabu lover, and I had tried many different ones, from west covina, ontario, burbank, san garbriel, rowland heights, pasadena, los angeles, and even san jose.  Still no comparison to Shabu Shabu House, I actually go there at least once a month, matter infact I'll be going this Sunday nite.  Other than the long ass wait in line (I've waited 2hrs before), Shabu Shabu House offers a very simple menu (large platter 15pcs/regular platter 10pcs), comes with a plate of variety veggies, and the prices is fairly decent (cheap), meat quality/sauces is A+ melts in your mouth, and your taste buds will get the tingling sensation.  I highly recommend everyone to give it a try ^__^
