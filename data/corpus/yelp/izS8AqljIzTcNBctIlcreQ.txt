Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I am semi new to the hood but Casa Bianca basically became my friendly neighbor! They have a good variety of traditional italian dishes. All sorts of pizzas-thin crust or thick and its great for large dinner parties.. . I am more so in love with how its ran...family owned, takes a 2 week long vacation around the same time every year, paid their dues &amp; only take cash, and thee strongest customer loyalty ever! . . This place is one of those mom and pops spots where you always find comfort in stuffing your mouf!
