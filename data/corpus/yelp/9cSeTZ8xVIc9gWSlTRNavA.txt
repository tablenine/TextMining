Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Sorry you trend following hollywood rats, this place is pretty bad. The line is always long, kinda like the line to the bathroom at a very overpacked club, but the wait is definitely not worth it. The prices are pretty high for hotdogs, as creative as it is, its just not that great enough to pay those prices and wait a hour. If you haven't tried it then yeah go ahead try it. At least you can get that out of the way and say you tried it, but other than that, it's just not a place I am willing to go for my hot dog fix. Point me out to the good ole mexican lady (not trying to sound racist) with the bacon wrapped hot dogs with all the fix ins with jalapenos and you got yourself a happy Asian camper. ~^^~. . Ps. I waited in line for about thirty minutes and got to the front to order to find out they are cash only. FML thank you pinks.
