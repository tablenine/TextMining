Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
Well, I live very close to this restaurant.  And I mean very, very close.. . After moving into my new place, this restaurant was one of the first places that my roommate and I went to in order to celebrate our new house.  I've gone back a few times because of its convenient location.. . Overall, the food is pretty good.  I'm not exactly sure how great it is to Cuban food standards but people have told me that it measures up well.  I would say that it is a little pricey for the quantity of food they give you.  Now paying less than 10 dollars for a meal isn't obscene, but I normally call things pricey based on the quantity of food over the price amount.  And by those standards, Las Palmeras isn't a place I can frequent.. . The service is pretty friendly, but they seem a bit rushed since they have a lot of customers for a small restaurant.  It's great for lunch, especially in the summer.. . But I bet they are missing out on some primo income by only being open Wed-Saturday.  Maybe closing on Monday is fine but missing out on Sunday afternoons? Big mistake by them.
