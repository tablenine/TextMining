How much is a good meal worth???  The restaurant was nice.  We had reservations, but got their early, so we chilled at the bar  rubbed elbows, and hardy har harded with rich folks.    Naaahh, that's not what happened.  We reserved at 6, and got seated 30 minutes later.  I'm sure all the people there were just upscale lonely people who surrounded the bar with their lame stories, and loud talk about a whole bunch of nonsense.   We stood over glass covered walk way, below the Koi fish swimming all around.  The smell of the water was getting to me.  Like it had not been cleaned in a while.  We got to our table, and scanned thru the menu.  It was only about 9 of us, yet I felt we had 6 servers.   No we really did have 6 servers.  We ordered some appetizers which were good.  The whole menu was pretty tempting.  Ended ordering noodles and fish, others steak.  The meal was quite pleasant.  Water was ordered, and they asked Sparking or non, both were ordered.  So it was a very attentive service.   Definitely no complaints.  Except the fact that I felt like I was being watched the whole time!!   We sat in a table next to a 3 guy band sits and plays while you eat.  Pretty entertaining.  The restaurant is nice.  The service is good, (too good)  the food is expensive, the drinks are expensive and even water is expensive.  Other than that. I would find it fair to give this place not 5 stars, but rather 3, for the snobbiness, and the beautiful people that make that place look fake.  The extra expensive food and drinks, and how dare you trick me into buying a $7.00 bottle of Fiji water!!!. Too much money to be wasted on food, service and drinks.  . . Then again.  I'm a humble guy, and although I like to wine and dine, this place is not my kind of place.   It's just not worth it.
