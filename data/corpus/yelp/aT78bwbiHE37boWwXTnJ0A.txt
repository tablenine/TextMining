Me: "I'm drunk. Let's eat. Where can we eat?". Friends: "Clarkes is open. It's right off Belmont.". Me: "Will it kill me?". Friends: "The alcohol in your stomach will kill the bacteria before it gets to your intestines, so you're probably safe.". . Clarkes equals drunk food, so drunk you keep yelling "IT COULD BE COLDER" to random windows in Irving Park on a Thursday.. . That is how drunk you need to be to eat at Clarkes and not throw up. . . Plus? The Burrito I ate was really good, but then again I was drunk and the Soda didn't taste like pee, but then again I was drunk so I can't be certain.. Minus? The Carrot Cake didn't have cream cheese frosting but then again I was drunk so it could have been slathered in butter and I might not have noticed.. . Come drunk or don't come at all, seriously.
