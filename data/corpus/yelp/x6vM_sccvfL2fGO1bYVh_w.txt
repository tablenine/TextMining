Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Screw this place. On a Friday or Saturday, be prepared to wait up to 90 minutes for a table. The portions are TOO massive and the menu is TOO big. TOO bad the food sucks. There's no balance or delicacy. It's all obscenely fatty, cheesy, salty, greasy, and dense and just walking into the place makes me feel gross. I get the impression that the patrons at Cheesecake Factory are out-of-towners and families who think this place is upscale dining and want to say they ate dinner at the Hancock building. It's a shame they fall for this place because there are so many great restaurants Â to experience in Chicago that are less expensive and much less of a hassle. For all intents and purposes, Cheesecake Factory is little more than a pricier and glitzier Applebee's. They should put Cheesecake Factory on the list "Stuff White People Like.". . Is the cheesecake good? Yea, it's tasty... but better cheesecake can be bought--or even made from scratch with minimal effort. . . By far the best part of going to Cheesecake Factory is getting a double-take from the server when instead of asking for the Bang-bang Chicken and Shrimp you specify the "Gang-bang" Chicken and Shrimp and repeating it in such a manner as many times as possible.
