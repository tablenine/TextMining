Went to the legendary Gibsons Steak house in Chicago and was at first a little disappointed.  The bread and salad were mediocre at best, but i was cheered by the icey cold beer the waitress brought  me.. . But then my steak came.  And it was perfect.  One of the best ribeyes i've ever had.  Incredibly flavorful with a delicious 'crust' but still perfectly medium rare inside.  Steak is usually a tremendous disappoint to me, so i was thrilled that i hadn't wimped out and ordered something lowfat.. . The fries looked a lot better than they tasted, but they were good enough.  I'd go back in a heartbeat.
