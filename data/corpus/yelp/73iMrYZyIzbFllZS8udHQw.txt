This place is fun! Our cozy group of 8 got our very own semi-private room in the back, complete w/ a flat screen TV to watch Sunday NFL football. Our waitress was super nice, our orders came out fairly quickly, water glasses were refilled and the snazzy coffee drinks were made in a reasonable amount of time. . . My sis, J., and I shared the Blu Toast - French toast layered with blackberry jam &amp; cream cheese, topped with bananas and powdered sugar . Cream cheese??? Rich, creamy and a little over the top, yes, but it was yummy! We also ordered a salty dish to balance out the Blu Toast... a special that was called "Hangover [something]" or "[something] Hangover", which consisted of a ground beef and jalapeno mixture served w/ tortillas and country-style potatoes. Tasty and SPICY! I needed 2 glasses of water to wolf 1/2 this plate down. My son, C., ordered 1 pancake which was the size of a large plate, but he ended up in the corner of our booth w/ a tub of grape jelly... enough to make him a happy camper. No worries, my other sis, S., finished up that plate of pancake quick! . . Totally cool ambiance, friendly folks and a large well-rounded menu. Bon appetit!
