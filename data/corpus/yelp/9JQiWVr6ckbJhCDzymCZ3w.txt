We absolutely love the sandwiches here!!! The menu is extensive and extremely reasonable regarding prices. We usually order the Turkey Turkey and the Todo Italiano with avocado, however always have a tough time deciding what we want while perusing through the menu. In addition, we travel 30 minutes just for one of those sandwiches!. . On another note, I usually enjoy ordering for pickup rather than dining in because last time it took about 30 minutes for a sandwich to be prepared for dining in. On the contrary, pickup usually takes 15 minutes and you can cut in front of those people holding up the line because they can't make a decision on what to order. Â . . My wife also feels as though they should specify what type of bread goes with each sandwich on their menu (and I agree). Only sandwiches with tomato bread are specified. She prefers wheat over white being the healthier choice. Could of been our bad for not just saying wheat instead of white.
