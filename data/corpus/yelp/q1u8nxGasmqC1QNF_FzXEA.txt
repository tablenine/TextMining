I recently dined at this restaurant per the recommendations on this website and they were true! I highly recommend the Hong Steak its a great deal. I have eaten this before at Red Light at 5x the price (this steak is the same). Some of drawbacks was the lack of service (but maybe b/c it was Tues. night and they had specials deal on entrees) and no brown rice. However, the positives outweigh the negatives.
