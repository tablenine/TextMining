Tequila Tequila Tequila!. . Very small place so make sure you have reservations if you have a party bigger than 2.  If you come in the evening- valet is the easiest thing to do.  I love the drinks here more than the food that's for sure.  There is nothing special about their Mexican food.  I love the mango margaritas!  It's a fun and happening spot.  Its pretty dark and intimate in there.  The tequila sampler was pretty cool.
