I don't know how I could pass by this place everyday since August and today was the first time I've eaten here! Better late than never and boy am I glad I did! . The decor was beautiful especially their ceiling where an array of terracotta pots are placed to give this place the character of ancient Greece meeting modern America. . . Wow I am impressed! right when you sit down they offer you a plate of warm pita bread....I am a fan already. . Our waiter was quite helpful with recommendations, but I was most impressed with the octopus! OMG it was so good! Tender, not chewy with just the perfect sauce/seasoning! The tzatiki dip was also yummy cause it was thick and full of yummy Greek yogurt and cucumbers :) . We also got the eggplant dip which was scrumptious on its own and the meat balls and a Greek salad. . The Greek salad was fresh, the feta was beautiful :) . . I will definitely be back in no time!
