Had brunch here with a bunch of friends. My boyfriend's friend works here as a pastry chef so we were able to get our name on the list. Normally there's a really long line to get in.. . I had a half order of the tucson salad which is a southwest style salad only I substituted the ranch dressing for a honey sesame dressing. It was good! I snuck some sweet potato fries from my friend. I thought those were real good. Not too heavy like some sweet potato fries are. . The iced tea was real good too. I think they use mighty leaf's tropical green tea. . . Best part was dessert! I had a chocolate covered strawberry. Around the strawberry they cover it with cheesecake and then dip it in chocolate. YUM! I also had a vanilla, red velvet, and marble chocolate cupcake. The cupcakes here are rich and full of flavor. The texture of the cake kind of reminded me of soft chocolate.
