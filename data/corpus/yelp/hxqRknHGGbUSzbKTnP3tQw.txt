Wow.. the mozzerella is truly out of this world.  Wow... the service is too, and not in a good way.  These waiters are from Mars, to be generous.  I can't believe how many times I needed to ask to have my wine glass filled (since the bottle was not kept at the table).  The waiters would disappear for 15 minutes at a time.  When they returned, they wouldn't even notice that the wine service was deficient.  These folks are clueless.  And in speaking with management, they were pretty much non-plussed.  (Not a good thing).  Food is the reason you go somewhere and OM doesn't disappoint.  But service is key to a successful evening and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth to be sure.
