Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Cute, yet crowded restaurant that uses the freshest, tastiest ingredients in all of their dishes.  The cauliflower gratinate is amazingly good as is the fried squash blossoms.  The pizzas' unique combinations of flavors is perfect and surprisingly filling.. Since I'm not totally familiar with Italian wines, the waiter seemed to know his stuff pretty well and was helpful in recommending.. Still in the crazy crowded phase but has a good energy and even better food!
