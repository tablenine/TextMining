Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
This is the best Korean BBQ restaurant in all of K town i believe.  People have dragged me to other places and have told me about the other places but Soowon is the most amazing place.  I have been here many times and the meat they serve is consistently fresh and amazing.  The marinate and the juices are godly, and they are not conservative with the side dishes.  The staff is amazing and attentive.  I highly recommend their thinly sliced Bulgogi meat.  That is my favorite and it tastes like god, in your mouth.  For anyone wanting Korean BBQ, this place is the one to try, you will not be disappointed, and why not grab some Soju while your at it, and sport that mellow buzz!  BTW valet is in the parking lot and its 2 dollars, considering the neighborhood and location of the restaurant i think its worth the 2 dollars.
