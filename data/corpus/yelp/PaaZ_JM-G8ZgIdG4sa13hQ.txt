Great for a fresh, healthy meal.  BARGAIN TOO.  It's a good attempt to introduce vietnamese cuisine to a hipster sort of area without losing flavor.  Love the marinade they use w/the meat and it tastes great w/all the fresh veggies.  The mister and I usually go here right after work, when it opens for dinner so we have no problems waiting in line...except for it to re-open!  . . The noodle bowl w/ckn is our usual.  But we've also tried the wok-tossed noodle, which we found was good.   On one of our visits, we hauled my parents along and tried something different.  I had their seafood pho, which was "eh," while my mom had the ckn pho and liked it.  I haven't tried their $6 banh mi and probably wont because it's against the law to price them that much--don't they know? I can get one near work for $1-$2 that looks more filling than theirs.  Makes me wonder if I'm missing out a noodle bowl of that price too.  Hmmm.... . I enjoy the atmostphere; minimalist w/an asian twist...very silverlake-ish.  As for the servers....maybe if you go there when the droves are feeding then maybe you'll get one that's a little on edge but haven't had any bad experiences.
