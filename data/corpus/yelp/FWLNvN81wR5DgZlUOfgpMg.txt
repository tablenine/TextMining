Category: Sushi Bars
Sushi gone average in Bucktown. I've eaten there twice now and I still am not impressed. Menu of standard rolls and nigiri sushi will please lovers of raw fish. Stay away from hot plates -- if you come to Bob San, stick with what they do best and avoid ordering kitchen-made hot foods (including a plain bowl of rice) at all costs. Sushi is pretty tasty, but still only registers as average in my book.
