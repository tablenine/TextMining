Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
I must say that after my search for the perfect cupcake...I still think that Joan's on Third make the best!!!. . Try the chocolate/peanut butter ones... yum meeee. . Sandwiches are good too, I use them for catering for meetings, nice variety, . But you MUST start with your dessert first!
