Is there any other restaurant where a parrot cat calls you from the parking lot? It's the welcoming whistle inviting you in to a vegetarian delight and an omnivore nightmare (assuming the omnivore can't understand tofu Â and veggies, that is).. . Food and smoothies are all very delicious. Everything seems fresh, and it's enjoyable. The decor is very mismatched with large metal flowers outside the awning and a painting of the 1996 Olympic Torch path across the US on the inside. It sets the mood for this hippie place - I can't envision it having a normal table with normal waiters and normal paintings. It's kitschy and flirty in all the right ways, just like the meal you're about to consume.. . On one occasion before Halloween, a friend remarked that he loved the plates. The waiter said "Take it!" Being a klepto anyway, he did... and then proceeded to steal the pumpkins on the tables. I came clean to the waiter and we received the blessing of the staff to take any pumpkins we wanted! Not sure if this was a fluke or a guy begging to be fired, but it makes for a fun story.... . My beef? This 24-hour business. I've gone by at 3am only to be un-welcomed by passed out birds and closed doors. Yet there it is on the website: 24 hours. Is it or isn't it? I've heard of people coming in at all hours of the night, so I guess it was an off night? Also, it's weird to walk through a kitchen area to reach the bathroom. I hate that in houses; what makes it kosher in a restaurant? In R. Thomas's defense, it's more the washroom area, but again, walking anywhere near the kitchen to reach a toilet confuses me! Assuming it's poor design and hoping it's not a joke gone bad...
