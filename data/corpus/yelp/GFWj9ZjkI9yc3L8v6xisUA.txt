The Earl. I love you. I hate you.. . I love the Earl because they provide a cool venue for great music like my fave local band, Lloyd's Rocksteady Revue and a wacky, new discovery, The Movits from Sweden. And they don't rip you off-reasonable cover, drink specials, no $14 martinis.. . Hate them because I go home with cinders in my hair and smell like a bar for a week. Time for an air purification upgrade. Also, they have a bad sound system in the front room. It makes my ears feel like someone shoved tinsel into them. . . OH, and what is it with people throwing cans and cups on the floor? Makes it hard to dance, it's slobby and lazy. There is a trash can right near the bar. You need to stay home If you are that drunk or trashy.. . Cheers~
