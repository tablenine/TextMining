Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Wine Bars
Rosa Mexicana is one of my favorite restaurants. However, I must qualify that by saying that I always order the same thing. I've found what I love and, for the moment, I just don't want anything else. They always push the Pomegranite Margarita because it is their signature drink but l'unica is THE best traditional margarita in Atlanta. Just be careful because it will knock you on your keester. My husband and I always order the tableside guacamole and the Fileta con Hongos, a filet mignon with a mushroom, tequila, cream sauce. The steak is consistently done just right and the sauce is fabulous. Other reviews state that the portions are small for the price. We actually split this meal and usually still leave some of the rice and beans behind. However, we are not huge eaters so this may not work for everyone. . . We have always had good service at Rosa and they have even started to remember us and bring us a little complimentary amouse bouche when we come. Yes it's expensive but it's a gourmet mexican restaurant not a neighborhood hole-in-the-wall. They always have some kind of seasonal menu that impresses me with it's creativity (not enough to tempt me away from the fileta yet but one of these days I will branch out).
