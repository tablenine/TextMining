Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
THE BURGER! I finally satisfied my curiosity and checked out Ford's Filling Station a few days ago. We were on a bizarre time line for the day and could only go in the late afternoon and needed something filling. The burger called out to both of us. I am usually opposed to ordering the same thing as my friends because I like sampling, but in this case...it had to happen. At $16 for a burger, I better get a damn good burger and a side- no disappointment. Ground chuck, roasted tomatoes, blue cheese, and carmelized onions on a homemade onion roll yield a pretty fierce burger! I was pleased and even more pleased with the side of onion rings so light and fluffy it was like eating donuts. I can normally pass on onion rings, but these were just too delicious! For dessert we went with the chocolate liquid cake with gianduja and pear. Pretty damn good- I'll have another please! I'd like to go for their dinner service and check it out. I'd also like to have a Ben Ford sighting- adorable in his chefdom!
