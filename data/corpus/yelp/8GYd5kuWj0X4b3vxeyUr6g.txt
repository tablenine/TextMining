Restaurant: Alinea
Category: American (New)
I do the Tour each time with the wine pairing - mainly because I would rather have the Chef do the thinking for me - and he does a pretty darn good job of it believe me . . Alinea is an EXPERIENCE - so be prepared to give your full attention to an evening of culinary theatre - I didn't count the omg's - but believe me every time they bring something out you can at least count one omg . . I took one star off for the sommelier who just couldn't understand that my guest did not like white wine - period - no matter how well it pairs with the dish - she wanted champagne instead of white wine - the way I see it the guest is always right - other than that - every time the experience was perfection!
