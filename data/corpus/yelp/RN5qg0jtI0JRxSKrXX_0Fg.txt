Also, could be Atlanta's best restaurant if it weren't 2 things (i) The Location and (ii) The fact that there are televisions at the bar.  Yeah, I get it, it's in Atlanta, but if you want to devote yourself to being a true restaurant, you should gear the patron's attention towards the food, decor, and space and not the Braves.. . That said, the food is amazing.  Have eaten here a handful of times, and have never been dissapointed.  The space is huge, ceilings tall, and feels a little spaced out at first, but feels inviting once you sit down.  Service is typically impeccable, and were it not for the location, this would be a constant starter to the evening.  However, being in purgatory, and part of a "silent after dark" development, I go here when dinner is all that's on the schedule.  Well worth the trip though...
