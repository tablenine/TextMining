Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Best pizza in Chicago. To compare,we get a Margherita pizza wherever we go: Coal Fire's is IT: A crust thal's magically both crisp but still easily 'foldable', &amp; a tomato sauce that reminded me of pizza in 1959. Service was excellent, attentive but not intrusive. Salads &amp; drinks arrived seemingly instantaneously, pizza not far behind. The place started getting busy toward the end of our stay, so the very-attentive owner(?) brought us our check to keep the pace of the dinner spot-on. The owner(?)'s sincere 'goodbye' from across the now-crowded room capped-off a perfect dinner.   It's also less expensive than other good pizza,(and most bad), in Chicago. Factor in 1/2-price wine-tuesday, and this is the deal of deals!.(PS: Re: "Julie G" 's 'review': I'm in the service industry: It's not unusual for uncooperative patrons to suffer deafness to, or amnesia of, the first 1/2 dozen polite requests or explanations I make, only recalling the last-minute drama  which is apparently the only thing  they can hear. No, calling someone an  "f-ing jerk" isn't a crime, that's why you weren't arrested.)
