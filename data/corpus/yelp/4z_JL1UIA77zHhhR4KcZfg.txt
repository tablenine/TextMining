Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
I love Southeast Asian cuisine and hospitality.  All of the usual Thai favorites are on the menu here, as are some excellent Malaysian dishes (the cuisines are similar).  My significant other spent four years in Malaysia and loves it when I take her to Top Spice.  Do yourself a favor and order from the Malaysian Specialties side of the menu.  But get a Thai tea.  Yum!.. . We both could eat three meals a day.  Fortunately for our retirement savings, they aren't open for breakfast.
