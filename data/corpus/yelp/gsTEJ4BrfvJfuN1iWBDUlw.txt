Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If you're really curious, head over on a Monday morning when there are no lines and see what the fuss is all about.  I'm glad I didn't have to wait, because those hot dogs are un-fuss-worthy.  The chili reminds me of a high school cafeteria special.  I'd wait in line just to witness the type of people who'd wait in line for this stuff.
