I don't eat pork, and generally avoid hot dogs and sausages, so I was really pleasantly surprised to find a sausage place that not only has chicken/turkey sausages, but also three varieties of vegetarian sausage!  I had a sundried tomato and mozzarella one with sweet peppers and sauerkraut, which was good, but I almost wish I'd gotten it without the toppings because they drowned out the flavor a bit.  I went for a friend's birthday with a ton of other people, so it was a bit of a struggle to hold down half the table just for us, but the communal table was nice, and the place definitely had that hipster vibe.  Also, a nice selection of beer for a reasonable price.  The sausages were nicely priced too. (I paid $14.75 for the food and a beer, which was a nice change from the $20+ dinners I tend to get in West LA.). . As far as parking, I don't know the Downtown area too well, so I gave my car to the valet across the street for $5.  Also significantly cheaper than I'm used to at places like this, and they brought my car right too me in good time, so definitely not complaining.  A good night :)
