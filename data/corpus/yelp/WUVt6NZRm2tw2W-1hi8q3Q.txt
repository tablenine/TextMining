Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
My favorite brunch in Chicago... and my parent's favorite brunch too.. . This place always looks crowded, but honestly I've never waited more than 20 minutes to be seated even on a weekend.. . I love ordering and eating the pancakes "orgy": three different types of pancakes, yogurt, granola, fruit and honey. Â They have the most fantastic fresh fruit even in the dead of winter.. . I am a bit of a brunch connoisseur, and I've taken my parents to the Bongo Room, Orange, Angelina's, Melrose Diner, Ann Sather and Bistro Zinc... all solid options, but Toast gets the parental seal of best brunch in Chicago.
