mmm.. i love LOVE breakfast.. . breakfast: eggs flourentine. SOO good. get it. I couldn't finish it all either. good portions. perfect combo of spinach and eggs. it was great. the toast was good too. friend got the denver scramble-- pretty legit too. but i say, if you go to toast, get something abnormal.. . lunch: potato corn chowder: pretty good. I reccommend this soup out of all of them for sure!!!! got the chicken chow salad, REALLY good. big portion again too. . . breakfast def is better than lunch.. . oh and you might run into a celebrity.. but i have yet to run into one :( . . my fav breakfast place yet!!!
