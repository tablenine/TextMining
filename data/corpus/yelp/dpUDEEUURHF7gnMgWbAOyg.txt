Absolutely delicious.   Followed Henry T's review.. Couldn't snag a reservation but found rock star parking right in-front, waltzed in and snagged a table in the bar. . . Beautiful bartender.  Pink dyed hair immediately came over and was super cool.   If I lived in the hood I'd stop by there frequently just to hang.  . . Attention Fraiche owners...your bartenders a rockstar! . She knows how to work it!. . I ordered the Wild Snapper and I highly recommend it.  . The lady had the iron steak.  . I started with Frites and the lady wondered how come she can't make good frites... so I ordered us a deep fryer for June! Not..... . Fraiche presentation was great! . . For a Saturday night prime time you couldn't ask for a better vibe. . Culver City....respec!
