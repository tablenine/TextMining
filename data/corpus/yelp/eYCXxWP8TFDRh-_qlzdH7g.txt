tuna crispy rice is gooood. . . . I went here a couple weeks ago and had a blast. I went with some friends who insisted on ordering for me which was fine. Large menu of choices. we must have ordered 4 different crab rolls trying to find the one they had last time. We gave up and eat other stuff for a while. Honestly i need to go back a few more times for it earn the 4 stars i gave them. It was good, but I am just hoping the stuff i havn't tried is as good if not better. Â Sorry i don't have a list of my top 5 fav rolls, but i was eating and not ordering.. . Made my personal top 5 sushi place in LA.. Lives up to the hype.. . long wait kind of sucks (even WITH reservations), but make the best of it and get some cold sake or beer while you stand and wait.
