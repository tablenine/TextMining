I just found the best ramen shop in LA... all these years, i was only in love with Santouka.  But the Daikokuya ramen kotteri style I had there today was out of this world.  . . I will say noodles, pork, and soup base are VERY VERY VERY close in awesome to Santouka.  . . But what puts it over the top is the perfectly boiled egg.  The marinated egg has a soft yolk.  Not so soft that in runs, the yolk holds and has an awesome texture to it.  . . See my pictures of this perfectly boiled egg.  . . . http://richmarphotogra.... . . Go get a bowl now!!
