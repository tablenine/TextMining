I've only been the once, just now, so my review will be limited.  I had a sashimi platter - chef's choice (tuna, salmon, octopus, crab with salmon roe, red snapper, scallop, mackerel, and something that i cannot remember now); squid leg, sea eel, uni, and tamago nigiri; and grilled miso cod.. . Everything tasted fresh and had the appropriate texture and flavor.  I left satisfied, which is a rarity as I always want more when eating japanese.  And both the sashimi and the cod were choices of the employees and both were very good.  The grilled cod..  I'm not even a huge fan of cooked fish but it was something I will get again next time I visit.. . I was hoping for a more in-depth omakase experience but I believe I ordered the wrong thing for that.  In any case the flavors were good and the prices were very reasonable and it would be a great place to bring someone on a date, with whom one could then share all sorts of small plates of delicious foods.
