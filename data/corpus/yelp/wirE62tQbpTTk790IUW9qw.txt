If you enjoy trendy spots and like paying for the ambience and decor, this is a decent place to go.  The stylish interior is draped in red and there were two "geishas" walking around when I was there who didn't seem to have much role aside from being part of the background.. . The dishes were pretty good although only one dish did I find amazing: the black cod.  The drinks and dishes definitely add up to a nice bill.. . This is probably a place where you can do some people watching, as I believe the band Good Charlotte was there when I dropped by.  I don't know if I would frequent it that much even if I lived in the area, but it was worth the experience.
