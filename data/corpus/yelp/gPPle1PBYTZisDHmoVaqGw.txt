I remember my time in the 'Nam like it was yesterday.  I wasn't one of those lazy REMF's.  I was deep in the jungle, crawling through the Cu Chi Tunnels and popping off an occasional round on my M-16.  Okay, maybe I wasn't there in 1969.  It was more like 2002, but I still have flashbacks from of my time in the 'Nam, especially the food.  I had a memorable bowl of pho on the streets of Saigon.  I was seated on a tiny plastic stool.  There were a nonstop parade of motor scooters whizzing by only a few feet away; their two stroke engines filled the humid Saigon air with pollution.  But the pho was delicious and it only cost me $1.00 (which was apparently twice the going rate).  Most importantly, the food was undeniably authentic.. . The food at Gingergrass doesn't aspire for complete authenticity and it will not evoke nostalgic memories of my tour in Vietnam.  Purists may blanch, but the food is pretty good considering it's a hipster joint in Silver Lake.  If you want a truly authentic Vietnamese culinary experience, Ho Chi Minh City is only a 20 hour plane trip away (or you could drive 30 minutes to Orange County).
