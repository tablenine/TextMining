Went here on a work night. We ate outdoors and it was pleasant - comfortable, with heaters.  My boyfriend gets the Ordering Win for this night. . . Ours: The bacon wrapped dates were edible and fragrant, but nowhere near the league of the ones at Cobras and Matadors. Bland mozzarella inside could have been replaced with Stilton for a better flavor and texture. And there were just three, which means we each only got one and a half. :/. . His: Fish and chips, although on the oily side, were very good, with fried asparagus that I kept stealing. Mmm.. . His beer: Very hoppy and bright with a complex citrus taste - the server suggested it, but their beer menu is not online, so I don't know which it was, sorry. I ordered wine, but it was his beer (that I can barely drink due to allergies) that I kept longing for. Look, I even took a photo. . . Mine: Cheese plate - Yawn. I didn't finish it. The bread was not warm, white, and dry. The figs were dried and hard. The pecans, sweet &amp; gooey, but I don't like pecans. Some fresh fruit, earthy bread, or a sprig of fresh herbs would have woken this plate up.   (As you can see, their profile photo of the cheese plate is deceptive.) The cheeses themselves varied - the Hook's 5 year Cheddar and the Red Hawk were good. The goat cheese was meh - Trader Joe's has better.. . The complimentary and very oily garlic bread was good, though! It allowed me to eat some of the cheese.. . It was a pleasant night, but the only thing I could solidly recommend it for is the beer, fish and chips. Mmmm.. . One curiosity: on the menu, there's a Whole Pig dinner option for $500, 8-10 days notice. I cannot imagine that this would be the kind of place where you'd order a $500 dinner and have the atmosphere to be worth it, never mind one that contained a Whole Pig...
