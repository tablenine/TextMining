Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
The best neighborhood Italian restaurant in the city. We've moved away from the neighborhood and still go back for the atmosphere and friendliness of the staff.  Be sure to get Rich as your server (tall, bald head) or Ricardo, and keep an eye out for Anthony, the owner.  They have all become like family !  Lobster Ravioli is the best. Pumpkin Ravioli is good as well. The lasagna is good.  Around Halloween until Christmas they have "Rich's Pumpkin Martini".  Don't pass it up. Possibly the best Martini EVER !
