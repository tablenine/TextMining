Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House

I haven't got a chance to go back to Taiwan lately so I was very excited before I went to try this place.However, I was totally disappointed.Even though they claimed that their recipe is from the original store but it tasted like regular frozen dumplings.So disappointed.
