This place is AMAZING!. . When I first walked through its doors, I was overwhelmed by how many people were standing in line and if not for the great reviews I've read on Yelp about this place, I would have turned around and gtfo.   The line actually goes pretty fast, except if you had bad luck like me and got into the slowest line ever ... when my boyfriend and I were the next in line, 5 people in the next line passed us.  But even that was well worth the wait.. . Got my beef sandwich double-dipped.  Will try wet next time.  The freakin' best sandwich I have ever tasted.  Their $.75 lemonade and iced tea was also really good.  It definitely lives up to its hype and I can't believe I was born and raised in So Cal but took me 21 years to try Phillippe.
