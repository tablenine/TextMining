Restaurant: Rathbun&#39;s
Category: American (New)
I dined at Rathbun's toward the tail-end of many trips to the ATL area, and it bookended my first visit, to Joël, quite nicely (with a number of missteps in between).  That having been said, Rathbun's is a dining event, and an entertaining experience due to the small plate style that allows for a number of different items to be sampled throughout the evening.  Particularly memorable was a lovely, delicate potato leek soup and a sharp but delicious carpaccio.  . . I understand that the chef-owner is becoming quite well known due to television appearances and success in competition programs, but I didn't feel overwhelmed by pretension or that anyone was resting on laurels; the food and service spoke for themselves.. . One additional note: the wait for our table was not a problem, given the nicely appointed bar and the wonderfully balanced cocktails made.
