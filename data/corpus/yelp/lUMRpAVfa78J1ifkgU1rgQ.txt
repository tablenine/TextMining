Love, love, love Le Colonial! First of all, the ambiance of this place is absolutely amazing! I just absolutely love the feel of this place! The food is to die for as well! Every single dish I have had there I love! The sea bass is one of the most amazing dishes on the menu! I've also had GA XAO XA OT - which is the wok seared chicken breast with mushrooms and a basil chili sauce! Excellent spicy flavor and served over brown rice is delicious! The last time we were here we ordered a side of the MIEN XAO - which is stir fried cellophane noodles with crab meat, mushrooms and cilantro and it was AMAZING! I couldn't stop thinking about it the next day. This place is a great date night spot ! I just love it and the bar upstairs could be a great little hang out spot as well.
