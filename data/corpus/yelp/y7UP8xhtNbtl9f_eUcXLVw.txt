I was pleasantly suprised by this sushi place.  The sushi here is great.  I was excited that had my favorite even on the menu since most places I have to ask if the chef will make it for me.  The waitress was honest about her reocmmendations.  Try the patio.  It is excellent atmosphere, especially while the weather lasts.
