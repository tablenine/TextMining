I've never actually sat down in here, but it is far and away my favorite place to grab a cupcake or a scoop of ice cream for a treat. Their vanilla cupcake with sprinkles... I swear this stuff is sent from Gods. . . Their buttercreme frosting is unbelievably great, never had anything like it before. Very rich and smooth. It's really cute outside as well. Only downside are the people behind the counter... they need an attitude adjustment for sure. I mean, you're selling goodies for a paycheck in one of the best neighborhoods in Chicago. The least you can do is crack a smile.
