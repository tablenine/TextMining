I am so crazy for this little joint right now.  The BF thinks I'm in for an eventual burn out because I'm indulging in too much of a good thing.  Let's examine the negatives first: The line is nearly always out the door.  Drinks are a little pricey.  But that's all I got for cons.. . Positives: Everything I've tried is delish.  Lately I'm on a spinach, goat cheese, and hazelnut simple salad streak but the Chinese chicken and the Mediterranean salads are also especially excellent.  The grilled veggie selection changes daily, so I might be better sold if I could see them before I order.The vegetables are always sooo appetizing and as I pass them by I often wonder why I didn't remember to ask for the grilled veggie salad instead.    The hot chicken plate is especially tasty and the mashed potatoes are just about perfect.  The atmosphere is mixed: casual and airy but when a swarm of diners hits I always feel pressure to hurry the hell up and finish already.
