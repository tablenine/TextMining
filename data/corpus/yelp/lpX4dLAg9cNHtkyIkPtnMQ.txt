My first review of FLIP was completely favorable, but possible premature. I went back for a second visit for lunch today, and my experience was not nearly as positive (although this time I DID have the company of a fun lunch date).. . We arrived around noon, just beating a huge hour-long rush of people. Although we were seated quickly (at the bar), the food took a while to come out. Our burgers took about 15 minutes, and the post-meal milkshake took another 15-20 minutes. It seems that one person is dedicated to making milkshakes on one machine, which is apparently not sufficient.. . The food was also not as impressive; the bun was too hard to squish, and grease dripped all over my fingers as I took my first bite. Not good. The Burnt Marshmallow milkshake was not exactly what I expected, either; it was merely a chocolate milkshake with crisped marshmallows on top, . . I'm not giving up on FLIP yet--I'm sure they're still getting their act together...I'm just not as crazy about it as I was last week.
