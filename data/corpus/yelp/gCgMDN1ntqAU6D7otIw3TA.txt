Why 2 stars?. 1 star = Office Favorite?!?!. 1 star = Free. . My boss loves this place , so he occasionally orders them for the office. Quite simply something about these sandwiches makes me sick. Don't know if its the cheese or tomato but I have tried the subs without cheese or tomato and BLAH!!! Don't get me started on the bread. The bread is no way near close to being fresh.Which means that Â your lucky not to slice the inside of your mouth with every bite or go blind from the crumbs flying all over your face O.k that was a bit exaggerated but you catch my drift. Cold hard bread.. I am sure the folks there are swell, I really wouldn't know because again, unless its free, I'm not eating here.. So proceed with caution and wear goggles, you will thank me later. :). *I remember a sub place on Western and Addison being way better.*. **Our receptionist would like to add that calling in an order is useless, they still make you wait for your subs**
