Went here for the second time last night and it wasn't as good as it was when I first went two years ago.  The garlic chicken was still really good, but the shrimp and scallops combo was not cutting it for $17. Last time, there were about 4-5 whole scallops nicely plated next to a piece of dried salmon, but the scallops were amongst the best I've ever had.  . . I went back after eating scallops elsewhere for two years, always thinking about how much better in taste and value the ones at Versailles were.  That memory went to hell, as the scallops were no longer whole and the taste wasn't there. . . They ran out of sangria at 10pm on a Saturday night so the girlfriend and her friends were disappointed.  The chicken was good, even with the raised price, but still worth going back for, definitely.. . service wasn't good, nor poor, just not attentive, but this isn't French dining so don't hold that against them.  order the chickens and i'm golden
