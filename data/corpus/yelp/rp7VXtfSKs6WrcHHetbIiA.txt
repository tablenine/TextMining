Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
When it comes to dining out you have to remember one thing: you go to specific restaurants for specific dishes.. . Do I go to Geisha House for their Japanese cuisine?  No.. . I go there for one dish and one dish alone, which is actually more of an appetizer than anything else: rock shrimp tempura.  It is very delicious and while it is overpriced, so is everything else here.. . Aside from the food, it's a pretty nice lounge, but you will pay more for drinks here than at other places.  That's the price to pay for the celebrity sitings from time to time.. . Know what you're getting into and you won't be disappointed.
