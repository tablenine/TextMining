The wait for Saturday 01/23/2010 was 2 1/2 hours. That's right... that's not a typo.  2 1/2 hours.  It is ridiculous for a restaurant of this size to not take a reservation. There were 6 of us, so it's not a terribly big party.  After the 2 1/2 hours wait, I expected the food to be great. I was greatly UNDERWHELMED.  . . The food was mediocre. nothing special.  The salad was below par ( We had the Italian and the Louie ), the mozzarella and the clams we ordered arrived cold.  Other stuff were forgettable. The only redeeming thing on the menu was the portobello fries.  It really is just the hype of the restaurant. Unless they upgrade their food ( maybe get a celebrity chef ) and rethink their reservations policy, I will not be returning here.  That was a painful 3 1/2 hours ( 2 1/2 hours waiting and 1 hour dining time) of my life that I will never get back.  They did comped us with a pizza but my time is worth more than a $12 pizza. . . I can't believe any foodies actually appreciate the food here ! Shame on all of you who thought the food was great.  Almost any 2 stars restaurant is better than this place.
