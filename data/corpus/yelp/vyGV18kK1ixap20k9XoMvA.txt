First visited Craft during restaurant week in 2009.  I have several friends that rave about this restaurant and I was finally able to find out whether or not it would live up to the hype.  Since there were 4 of us, we were able to try a few dishes.  For the appetizers, we ordered both the charcuterie and the baby lettuce.  Both were tasty but the nod goes to the baby lettuce.  The hazelnuts that they throw into the salad definitely adds a nice flavor.  For the entree we had the prawns and the pork shoulder.  Again both dishes were very good.  Finally for dessert we had the semifreddo and the chocolate crepes.  I think the semifreddo was the overall winner during the entire meal.  For the dinela meal, portions were not huge but definitely big enough to share with another person.  . . Service was perfect and will have to go back for their tasting menu.  This place definitely does not disappoint and lives up to the hype.
