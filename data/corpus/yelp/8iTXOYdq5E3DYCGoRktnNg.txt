Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
A group of fifteen guys and myself had just seen the musical Wicked and decided to further our sausage-fest by seeing Pink's. I purchased $13 worth of food. French fries. Fruit drink. Rosie O'Donnell hot dog and [some other dog that I can't name right now].. . I really can't recall that other dog - I guess that says alot, haha. The Rosie O'Donnell hot dog had chili on it and sauerkraut. I think it's hard to screw up chili and sauerkraut. But Pink's accomplished that. The sauerkraut was way too tart, and the chili was lacking meatiness. I was really disappointed. The fries were terrible. They tasted like fried cardboard. And man, let me tell you - I like some pretty whack stuff (read my other reviews). And the fruit drink...man. I felt ripped off - I think it's Kool-Aid.. . Service is terrible - waited over an hour in line. Thank God my homies were with me or I wouldn't have enjoyed it. Definitely overhyped. But you know, I would give it only one star, but I'm giving it two stars because it was nice to just go out to LA and eat at a landmark. But on the real - if you want good hot dogs, Costco or dirty dogs from those Mexicans who cook on makeshift grills. It's the only way to go.
