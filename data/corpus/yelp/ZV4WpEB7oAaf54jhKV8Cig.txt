We stopped here on a friday night looking forward for a great dinner.. The decor looked very nice, modern and it felt very intimate as well. Definitely upscale.. The staff was very friendly and well trained but we had to wait about 10 minutes to have our glasses of water filled up and another 5 minutes to have the salt shaker on the table.. Our first course was a pork dish which tasted good and the spices blended in very well. . The second course was the roasted farm chicken for which we had high expectations. From all my knowledge i know that chicken is supposed to be white meat not cooked rare if you can call it like that!. As a side order we decided to try the Royal trumpet mushrooms which tasted ok but they had an overwhelming quantity of grease on them.. The best course of the dinner was the complementary Mandarin Pastry and the Apple Jelly which i loved. Oh and i was about ready to forget the bag of trail mix that they gave us along with the bill. . Overall experience for a hundred plus dinner was not good. Â Will we ever recommend this "Upscale" restaurant to our friends or come back here? Most likely NOT! I . Based on the decor and friendliness of the staff i will give it 3 stars.. . P.S. I have to mention this, I am a skinny white european, well traveled guy if that helps :)
