Restaurant: Mi Barrio Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
Decor- so Tijuana!  I loved it.. . Service- excellent!. . atmosphere- so family with kids running around and Telemundo showing.  Expect this at any real- I'm gonna show you how I live at home- Mexican restaurant.  I absolutely loved it!. . Food- The pork tamale was really good!  The beef tongue taco wasn't as great as everyone said it was.  I really expected a different texture.  It kind of reminded more of liver than tongue.  The complimentary salsa wasn't that great either.. . I would go back to Mi Barrio and try something new.  I just really like the place.  It's so Buford Highway, but off Memorial.  Home away from home.
