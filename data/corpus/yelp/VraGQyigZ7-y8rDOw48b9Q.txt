Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
This place is amazing! I just went here for the first time the other day and had the bossa salad, and their salmon a la carte. My salmon was charbroiled to perfection, nice and moist, and the sauce really made the dish. Essentially the dish wasn't all that brazillian or different, but the sauce really made it a stand out dish, I loved every bite! The bossa salad was soooo good too. The warm shrimp mixed in with my greens and the dressing was really something different and delicious. The waiter also suggested brazillian ginger ale, and because ginger ale is probably the only soda i like to drink, i had to try it! Its really refreshing and slightly sweeter and more pleasant to drink than your average...definitely get some with your lunch :] Can't wait to go back and try more amazing dishes! Portions are big and at reasonable prices. The ambiance was great too, really giving you a feeling of being outdoors at night but with the comfort of actually being indoors! Â :]
