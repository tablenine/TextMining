This place is extremly expensive it seems for me and doesn't have much reason to be.  The atomsphere is nice, but it doesn't justify that my sister and I ate there and spent a little less than $150.  I guess I'm just cheap. I will say that the guacamole is outstanding!  They make it right at your table just the way you ask for it.  I also had a margarita and it was very tasty and strong.  For the most part, the other food, I didn't care for.  Even with the small protions I didn't end up finishing.  This might be a good place for a first date or just to grab some drinks and appetizers but other than that, I dont really recommend it.
