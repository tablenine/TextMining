Dined here with a group of 7 on Saturday night. We had reservations for 7:30, but had to wait half an hour to be seated. Minor annoyance, but I've been on the other side of a hostess station and I know sometimes it's out of your control. meh.... . Service was nothing to write home about, but the food sure was. I had the butternut squash ravioli in brown butter sauce with fried sage, it was flawlessly prepared and the flavors were amazing! Just the right amount of sweet and savory and the fried sage was crisp and light and the perfect compliment to the butternut squash. Loved it!  I was able to sample some of the other dishes at the table, and everything was very good. . . Desserts were tasty, but not nearly as exceptional as the food. We tried the tiramisu, pistacio gelato, and cheesecake with raspberry coulis.  . . Overall, a great restaurant for a nice dinner out that won't break the bank.
