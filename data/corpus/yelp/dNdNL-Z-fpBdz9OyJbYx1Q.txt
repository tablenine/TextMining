Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
A friend and I decided to check out this place on a weekday.. . Service was very casual with only one waiter.  We ordered eggs benny and a scramble.  We managed to make a dent in each of our meals... we must've eaten enough to feed a small village!. . We decided to complete our dining experience with the Strawberry Belgian Waffle for dessert... to share, this time!. . The food was great.. . However, everytime I attempted to return, the lines looked like the line up for Harry Potter's 7th book release!. . I'll always treasure my experience at the Griddle Cafe...
