I went in for dinner. It is very pricey for the quality of food that they are serving. It was $68 for two people and we only had one drink each. Which I am not sure had any alcohol in it. Our service was so so. I server was here one minute then gone for 30 minutes the next. Definitely would not go back there unless they lower their prices or improve on their food.
