5 stars for Â the following: well-executed food, for using organic and sustainable ingredients; for following the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch; for the attentive service; and for a shuttle service that takes you directly to the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion so you don't have to deal with the awful traffic. Need I say more?
