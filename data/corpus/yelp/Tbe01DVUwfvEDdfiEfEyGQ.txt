Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Hubby and I wanted to get out of our Southbay fish bowl and ventured to Melrose for breakfast. We chose Taste based on the Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. We arrived around 10:45 and had the pick of tables - it began to get crowded just after 11. The place has a chill vibe with both patio and indoor seating. Since we had our pick of tables, we grabbed a spot on the patio with a heater.  I started with a glass of champagne and appreciate that the waiter asked if I wanted the standard brunch sparkling wine or the more expensive selection.  The bloody mary my husband ordered had just the right amount of spice and did not appear to be from a bottle mix. Big points right off the start! The Brioche French Toast with Brulee Bananas was super delicious - sweet without being obvious. My husband had the Tasty Burrito which was fresh and also delicious. The portions were right-sized. Not too small, no extra fluff. I have to say we ate every bit, left no crumb behind. Finally, the service was spectacular. Even after it started to get busy, we still had great service.  The only down side is the cost. It was slightly overpriced. Still, the food and service was worth it. I definitely recommend Taste for brunch.
