I guess I got lucky the last time I went because there was no line - maybe because it was a Saturday afternoon. Line or no line, I'd wait as long as I needed to for just one bite. You can't get this goodness just anywhere. . . I'm happy to report that half of a pizza leftover (not sure how there were leftovers) flown half way across the country still tastes pretty damn good even when it's room temperature (I know the health department would disapprove, but what choices did I have?) by the time you get back to wherever you came from where they have nothing that can compare to this.
