Whether eating brunch, dinner or hitting up Rodan for Drinks and nighlife, i am always pleased.  The hangar steak was awesome, the soups are great, wasabi fries are on point, great drink selection... plus everytime I walk in here, the staff is super cool and does a good job.  Some nights when its packed it can take a minute to get a drink, but whatever, this place gets busy.. . Whenever I'm out late, I always think to myself, "hmm i wonder whos at rodan?" and i almost always venture in to kick it for  a while and run into friends.. . Good times, good food, good DJ's... no complaints about this spot.
