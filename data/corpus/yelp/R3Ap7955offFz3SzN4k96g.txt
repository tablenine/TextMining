Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
One of the few really terrible restaurants in Chicago I've been to. I think the food I had here with a friend was so bad, that probably Applebee's or Denny's would outshine this place(never mind that I've never gone to any location of the former, and've only been once or twice ever to Denny's). And that's saying a helluva lot.. . Not to mention, with all the great existing restaurants in Andersonville and/or in nearby Edgewater(Noodle Zone, Calo, Charlie's Ale House, Moody's, etc.), why would anyone wanna waste their money here?. . I may give this place one more chance in the future, just since I was a wee bit curious to see if the alcoholic drinks, and/or the "Mary's Attic" upstairs area give this place any sort of saving grace. Then again, I was so weirded out by going here, that I so badly wish that Cafe Boost or Coffee Chicago(both which preceded Hamburger Mary's in this spot) was still in this location, instead! And sorry Mary, but I think you didn't quite work out here, but would've been better off if you had stayed on the west coast..... . ------------------. 11/11/07 edit: After last night, I unfortunately have to say that if only yelp allowed people to do so, I would downgrade my review to ZERO stars. To me, this place is now the NEW low bar, I will measure other terrible dining experiences I have against. Not to mention, Scamburger Mary's(which I'll use to refer to this s***** restaurant by, from now on) is now dead in the water to me, sadly.
