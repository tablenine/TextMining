Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I used to just love love this place at it's old location and would still go to the new location.  Thai Elvis is entertaining, the food is good, just not as great as before.   This place is like a well oiled machine, almost too smooth now it feels commercialized, especially with the huge Elvis sculpture and the way the new place is set up.  I used to love their duck curry and pad thai, now alot of dishes taste too sweet.  The grilled beef steak and the fried fish are still good.   Just that the exoticness of the old Palms is gone, things feel a bit more dull now.
