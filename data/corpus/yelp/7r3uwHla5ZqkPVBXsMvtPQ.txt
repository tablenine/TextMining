Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
My friends and I were trying to go have dinner at Loteria grill in Hollywood bu the place was booked. so we decided to check out Geisha House right next door.. . This restaurant has beautiful decor. Great ambiance and definitely a fun atmosphere. The Kobe Filet Mignon  was definitely worth the $$$.  The Black Cod was Delicious and the Sushi was good also.. Very upscale Japanese sushi place.. Loved everything about this place! Yes, pricey but what do you expect? It's in a really HOT spot (Hollywood). I loved the bar area it was beautifully decorated traditional Japanese style meets contemporary.
