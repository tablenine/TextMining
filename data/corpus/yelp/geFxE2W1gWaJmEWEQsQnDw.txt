Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Mexican
I love mexican food. I love the decor and ambiance of Rosa Mexicana. I don't love the menu, as it tries to be upscale and trendy with the items-everything is great the way it is, don't change it! The waitstaff was decent, despite considering themselves uber important and snooty. The margaritas were yummy. Nothing goes better with margaritas than guacamole - I'd be happiest with drinks and appetizers. It's expensive mexican food, but it's worth it for a fun night out.
