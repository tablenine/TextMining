Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
They have great ribs.  On a good day, it can be one of the best around Atlanta.  The location is nice just in between Buckhead and Midtown.       . . However, the price is more expensive than most other bbq places ($20+ for full slab), and the meat does not come with side dishes (except for pieces of white bread). . . Their Brunswick stew is not great.  So if one prefers a more traditional setting with stew and cornbread, Harold's can be a better option for cheaper.
