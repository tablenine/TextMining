Category: Thai
I enjoyed the authentic and fresh Thai food while listening to the Thai Elvis. The flavors are as hot and spicy as want them to be and the cooking is the same as you will see in Bangkok.  Service is really fast once you sit down. Our food arrived within 5 minutes of ordering. While true that the seating is cafeteria style it is comfortable with plenty of room. There is a $10 corkage policy for wine brought in.  We enjoyed a nice bottle of Riesling with the spicy Thai food.  Recommended spot when you are in the need of a Thai fix.
