Restaurant: May Street Market
Category: American (New)
Such a disappointment.  We'd been wanting to try May Street Market for awhile - it's right in our neighborhood, menu seemed intriguing, at least worth a try.  We went this past Friday night for an early Valentine's Day celebration, and it was probably the worst meal I've eaten in recent memory.  And not a cheap one, either.. I started with the Maytag Blue Cheesecake - it was good, and really the only acceptable element of our meal.  My husband had Pumpkin and Lemongrass soup, which sounded odd, but he loves pumpkin soup.  It was lukewarm and nearly inedible.. I ordered the scallops for dinner, and the odor coming off the plate was so repulsive I nearly couldn't bring myself to try a bite.  But I did - tasted no better than they smelled.  I have NEVER sent a plate of food back in my life, but I had to send this one back.  The server was very nice about it, and suggested I try the salmon instead.  It was fine - not really worth finishing - the flavors were just a little off, which seemed to be a theme there.  My husband had the filet - he claims that the meat was good, I only tried the risotto on which it was sitting, and it was just not great - not to mention the flavors were off.  We both agreed that the meal was not worth even near what we paid for it, and just such a disappointment.  We love food, love dining out in Chicago, and will be trying very hard to forget this meal.
