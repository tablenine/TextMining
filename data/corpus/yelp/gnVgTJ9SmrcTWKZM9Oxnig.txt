Ummm i don't know what to say. The food is not qualified for the price! even if the food was cheap I still wouldn't eat there!! Although i give it one star because the food is fast. The service is okay! The thing with these servers is that they judge a book by its cover! They think youngin` don't tip that much so they don't pay much attention to them. I just come here because it was so in at the time and now it's wayyyy out of the league!
