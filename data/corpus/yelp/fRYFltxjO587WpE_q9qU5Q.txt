Restaurant: Bite Cafe
Category: American (New)
Bite is like crack cocaine.   I was hooked 9 years ago, on my very first visit.. . Went to Bite on Friday for lunch, had their excellent vegetarian burrito and some witty banter with the nice server.    . . Went to Bite on Saturday for brunch, and thought I was stood up on a date (wah!).   Turns out it was the wrong day (whoops!), but definitely not the wrong restaurant.   . . I know my brunch server by name, and she takes exceptional care of her tables.    She knows the dish I enjoy, then went to the kitchen to have them make me a delicious mushroom sauce to go with my eggs.   It's not on the menu but she got it for me as she knows I'm not a huge Hollandaise fan.. . OK, so Sunday rolls around, and it's the true day for my date.   I kind of wanted to reschedule it for another restaurant, as I'd been there the past two days.   . . Wrong.  Different day.   Still delicious.. . How many restaurants in this city can you visit three days in a row and still want to go back?
