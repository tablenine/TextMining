I had the privilege of attending one of their monthly wine tastings on  Saturday afternoon.  . . I'll focus more on the restaurant iteself.. . The restaurant is accessible, clean and spacious.  The foods that were paired with the wines were from the kitchen and tasted great.  If I can remember it was a variety of cheeses, herb garlic chicken, and duck breast.. . The overall atmosphere was great and the servers were very helpful and on the spot.  The chef (dude with braids) came out and chilled for a while too...seemed like a really cool guy.. . If I try the actual menu someday I'll post again.
