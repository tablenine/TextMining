Perhaps I set my expectations too high? Maybe I need to dine there instead of bringing it back home? Or maybe, just maybe this place is overpriced? The only thing I know is that for $20 this burger and fries missed the mark. However, I am glad that I finally got to taste their food and cut through the mystique that has surrounded it and not feel guilty that I haven't been initiated. However, now I know that if I want to spend $20 plus dollars on burger, fries and beer and get something I know will be good, all I have to do is go up the street to Lucky Devil's on Hollywood Blvd and get their Kobe burger with a pint of Racer 5 instead of driving out to the west side.
