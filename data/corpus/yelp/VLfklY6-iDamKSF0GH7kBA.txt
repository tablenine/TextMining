Very romantic setting. However we were seated in a small table for two that seemed a little too close to the other table. To the point that I felt they were a part of my date.. . We were seated in the covered patio area which was so nice that I wasn't even aware it was a covered patio. That is until the guy next to me light up a cigarette and started to smoke. Nasty. Thank goodness we were ending our meal and close to be leaving anyways. He was polite about it and didn't blow it in anyone's face or direction. But was something I wasn't aware that I might be sitting next to someone smoking while paying for a very expensive dinner.. . Service was ok, wasn't very attentive and at times I felt we were "forgotten" but all I had to do was raise my hand and got his attention and he would get whatever I needed. Could have been a busy or "off" night.. . Food was nice. Nothing I really remember or would write home and rave about. It was simple, nice and enjoyable.. . Only problem was there seemed to be too much noise. This made it somewhat difficult to talk. The atmosphere was that of a romantic secluded place but the level was that of the Spaghetti Factory!
