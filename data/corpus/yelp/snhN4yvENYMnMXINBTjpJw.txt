Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
I love this place!  My boyfriend and I came here on our 2 year anniversary.  We were seated in the patio with nice comfy pillows.  I ordered the pistachio crusted scallops and he had the monk fish.  They were so good that I'm still thinking about it now, 2 days later.  . . For dessert we had the chocolate cream pot.  Now this is the only negative that I've found about their food and it's a very small one.  While the dessert was good, it gets overwhelmingly rich after awhile.  I wish they would add a couple more strawberries, instead of having just one.  Dipping the berries into the chocolate pot was the best part!. . The restaurant is hard to find as it's just a wall and a "little door" from the outside.  To me, that adds to the charm of the entire place, as opening the door reveals a beautiful garden with what looks like a small cottage in the back.  Very romantic.  I will definitely come back to try their other entrees.  We had a great time.
