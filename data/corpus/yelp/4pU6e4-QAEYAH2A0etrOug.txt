Category: Mexican
A west LA traditon must be doing something right. Â There is more flavor per dollar than any other place I know. You have to wait forever at conventional meal times, and the parking can be miserable. But, it is worth the wait to be part of a classic experience....tacos and enchiladas made for speed, designed to be good enough, if not authentic. It will be there forever I hope.
