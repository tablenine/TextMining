Restaurant: Pho Dai Loi
Category: Vietnamese
I went with a friend during a very busy lunch hour.. The food was made very quickly though. However, I was disappointed in the size of the large pho I ordered. Also, most of the pho was the broth and there was only a small amount of noodles and meat. The meat was also very chewy compared to other places I've had pho.
