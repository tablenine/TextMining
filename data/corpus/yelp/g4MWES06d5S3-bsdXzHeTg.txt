I brought my mom here and we had a good time.  We sat out back, which was lucky, because the inside room was a bit cramped and loud.  The back area was really nice and charming.  The service was a bit spotty and the food was ok, nothing amazing.  All around an average experience, nothing too extraordinary, but a nice place to go if you can get a seat out back.
