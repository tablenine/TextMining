Doner Kebabs! . Chicken, veggie, falafel beef/lamb slices on a wrap or focaccia slices. . The Classic Chicken was delish, especially with side orders of sweet potato fries, regular fries and fried pita strips. My fav was the sweet potato ones, but the fried pita strips w/ hummus were equally great!. . Spitz also sells gelato. If you go from 8-10pm, it's $1 if you order a meal. . . Oh and for some reason everyone seems to get their raspberry ice tea. mm... I mixed it with lemonade to make an Arnold Palmer --- good stuff. . . Parking is tricky unless you're annoyingly lucky and snag one of the 3 non-handicapped parking spots. So before you drive into Spitz, see if you can find street parking first. You'll save yourself some triple turn backup maneuvers. :). . BTW - this seems to be one of the few cafes open on a Sunday afternoon in Eagle Rock... I wonder why everything else closes so early?
