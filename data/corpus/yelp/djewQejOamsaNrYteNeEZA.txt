Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The only dish I get here is #13 - 1 succulent breast and 1 delicious waffle.  LOL.  It's seriously the best fried chicken breast and best waffle I've ever had.  I don't even like waffles much.  The chicken is crunchy and tasty, the waffle soft and melts in your mouth - even the syrup is irreplaceable.  I can't speak for the rest of the food though.  Mama is really friendly and you might occasionally spot a celeb if you're into that.  . . Usually crowded but the wait isn't too long, and parking gets tight.
