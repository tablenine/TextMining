Went here for breakfast, and snagged a table in the front.  Had the bison chili, which was a first for me.  They melted two slices of jalapeno cheese on top - it was pretty good.  Would've liked to have sat outside, but it was pouring.  Very crowded.  I felt a bit out of place, as it seemed to be a pretty indie/hipster crowd.  Not too noisy, but had good energy.. . Overall, a good breakfast/brunch type of spot.
