Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
WOW, the most amazing burgers ever!  I think I was being stalked by Umami.  First, a girlfriend mentioned Umami while at dinner in L.A.  Second, I get back to Chicago and receive my Vanity Fair and there is a write up about Umami.  Last,  back in L.A. and I log onto Yelp and the ROTD was Umami.  Geez, someone really wants me to eat here!. . My friend and I stopped by here for yesterday for lunch.  We ordered the Umami burger, the Truffle burger and an order of onion rings.  We split our burgers and shared.  We were in burger heaven.  Our favorite of the two was the Truffle burger.  It was rich and decadent.  In a word- perfection!  Don't get me wrong, the Umami burger was amazing.  It had the perfect mixture of flavors.  Lastly, I had a Grape Crush that immediately transported me back to my childhood!  Gotta run now...I need a nap!
