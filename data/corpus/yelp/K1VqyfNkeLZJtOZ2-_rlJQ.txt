Restaurant: Spring Restaurant
Category: American (New)
Absolutely love Spring, we had a wonderful experience--this may be my favorite Chicago restaurant. The menu is interesting and varied, the service is excellent and the ambiance and decor reflects the clean delicious flavors on the menu. Our waitress was really helpful with wine selections but not overbearing where we felt we had to order what she suggested. . It's worth every penny and I will definitely go back here, hopefully sooner than later.
