I'm not even taking a star out for the wait ( yeah be prepared to wait for a long time... ) and I usually don't do lines !!! On the bright side, you can also wait and drink Sake at the restaurant across the street !!! . . This place is awesome, the food is fresh and delicious ! If you know what you like you can make your own seasoning in the fondue pot, if not the chef will be more than happy to make the "special sauce' for you. . . A must do when you're in LA ... SERIOUSLY ! Forget the lines at Universal Studio, just get in line at Shabu Shabu House !
