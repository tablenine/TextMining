Yamashiro gets 5 stars just for the view alone.  Make sure to request a table by the window so you can have a great dining experience.  It's a good place for get togethers with frineds or romantic dinners.. . When I go to Yamashiro, instead of ordering entrees, I usually order sashimi or sushi.  Last time we went, we had 80 pieces of sushi/sashimi between five people.
