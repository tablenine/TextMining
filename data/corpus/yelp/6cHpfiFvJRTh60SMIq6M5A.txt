Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
its not the best. 7 mares on sunset is much better. i can't imagine frequenting a place that has only two options. a salsa bar is nice, but makes me feel like i might get sick from some of the items that sat out all day. lastly, tacos should come on two corn tortillas, not one. every other stand, cart, or truck uses two. a silly thing to mention, but i've got a taco technique of splitting one into two.. . really, though. are people falling for the name because it contains the word "best"? i see signs for "best burger", "best cheesesteak", "best pizza" only on substandard establishments.
