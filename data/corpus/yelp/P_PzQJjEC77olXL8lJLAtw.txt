I like my meat to taste like meat and my faux meat to taste like faux meat a la garden burgers. But a guy in line behind me told me to try the Santa Fe Chillin' Chicken sandwich. Upon first bite, I thought: cardboard!!!. . But my coworker suggested I just douse the bad boy in sauce (a.k.a. spicy mayo for the Santa Fe). I ordered the sweetheart fries which upon first bite was bland but soon became delicious with the spicy mayo.. . Love the way the place looks and would come back again to try other items now that I know the "meat" isn't going to taste like real "meat.". . Oh! And I had a bite of the vegan cookie which was chewy but...I think I just prefer butter in my cookies.... : \
