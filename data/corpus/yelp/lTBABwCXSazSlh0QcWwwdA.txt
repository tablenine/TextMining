I like this place. I took my dad here one time &amp; he ordered the pastrami. He is a fan of the Hat (not the one in Pasadena, that one sucks) &amp; he was BLOWN AWAY by Oinkster's pastrami. I've only ever had the cheese burger &amp; fries (I don't know, when I find something that I really like at a place that's a little pricey, I just keep getting it) &amp; it's been perfect every time. The same time I went here with my dad, there was this beast of a woman who wasn't satisfied with the way her burger was cooked &amp; demanded they make her another one. Hahah, she still ate the 'unsatisfactory' burger. &amp; then ate the replacement, THAT'S HOW GOOD THESE BURGERS ARE. . . WARNING!!!! Their Iced tea is an Earl Grey blend. I loooove Earl Grey, but I know that not everyone does. For example, my boyfriend ordered the tea &amp; I got the Oinsterade. We had to trade because he was unpleasantly surprised by the Earl Grey. I didn't mind one bit.
