A-Ok is a respectable way of saying 'I like this place just fine'.. . Good atmosphere for fish and chips and a pint of draught Guinness.. . I had the banger and mash.  I wouldn't get it again, not because it didn't taste good, it did!  For some reason, the bangers banged up my gut and I entertained myself by emitting nice long winds that sounded like a trombone for a while afterwards.  Yea, in short, I had intestinal gas.. . My husband had the fish and chips.  I tasted the fish and it's exactly what I like:  juicy, moist, fluffy fish coated well but not thick and fried crispy.. . I'll go back and get fish and chips with my pint of freshly drawn Guinness.. . We parked in the building next door for free.  And, what's up with putting Hermes in between a parking garage and an Irish pub??
