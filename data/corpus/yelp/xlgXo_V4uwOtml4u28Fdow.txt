Restaurant: Dresden Room Restaurant
Category: Lounges
Dresden Room is an old-school restaurant with cool, art-decoish tables and seating Â ( at a glance on my way to the restroom). Came here a while ago for a drink at the bar and some appetizers.. . I do like the ambience here, and am guessing that's why the whole place is full on a Tuesday night at 10 pm. It's dark and somewhat cozy although seating is a bit awkward when it gets full. . . My only qualms- the place smells stale, like a dark bar with old carpet. The music is okay, your basic lounge music except they are from the lips and fingers of the couple, Marty and Elayne. It's very casual, the music is not great but it's catchy and the couple is very entertaining. . . My calamari looked and tasted like rubber chicken nuggets. Same breading. That's like breading your tempura with egg and flour.. a big no no. . . It was a total deal-breaker; really, if you can't respect the appetizers then really, what can you expect from the main dishes? 3 stars if I would come back, but I don't think I will unless its for the bar only.
