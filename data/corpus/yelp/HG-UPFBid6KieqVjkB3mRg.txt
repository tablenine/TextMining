I mean, seriously, AS IF this place needs another review, because it certainly doesn't! My fam and I used to frequent this restaurant when it was at the old location down the street but we stopped for a while and I've only been there once since it re-opened at the current location. But now we recently went there over the weekend for my brother's birthday dinner. We had like 15 people and ordered so many dishes that I didn't even know the name of but let me tell you, we pretty much had a feast of the gods. So delicious...!. . The wait was about an hour but it WAS the weekend AND we had a large party so we pretty much expected it. (Have a few people come early to get a number, no big deal!). . I honestly ate so much I couldn't even see clearly. Straight up food coma!
