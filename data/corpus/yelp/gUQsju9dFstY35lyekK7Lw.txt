I have been looking forward to going here for a while.  The lobby is full of chairs and a cool looking bar.  Everything is clean and shiny and the staff is busy, yet friendly and helpful.  I sat at the bar for a while waiting for my friend and was able to watch the hustle and bustle of the staff.  Everyone was moving around getting things done, there was no lingering or waiting around.  . . Once we made it into the theater it was set up in a very cozy fashion.  Tables and bars made up the seating.  Two people could share a table or a group could sit at the bar.  Most of the tables were against a railing, giving a great view of the screen, but there are a few that are two deep.  We sat in the second row and would definitely sit against the railing next time.  It wasn't too bad, but it could have been better.  The waitstaff was friendly and decently prompt.  There was a wide variety of food and drink options.  The Crab Rangoon Dip was very good.  It was a little distracting during the movie with the waiters walking around, but wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  . . All and all a great experience.  I will definitely come here again!
