First of all, the group I went with had the worst time pronouncing the name. We decided on "worst coohie". Not appropriate, not accurate but fun to say. . . The food is amazing!!! They have a good selection of sausages to choose from. I went safe this time and had the spicy link. I will get more adventurous and have rattlesnake or alligator. You can top it with all kinds of stuff from hot or sweet peppers, onions and all the others you would expect to put on a sausage. . . We had the large fries with it and got to choose two dips (we chose chipotle catsup and pesto mayo). Both dips are excellent and the fries were very good as well. . . Of course just as important as your sausage is the assortment of beer. And they have a huge selection. I tried some that I have never heard before, but will definitely have again. Great stuff. . . You have to go here. That's all I have to say.
