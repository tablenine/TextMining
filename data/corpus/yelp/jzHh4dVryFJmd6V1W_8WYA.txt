Sometimes I feel like the only thing I eat is brunch, but I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I must say, people might not see LA as a "foodie" city, but it's pretty brunch-tastic and Blue Jam is yet another great brunch spot in LA.  Personally I love the scrambles, they have a lot of different options, many of which have interesting combination you might never think of on your own.  They have a delicious looking selection of sweet stuff too, like pancakes, french toast and crepes, but I don't think I've ever tried them because I just can't seem to pull myself away from those scrambles.  I guess I'm just not as sweet as I look.
