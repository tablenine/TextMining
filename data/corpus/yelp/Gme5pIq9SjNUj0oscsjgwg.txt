I like the patio at this bakery/ brunch/ sandwich spot. They recently made their champagne serving with the mimosa smaller but didn't lower the price so that's where they lost the star. . . the american panini and the roast beef panini are my favourite sandwiches. the salads are really ample. . . i like to sit in the cushion low chairs on the left side of the patio, some of the other chairs are ricketey and uncomfortable. i find it weird that they stopped allowing smoking considering it is outside.. . waiting in line to place your order is sort of annoying, especially since they then offer you delivery to your table, but it is a minor annoyance.. . $20 per person
