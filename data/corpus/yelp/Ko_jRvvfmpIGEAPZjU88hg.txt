We had no idea what to expect as this place is downstaires from the building I work in.  The atomosphere was very chic with a dash of elegance.  . . At first it started off slow, especially as I only had an hour for lunch.  We waited awhile for our drinks to come, BUT  it was all definitely worth it once we got our meals. . . I ordered the carne asada tacos, and my husband ordered the marinated skirt steak.  One of the best seasoned and marinated types of meat we have ever tasted.  My carne asada tacos were fantastic, the meat was tenderful and cooked just perfect.  They could have done without the corn in the tacos, but otherwise perfect.. . My husband's marinated skirt steak came out on a bed of lettuce and potatoes.  I tried some of his skirt steak and it was the best burst of flavor I have ever tested when it came to latin skirt steak. . . The only reason why I am giving this place a 4 is because my husband was still hungry!  If had two orders of the skirt steak, minus the lettuce, it would have been absolutely perfect.  . . We got our food on time and I still had several minutes to enjoy my lunch with my husband! Just a great and unexpected place.
