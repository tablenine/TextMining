Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Although I live pretty far away from Palms it is always worth the Hollywood Â drive to go there. I am addicted to their Garlic beef dish! Nothing adds to their already amazing food like seeing the Thai Elvis. The atmosphere is very fun and the service is usually pretty fast.
