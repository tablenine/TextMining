Moody's is a great place to go on a nice summer day. They have a nice outdoor patio-type area. The Moody Burger is very large and appetizing. I especially recommend getting a pitcher of lemonade and onion rings with your meal. Their onion rings are the best in Chicago! Good service tops off a great experience at Moody's.
