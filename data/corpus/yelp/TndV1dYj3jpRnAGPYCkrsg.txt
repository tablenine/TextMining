Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
Question: What type of food is more appropriate than Brazilian to follow a night of imbibing?  The right answer is that there isn't one. Me and my group of drunkies unanimously voted to come to this place.. . Meaty and greasy, the food at Bossa Nova was exactly what we needed that night. My Filet com Abacaxi sandwich had a delicious center, with Monterey Jack cheese melted over "Fillet Mignon" and and grilled pineapple.  The bread was crispy and thick enough to feed an entire small village. . . Three stars for the food, one extra for the fact that this place is open until the wee hours of the morning.
