love the Hainam chicken rice there! it is a must have!. Honestly i went there a couple times but i never ordered anything other than HCR. I heard other dishes was okay...... Always order a lemon ice tea! Free refill~ and the waitress will fill to the top and gave u a cap for to go. . try there cream brulee once, its good if you want to have a little something to fill your sweet tooth, besides, its not expensive either. . good place~~ their business is soo good that they close on sunday! god they must made a lot of money!!
