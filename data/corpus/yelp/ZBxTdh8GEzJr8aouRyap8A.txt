Aahh this is where I go after a Lakers or a Clippers game. A french dip beef sandwich, a side of cole slaw and an ice cold lemonade. I learned of this place from Huel Howser's California's Gold TV show about 10 years ago. Went there the next day and the same lady that Huel interviewed happened to be the one that helped me. . . The story was that a long time ago a cop came in to order a beef sandwich and the server accidentally dropped the bread in the sauce. The cop said its okay, I'll take it anyway.
