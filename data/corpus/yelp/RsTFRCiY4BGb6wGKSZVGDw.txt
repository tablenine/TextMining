Like any dirty uncle there comes fascination-repulsion.  Fascination-repulsion.  Everyone knows his M.O. but he's going nowhere because he's part of the family-- think of Uncle Julio's as part of the family.  I agree with previous reviewers-- it's overpriced, filled with trixies and their tiny trixie children but sometimes when it's summer and you're walking around and need that decent fruity drink and some great grilled meat on homemade fajitas you'll be looking for a family reunion.
