Restaurant: Colonnade Restaurant
Category: Southern
It's a throw back.  Appearance-wise, It reminds me of a dark hotel restaurant or a casino restaurant from Vegas.  I certainly prefer other atmospheres; but the food helps make up for this a little.. . It has a cafeteria feel to it including the "active adults" group that usually dominate the clientèle.  My fiancé introduced me to the place as she really enjoys it.  Seems the Colonnade has been an Atlanta staple for a long time.  I wish I had known about it sooner.. . The food?  Very good.  You can expect traditional Southern cuisine with a friendly wait staff.  The fried chicken is what they are famous for; but personally, I also like the assortment of veggies on their side dish list, i.e., black-eyed peas, pickled beats, fried okra, squash, baby lima beans, and many other goodies.  For the main attraction you can have roast beef, just a salad, or even a fried seafood platter just to name a few off of their diverse menu.  You do not have to wait long for your order either.  Plus, to my surprise they serve beer AND mixed drinks.. . Expect a little dated atmosphere (and visitors ;-) ) when you go, but get past it for some decent home cooking.. . Remember:  They do NOT take credit cards.  Cash or checks ONLY.
