I've had both dinner and brunch here.  The dinner menu has a wide range of mediterranean-inspired dishes.  I think I've had almost everything on the dinner menu but the pork shank is my favorite.  The paella is ok - definitely not authentic but has lots of seafood and is better than La Fonda's.  The kefta is good also but such a smaller dish than the others.  I'm not a big fan of sweet &amp; sticky but the baklava is really yummy too.  Oh, and 1/2 price entrees on Mondays...one of the best Monday deals in the A.. . I've only had brunch here once, and it was awhile ago.  All-you-can-eat cooked to order but nothing really spectacular that I can remember.  I did like the lentil soup and grits.  Shorter wait than Flying Biscuit if any.. . Oh, and the service is always excellent!  I hear their karaoke nights are fun too.
