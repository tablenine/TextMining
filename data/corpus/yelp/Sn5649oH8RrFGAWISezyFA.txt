First impressions: the tall ceilings and loud music immediately transported me to Trendy Club and then the enormous Buddha in the room took me to Thailand.  Wait.  Why is Lady Gaga blaring with Buddha sitting there so tranquil-- at peace?  This place is full of juxtaposed cultural iconography.  Well, mainly Asia and current culture.  I must have counted 10 Rihanna songs during our meal.  Note:  This is not a good place for a first date, because you will find you have to shout a little to be heard.  It's very trendy, high-vibe place.  The food isn't bad, I liked my Curry Masala.  I thought the portion was a little small for the price, but I guess you pay for the atmosphere... . . I withhold some stars because I had to shout during my meal.. . I hear the front bar turns into a club after 11 pm or something, and frankly, I wouldn't mind checking it out since overall, the place is pretty cool and the valet guys are very friendly.
