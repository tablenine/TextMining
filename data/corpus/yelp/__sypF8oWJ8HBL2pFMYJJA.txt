Restaurant: Green Zebra
Category: Vegetarian
Vegetarian and largely Vegan (only the lonely Halibut on the menu for flesh-eaters and I think they under-seasoned it to teach a lesson, like J. Walter Weatherman) Green Zebra isn't part of the raw food or ultra healthy vegetarian side of things but rather shows the ability of meatless dishes to shine on their own without an 18oz porterhouse on the plate.  . . The small plate entrees come loaded with layers of flavors and textures and richness frequently augmented with cheese and butter.  I didn't miss meat and didn't leave hungry.  . . The ice cream flight was the real highlight- corn ice cream that I enjoyed past the two bites of curiosity and a marshmallow and chocolate chunk ice cream that I'd have enjoy a three scoop waffle cone of.
