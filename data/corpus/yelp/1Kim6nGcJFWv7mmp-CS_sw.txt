Restaurant: El Cid 2
Category: Mexican
I used to go to this place all the time when I lived in the area.  Once I came back from college I took my boyfriend to show him a good Mexican restaurant I used to go to.  To my disappointment it has completely changed.  This place used to be a place to go for great food and a casual environment.  Now they just focus on making the place a hip place to go and have lost the appreciation for good food.  They completely remodeled, the prices went sky high, and the crowd is completely different.  We will never go back - there are too many excellent Mexican restaurants in Chicago.
