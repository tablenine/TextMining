This place was a great surprise for me!. . I was expecting it to be crazy busy on a Friday night.  I was able to find a table and managed to linger there for a few hours w/my friends.  Great music (old school Michael Jackson from the Off the Wall album) at a conversation friendly volume.  . . I had the Friday special (fish 'n chips).  Very good, although don't expect to have them refill your fish'n chips quickly, as they make a new batch as you request it.  Downside: waiting for fish n' chips.....Pro:  FRESH fish n' chips!. . It eventually became busy later in the night, although our server's service was unwavering throughout the night!  so that's a big bonus!. . Overall, great place to meet up with friends after a long day at work!
