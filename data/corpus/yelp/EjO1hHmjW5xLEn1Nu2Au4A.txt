Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
La La's is a good spot.  . . For lunch, I find their salads to be especially tasty. . . Their empanadas are petit and make for a great  snack.. . They have decent wines and mixed drinks.. . At night the place has a relaxed atmosphere. The side patio is really pretty nice especially if on a date or with a small dinner party. They have heaters which keep the temperature just right and the lights are  dim which gives the place a very mellow and intimate vibe. . . The kitchen stays open later than most other restaurants in LA. (This is always a plus in my book.). . Parking is typically my biggest beef with La La's, although I was there last Sat at 10 pm and found a spot right on the street literally next the entrance. Note: this is the exception not the norm, but I'll take it and be grateful.
