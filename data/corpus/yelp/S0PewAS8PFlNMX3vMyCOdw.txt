Chinese Cuisine. Terrible service!!!!. yes, evryone is right, this place  "might" have good foo but the lack of service is terrible.. We had 2 dishes:.  Thai basil shrimp/calamaris  which was suppose to be spicy (not at all). Shrimp curry.. Both dishes arrived with rice, but when the first dish arrived the waiter just throw the dish at the table (like drooping a rag) and left, ok...... so we just had to arrange our plates to eat, then the second came and the guy just gave it to my husband to hold it because he had to go, it was the last time we saw the waiter, there was no one to give us more water, my husband also order a bubble tea (which never arrived) so i went to ask for it at the register, they told me that my waiter was busy upstairs and i had to wait, they had like 20 orders of bubble tea on the counter that had no names..... i talked to a few wait staff until  (20 m later)i got my husband juice, the waiter apologize "we are very busy" he said.. Now, i dont think the people upstairs were more important than me, i think every customer counts as equal, they do have problem with service, i don't care if the food is good..... i don't like to be treated this way.. We took the rest of the food home, check came quick, but we didn't leave much of the tips....... really.. I had been many times to the one in evanston, they do know customer service. . Food ok. Service.... just HORRIBLE. Will never come back... NEVER!
