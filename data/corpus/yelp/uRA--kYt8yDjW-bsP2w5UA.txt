Did the tasting menu with the wine pairing and a bottle of flat.  $225.00+.  Would be happier if it ended up under $200, but it was still worth it.  The place is nothing too fancy.  Seated right by the fireplace in the patio, which added to the atmosphere.  Service was impeccable contrary to previous reviews.  And yes, the chef came by to check on things.  Stuck around for the music and the small lounge wasn't crowded at all for a Saturday night.  A good time to get cozy.
