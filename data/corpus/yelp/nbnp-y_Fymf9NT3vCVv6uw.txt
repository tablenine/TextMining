If I lived closer and had a higher income I would eat every meal here.  I love the decor...it's sophisticated--no dirty granola vibe or militant veganish symbolism (whew!)--it's simple, modern, and clean, with a lovely use of dark wood furniture.  The restaurant holds a fair number of people, yet maintains the perfect amount of intimacy within its social setting.  Perfect for date night?  I think so!  (If it all goes well, bring 'em back for breakfast; order the French toast, with a delicious side of extra crispy bacon! The scrambles are light and tasty, too.). . On June 7, RDF will premier its new menu for this season.  I have mixed feelings about this because I'm really attached to the Supreme Burrito--jalapeno cashew cedar cheese, Spanish rice, refried black beans, tempeh bacon, sauted onions and peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado &amp; tofu sour cream in a whole wheat tortilla.  Oh, God...is that a tear upon my cheek?  Oh, God, I'll miss my burrito so!  On the other hand, I can't wait to see what else Ann Gentry has up her sleeve.  She hasn't disappointed me, each dish being so fresh, filling, full of flavor, and wonderfully presented.  In any case, I'll be back for the food--and, the hot waitress that I have a mad crush on.  (I won't describe her.  You'll know her when you see her: bursting with life, full of warmth, and she'll chat your ear off about the awesome food if you let her; I let her.)
