Best Brunch Ever. Vegan or not, it's unbelievable. Without a doubt one of the best restaurants in LA. It's also one of our favorite places bring out of town guests and non-veg friends, and they've always loved it. My husband is not a vegetarian and this is his favorite restaurant in LA. . . Some of our favorite stuff is the TV Dinner, the Salsbury Seitan, the Club sandwich, the Nachos and basically ANYTHING on the brunch menu. The Weekender is the best way to go, you get a lot of food. Add blueberries to your pancakes, and get the "fruit spread," it's like butter with fruit mixed in. Even the little stuff like muffins and scones are unreal. . It's often crowded so be prepared to wait if you go at certain times, and we've missed out on brunch before by getting there too close to 3:00 and having to wait to get a table. . Parking kind of sucks if you don't want to valet, sometimes you can get lucky and find a meter.
