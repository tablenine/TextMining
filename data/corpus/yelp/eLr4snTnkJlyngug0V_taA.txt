Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
This was a must when I realized this was the place Snoop Dog loves.  And now that in the bay area, soul food/chicken and waffles is a big thing, I had to try this place.  I've never been to a restaurant where there is a bouncer at the door.  We arrived at 2pm and it was still packed!  The wait wasnt too bad tho.  Service was excellent.. . I was a little dissapointed because the chicken wasn't as juicy as I expected.  It was tasty, but I felt like the chicken was all batter.  There wasn't enough meat on the bone.  I think House of Chicken n Waffles in Oakland, California is better.  But I'm glad I went to just have the experience.
