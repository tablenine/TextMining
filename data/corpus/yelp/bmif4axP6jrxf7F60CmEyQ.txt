oh wow... such a great value for the amount of food that we got... the dishes itself though didn't stand out as much as it did at alta... 5 girls got the following:. . patatas bravas (best thing there MUST GET). croquettes (melted in ur mouth). chorizo con chocolate (weird... just think sausage with chocolate literally). chorizo regular... uh felt like just sausage. pork loin sandwich (pork pretty tender not dry... bread really good!). some cod thing (super flavorful with butter). sardine (alrite but not spectucular). fried fish thingy (overfilled with spices could do without). omelet/potato thingy... pretty good but forgetful. mushroom carpaccio super good with tons of garlic!. server was so good to us! gave us free squid ink... omg really good black sauce... need bread to soak that up!. cheese plate good ending but eh could be passed. dessert some sorta cake with dulce de leche yummmmm. . overall recommended for groups of 6+ so that u can make a reservation... otherwise wait is usually 2 hours! great girls night out location! i think this one and alta are my top two tapas picks!
