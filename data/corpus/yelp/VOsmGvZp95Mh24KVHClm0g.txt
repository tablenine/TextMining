All I have to say is, "OMG, I can't wait to eat here again!!!"  The day after , I spoke with several friends and suggested we dine here next time we get together.  The lamb was perfectly prepared, the bread was individually presented within the pot that it was baked in, and the sides and deserts were excellent.
