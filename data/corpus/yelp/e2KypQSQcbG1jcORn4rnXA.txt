I love this place! The service has always been great, the home made corn bread is a little greasy but sure taste amazing! The baby back ribs are excellent, and I love the chicken soup too, it's loaded with meat and veggie. The outdoor seating during the summer is awesome. The neighborhood is really up-and-coming as well. I'd recommend my friends to check it out. Maybe not there for a date though...
