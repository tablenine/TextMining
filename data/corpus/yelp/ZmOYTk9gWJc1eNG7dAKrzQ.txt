Restaurant: Kogi
Category: Food Stands
Kogi is the best food that delivers the yum-a-lish to your mouth.  For the meat eaters out there, the short rib tacos are the BEST!  You'll want to order multiple tacos.  The Kogi sliders are a close second.  The short rib burrito is very filling so beware if multiple ordering....since it is hard to only order 1 thing.  This truck will get you craving Kogi and planning for the truck's arrival.. I learned the hard way to make sure I got there in plenty of time.  Although they said they'd be in silverlake until 3pm, with 13 minutes till... we got shown the sign.  The last guy in line had a sign sayiing he'd be the last one served.  I don't hold this against Kogi since they have a schedule.  I've just learned to get myself there earlier. . I LOVE YOU KOGI
