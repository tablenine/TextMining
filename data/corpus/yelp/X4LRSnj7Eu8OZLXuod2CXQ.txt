Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
This place actually has parking and its more roomy than the other father's office.  . . needless to say, Office Burger is awesome, dont be one of those people who say "thats it?" when they eat it because we all know you're being an asshole and you probably hate Innout as well.. . I think people dont know too much about Terrible beer though, they dont serve it at many bars so one should get it while they can while they are here.  it comes in a 750 ml bottle and is 10% alcohol and its a very good ale that is complex blah blah blah, just do it.
