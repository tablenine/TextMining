I LOVE Feed. LOVE. IT. Where else can I defeat my craving for grilled corn on the cob, a huge pile of mashed potatoes AND banana pudding all in one place?. . But this isn't gonna be so much a review, as an etiquette thing.. . Feed is communal seating. That big table at the back? IT ISN'T ALL FOR YOU. There are 10 of you? Guess what? THAT TABLE SEATS 16. SCOOT OVER.. . My last trip here last week had me and my pal Molly McButter battling a roving pack of trixies for 3 seats at the end of the table. The place was packed (even the outside tables were all taken), and they about had a fit when we deigned to sit at the end of their coveted table that they had "Reserved". . . "But the OOOWWWNNEEERRR said we could have the WHOOOLLLEEE TABLLEEEE.". . Um. No. . . Ms. McButter saved the day when she went and talked to the super sweet (and super slammed) manager, who told her "There are enough chairs for everyone.". . All I wanted was to dig in. . . We did, and they did, and everyone was happy.. . The moral of this story? If the place is packed, you're going to probably sit elbow to elbow with people you do not know. Deal with it. It's not a bad thing.
