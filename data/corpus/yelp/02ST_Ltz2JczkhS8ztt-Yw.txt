Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
man i love hitting pizzeria mozza circa 11:30pm after getting concocted somewhere first while workin up my appetite. on a scale of 1-10 of my favorite things to do, it hovers somewhere around 10. . . i park myself at the bar, grab 250ml of vino, hit the albondigas, maybe some chicken liver bruschetta, then crush a pizza. i always overdo the meat, pretty much impossible not to, too many outstanding options.
