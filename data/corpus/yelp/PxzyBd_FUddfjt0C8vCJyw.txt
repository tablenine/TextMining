Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
This was supposedly one of the best pizza and Italian restaurants in L.A. but I would never compare it to New York or Chicago pizza places and restaurants. Â That would be disrespectful.. . When I arrived there with my b/f it wasn't as packed, no lines reaching outside the door and all. We waited at least 6-8 minutes before being seated at a booth.. . I must say though I gave this one extra star because the service was good.. . The pizza however, not so much. It was mediocre really. The only thing I liked other than the service was the meatballs that my boyfriend and I had ordered as a starter.
