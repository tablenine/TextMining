No words describes this place.. Gotta love the location...Good food, great prices and wonderful customer service.... . This place is very cool and laid back. . atmosphere is simple but yet it can turn to a lounge.. . we got the Belgian fries with garlic sauce is bomb diggity, got the bbq pulled pork and that was off the hook, the royale (pastrami and burger) together, that was off the chain.. everything in general is good at this place!!!. . Would def recommend this place and would def come again.... . So if you're in the eagle rock / glendale / pasadena area..come thru to this place...best burger, pastrami and fries joint!!!. . GOOD JOB OINKSTERS!!!
