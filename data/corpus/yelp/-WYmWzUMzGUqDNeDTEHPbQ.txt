"GOODBYE SEX. HELLO BURGERS AND FRIES FROM THE APPLE PAN!!" . . I heard some freak announce that upon exiting this fine dining establishment not too long ago.. . Hmm...perhaps it was me.... . One of the guys who works here kinda looks like Charles Bukowski, and I'm sure if good 'ol Hank were still around, he'd hit up this joint for sure.
