I can understand having a wait for Sunday brunch, but I cannot understand having a wait with at least 7 tables open and 5 servers on the floor!! Â It would have been nice to have been able to review the food but after staring 20 minutes at empty tables my friend, who needed to catch a flight, and I had to bolt for waffle house.. . Does the owner realize the volume they're missing out on?
