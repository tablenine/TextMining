Wow another place where the most recent yelp reviews are craptastic.  I had a very good experience here.  But maybe it was because I was here for lunch.. . We did a restaurant week lunch here and everything we ate we all loved.. . Started with the steamed shrimp salad with avocado and a champagne vinaigrette dressing....this was quite tasty...all 3 of us cleaned our plates.. . I had the skate for my main and again this was excellent...it came with sticky rice and asparagus..... . Everything was cooked well....the service was very good....we enjoyed the atmosphere although we were wondering how so many people were eating lunch there on a work day....two of my friends had off from work and I ended early but there were so many women....are they the types with rich husbands or did they all have the day off too?  Just something we were thinking..... . Mercer Kitchen is yummy!. . Oh!!! - The Raspberry Lychee Bellini is awesome!!!!!
