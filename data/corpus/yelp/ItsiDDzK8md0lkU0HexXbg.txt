This place is Awesome! Can't beat the music and food! Food is great! . The chinese broccoli with crispy pork is to die for.. yummie to your tummie.. The other food are great! You gotta at least try it out once right!!! . The only bad thing is parking you gotta pay! Before in the old center you didn't have to pay! boo for that.. And that they did raise the price for the food. hmm wonder why.. . oh well but it is yummie!!
