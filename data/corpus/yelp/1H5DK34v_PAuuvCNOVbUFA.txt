I hope you and your party like crepes because that's all they serve here. I had a breakfast crepe, and it was alright. I should've ordered one of their savory crepes (more unique). Like others have said, it's very vegetarian friendly. I don't get the appeal of crepes. Thinned pancakes with stuffing. I suppose every region has their own version of a burrito. :-)
