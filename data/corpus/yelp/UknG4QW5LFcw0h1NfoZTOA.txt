I've been back several times since my first review so I figured it was time for an update.  While my  opinion about the beef dip sandwich haven't changed, I have discovered the lamb sandwich.  Once I got my first lamb double dip sandwich I never turned back.  The lamb is extremely flavourful, juicy and succulent every time I get it.  The simple classic macaroni salad always hits the spot and if you have room , a cup of chilli with or without beans is certainly worth the nominal fee.
