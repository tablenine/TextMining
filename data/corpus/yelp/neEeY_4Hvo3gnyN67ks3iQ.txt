I only come here with a large group of people, for smaller group, I prefer to go to other smaller places with better meat quality. . This place can accommodate party 30+.. I won't recommend to come here if its your bday and you have nutty friends. . Cos I once saw the waiter empty an entire bottle of champagne on the bday boy with his friends approval. He was soaking wet from head to toe. LOL. . Their fruity soju are good, but not quite strong enough for my taste. . This place is more of the atmosphere than the food quality.. Most of the time this place is crowded and so be prepared to wait. . . Valet parking available or street parking.
