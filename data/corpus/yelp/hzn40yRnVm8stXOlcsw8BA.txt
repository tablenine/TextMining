Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Milk &amp; Honey Caf has a bit of an "indie" feel to it.  Completely casual, there is no table service here.  While ordering at the counter, I usually like the orange brioche French toast, smoked salmon on a toasted bagel, or an egg, bacon, tomato, and cheddar panini.  Their homemade granola is pretty good too, so it's no surprise it is now packaged and sold across the city.  The lunch menu is always fresh and new, including several salads and sandwiches.  There are also plenty of vegetarian options and sweets available.  The outdoor seating is charming, and during the cold winter months, you can enjoy your meal next to the fireplace indoors.
