Category: Steakhouses
The ultimate dining experience if you love red meat.  They have steaks down to a perfect science!  I love how your plate comes to you sizzling hot, so your food stays hot throughout the entire meal. . . Creamed corn, snap peas, mashed potatoes were good sides... HUGE onion rings (think: size of your hand big), that were good too.  The chopped salad and oysters were fresh and tasty as well.  Crab cakes were chock full of fresh crab, very good.... . Of course, the standout was the steak, cooked to perfection, smothered in butter.  Every bite was perfectly seasoned and tasty.. . For dessert, try the fresh berries and cream - for four people, we shared this one dessert and still had leftovers.  It came with tons of fresh strawberries, rasberries, blackberries, blueberries, and some thin orange slices as well.  Paired with the freshly whipped homemade cream, this dessert made for a satisftying end to a wonderful meal.. . We were seated in the "wine cellar" semi-private room, which made for an intimate and relaxing dining experience.  It's definitely different than the upstairs lounge/bar area, where it's very dark and loud.  The lounge area is better for people watching, but the wine cellar area is good too (our waitress told us this area is frequented by celebrities/VIPs wanting to have a more private dining experience).. . Mastros is now my new favorite place for red meat - no where else on the West Coast can compare!
