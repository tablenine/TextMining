Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
Look, the food here is slightly above average for a hot dog stand--certainly nothing great, and not fit to carry Hot Doug's hot jock.  But you aren't a Chicagoan until you've been to Wiener's Circle between the hours of 2 and 4 am.  It truly is feeding time at the zoo.  Once you've seen the show a few times though, this place becomes pretty skip-able, though I do occasionally stop by on a weekend afternoon for a quick bite.. . Oh and don't forget to order the chocolate milk shake.
