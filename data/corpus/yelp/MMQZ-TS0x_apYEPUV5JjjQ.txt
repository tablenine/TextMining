VERY YUMMY FOOD! we tried this place tonight &amp; it was great. valet parking is only $4. the food &amp; service is excellent! try the carne asada pizzeta as an appitizer... amaaaazing. And get the Kobe beef burger, its the best burger you'll ever eat YUM. . . The atmosphere is lovely &amp; prices aren't too high (from 15-25 a dinner plate). GREAT DATE restaurant! :)
