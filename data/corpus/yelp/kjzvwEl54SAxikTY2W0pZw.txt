I use to live just down the street so this was a convent place to get lunch a couple times a week. Sandwiches and salads are pretty good. I usually get the steak sandwich so that's my favorite. Red velvet cupcake was OK but i still like Â sprinkles better. Def better to sit outside in the lovely LA sun than inside so if its super busy and you don't want to wait pull out a 20 or 40 dollars to tip and that will normally make the wait time disappear.
