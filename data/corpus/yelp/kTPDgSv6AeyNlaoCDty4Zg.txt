Everything was very tasty, wine list was extensive, service was quite good, drink from the bar was yummy.  We may have been there on a slower night, but the noise level was fine.  I'm not sure what was missing to give it a 5 star rating, but it just wasn't somewhere we'd probably return to.  Nothing was wrong, but nothing is really encouraging me to return.... if that makes sense.  We had the mushroom flatbread (delicious), charred octopus appy (really, really good -- and a surprising meaty taste -- I was expecting something of the consistency of calamari.  It was very tasty), elk chop, and roasted hen, followed by the cheese plate after dinner.  Oh, and the potatoes fried in duck fat --- yummmm.  Maybe a more extensive list of entrees would make us return, I'm not sure.  Certainly worth one trip though.
