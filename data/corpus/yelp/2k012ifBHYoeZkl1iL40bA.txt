Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
A few friends and I ventured out to LA for a weekend to get fat and live like the celebrities we are. Well the mission was definately accomplished, as soon as I walked through the doors of this location, it was ALL OUT, me and the food, its going dowwwwwwwwn. . . I ordered the 1/2 chix with a side of 2 waffles. When the food came out, I did not believe I would be able to finish it but the beast inside me came out and I conquered it. Although I probably ate way too damn much, It still tasted very good. The chicken was moist and the waffles were crispy on the outside and soft inside. The gravy for the chicken was a nice addition to the taste. The syrup for the waffles was perfect too.. . The Service was acceptable, no complaints here. . . I would definately return, but I think I will have to go with 1/4 chix instead of the 1/2 chix. I really think they have the "1/2 chix" on the menu for Shaq sized people, and me standing at 5' 8'', 150lbs, am not close to that size at all. . . I am a fat kid at heart though.... haha.
