Restaurant: Five Seasons Brewing
Category: Pubs
I promised a friend who very much loves Five Seasons that I would withhold my review from my first visit about 2 months ago until now, when I could visit a second time last night. I am extremely glad I did because after yesterday I can't say that I would give Five Seasons anything less than five stars (har har).. . The first time I went the beer was great. As it should be....it's a brewery. But we all know that being a brewery doesn't mean great beer (ahem, Rock Bottom). For my dinner, I probably got the most boring, mundane thing on the menu - the French Fried Chicken. I was expecting a small piece of chicken but out comes literally, a WHOLE mini chicken. And it was good but not fabulous. You can imagine my disappointment because my friend had really done nothing but rave about how good the food is here.. . Fast forward to last night and I went again with this same friend, hoping to redeem the reputation of Five Seasons. I learned that the best choices come from the "nightly" menu. A few of the options for specials they were already out of, but we spotted two that might be good to split. A flatbread pizza with fresh tomato, chicken, and red onion and a ravioli with Italian sausage, mushrooms, and a creamy sauce. Both were really really really good. . . I left really stuffed and due to three Sledgehammer beers (their own brew), a tad tipsy.. . After last night, I would say that I really like Five Seasons and will visit again, but know two things if you choose to go (1) get THEIR beer and (2) pick something from the nightly specials menu for the best, freshest ingredient options.
