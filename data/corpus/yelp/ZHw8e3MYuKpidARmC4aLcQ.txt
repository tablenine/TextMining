Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
Was in the mood for some thai tonight so we decided to make the walk over to Penny's. Delivery was discussed, but it was so nice out, I thought it would be better if we walked over. . . Started out with the vietnamese spring rolls for an appetizer and they were really good. The hot pepper noodle with chicken was very much good as well as spicy. The margaritas/martinis were really good. The mango magarita was something special and the raspberry martini was cool also. The menu was pretty nice with many delicious dishes to choose from. Their beef soup is something to talk about...yum!. . I really like the look of the place. It doesn't have the look of the usual thai places, but it really has flavor. I love the big windows walking by them from the outside and sitting on the inside staring out of them. They have a pretty cool plasma television on the inside and some very swanky pics on the wall as well. The table setup they have is cool as well.. . They deliver as well!. . Good place and good food!
