went for the first time yesterday.  i had always heard that this was a "burger place."  strangely, they only have one burger option on the menu!  hahaha... soooo, i ordered the one burger option and a basket of sweet potato fries.  $19.  i'm unemployed, so it hurt, but when in rome, spend like the romans do!  . . thank god we got there before 7, b/c i would NOT have wanted to wait around for a table like a lot of folks were doing.  so keep that in mind when the weather's cold!  . . i didn't have anything to drink, so i can't comment on the alcoholic aspect of the place.  BUT, atmosphere vibed of an awesome drinking place.  friendly.  bartenders were also really friendly and efficient.. . burger was faaaantastic.  cooked to perfection (for all 3 of us).  sweet potato fries were delicious!!!  i couldn't finish either b/c portions are so big.  i got a big ole ground beef comfort food tummy ache.  it was awesome.  i'll keep that in mind for next time so i can go on the cheap and split with someone.
