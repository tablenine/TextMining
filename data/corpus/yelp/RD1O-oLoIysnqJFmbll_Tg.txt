Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I'm an absolute burger fanatic. Like no joke, my burger standards living in LA are so high now I don't even eat In N Out anymore unless it's with friends who drag me there. I heard great things about Umami Burger from a friend who went there a while back, and after listening to him rave about the Triple Pork Burger, I knew I had to come try it out. . . I was absolutely STUNNED how amazing the TPB was. Tender, juicy, flavorful, and well-spiced... and paired along with the soft supple bun... everything was top notch. Pair your burger with some legit mexican cane sugar Coke and an order of onion rings and THICK french fries, and you're good to go!. . Since then, I have also tried the Umami Burger, which was also delectable, but I'll definitely be back more often to try every single burger.. . Service is excellent and attentive, and parking (valet) is scarce, so you may have to try street parking. The wait time for my party of three was always around 15 minutes, so not a very long wait at all.
