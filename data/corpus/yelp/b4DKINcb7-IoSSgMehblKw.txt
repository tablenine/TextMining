Ate here for dinner for the fist time the other day.  Barbecue chicken sandwich was excellent.  The patio was open so table service was available, it was fast and friendly.  Only downside is the lack of plastic acceptance - I wanted to try some sides or dessert but didn't have enough cash on me that day.  I'll definitely be returning to try some other menu items.
