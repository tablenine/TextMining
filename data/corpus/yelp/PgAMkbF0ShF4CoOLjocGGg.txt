Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
The food is excellent and the service is great. This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the city. . . The menu is a diverse array of tacos, ranging from vegetarian to fish to pork. There are also enchiladas and fajitas, as well as other traditional Mexican foods. . . The drinks are great - they have a cholata on the menu, which I have only seen on my trips to El Paso. The authenticity of the food and drinks is impressive. The chef and servers have done their research.. . The homemade feeling is great. We probably had 2 or 3 bowls of the homemade tortilla chips with the 3 salsa appetizer. Very unique flavors, and wonderful to try. . . Parking is difficult, but if you go early enough, you can get a spot on the side streets in the area.
