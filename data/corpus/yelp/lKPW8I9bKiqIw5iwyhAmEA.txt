Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
This is used to be only $14.99. now its $17.99. Its still a deal though for an all you can eat.  Great place to eat if you got a lot of hungry people or just big eaters. There are a few choices of meat, but the best is the thin slice of beef i don't know what its called? Those tiny korean dishes are great when you are waiting for your meat to cook.  This whole place smells like bbq, so if you're gonna eat here, don't wear your good clothes, because it will stink even after you do laundry. The best time to come is 4pm. Why? you skip lunch and go straight for an early dinner and plus there is no wait at 4pm.  You probably need a few extra hours to digest the food too.
