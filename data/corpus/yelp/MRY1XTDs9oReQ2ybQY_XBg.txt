yes! my first 5 star review......and very well deserved. . took my wifey here on march 5th for her 30th bday.......location is in the heart of beverly hills......convenient valet right at the entrance......... . we were sat immediately upstairs.......we were sat next to the only other people in the restaurant, but in about 30 minutes, the place was packed. . service was excellent......we started out with a plate of 1/2 blue point and 1/2 northern pacific oysters........bomb!. . next, my wife ordered up the bone-in filet medium and i got the bone-in ribeye medium.......i think we got a couple martinis too........honestly i can't remember the drinks since i was too "drunk" from the meat!!!!!!. . perfectly aged, perfectly cooked, perfectly tasting!!!!!. . we also got the gorgonzola mac &amp; cheese and sauteed mushrooms.......excellent sides to compliment the main dish. . since it was my wife's bday, they brought out a special dessert plate filled with about 5 chocolate covered strawberries, warm butter cake with ice cream, and chocolate sin cake!!!!! (see picture i posted). . the bill was about $300 for the both of us........well worth it and our waiter deserved every bit of his 25% tip. . as we were waiting for the valet, the doorman kindly snapped a picture for us to complete her special night......... . could not have asked for a better evening.........or meal......... . 5 stars all the way. . JYEAH!!!!!!
