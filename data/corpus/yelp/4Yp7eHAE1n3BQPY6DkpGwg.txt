The lines here are still crazy even with 4 trucks.  I spent $26 the other day for myself cause I wanted to try everything.  I shared some of my bounty.. . Winners. Kimchee quesadilla - the blend of cheese and spicy kimchee with a nice gochujang/siracha sauce on top was the best thing I ate from the truck.  Really a crazy mind bending meld of flavors. . Spicy pork taco - the best of all the meats.  Was definitely the most flavorful and tender.. Kogi dog - just a flat out great hot dog.  It's a great all beef dog.  Add on a bunch of kim chee condiments and hot sauce for a great hot dog experience.. . Good to Average. Blackjack quesadilla - the melding of flavors didn't work as well.  The addition of spicy pork was nice.  The green chile verde sauce just didn't strike a chord with me.  Not terrible but after eating the kimchee quesadilla this wasn't as good.. Short rib sliders - the short rib itself was kind dry.  I guess its really luck of the draw.  The soft Hawaiian type rolls are great.  I didn't really care for the toppings.  The cheese and slaw were just haphazardly added.  I didn't feel this was very successful. . . Gotta go back and try the snake in the grass, chocolate dessert and the calamari tacos.  The kimchee quesadilla, spicy pork taco and hot dog are all keepers.
