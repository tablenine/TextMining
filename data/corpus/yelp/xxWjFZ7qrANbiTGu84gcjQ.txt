Restaurant: Mary Mac&#39;s Tea Room
Category: Southern
If I could give a 3.5 then May Mac's would get that.. . I've been a few times over the past year and generally enjoyed the experience, but something just didn't feel right about my meal there last Saturday. Overall, Mary Mac's would get a 4 for delicious southern food, charm and top notch service.. . I usually stick to the Chicken Dumplings or Meatloaf, but this time I opted for the Roasted Pork. The Roasted Pork did not seem very fresh and felt like it had either been around a while or came pre-made in a can(like pressed turkey). The Mac N' Cheese was as to be expected, delicious. The broccoli souffle was a new choice for me and I was not disappointed.. . I plan to revisit Mary Mac's soon and hope I can upgrade it to four stars then.
