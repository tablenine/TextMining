Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I've been to better k-bbq places where there is better service and you don't end up smelling like barbequed cow afterwards, but for some odd reason, we are always drawn to this place, maybe it's a cheesy pop korean music in the background or the server's eagerness to serve (or lack of), the freedom to smoke our lungs out or maybe the sight of a champagne shower for the poor unsuspecting birthday celebrants. . . +1 star for the variety of soju!! salad is good and the side dishes are good as well.. . nothing beats good ol' korean bbq, and a bottle of Hite and some soju.. . Whatever you do, do not drink the water! It sits in an uncovered water jug and is scooped out with what looks like a very unsanitary bucket. eeww.
