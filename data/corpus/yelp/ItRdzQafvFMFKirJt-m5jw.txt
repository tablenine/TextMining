We went early on a Saturday night for a light dinner and a few drinks. We are greeted with a friendly wait staff and a laid back atmosphere. They have a decent drink menu with interesting (although a little watered down) and seasonal feeling choices. We got the special with gin and absinthe which was surprising,smooth and refreshing. We started with the pub frites with three dipping sauces - we picked goat cheese fondue and curry catsup and our waitress brought us the smoked tomato mayonaise on her. The mayonaise sauce is her favorite and ours, the goat cheese fondue was too lite in flavor and the curry catsup was nice but not extrodinary. We also ordered the goat cheese stuffed peppadews to start. They were great, a combination of sweet cheese and slightly hot peppers - the portion was small but perfect for a taste.. . We will return in a month or so.
