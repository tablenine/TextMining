Great neighborhood spot. You can be in and out quickly, and the menu is a bit more eclectic than the average Mexican joint. Margaritas are great and the service is friendly (although sometimes it can seem like there is one person working there). I had the carnitas once but they weren't that good..fatty meat and they tasted more like the oil they were friend in than the pork you were expecting. But this is always an easy failsafe for me if I want to eat somewhere cool in the neighborhood....
