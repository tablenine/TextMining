First time I've ever been here, and I definitely would make a return trip if I was in the area!. . I tried their lamb sandwich, macaroni salad, and dill pickle w/a glass of lemonade.  The lamb had a great flavor and was tender; I just wish I had remembered to get swiss cheese on the top!  The macaroni salad was very good.  The dill pickle was nice, but I think I prefer the store-bought Claussen kosher ones (though I could've had bottom-of-the-barrel pickle since it was one of two left in the container at the moment).  The lemonade was perfect!  It's just a shame it comes in a small glass, but for $0.75 it's still a great deal.. . The interior was pretty much like an old-style deli.  There are multiple lines and you just wait inside until you get to the front.  The floor has sawdust and there are long tables w/bar stools.. . Definitely worth a shot if you've never been there before.  Perhaps you'll also become a fan of Philippe!
