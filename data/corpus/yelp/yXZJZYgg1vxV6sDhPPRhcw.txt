Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Soowon has some of the best spread of side dishes of the Korean restaurants I've been to,but Â there are better places for barbecue. The meat is of good quality and freshness but for some reason it doesn't absorb enough of that charcoal flavor that we sacrifice our clothes for. The servers are very nice but service itself was painfully slow last night.. . This place is worth a try, since most places normally use gas grills instead of charcoal, which results in cleaner but sort of banal flavors of the meat. The cleanliness and modernity of the space is also worthy of mention. I was impressed with the quality of the cuts that are served here, but if you're looking for a good traditional Korean bbq (i.e., marinated shortribs), try Soot Bull Jeep.
