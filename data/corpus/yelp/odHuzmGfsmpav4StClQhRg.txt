Wow, a real experience.  You have to go here.  Basically anything you could want out of a Jewish deli and more.  It's cafeteria style and you slide though the food line and point and pick up whatever your little heart desires.  The potato pancakes are out of this world (and non traditional), plus they have all of the usual suspects done right.. . They have free valet which is a plus considering everything is so enticing that I always end up with a bill upwards of $20.  Considering everything is super reasonable, that is a LOT of food.
