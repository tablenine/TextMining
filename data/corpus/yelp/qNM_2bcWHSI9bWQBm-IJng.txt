Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Went back again for a date night on Friday night. We didn't have reservations but we got seated right away and it was almost 7pm. It was packed but I think we just got lucky!. . It was so crowded that the waitress took forever to get us our drinks / take our order, but she was super sweet and experienced - made us feel like it was OK that she took so long. :). . We had the "pre fixe menu", I went w/ the truffled mac n cheese as the first course and had the chicken as the entree. It was delicious. My other half also had the mac n cheese but had the kobe beef meatballs as the entree and it wasn't as good as my chicken. I think it was a unique dish but the taste wasn't spectacular. Overall though we still LOVE this restaurant because the quality of the food is great, service is professional, and always easy to find parking w/o having to pay over $10 to valet like other restaurants.
