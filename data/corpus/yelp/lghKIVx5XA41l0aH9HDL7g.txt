Yes, five stars. Because it's delicious, but also AFFORDABLE! What, an affordable lunch spot in LA? Yes! Cuban sandwiches, YUM. Potato balls, not healthy, but yummy. Friendly service. Comfortable, well lit seating. And delicious, hot cafe con leches!! When I end up in the valley occasionally, it is a treat to come here!
