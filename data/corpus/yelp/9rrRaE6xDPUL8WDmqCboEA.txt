Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
I make it a point to stop at Canter's each time I visit LA. An LA institution. From an out-of-towner's perspective Canter's is a much needed oasis as one crosses the desert Los Angeles sprawl.. . TIP: As you enter the restaurant look into the glass cases on your left for a display of desserts. It will help you navigate the menu later.. . Worth the stop and a return visit.
