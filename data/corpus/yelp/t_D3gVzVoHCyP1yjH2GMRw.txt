Not impressed. Blue velvet was quite dry and un-flavorful. The frosting was a bit too much and tasted like plain whipped cream. Brownie Sundae anyone? Extremely rich and tasted really 'commercialized.' Nothing special about it. The displays were in fact amazing looking but that's about it. Cute place and location though!
