dude... this place is MAD good.  you'll never feel hungry coming out of this place no matter how hungry you are going in.. . in terms of greek food, this is one of the better places i've been in, but what really kicks it up to five stars for me is the fact that they have a market attached to it!!!  KABOOM!!!  instant hit for me.. . i got the gyro plate, which was yummy... they also have a personally brewed root beer that is tasty and SEVERAL types of beer and other alcohol geared toward your food!!!  . . also, the fact that the eating area is big enough to host a party is an awesome thing.  CAFETERIA STYLE is the way to go!!!  plus... they have a lowly musician playing for change... what more could you want?!?!?!
