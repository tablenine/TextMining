Restaurant: El Azteca
Category: Mexican
So one day, I wanted to go to Fellini's but my friends thought El Azteca would be our destination. Bad choice. The food was gross: the clump of nasty refried beans and the beef in the taco got me sick after. And not to mention that...um...the food from this place actually killed a man. "Eek! Methinks not." is definitely right.
