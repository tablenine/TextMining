Okay, first of all, I'll admit, I have a few friends who work there.... but, moreover, I really like this place!. . Last night was the 2nd time in 2 weeks I was there for dinner on two separate special occasions.. . The food is just exceptional!  The last two times the fish specials were maybe the best prepared fish I have ever had at a restaurant.. Also...Cheese Fritters..(okay, it's really called something a lot more romantic and Italian..) are like little pillows of heaven.  Seriously.. And the salad with the egg on it! (I sound so sophisticated this morning..perhaps a sign that the wine is excellent also). . The brunch is so so ... but I give this 5 stars for the dinners... . The ambiance is cool, the furniture is all rustic and mismatched, the location gives you excellent people watching.  The tin ceilings look beautiful..but cause the place to get a bit loud sometimes... oh and I have yet to wait for a table!
