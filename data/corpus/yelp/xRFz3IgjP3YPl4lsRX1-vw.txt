This isn't pizza, technically. It's flatbread made in a wood-burning oven with toppings much like pizza...but it's not really pizza. No mind, though, because it was pretty darn good.. . There are a lot of things to love here, in addition to the good food. The outdoor seating, the friendly service, the fact that the restaurant is only one of about four different restaurants nationwide to achieve the status of "organic certified" are a few other positives.. . I was a little disappointed that only a few "pizzas" had a tomato based sauce but there are some really interesting combinations so one needs to think outside of the box (what an overused phrase, sorry) when reviewing the choices.. . Small but solid wine and beer list. A nice place to hang with a friend or sweetie on a lovely evening.
