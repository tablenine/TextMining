Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
UG!! I tried to eat lunch with a friend at Tender Greens but it wasn't open yet. We figured Ugo looked good. Boy, we could not have been more wrong. The waiter that took our order was a complete jerk. My friend asked for the grilled vegetable panini and she wanted them to add a piece of salmon. This shouldn't have made the waiter blink, seeing as how they were both already cooked, sitting next to each other in the display case--waiting to be heated up. He faltered for a minute then said 'No, they can't do that. I don't want to ask the cooks to do that because it'll make them mad'. Seriously dude? I didn't ask you to go catch the fish, skip to the Farmer's Market to buy the veggies and then build it from scratch for Christ's sake! . . So my friend said, "okay, no sweat. Just give me some salmon and some mixed veggies please." To which the waiter popped off like he was trying to placate someone that's losing control. When I said he was rude he back tracked and said he was joking. . . So when the food got to us my friend's veggies were cold. And the fish was hot. We asked the waiter about it and he said the grilled veggies were a salad. . . The only reason I gave this place two stars is because my minestrone soup and caprese insalata were pretty good. However, I will never go to this place again.
