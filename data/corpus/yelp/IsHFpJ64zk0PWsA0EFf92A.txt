Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Holy Cow. Milk's ice cream treats are the best I've had since my first taste of Ben &amp; Jerry's. Soy drinkers watch out, Milk's got a brand new bag.. . How are the sandwiches? Who knows. What about the cookies? Um, I don't care. As long as I can eat their HOMEMADE butterfinger ice cream bar, the City of Los Angeles can tow my car while I watch. In fact, I probably wouldn't even notice if they ran over my foot with their overcharging tire on the way. Why would they tow me? Because there is no parking here. It's that impossible area of Hollywood where every side street has a permit and you might have to go rogue and risk a ticket while you run to grab your treat and back to your car.. . Of course, running might be a good idea because you won't be eating light fare here. Don't let the simplistic metal furniture and mention of salads fool you, this place is where diets go to die. . . A word to the wise when ordering:. . Milk is best when served cold. Follow the same rule of thumb when picking a dessert. The ice cream sandwiches, the handmade ice cream bars, the shakes, oh the shakes (Strawberry Shortcake shake, thank you bf for ordering)...I avoid this place when it comes close to summer, because too much from that menu is a prescription for a one-piece swimsuit.
