i don't eat pastrami, but all my friends say it is good.. however, it has the reputation for being amazing, and i never hear that. i think that it lost its edge. all the old timers say it is the best hands down, but they haven't been back in years. i think the bread changed since the old days too. other wise its jsut your average deli that closes at 4pm. lame.
