I love this place. The service is spatacular..followed by an array of eggs scrambled with two cheeses, potatoes, velvety grits, and sweet potato pancakes with a carmelized syrup on top. Need I say more..this place is D-LI-CIOUS! Run..don't walk! Did I mention the space is lofty with brick exposed walls &amp; the smell of yeast baking bread slapping you across your face as you open the door to this jumbo serving red velvet cupcake hideaway!
