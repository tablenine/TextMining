Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I spite Tito's Tacos,. . You spite Tito's too.. . These are awful tacos.. . Find a taco truck near you.. . Give lots of chips to hide the burritos,. . tacos, enchiladas too.... . the only thing that's worse than a Tito's Taco,. . is the queue*. . I say the best rating that this place deserves,. . is two.. . * queue    (kyoo)   . n.   A line of waiting people or vehicles.  Rhythms with too.
