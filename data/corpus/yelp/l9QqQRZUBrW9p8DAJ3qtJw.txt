If you thought Cuban food only existed in Miami, think again. . . Walking by this place, you can't help but be mesmerized by the aroma of fresh Cubano bakery goods. Located down the street from the busy shopping areas of Americana and Galleria, I'd choose this as my top lunch choice over anything else - even that chain Panera Bread across the street. Not just for lunch, but also desserts. They have outdoor seating, which is a plus. . . Here is my list of must-haves:. . - 2 potato balls (a ball of mashed potatoes, meat in the center that is breaded and fried). - Mariquitas (plantain chips, comes w/ Cuban garlic sauce). - Cubano sandwich. - Medianoche sandwich. - Papa Preparada (potato ball sandwich). - Turkey Croissant. - Tuna Croissant. . Desserts. - cheese roll. - guava roll. - plain and chocolate croissant. - pina colada mini cake. - chocolate bundt mini cake. . Drinks. - Dulce de Leche Latte. . Cakes . - Tiramisu cake (had this for my birthday one year and it was heavenly!)
