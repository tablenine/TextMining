Absolutely AMAZING bar.  My review just focuses on the nighttime scene, not the restaurant. . . Very diverse and extensive list of beers -- tons of rare, hard to find Belgian brews and lots of local stuff (MN and IL) too.  Delicious martinis.  . . Intimate setting and decor is one of the coolest I've ever seen.  Both welcoming (open air/windowless) and chic (dimly-lit, back wall is lit up in alternating neon colors, floor and ceiling are black).  Set up like a typical NY bar, like a corridor with a full-length bar and lots of tables.  Sleek-looking colors like an LA/Miami bar but with none of the pretentiousness -- a great mix of people, not just hipsters.. . Would love to come back during the day and try the food!
