I cannot for the life of me imagine why anyone would want to come back to this place.  I'd heard good things about it, so my husband and I went here for dinner one night while we were in the West Loop area.  I will never be back.  Period.  The help here is so slow, it is pathetic.  Although it was crowded, we got a table almost immediately.  But it took so long for our waiter to come to our table.  I chalked that up to them being busy.  But it took another 1/2 hour or so just to get our drinks.  And we both ordered a beer.. . So when our waiter finally did show up to take our order, he mumbled so badly, I couldn't read his lips.  So, because I had a question, I began signing (I'm deaf) to my husband to give to the waiter.  He rolled his eyes at me!  Oh that's it!  I almost left on the spot!  But I heard good things about the food, so we stayed.  Well, my barbecue pork was so salty and the pork was so tough, I couldn't finish it.  This was one of the few places I told my husband "no tip."
