I'm utterly clueless when it comes to vietnamese food, so i can't comment as to the authenticity of these banh mi sandwiches compared to what you might get in ho chi minh. I found the sloppy bao to be very flavorful though. Unfortunately, the result was the most atrocious case of oxtail tha i have EVER suffered. I don't know if it was the m]quality of the meat (basically manwich with curry sauce instead of the bland shit), the combination of the spcies with much alcohol, the latent potency of the spices (i was a vag and got it mild for christ's sake) or a devil's mix of these factors. Â I would SERIOUSLY not advise getting one of these unless you're going to have access to a WC later on. I can only imagine what a **spicy"" sandwich would do.. . Regardless, i still think its a cool little joint. I don't know if its something i could eat very often (maybe you build immunity?) but the sandwiches seem inventive and they're not too pricey. If you have time to sit down and eat the spot is good for people watching as well. I'd definitely like to go back to try the catfish and bbq chicken sandwiches.
