Since my last trip home, I have seen bakeries in New York and Washington, "and nothing compares to you...." (sing that part).  I had the Cuz pick me up some on his way to pick me up from the airport.  I tried the potato balls.  They're pretty good but I'd rather save room for dessert.  When you get stuff to go you don't get the fried plantain chips.  I do like that they have little packages of Tapatio to go though!   Cuz forgot the puff pastries this time and they were out the previous time.  I am on a mission to try those now.  Oh yeah, my parents now make trips to Porto's also...so much for their diets.
