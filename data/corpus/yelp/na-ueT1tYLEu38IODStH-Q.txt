OK -- I wasn't going to review this place b/c there are already soooooooooo many reviews!!  BUT ... I've decided to review it considering I had to give POLLO CAMPERO a negative review.  NOW -- ROSCOE'S .... YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMY!!  The chicken is GREASY and damn CRISPY ... and has the best FLAVOR ever!!! . . I have to say it serves THE BEST COLLARD GREENS I've ever tasted!  and I mean ANYWHERE!!! even down SOUTH (Georgia ....and all those other Southern states...) CANNOT compare to the GREENS here!!!  DEF get an order of them!!  . . Servings are pretty big -- so don't go overboard when you're ordering ... I usually just get a couple chicken ... the greens and GRITS -- which are also tasty!  Can't wait to go back to visit the folks!!! I'll have to stop by Roscoe's on the way there ... :) ... I guess I should start running a couple more miles a week to compensate!  :)
