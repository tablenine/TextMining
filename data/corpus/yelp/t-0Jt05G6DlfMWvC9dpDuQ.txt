Ate there last evening at about 8pm and had to wait about 10 minutes for a seat, which was very reasonable.  I really enjoyed taking the "L" there as well (and I never noticed the rumbling sound of the train).  . . The menu was sort of small, but I suppose it made it easier to pick items when you are waiting in line to place your order.  I had two of the "Sammich's" and two of the sides.  The BBQ Kogi was really tasty.  I tired to wipe up all of the good juice at the bottom of the bowl and I ended up eating some off the paper.  They use these cheap plastic bowls lined with thin paper to serve the food.  I ate some.  I couldn't taste the difference though (is that bad or good).  The Tilapia  "sammich" was tatsy but not as good as the bbq kogi.  . . We had the butternut squash and the brussel sprouts and chorizo as sides.  The squash was ok, but the brussel sprouts were great.  A little on the greasy side, but thats what happens when you mix in Chorizo.. . Didn't try the desserts.  My wife wouldn't let me order the bacon chocolate chip ice cream.  It sounded interesting.  The place is BYOB and the seating can be communal.  The chairs are not comfortable, but i think that is how they get people to turnover the tables.  I'd like to give it 3.5 stars, but i gave it three because I ate the paper.  Is that my fault?
