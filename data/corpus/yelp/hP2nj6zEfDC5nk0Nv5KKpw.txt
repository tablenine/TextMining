the presentation of this place is great. very "white", whichs gives your a sense of freshness. My co worker and I went for dinner and had the following. . Caprese Salad - SUPER delicious. Half Roasted Chicken - tasty but a little dry. Asparagus w/ Fried Egg - very yummy. I definitely reccomend it. eve the waiter said it was a good choice!. . Overall I was very satisfied. Next time I plan on getting some of their pastries. They look very delicious, but i was too full!
