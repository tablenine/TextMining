Okay...seriously, I went back again. This time I ate. And this time I met Ludacris. And this time a champagne was poured on my head from the top balcony.. . The lollipop chicken is the bomb. This is probably the only thing I will eat from there because I am hooked.  Too hooked to try anything else! Ludacris was roaming around. After all it is his place. He was very nice and down to earth. Doesn't mind taking a picture or two either. And yet of course, me and my friends were showered with a broken bottle of champange from the top balcony. The champagne and some glass(yikes) came cascading down on us as we were right below the edge. Ludacris immediately came over and apoligized.  . I have been back. I went to a private party in his party room downstairs. It is quaint...perfect for a small get together...even a nice little area for some DJ equipment. He showed his beautiful face then too.. So I uppppped my stars cause I saw a star. Yep...4 star from me!
