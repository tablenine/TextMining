Ok, the food is pretty good and the wine list is top shelf.  This time the service was pretty good too.  However, our first time they lost our reservation, and the second time they made us wait 90 min past our reservation time.  This visit a bar fight broke out and the police and EMT came.  Some drunk girl was yelling in the bar and glasses were flying.  I will not be back...simply not worth the drama.
