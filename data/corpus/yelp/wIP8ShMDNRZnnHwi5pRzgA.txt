OK. Well, holy cow... there's already 280+ reviews for Canter's on here.. . It was my first time ever. I ordered the mishmosh and it was brought to the table by a waiter with the awesomest beehive I've ever seen. He kept my friends well-hydrated with several rounds of Diet Cokes.. . So yeah, the mishmosh. I've never had a matzo or a matzo ball soup or schmaltz. Who knew it wasn't a gigantic cracker swimming in soup?! The ball--about the size of a baby's head--was more satisfying that a regular meat ball. The fattiness of the chicken essence with the matzo was magical. Magical! I could have fallen asleep right in the booth after finishing off my soup.. . Other things at the table I wish I could have tried (but couldn't because it was a Friday during Lent), were the thick ass sandwiches, knackwurst, and over sized salads. Considering how they never close and maintain a pretty friendly staff, the prices were right in line with what I imagined. It's a pretty good value, if you ask me. . . Next time I come around (which will probably be soon because the Regency Fairfax around the corner has a great Midnight Movie schedule), I'm planning to plant myself in front of the bakery section and try every single cookie and danish in stock! Fat-tastic!
