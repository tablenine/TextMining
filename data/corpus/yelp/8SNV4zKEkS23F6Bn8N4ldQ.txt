Well I guess I can't say too much more than what has been said already.  I went here on a Saturday night with a newbie sushi eater.  The place is usually crowded, but they luckily will take your phone number and let you leave while you wait.  That's basically key for this restaurant since they place is so tiny.  There are quite a few good bars around the area, so it's easy to grab a drink while you wait for them to call.. As with the other reviews, the sushi was extremely good and fresh.  Before our rolls came, we were given a piece of very good salmon to nibble on.  The place has a very good variety of rolls.  I will definitely be back here to try more of the unique rolls.
