Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
I went on a Sunday with a group of girls, a couple bottles of wine and it was a great time. It is a little hipster in the decor, very dim (which does make it hard to see your food, but only a little hard). It's kinda crowded but not in a bad way, just in a get to know your neighbors kind of way. . . The food was great, anything than combines chicken satay and sushi into one restaurant is great by me! The sushi we had was very fresh, inventive, and delicious.  I had the Sunrise roll which was amazing!  One of my friends also got some Thai dishes and those were good.
