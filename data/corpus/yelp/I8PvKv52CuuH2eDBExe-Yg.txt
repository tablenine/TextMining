My girlfriend and I went for brunch, and I have to say that we were both disappointed.  She had the griddlecakes, which were much too dense and tasted like they came from a mix.  The large portioned crab cake benedict fared slightly better, but was much too salty.  The "old-bay" hollondaise seemed to overwhelm everything, taking away from the good flavor of the crabcake.  And the egg on top was fried, not poached.  I don't know how they can get away with calling it a benedict if it's made with a fried egg.  I know it's on the menu as "sunny-side up", and I was willing to try it - but in my opinion it just didn't work.  Poached would have been better.. . Also, the coffee is really dark.  I know it's a personal preference thing, but beware.  You'll have to use a LOT of cream.. . The beignets were delicious and were the highlight of the meal, even though they were admittedly from a mix you can buy at your nearest Jewel.. . Service was rather inattentive.  Nobody came to ask us how our meal was.  If they had, we would have told them that it was unsatisfactory.  Our waitress said nothing when she noticed that two of the three griddlecakes were still on my girlfriend's plate and she didn't want to take them home.. . I don't think I can recommend this place.
