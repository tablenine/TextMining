I like it. Didn't love it but I think it was good. I really liked the salads and also like the flatbread I ate. They are so busy right now which is where I think some of the problem comes in. We waited for 30 minutes for an outside table and then they sat 5 of us at a table for 2 or 3. There wasn't even enough room for our Flatbreads on the table. The server had to bring us extra CHAIRS to put our food on. I mean really!!!. I like the organic thing. I like the cute shirts the servers wear. I didn't like the full length mirror in the toilet stall.
