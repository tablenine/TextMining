We arrived early for our reservation and the bar area was too crowded to get a drink so we went around the corner to Bottle Rocket (which by the way is great.... great service,great selection, great place to go if you arrive early). But this is a review for Fraiche so I digress.. . I had the pork chop with broccolini and polenta. The pork chop and broccolini were FANTASTIC. The polenta's cheese was too overwhelming. It was so wierdly smoky and seemed disjointed from the dish. To emphasize the idea even more that the polenta was an afterthought, it wasn't even served on the same plate, it was put in a separate ramekin.. . The lamb with ricotta gnocchi was nice. However I'd probably try another dish next time. Maybe the snapper or monkfish everyone keeps raving about.. . The strawberry fritters were so good, I kept eating and eating till every bit was gone. The strawberries alone were so sweet and juicy. The fritters were like egg shaped funnel cake donut holes. Yum. . . The server was good. Felt he was trying too hard to seem better than thou every now and then but no matter, he was attentive.
