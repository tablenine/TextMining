Really good, really extensive beer list. I mean really. The kind that takes you a good ten minutes to make your decision. Luckily they offer flights so you can pick 4 or 5 beers to try out for a really good price. . . Food was good too (a lot of interesting sandwiches to choose from). Not great, but definitely good. Mac and cheese was a great side, but the fries were kind of bland. Definitely worth stopping in if you're up for trying a new place during the nice weather that's arriving as they have some great patio seating.
