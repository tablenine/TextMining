Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Friendly service, decent food. The prices are great, and they have family-style eating with live dancing on Thursday nights. Very casual - plastic plates and utensils. The interior feels like you're eating in a mess hall, decorated with images of Greece. Good for dates, children, large groups, friends.
