Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
The first tip off that this is a good eatery is the long long line you will see around 30-45 minutes before they open.  My hint to you is go early, put your name on the list and stroll around Japanese Village; do some shopping, get some snacks to kill the time.  Just make sure you are not late when they call your name or else you'll have to go to the bottom of the list.. . Once you get seated you will find that it was well worth the wait.  The quality of the cuts of beef is magnificent.  Like with Jap. bbq I prefer to eat my cuts as rare as possible for the ultimate flavor.  If you are feeling hungry enough I would go ahead and splurge for an extra serving of beef.  The veggies and noodles are what they are, but the sauce is mighty flavorful.  Just make sure to keep asking for more as it gets dilluted by the broth from the pot.. . This is the best shabu shabu I've had outside the comfort of my own home.  If the long line is scaring you off just remember, good things come to those who wait.
