This place is wayyyyyy overrated. I kept on hearing what a delightfully magical place this was, so we checked it out. I give them credit for being patient to LA crowd of health nuts and letting 'em sub one thing for another, but I found it to be an average breakfast/brunch place.. OK, SO maybe I was a bit harsh or not, so I am adding this tid bit. I decided to stop by there with a friend. I ordered the chocolate french  toast. I was in chocolate coma for 2 days it was so good. On the other my friend had blueberry pancakes and she ended up being sick for 2 days. I guess we gotta have strong stomachs for this place.
