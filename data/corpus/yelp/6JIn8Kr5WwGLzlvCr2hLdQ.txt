I love that I'm within walking distance to this place!  The dessert display alone fills me with happiness and delight when I walk by it.  So pretty and pleasing to the eye!  We ordered Penne Gamber, clam pizza, and portabello fries.  Pasta was very yummy, portabello fries are crave-worthy, and pizza was good but not spectacular.  Acoustics are terrible at this place...no sound dampening so it can get almost jet-engine loud.  Not a first-date kind of place...unless you're there to pick up scrumptious picnic fare for that date.
