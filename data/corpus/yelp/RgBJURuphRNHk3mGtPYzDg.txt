When we came here at night, it was packed, the service suffered a little bit.  The beers, all very good, try the Hefeweizen, my favorite here.  The stouts are also very good if you like it.  I still like the Rock Bottom in Warrenville better.  Can't wait to come in the summer to get on the top patio!
