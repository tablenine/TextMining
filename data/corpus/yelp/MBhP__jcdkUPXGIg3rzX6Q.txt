Kudos to David S for the service on my most recent trip here, in spite of being busy he made us feel like we were important customers! Kudos to CSPP for having a beer-geek night, and showing continued commitment to good beer. Of course who needs any other beer when Flying Dog house beer is $3? And this visit I tried the mushroom on a bun; "Portabella Burger" it was called. Nice. Reminds me of the mushroom steaks I used to eat in Sicily.. The downsides: the room got colder as the night went on as if they turned off the heat. It was too early for that! And this is important: there is a auto-spray device in the toilet that sprays the room with scent occasionally. When I went back to my table, I almost sent back the beer because it tasted soapy. Then I discovered that scent had gotten on my lips. Turn those things off!
