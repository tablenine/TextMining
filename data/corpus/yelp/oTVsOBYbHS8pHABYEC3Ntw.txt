As Jimmy Price from Layer Cake might say, "The food here will make your bollocks tingle." --all without the help of any meat. There isn't really very much I can add to all of the other reviews here. The food is simply amazing, with ingenious flavors. With Green Zebra, I have sampled the triumvirate of Shawn McClain establishments in the city (along with Custom House and Spring), and even without meat, this one far outshone the others. Of particular note were the desserts, which I think easily compete with if not exceed the inventiveness of desserts at Blackbird and MK.
