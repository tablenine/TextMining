Restaurant: Pure Taqueria
Category: Mexican
This is the best authentic Mexican taqueria/street food in our city.  All the owners of those so-called Mexican joints like El Ass-reca and such need to close for the day and head up to Alpharetta to sample what real Mexican food can and should be:  fresh, simple, PURE.. . This place also makes me realize how lacking Tacqeria Del Sol is with their totolatarian service and skimpy portions compared to Pure's simple but plentiful platters (at the same prices).. . Thumbs up to the lofty-chic decor, excellent margaritas, and cute waitstaff. The only negative is parking, but with food this good I'll deal with it.
