Horrible, horrible experience for a friend's birthday. Thoroughly disappointed with food and service and everything.  My best friend is a pizza &amp; steak kinda guy...so this place was perfect - or so we thought. . . Lets start with the food:  I, being health conscious, saw a salad that was listed with potatoes, zucchini, beets, green beans, etc.. what sounded like the works. What did I get? A plate of very bitter arugula piled high with minimal extras. 1/2 a new potato maybe and one beet? It was pretty dreadful. The salmon and steak were fine, but for the price came with not too much - a plate of greens on side, nothing more. The appetizer - fried zucchini was delicious - I will give them that one.. . Service: Now, the bartender and hostess were rude off the bat. A little too cool for school, if you ask me. We get seated and our waiter, who was very nice, had a few other tables + a very large party. How exactly is he suppose to manage all that? He couldn't (who could?) - and the result was us waiting for everything.  Birthday boy got his steak with arugula and wanted potatoes too - we had to wait about 10 minutes just to order those... RESULT: his steak getting cold!  Another bottle of wine? Sure, that will arrive at the end of your meal. Oh, and that birthday dessert you prearranged.. yea, forget about that - you are just getting a bill. WTF!?!?  . . We payed way too much for delicious food,  but mediocre food combinations and HORRIBLE service and attitude. I will never go back or suggest this place!
