Category: Latin American
Only 170 reviews for this location?!  I might as well help it catch up to its sister location.. . Yes, the cheese rolls are incredible, but have you tried their sandwiches?  M-M-M-Mmmmm goooood!  If they took those cheesey goodness out of their bakery, I bet Porto's would still survive solely on the sammiches. . . I had the media noche preparada - juicy pork, ham, croquette, on a sweet roll.  My partner in crime, who shall remain nameless, had a turkey croissant.  We both devoured our sandwiches, only coming up for air a couple of times.. . Following the sandwiches, we tried the flan (ok I confess, I had most of it).  We both agreed it was not as soft as the mexican flan.  Porto's version is very identical to the filipino style.  . . I've found this Porto's easier to access.  Parking is a breeze and the lines aren't as congested as the Glendale location.
