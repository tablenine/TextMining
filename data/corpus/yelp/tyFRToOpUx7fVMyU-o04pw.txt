I have been to Silver Cloud a few times now.  I keep giving it another chance after some time thinking it will get better.  Still, I always end up getting soggy tater tots!  In my opinion the food has been pretty unmemorable, but I have to give this place one additional star for the Thankgiving dinner sandwich.  If you come here I recommend that over the other sandwiches.  I also hear the sloppy joes are the best thing on the menu, but I just can't get myself to order them - traumatized from CPS lunches growing up.
