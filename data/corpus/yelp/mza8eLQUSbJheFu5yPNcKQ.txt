Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
Great idea at the time when you're craving garlic.  Bad idea when you're walking out having consumed WAY too much of it.  The food is good.  The restaurant is interestingly decorated...horrible elevator music is always playing though.  But if you can restrain yourself with the amount of garlic you eat then it's great.  But really, try and restrain yourself...your body will like you better the next day.
