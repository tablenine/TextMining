Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
So a friend told me that we HAD to try Tito's Taco's and we were invited to do so on a Friday night. I appreciated the ample parking and the line wasn't really long, we waited less than 5 minutes. I was super excited to try these infamous taco's but was severely disappointed. What is the attraction! they were plain, flavorless and boring, they tasted like the tacos my mom made when I was a kid. Yes, they are cheap, but you could make the same thing for the same price at home! even the salsa was disgusting, seriously it's pureed tomato liquid with this weird foam on the top, nasty! I also tried the gaucamole which must be prepared the same way as the salsa as it is basically straight avacado in liquid form. The bean and beef burrito's I found to be slightly better than the taco's but still not worth returning for. I just don't get it, my friends really love Tito's, maybe I've become too much of a foodie, (damn you yelp!) but I like real Mexican food, with flavor!
