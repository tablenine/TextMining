I ordered from Deleece through Grubhub for dinner last night.  Delivery took exactly one hour (which is what was promised).  The food was lukewarm but still good.. . I ordered:. Fried chicken - a little greasy but good flavor and not dry - with 2 sides: mashed potatoes (excellent and they give you enough for 3 meals) and mac &amp; chz (very good, a little greasy - not typical mac/chx, spiral noodles in alfredo sauce).  Also ordered an appetizer - fried chz curds which were okay (a little greasy) but came with cocktail sauce (not tomato sauce like I expected).  . . Overall food was okay. I probably won't order delivery from here again - the food wasn't good enough for the price (total ran almost $40).  I may check out the brunch based on other reviews.
