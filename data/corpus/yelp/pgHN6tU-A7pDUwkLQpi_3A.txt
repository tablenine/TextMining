Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Everytime I jump in the car and head to SoCal, I always make it a point to make a stop at Roscoe's.  This time around, I was with friend who's never been so, we went  for breakfast on Saturday 5/16, it was her first time...I was so excited for her to try some good ol' chicken and...waffles!!!. . My usual order:  Country Boy (Three wings with a waffle) and a Sunset (Half Punch/Half Lemonade).  What I like about Roscoe's is that the food is always consistent and the service is always friendly.. . Did she enjoy it?  Yes!. Did I enjoy it?  Always do!. Is it worth the 367 mile drive from NorCal?  It is HELLA worth it!  :D
