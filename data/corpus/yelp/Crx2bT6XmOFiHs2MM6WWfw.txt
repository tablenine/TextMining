my boyfriend lives in brooklyn, so we eat here often. what a gem!! on weekends you may find a long line, but it is really worth it. sometimes you get offered free coffee and something to snack on while you wait.. . the atmosphere is unique and fun. you eat a yummy breakfast, and you get very good service. and free cookies.. . props to the older lady (tom's widow?) who gives you a free lollipop when you leave.
