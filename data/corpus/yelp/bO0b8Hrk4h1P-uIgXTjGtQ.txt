Wow I must have missed something when I had dinner there last night. I definitely loved the $29 pick 3 deal which including a appetizer, main course, and a dessert but I didn't think that it was anything spectacular. The bacon wrapped dates were just that bacon wrapped around a date and put under a broiler. The crabcakes were good but I have definitely had better. The dessert which was a adult version of a ho-ho was the best thing I ate all night. It is byob which was nice and our waitress was great but I would definitely go elsewhere before I went back.
