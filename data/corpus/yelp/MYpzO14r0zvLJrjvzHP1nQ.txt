been looking to try this place out for quite some time, but didn't want to wait with the large crowds. looks like the best time to go is on a weeknight before 7pm. we walked right in with no wait and had a table (it was pretty busy though). . i thought i had explained the setup to my wife, but i guess not. she was pretty confused when the lady next to us started eating out of her "togo" bag. wife thought she must of been pretty hungry not to wait until she got home. when out food arrived in "togo" bags she gave me a look of confusion and said "i though we were going to eat here".  after i about fell out of my chair she figured out the deal and dug in. . . overall great food, its about the cost of a decent sushi dinner. the crab legs were the best and the shrimp was ok. (we tried the whole shebang seasoning, next time i'm thinking it would be better with just butter and garlic).  they were out of crawfish (its out of season) and plan to order about 1-2 pounds a person. . . great event dinner. although for us its too expensive to go more than special occasions.
