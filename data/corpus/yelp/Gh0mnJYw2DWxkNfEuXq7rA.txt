Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
Smoke Daddy is one of those places that makes me want to stop being a vegetarian.  I live right by here and whenever I walk by, I smell the glorious smell of meat cooking and BBQ sauce and I want some ribs.  . . The only thing I ever order is the veggie burger, which is relatively ordinary, the side of cornbread makes it quite special.  Seriously, the cornbread it awesome.  And the BBQ sauce on the burger (and on the side) just makes me smile.  . . I've never really hung out here since I usually just order carry-out, but it looks like a pretty cool place, especially with the live music.
