Great vegetarian dishes and interesting beverages. Sit outside when the weather is nice. . Here are some of my recommendations:. thai watermelon, beets, ravioli, baked goat cheese, spanikopita, corn on the cob, and SLIDERS (add gruyere cheese). . the sake and pear nectar cocktail and the watermelon and fresh mint cocktail are both really good, and they have a small selection of solid beers. the cocktails and beers are a bit pricey but not outrageous.
