Amazing service!  The wait staff here work in teams so you are always having drinks refilled, always having empty plates cleared away, and the plates of food just keep on coming.  It never seemed annoying because they were so stealth about it.  Decent selection of beers on tap, and a few I've never heard of before.  The knowledgeable wait staff will help you make a decision if you need some help.  The "Plates" section of the menu is mostly tapas style.  It was enough food to split between two people.  We ordered the buffalo calamari (good), beef stuffed mushrooms (eh - skip this one), and the hummus (the pita bread is crispy and SWEET! - I recommend starting with this one).  They also had some interesting selections that I will try on my next visit like beef tartare and gazpacho.  There is "free" valet parking too if you need it, but I just parked two blocks away in the residential areas and walked.  Very cool place.  Owned by the Concentrics network which owns a few other amazing restaurants in town.
