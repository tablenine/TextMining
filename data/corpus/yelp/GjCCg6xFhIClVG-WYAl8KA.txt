WOW!!!  They start the table off with different breads, my favorite was the cheese rolls.  Immediately I thought of eating cheez-its, but light and fluffy.. Next you select your appetizers.  Everything at our table was a food share, so we selected alot of things.  I particularly enjoyed the Red Beat salad (first time I have every enjoyed a beat salad!!!). The Zucchini Flowers stuffed with ricotta was FANTASTIC!!!. At this time you order your entree and the side dishes (everything comes al a cart).  The server brings a plate with all the meats they offer, rapped in white napkins. And proceeds to give a brief description of the difference between the meats.  Everything is a show, from the time you enter... . The restaurant layout and decor is a fantastic modern design with large photos of stars "O" Natural in black and white.  I couldn't stop looking around from tables to plates.  It's alot to absorb so be sure to have time to enjoy.. . Back to the food.... Everyone wanted to share. Our table had: Roasted Duck, Roasted whole Chicken / Cobbe Steak / Rib-eye.  I stuck with  tuna tar tar (wonderful) but an appetizer.  Our entire table was wide eyed as everything started to arrive, and as we all started to eat we had a hush... . Our sides consisted of French fries / onion rings/ and mashed potatoes.  I liked both the mashed potatoes and french fries. Perfectly thin cut with perfect seasoning and perfectly crisp.. For desert we ordered the Banana plate (banana cake / banana ice cream) it wasn't banana flavored enough for me or others at the table, but the Baked Alaska was Yummy.. Our servers were on top of everything, never leaving the table un attended.  . We spared no expense and enjoyed the entire evening.  Very pricey but worth every penny.
