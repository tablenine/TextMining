Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
I was skeptical about this restaurant since I am not a big fan of garlic. I tried it with my sister last weekend since everyone says it's good.  It's a fun place to check out if you're looking for something different.  The restaurant is nicely decorated.  Food was ok, and the garlic ice-cream was not bad.
