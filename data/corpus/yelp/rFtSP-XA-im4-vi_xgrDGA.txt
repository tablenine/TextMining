A well decorated and well designed bar serving decent food and beer.  Also, its huge.  But it presents itself as generic and without personality.  I haven't been back in a couple of months and I will probably continue to explore other options in the area.. . 40 Bookmarked places to review, 40 bookmarked places; take one down, pass it around: 39 bookmarked places to review!
