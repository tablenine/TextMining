Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
I met Colleen C here for lunch yesterday, and was intrigued to finally eat at the infamous Duck Walk.  I say "infamous" because the phrase DUCK WALK has become synonymous with my friends as meaning "sneaky or ninja-like."  . . Let me explain:  No matter where you live in the city, they somehow get their menu under your door, in your mailbox, under your bed.  Freakily enough, its probably all of those places right now if you look.  Damn you duck waaaaaallllllllllkkkkkk!. . When I sat down, the waitress flips the menu to the lunch special page and tells me its a really good deal.  10 minutes later, we try to order off it, and she says no- Ummm ok???. . The food breakdown:  Don't be fooled by the pictures on the menu!  They looked so appetizing, but didn't really deliver.  Our veggie egg rolls were really bland, and I've had better (and cheaper) pot stickers.  I was, however, pretty impressed with the crab rangoon.  I (maybe unfairly) judge Chinese/ Thai/ Vietnamese restaurants on their egg rolls and such, so Duck Walk wasn't doin' it for me.. . Fun little tip:  Ask Colleen to show you her tapioca balls.  Quack-Quack.
