Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
So the moment you enter the store, you have 4 or so workers, including the cooks, screaming welcome to you in really loud Japanese.. . What an entrance! And for good reason to! I had the best ramen here I could have possibly had outside of Japan. And i've eaten a lot of ramen. I love how you can customize it in every way to make it just the way you personally like it. So you are pretty much eating a unique bowl of ramen that you and maybe a few other people out of the millions that enjoy this restaurant. My ramen was perfect and extremely tasty for a great affordable price. I thought the service was quick! Definitely come here and try their great customizable ramen! The side dishes weren't too bad either, but they run a little pricey.. . My japanese friend showed me the works, so thanks to his help I was able to pick my ramen quicker. So you have the noodle hardness level, the soup type, meat type, and what kind of toppings you want (can be charged extra for some). With so many ways to enjoy this ramen, you can't go wrong. If you're unsure, you can even check out everything with the cook throwing around the noodles right in front of the customers. Definitely go at least once!
