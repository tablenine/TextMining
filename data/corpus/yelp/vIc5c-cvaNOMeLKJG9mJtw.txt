OK, so there's a very good chance this place is a mob front, but with food this fantastic, you can forgive.  You can also forgive the location smack in the center of Cheshire Bridge's porn stores and stripper nightclubs.  The meal will take forever, but it's not due to a lack of attention.  Just plan to spend a while and talk with your waiter.  the same guys have been there forever so it's worth the personal investment.
