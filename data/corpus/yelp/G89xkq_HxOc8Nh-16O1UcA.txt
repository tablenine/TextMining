This place is simply marvelous ! ! The food is delicious and the people who work there are really friendly and very nice. Their hamburger is AWESOME ! ! ! Their crepes are to die for. The only thing that I can gripe about is their method of getting your drinks. They give you a number and they take the food to you but won't take your drink. You have to wait to pick it up from the counter and it gets BUSY. Other than that this place is the bomb. OH YEAH THE REVIEW FROM ROB .F IS TOTALLY OFF DO NOT BELIEVE HIM, HE IS OBVIOUSLY FULL OF DOO DOO ! ! !
