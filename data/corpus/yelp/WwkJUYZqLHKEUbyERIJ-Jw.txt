this is my absolute favorite favorite!  I've been in LA for 7 years and I still can not get enough of this place!  It's the first place my mom wants to go when she comes to town.....my mama's a very hip mama.  My cousin who's a chef in London, same thing came back to town to visit the second time and it's the only place he asked me to take him.  That's a pretty giant compliment if you ask me.
