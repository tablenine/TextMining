you know you people are going a bit overboard on your reviews seriously. Its like your all extremely hardcore food critics, it amuses me!. . Anyways! Ive been hearing alot of hype from this place and decided to go there one day with my cousin and his friends. I have to say the resturants cleanliness isnt Â that awesome, but just before I sat down i noticed some guy crying and sweating his ass off. Apparently he had that special number 2 which kicked his nuts off. So I was a bit skeptical on taking on the challenge so I got the number 2 Hyper mix with extra pork and some eggs. . . I took 2 sips of the broth and goddang! I felt like I was back in basic training getting hit with CS gas! I started sweating up a storm, and my idiot self decided to wipe my face with the napkin I used to wipe my mouth with and all of a sudden my eyes and face started burning!. . I have to admit the food here isnt great! the cleanliness isnt either but the reason why I gave it a 4 star is because ITS FUN! You come here with your friends and expect to have a good time laughing at each other try to eat the hot spicy bowl of soup and you do! . . So for all you hardcore fake food critics out there, go eat at mcdonalds and have a spoon full of shut the F**k up xD!. . SO FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE THAT HAVENT TRIED IT! JUST GO SEE FOR YOURSELF DONT TAKE ANYONE ELSES WORD FOR IT BUT YOUR OWN AND JUST EXPECT TO HAVE A GOOD OR BAD TIME DEPENDING ON YOU!. . EVERYONE IS JUST AN OPINION UNTIL YOU'VE TRIED IT FOR YOURSELF!
