I love food, but I am definitely not a "foodie".  So when Mr. L and Cougar H. decided to take me to Craft for a birthday dinner, I was a bit apprehensive.  I don't go to places that are "star" rated, hell, I am usually eating at places that barely get a "B" posted on the front door. . . With that being said, my Craft experience was as pleasurable as it was memorable.  The restaurant itself is very elegant.  You can totally see this place as power lunch/dinner central, where agents are getting there ,"negotiate on."  As for the food, I can honestly say it was very good.  Granted, my taste in food might is anything but sophisticated (think super fries @ Alberto's), even I can tell the food was something special.. . The three of us decided to select the tasting menu, so we can get acquainted with the entire spectrum of the menu.  For all but one course, it was all good.  From the sea urchin to asparagus to the beef cheeks to the halibut, everything was downright tasty.  It was all about the combination of flavors and textures.  The foie gras was sick! I've never eaten anything that rich and flavorful. It was off the hook.  Like I said before, the beef cheeks were delicious as was the skirt steak. Oh and before I forget, the vanilla sorbet was the sh-t!  I could've easily ate a gallon of it, but I probably couldn't afford too.  As my adventure into the world of gourmet dining begins, Craft was an excellent starting point.
