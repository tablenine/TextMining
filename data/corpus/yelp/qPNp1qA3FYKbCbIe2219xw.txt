The banh mi at Baoguette is outstanding.  I've tried the classic, the sloppy bao and the grilled pork but I think the classic is still my favorite.  I love the crunch of the pickled vegetables and the sweetness of the pork.  The grilled pork chop sandwich is pretty good too if you want something more substantial - the pork chop is tender and juicy and the fried egg just adds that extra oomph.  . . I've tried their phos before but didn't think any of them were anything special except for the spicy beef belly.  The broth was definitely the most flavorful and rich (probably the five spice) and the beef was closer to the type of beef that you would find in a chinese beef stew noodle soup.  There were also chunky pieces of carrots and turnip in it.  It's actually not very spicy but I guess that's what sriracha is for... And at $8 you got your money's worth because it comes with a ton of beef.
