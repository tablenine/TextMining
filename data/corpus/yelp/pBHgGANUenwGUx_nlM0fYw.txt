YOU MUST GO HERE! . . This is like the heaven of all bakeries. They have a huge selection of baked goods, cakes, and sandwiches. If you need a birthday cake, this is THE place to go. They decorate everything to perfection! What I like most about their cakes is their level of sweetness. It has just the right amount of sweetness. If you haven't tried their strawberry shortcake, you are missing out. I think God created this cake... . . PARKING: Free parking lot right next to the shop. Might get packed depending on the time of day, but you will definitely find parking. . . WAIT: I waited in line for about 10 minutes to place cake, potato ball, and cheese roll order, but I think I needed more time since I needed more time to pick and choose! There are so many great options! . . PRICE: Not bad at all. You can buy a strawberry shortcake, 4 potato balls, 4 cheese rolls for about 25 bucks. Â The cakes are about 18 bucks on average, but it is so worth it. You can definitely feed at least ten people with a cake. . . IF YOU LOVE BAKED DELICIOUSNESS, YOU NEED TO GO HERE! THIS WILL FULFILL YOUR LIFE!
