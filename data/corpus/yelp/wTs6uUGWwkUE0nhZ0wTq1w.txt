Restaurant: Native Foods
Category: Vegan
Native foods has really stepped it up a notch.. Not only have they acquired the empty store front right next door, but they have taken full advantage with the area and added cute "cruelty free" boutique merchandise for sale as well.. Now I can shop for vegan shoes and handbags while I wait for my vegan to go orders - I feel so green.. An updated menu that includes a seitan french dip sandwich with au jus dipping sauce has me drooling and jonesing for Native foods way more than ever before.
