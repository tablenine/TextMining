This is the best Thai in Atlanta. There is nothing on the menu that is bad. I always order the Pad Thai and the chicken soup. Wonderful friendly owner that always says hello when you are dining. It is a little more pricey than your normal Thai Place. I wish they could work a deal with building management to validate parking. I am lucky to work in the area so I walk here. I feel guilty asking friends to meet me here if they have to pay high parking fees at Colony Square. If you are going to an event at the Alliance, check this place out for a pre-theater meal.
