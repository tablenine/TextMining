I AM ADDICTED TO JERRY'S VEGGIE BURGER!. . I have had many veggie burgers in Chicago and this one tops all of them. I usually get mine on the pretzel bun with all the fixings!. . Why so good?. Fresh veggies: eggplant + shallots + peas + corn + cauliflower + black beans + carrots and more! / not mushy and not super dry! / not another frozen garden burger! / eat half and save the half for tomorrow / tastes great cold - kinda like a cold slice of pizza!. . There have been a few times where I have ordered my beloved veggie burger and Jerry's was out. OH NO - what should I order!? Still do not have a backup plan... Anyways, I guess they make ~12 a day, so you know they are fresh. I am assuming they have upped their veggie prep recently...haven't encountered a veggie burgerless Jerry's in awhile. . . OO, and they have a great beer menu with flights and pitchers! . . Thank you Jerry's for your AMAZING veggie burger!
