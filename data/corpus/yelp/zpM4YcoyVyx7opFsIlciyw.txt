I have only been here late at night and only for dessert.  With that said, it is a quite charming little place.  They have the perfect garden setting (like everyone else has mentioned).  Beautiful fairy lights glistening in a canopy of trees.  I would call this the perfect little date spot for wacking any girl over the head with a powerful sugar overdose.  I just wish their cakes and desserts were more subtle in both look and taste.  Other than the princess cake, most of the cakes look frosted with Play-Doh.  Whatever, I totally judge books by the cover.  At least you get a fatty slice for your money.  I would recommend washing it all down with a swig of soy lattee goodness, but sadly, I recall my drink smelling like burnt tires.  Still, I'm positive pregnant chicks must dig this place.  So, date pregnant chicks and bring them here.
