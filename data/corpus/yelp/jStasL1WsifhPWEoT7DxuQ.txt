Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The one time I did go there, there was a long wait. I found the crowd to be rather annoying and the waitresses only added to my annoyance. They were pretty rude and abrupt. Most Asian establishments have servers who barely give you the time of day. Once you order and they bring your food that's it. This place was like that. I don't remember anything in particular that was good or that I would be able to recommend. Everything was so-so. Since it started in Taipei, Taiwan I was thinking that the workers would be Taiwanese but they were all Mainland Chinese. That kind of takes away from the authenticity of it all but who am I to judge.
