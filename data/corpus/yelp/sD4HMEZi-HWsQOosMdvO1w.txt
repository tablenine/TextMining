Being one of the few places you can get fugu (blowfish) in the US, I had to make a stop at Bond Street on a recent trip to NYC. The place is trendy and had lots of creative dishes passing through the dining room.. . As usual dishes are rated 1 - 10, 10 being amazing.. . $14 Cocktail (5). decent drinks, nothing special.. . $10 Tuna, Blue Cheese (9). Sounds crazy, but I loved it. They take chunks of tuna and marinate it in Â a blue cheese sauce for three days. . . $18 Fugu (3). I was expecting that tingling novacaine initiation into the Fugu club, but it just tasted like a regular piece of sushi.. . $48 Tessa ( Fugu Sashimi) (2). Well, I'll just spend another $48 to get a whole plate of this stuff. But, it was just as boring, what a rip off. I think you need to get this stuff fresh in Japan to get the tingle.. . I gave the place a high rating because everything else passing the dining room looked great.
