Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I knew what I was getting into being a vegetarian going into a place claiming to have Chicken &amp; Waffles: my dinner was going to be coffee.. . Imagine my surprise when I found they served Waffles on their own (granted, it's a bit of a given, but I make no assumptions). And that they're fantastic, with hints of cinnamon and easily ripped apart and dunked in the restaurant's dual shot glasses of syrup.. . I can say nothing about the chicken, but if it Roscoe decided to establish a House of Waffles (and not a Waffle House) he'd have been just fine.
