Ooohh when that yellow blood in my veins rage with hunger I start to crave strange things like shaved ice w/ peanuts, red beans and condensed milk. Every so often I crave the minced pork, pork chops, and sour pickles on rice. How about the Taiwanese gooey meatballs or the oyster pancake omelet? Absolutely delicious.. . You're probably thinking "WTF is this Dave guy talking about?". . It's the yellow blood talking.  This review is solely for my peops. The fried tofu eating, thousand year old egg smelling, full moon cake eating Chinese fellers.  Raise your fists, stay true, and march on!. . Down to Sinbala that is, because their food is derishuz!
