Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
A landmark that offers good specialty hot dogs.  My favorite is the spicy Chicago polish dog with cheese.  There are so many different combinations and variety - "a heart attack in a bun.". . Fries and onion rings are a bit greasy but good for those after midnight feedings.  Expect a line - for me average wait is about 30 minutes on any given weekend.
