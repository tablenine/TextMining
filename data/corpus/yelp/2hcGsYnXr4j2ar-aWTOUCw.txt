service is top-notch (seriously, these people know what they are doing!) and thet were incredibly sweet to us with our lil person in tow. Upon walking in to the big cozy dining room, we were promptly guided to the 'best spot' to sit with a  highchair. . . coffee there puts starbucks to shame (their brew is dreck in comparison!) and our mishmosh, sandwiches, and pickles arrived in short order. My only regret is not having an extra bowl of mish mosh just for me!!! The noodles and matzo ball disappeared quickly into the ravenously hungry little man's tummy. . the bagel chips were the perfect accompaniment and popular with us all..... . their cole slaw is nothing short of perfect in my book, the blend of sweet/salty/creamy/peppery is unmistakable. If I lived in the area i'd go back just for that.. . no.... wait. I lie. The baked goods!!!! always amazing..... Cookies, cakes, hamentaschen (those triangle cooky thingies)..... O! They are a joy to behold and eat! (and prices? Divine.) . . the bakery man was so sweet, the lil diner was signing "more" as we were paying for the goodies... and when I mentioned he enjoyed the bagel chips, he handed us a big sample of some to take home!!!. . popular with locals and tourists alike, I'd say this is an absolute must for almost anyone visiting the area... family and child friendly is a huge bonus! . . be aware, it can get busy on weekends. We were there on a tuesday morning.  . . I'm hungry again already!
