The food is very yummy. However, waiting in line for almost--if not more--than an hour is a TAD bit discouraging to eat at this creative and very modern take of tacos. PLUS, another half hour to an hour wait for the food.... ahhh. The wait to order and to get the food would range from an hour and a half to two! Best to go in summer because waiting for the food in the cold is horrible.... . YOU MUSTMUSTMUSTMUST be at the location early to be in front of the LONNNNGGG line. I always order the short rib tacos!!! They're delicious! I tried the short rib burrito and it did not ring happy bells on my taste buds. I'm not a big kimchi fan, but my boyfriend tried it and he said it was okay.. . You can track down their next location spots by going on their website:. KOGIBBQ.COM
