This is the best hot dog period...I don't even live in the area anymore and as soon as we land at O'hare we are Gene &amp; Judes bound...I've been eating here since I was I think 3 years old and I still have'nt found another hot dog that compares...and for those who list it as a 3 star or below must of bumped there heads before they ate...can't wait for my next trip back
