I've now been to Sushi Gen at least ten times.  Although it's not amazing, it is certainly one of the most consistent and reasonable sushi bars in LA.  And that, in my opinion, makes it unique.. . There are too many sushi bars to count now.  But I can say, Sushi Gen is one place where you'll always find a good variety of fish, good/very good quality of fish, and reasonable prices.  This last time, I had tai with lemon juice and salt (very good belly cut) , kanpachi (tail end cut - not my fave), tako, iwashi, aji, marinated sanma (not my fave - I really like this fresh while it's in season during the fall, but I was glad to see they had it), akami (bluefin) and two types of toro - one slice each of Canadian chu-toro and Boston o-toro.  The Boston o-toro was unbelievable.  Although a little sinewy because it was real o-toro from the center of the belly, the meat had the this unbelievable firm, yet fatty and rich texture that I haven't had in a long time.  . . This is why you go to Sushi Gen.  Although they sometimes have Yellowfin Tuna, they almost always have Bigeye or Bluefin.  And the tuna is high quality.  While you can go to many other places to get the same farm raised fishes (i.e. east coast fluke aka hirame, salmon, hamachi), Sushi Gen has the real stuff.. . P.S. - All of this for about $40, including soup to end.
