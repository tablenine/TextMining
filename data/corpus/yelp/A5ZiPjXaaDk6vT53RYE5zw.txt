First of all, if a crazy hobo in Silverlake that looks like the Mad Hatter doing crane kicks tells you to go THERE for the Kogi taco truck....don't go THERE. Stay where you are. . . So maybe I was negatively influenced by the rain and cold we had to endure for an hour and a half (which would've been only a half if the taco truck wasn't an hour late). I was so hungry that they could've served me old Korean socks in a tortilla and I would've scarfed it down. Well played Kogi.... . Anyway, we ordered short rib &amp; chicken tacos, kimchi quesadillas and a short rib burrito. They were out of Spicy Pork, supposedly the best, so add that to bad weather and their tardiness. Tacos were OK - you'll like them if you like the flavor of Korean BBQ marinade, but the tortillas are nothing special. Kimchi in the 'dillas were kind of crisp, not as soft as I'm use to but adding melted cheese to it is money. I ate the short rib burrito the next day at 5am and it was good. Then again, I like anything with rice, eggs and meat in it.. . Would I make the effort to find them again? Probably not, unless I was walking around and they were randomly there...and there was no line...at all.
