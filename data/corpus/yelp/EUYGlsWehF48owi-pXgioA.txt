Each time I pass this place, I wonder how it stays in business right next to Piece. Now I know! They're open at all hours of the night during the weekend.. . I'm a more "late night hot dog or taco" type person....so pizza after 11pm really crosses my radar. After a night filled with a bit of dancing and drinks, my friend was adamant that we get late night pizza. Where? I asked...we only have Flash Taco &amp; Arturos...where can we get pizza at like 2am on a Saturday? Piece is closed. . . This Boystown wonder walked me to Santullo's. Wow, I hung my head in shame...I've lived in the area for a little over 2 years, and I had NO idea this place was opened late...and I pass it almost every day!. . My friend ordered bc I was staking out the booths and immediately plopped myself down in one when one opened. Therefore...I have nothing to say about the service. We did have to ask the ppl next to us for Parmesan tho...our container was empty.. . I guess this is like NY style pizza? We got 3 pieces of sausage. Wow...huge slices. Did I double mine over and eat it like a proper person from Brooklyn? No....I ate with a knife and fork. Hey...don't judge. The pizza was decent. The crust could have been a bit thicker, with a bit more cheese...but I guess that takes away from Santullo's style. And...the grease...wow, lots of grease. Yes, I will be back again to cure a potential hangover....after all, late night pizza is hard to resist, especially in Wicker Park......and I do need to move away from the hot dog thing....wait, which is less fattening?
