They don't need yet another review telling you how amazing they are.  So, I'll just warn you, an order of pancakes is more than enough for three people.  You want to eat them all, because they are truly delicious (no strange baking soda aftertaste, great fillers, fantastic batter, and a myriad of options, etc.)  They arrive looking like a 3 layer birthday cake and there is simply no way to eat an order alone.. Tasty.  The french toast is less impossible to finish, although it is still quite a large portion.  The original F.Toast is also wonderful with great texture and oh so tasty.  Weekdays are pretty easy for seating, but weekends can be impossible.
