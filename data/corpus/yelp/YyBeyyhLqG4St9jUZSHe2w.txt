This place was delightful. . . The restaurant is beautifully decorated,. but it is not the place for a truly romantic meal. The tables are so close together that it feels less awkward to just make friends with your neighbors.. . The service was efficient, and effective. They were not particularly friendly though. . . Our food was amazing. When we go to a new place we try lots of dishes. Â The scallion pancakes w/mango curry and the moo shu were table favorites. We also had spinach and soy cheese wontons, sauteed spinach w/ orange and cashews, and yam and yucca fries. Nothing disappointed! . . The flavors were so well balanced, that I (a salt guzzling sodium hound) did not ask for salt!!. . Almost everything is totally vegan, and they are very accommodating of food allergies.
