Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
The raves Philippe gets, are at best sentimental, rather than rooted in fact. Guess these hacks brought  the "au jus" sandwiches to America, or even invented them outright. What an abomination. . . In France nobody would consider serving a limp bread roll that had been  tossed (acidentally, as the Philippe' lore goes - and hat would make sense) into roast drippings to humans. Ever! But in this chow hall with the charm of a Greyhound Bus terminal it is the main attraction.  . . There is a lot to be said for the fine "gele" you can make from cold pan juices (the "jus"). Put them on a nice crunchy baguette, with some sliced cold meat(s) and you have a rather fine sandwich.  . . However, the Philippe style of soaking a roll that had the consistency of mitigated noodles to begin with, in thin salty roast juice and slapping some barely edible meat from unspeakable parts of various critters on it, is simply cruelty on a plate and looks, feels and teastes - to borrow a phrase from the fabulous Dan Neil - "like throwing up in reverse". (Chapeau!)
