We went here on a quiet Monday at 6:30 pm. I was very hungry and expecting a pub, albeit a "gastropub," not a wine bar. I guess I assumed they would make food a priority. Do not come here hungry, period. It's a wine bar with tasty, expensive nibbles, but that's about it. The food tasted fine,  but entrees are pricey and Husby would have needed about 3 of them to fill up. The decor is kind of cool-looking, but so what?  The clientele is 100% as Matt L, puts it, "white people in their 30s wearing expensive jeans." All that said, the experience would've been okay, had the bartender had any interest in helping us. He would take our order, then walk to the other end of the bar and chat with his friends, serve a drink here or there, then ten minutes later wander casually over and ask us if he had "taken our drink order or not."? Ugh. I guess I realized that Bucktown was already pretty far up its own a**, but I still wanted to give a new place a chance. Don't bother with this place. And a very special *suck it* goes to Time Out for writing it up as a place that actually serves decent portions of food versus wine and cheese. Even a "gastropub" should have draft beer, right? Call me unsophisticated, but Bluebird, I just don't get you.
