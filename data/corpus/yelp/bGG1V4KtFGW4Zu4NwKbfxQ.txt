Category: Burgers
One of the best burgers in LA.  Closed Mondays, but open late the rest of the week.  The wait for a stool at the u-shaped counter can be long and even harrowing.  You'll have to choose a side of the room to wait, and some stool sharks will hop into an open seat even if they arrived after you.  . . But the real reason I keep coming back is the pie.  Apple, boysenberry, and banana cream are my favorites.  Sometimes they offer strawberry, peach, pecan, chocolate.  Pie and coffee at Apple Pan; that's good stuff!
