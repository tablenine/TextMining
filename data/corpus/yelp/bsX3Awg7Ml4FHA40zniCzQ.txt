Anthony Kiedis is stalking me. Or maybe I'm stalking him. Regardless, I see him every time I'm here. And, let me tell you, he looks pretty good for 43. . . But that has nothing to do with Real Food Daily, which is just as yummy as Anthony Kiedis. This place is delicious and so healthy feeling that you can reward yourself with one of their oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. I'm a fan of the RFT burger and the Stir It Up. Yum. Vegan Goodness.
