Yummy food, friendly service, and right next to the beach!  I can't wait to come here more often!  My favorite dish for breakfast is definitely the Potatoes Del Riego- this is potatoes, cheddar cheese, bacon, with avocado and sour cream on top.  I add an additional sunny side up egg, and this is enough for two meals!
