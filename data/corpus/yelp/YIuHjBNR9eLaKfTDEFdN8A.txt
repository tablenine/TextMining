Restaurant: Across the Street
Category: Mexican
I like to judge Mexican restaurants by their chips and salsa and Across the Street just has a so-so offering. Their queso with corn is pretty tasty though, but way overpriced. It was like $6 bucks for a cup.. . The main dishes were also a bit disappointing. I got excited because they have chilaquiles covered with mole as a specialty of the house, but it failed. I picked brisket as my meat and it was too fatty and my portion wasn't very big. Also, the mole wasn't the best I've ever had... My friend complained about the brisket she was served and the jalapeno mac 'n cheese was also nothing special. The only complement came about the tacos and I hear they have an all-you-can-eat taco night on Wednesday, so that's probably worth coming back for. . . The service was good, so nothing to complain about there. I did find it strange that this place didn't have a computerized ordering and payment system. That made paying for the meal a little more time-consuming.
