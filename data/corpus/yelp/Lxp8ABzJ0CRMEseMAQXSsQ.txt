Dined here on New Years for my anniversary with my boyfriend of one year and really enjoyed the experience and food.  Naha flavors were fresh and innovative, but not over the top; very northern Cali like.  . . I saw Carrie perform a cooking demonstration and liked the way she worked with regular food, but offered a fresh take; although not trying overly hard.  I started with scallops seared in a vanilla bean sauce; although I did taste a little grit; so there was a bit of sand left (hence my 4 stars).  Main course I went with the whitefish with capers and a lemon sauce.  My boyfriend went with pairing of pork belly, quail and quail egg; it was a great combination.  I think he out ordered me; which I hate it when that happens.  The highlight for me was the cheese tray; 8 cheese with from local farms and I loved talked about it all night.
