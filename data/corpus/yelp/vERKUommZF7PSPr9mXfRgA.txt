Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
I have only had the delivery from Duck Walk. It was fast, but nothing really special. The tofu wasn't cooked right and just tasted soggy and bland. Â It is pretty well priced compared to other places in the area, but you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, there is just too much competition for this type of restaurant in the area-if it isn't extraordinary, its not worth giving a second shot.
