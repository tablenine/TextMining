Restaurant: Varasano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
The food was fabulous as always but we were SUPER DISAPPOINTED with the service!! We have been going to Varasano's since they opened and can remember when we were one of three tables in the restaurant. Our server was pathetic and inattentive and we watched the table next to us turn over THREE times because they were never approached by a server. The table behind us waited so long for their food without being checked on by their server that they asked for their pizza to go. I don't know what happened to this place but they have lost two regulars who have been talking this restaurant up for months!
