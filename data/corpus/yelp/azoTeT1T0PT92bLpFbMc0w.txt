5 stars is not enough for this place!!!. . My friends and I went to Sura last night for dinner and it was exceptional!  Our server (Kay? I dont know if it was Kate) was AMAZING!  She was very pleasant and recommended the "Sex on the Moon" roll which I instantly wanted to get because of the name.  About half way through our meal the Manager came over and talked to us for a while giving us more attention than I ever have received in a restaurant which was really refreshing from some of the places in this neighborhood.  He did everything in the world to entertain us including the MOON WALK! It was AWESOME!!!!  I cant believe he could actually do it.  After that I was SOLD that this place rocked.  But, as if that was not enough as we were walking out a scruffy bartender (kind of looked like Abe Lincoln) caught us at the door and did shots with us!  Something called a red demon i think.  Best shot I have had in a while.. . I love this place!
