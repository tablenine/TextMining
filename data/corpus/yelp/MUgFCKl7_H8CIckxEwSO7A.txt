Buy a steak and cook it the way you want. This is commercial style steak at its norm. Not worst. Not best. But don't be fooled by the over-production. It's okay, but go the Ralphs or Gristedes and buy the steak and cook it the way you want it at home. Save the money; save the grief. Enjoy life without them! Problem- ordered the Porterhouse for Two - medium to medium well. I asked, "Will the chef do it?" Answer, "Of course. He can do whatever you want." Wrong. Mistake. Showed the manger, who agreed, that this is the wrong kind of cut to go that far. I know, I shouldn't be eating expensive steak like this over medium. However, if you ever read about the bugs in even the best cuts...Should have gotten a butterflied filet or New York.
