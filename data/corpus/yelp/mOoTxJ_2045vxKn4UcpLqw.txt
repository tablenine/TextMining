Though the menu is extensive, the food offering isnt as exciting as we hoped. The green beans in garlic is good, the fried chowmein noodles were good, the spicey chicken &amp; cantonese fried chicken were both good, but the dim-sum is limited and didnt taste fresh or very exciting . I was disappointed when the server informed us there was a max of 2 "anniversary" priced lobsters per table, our table had 8 folks!
