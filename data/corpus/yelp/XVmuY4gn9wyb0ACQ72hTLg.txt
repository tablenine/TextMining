Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This was our second try on attempting to eat at Toast.  We went Sunday morning at 11 and once again, the wait was hour fifteen.  Fortunately, the cute boutiques were open to kill the time and we were able to get seated in 40 minutes; next to the bathroom.  We were rushed to order from the not so friendly waitress.  We ordered the veggie eggs benedict and the french toast orgy.  . . Food:  Veggie Eggs Benedict:  Great hollandaise sauce.  Probably because anything mixed with truffle oil is delicious.  But nothing special.  The egg was definitely over poached and the potatoes were soggy.  The French Toast Orgy - which was a mix of strawberry , chocolate, and marscapone stuffed french toast with yogurt and granola and fruit on top.    Sounds delicious and looks scrumptous - but unfortunately was nothing special.  You would expect french toast to be stuffed with chocolate, strawberry, and marscapone.  However, 1) It didn't really look like french toast, but more of a oversized soggy swiss roll and 2) wasn't really stuffed, but a strawberry flavored french toast, a marscapone flavored french toast, etc.  and finally 3) didn't have that much flavor.  . . Service:  The waitress wasn't friendly as previously mentioned since she pretty much demanded our order although we weren't ready.  The bus boys were friendly and filled my coffee promptly without asking and boxed our soggy french toast without much complaint.  . . Atmosphere:  Tiny as flip especially since we sat next to the bathroom!  It was also loud, crowded, and claustrophobic.. . Overall:  I cannot believe I tried to come here twice and was willing to wait an hour fifteen minutes to eat something so disappointing!  There are several brunch places with a less wait time and better quality food (Meli Cafe, Bongo Room, etc). . .
