I wanted to give 4 stars, but there were two things which are hard to forgive (first impressions meaning everything, ya know). . 1) The bathroom sucked.  There was only one (the other was broken).  There was always a long line.  AND when I finally made it in there... it was gross.  Next time, hold it.. 2) They were out of pineapple.  I saw a sandwich with pork &amp; pineapple and got really excited... but then the waiter came back and told me they were out.  I freakin love pineapple,  and don't like to be teased. . . Despite those factors... I loved Bossa Nova.  SOOOOO many things to choose from, all sounding delicious.  Plus dining al fresco.  . . Fix the bathroom, get some pineapples,  and I'll be back.
