I had high hopes for this place, but I have to admit (sadly) that I left disappointed. The food was quite good, with the exception of the squash and bacon dumplings that tasted strangely like lemon cleaner. Several of the noodle dishes were ordered at my table and they all were cooked well.. Unfortunately the service was absolutely abysmal. I understand the counter service idea, and communal tables are great as well. However, I do not like feeling as though I am bothering the staff with my presence. From the get go, staff was dismissive and the cashier was rude when asked a single simple question regarding portion size. Â Also, there was absolutely no where to put our coats and purses so they we were forced to put them on the floor already soaked by boots and shoes. The staff also had no qualms about placing my bag of leftovers directly in a puddle on the floor next to my seat. . I was thoroughly embarrassed to have recommended this place as a night out for us all.
