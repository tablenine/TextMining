I have always wanted to go to the Magic Castle.  I heard it was an experience you have to have in Los Angeles. . . I would agree that it was an experience.. . Mullets.  Big, old, boobs squeezed into undersized dresses...bad meat...poor service...and such bad magic.. . Oh, but at least I got to wait in line and pay a cover charge of $25.00.  . . To be fair, I think magicians, and I'm generalizing, are weird folk.  I rank dedicated magicians up there with mimes and clowns.  Just bizarre.  I know it takes talent, but I just want to punch em in the face and take their lunch money.  . . I will say that up until the WORST show I have ever sat through I did have fun with my friends...but I would save a few hundred bucks and go to a nice happy hour instead.
