My fianc√© and I came here for dinner the other night. The restaurant is cute and comfy, and the food was pretty good. We both had the steak which was pretty good, but the portions were really small. We usually never order appetizers since we can barely finish our dinner, but at this restaurant you definitely need appetizers. Our meal was the steak and mashed potatoes and we were still hungry--even after dessert (FYI: dessert was pretty damn good). . . On our next trip we will probably try the chicken pot pie, but we will be sure to order soup and perhaps an appetizer.
