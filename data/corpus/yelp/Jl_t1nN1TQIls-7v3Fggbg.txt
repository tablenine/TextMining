I went here for dinner on a Friday evening with some co-workers.... . Walking in, the place was absolutely packed.  We had a party of 15 or 16 and reservations, but we ended up waiting for what must have been an hour+.  We crammed into the bar, standing in the aisle right at the entrance and most likely causing a fire hazard.  It was definitely loud - If you weren't standing next to me, I would barely hear you.  . . Despite the unfortunate beginning, I had a great evening with my co-workers because, well, we're a fun group.  People have complained (it seems) about the display of steak cuts and seafood that they show to every table.  We didn't have any problems (no raw meat juice flowing all over etc...) but as I said, none of us really understood anything the waiter said.  We ordered a one lobster tail for the 6 of us to share and each got our own steaks - our version of surf n turf.  You should go here to try the steak.  I got the rib-eye which was delicious.  It was absolutely amazing - best steak I've had.  Cooked well, seasoned well.  This place would definitely be 5 stars if they put the rest of their act together.  It is expensive, and it is definitely loud, but when you're eating you kind of forget all of that.  . . The crowd is definitely the epitome of the "Viagra Triangle".  It was primarily filled w/ young to middle-age professionals who wanted to act rich and powerful.  I feel bad for the wives of some of these men who think it's okay to go out and take off their ring or for the future wives of some men who don't seem to have matured much from their college days.  . . All in all, I had really wonderful food.  If you have really excellent company and a whole evening to waste, then come here for sure.
