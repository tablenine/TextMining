My wife and I went there in June of 2004 (days before we got married) and LOVED it. I can't remember what I had then, but I know I loved it.. . We went again on New Years Eve this year (12/31/2009) with friends. 3 couples total. Our experience was not the same.. . I had:. 2 Mojitos. Ox-tail Empenadas. Beef short ribs. Bacon-infused creme brulle. . The mojitos were very fizzy. I joked later that I thought they were like 7-up with leaves in them. I did order 2 of them even though the first was not good. I thought the first one HAD to have been a mistake. It wasn't - the second one was just as bad. I don't like to make a fuss, so I drank the drinks and enjoyed the company.. . I should mention that there was a pre-fixed menu for New Years. I think there were 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and 2 desserts.. . Portions were on the smaller side, but the empenadas were good. But nothing to get excited about.. . The short ribs were also just fine. They weren't bad or good, I just didn't get that excited about any of this food.. . The dessert was really interesting. It was a chocolate creme brule infused with bacon. And it had a TON of bacon flavor. It was really really fun. I *would* render a complaint on the chocolate quality of the dish. It seemed rinky-dink for such an experimental thing. Overall, the dessert was delicious, but didn't meet it's full potential, so it was still kind of a letdown.. . Long story short - I didn't like it. I will likely not go back to Coobah. But I won't fight it if someone else really wants to go.
