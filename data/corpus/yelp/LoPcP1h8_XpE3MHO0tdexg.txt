So the pancakes are ridiculous. The other reviews have established that. When we left, I saw a man sorting through the trash looking for recyclables to add to his shopping cart of cans, so I thought I'd ask him if he was hungry, He was, so I felt slightly less badly about wasting all that money, a styrofoam to go container, and so much food.  If I went back, I'd order the French toast with Nutella (which is what Kathy ordered) or the tacos that Justin ordered.. . We were curious about the chili, so we took one to go. It was the garlic chicken one, which was way too expensive for the portion size (we got the cup for like 8 bucks) but it was odd and strangely addictive. And the fresh chips that came with it were yummy.. . The coffee is also very expensive but worth it-- French press right there at the table and tasty.. . A note about the waitlist: don't mess with the guy running the wait. He will call your name once, and if you don't answer immediately, you're dead to him (his words, not mine).. . We didn't hear him call "Kathy for three" and someone else pretended to be us, so when we asked if we were soon, he said, "I just sat Kathy for three" and when we assured him we were the Kathy party, he actually went to the table to kick the imposters out. They had already ordered, so he let them stay, but he was not pleased. They got us in right away at the counter. I wish I could have dealt with the wait at Applebee's like that! There is no ass-kissing at the Griddle. . . I found myself watching a tall drink of water in a Notre Dame cap serving some of the outdoor tables. I hope he's a wanna-be actor and that he makes it, just so I can watch him again one day.
