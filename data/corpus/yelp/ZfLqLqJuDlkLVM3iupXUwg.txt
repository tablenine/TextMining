Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Outside the nostalgia involved with the place.. there is nothing compelling for you to go here and wait an hr for a hot dog??. . I lived just down the street a couple of years ago, and i can honestly say that I never even went once... . Its cool to come here late nite on a Monday to indulge in a bacon dog butg other than that, there are other spots to hit up when lookin for a late nite food fix.
