We seriously love this place. The prices are very reasonable and the food is authentic and tasty. We usually share the crepe (I don't know the actual names) for an appetizer, and then get vermicelli salad. My wife gets the tofu one with the rolls (which she loves) and I get the lemon-grass steak salad. . . You may have a hard time spotting it, it doesn't have a sign anywhere on the building or the street, so heads up (it's next to a Thai restaurant).
