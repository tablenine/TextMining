Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
It's somewhat pissy and childish of me to write a review just because I wanted it to be a bad review. Let's face it, Titos sucks. It really does.. . It's one of those weird LA phenomena that tricks everybody into thinking they are on to something just because the line is long. And the line is long because everybody thinks everyone else in line is on to something. It's a grease pit catch 22. . . The taco shells are deep fried, the meat is far to greasy and the burritos are not much better than the crap you'd get at the school cafeteria. Has anyone here actually been to Mexico and had an authentic taco?? This isn't even close to that. This is LA late night grease that's made to satisfy and pacify. . . Stay away from this. If you really need to have the cultural experience...fine, it's worth trying once. Oh yeah...it's cheap.
