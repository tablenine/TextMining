5 stars for the $15 pitchers of house margaritas alone. Incredible value and you can actually taste the tequila. The tacos are great and everything is so customizable(that's a word right?). Plus I always have great service at this location. I usually spend a good hour-2 hours there everytime I go. You can definately order some chips and salsa/margaritas and hang out without feeling pressure to keep ordering or leave. Super friendly.
