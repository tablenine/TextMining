Restaurant: Hand in Hand
Category: Pubs
Hand in Hand may sound like a church service club, but it's actually a fun bar in the Highlands. This dark, medium-sized, over-priced pub is always crowded. If you want a table you must arrive ultra early, or obnoxiously swarm around the tables waiting for a group to leave. I prefer neither, choosing to circle the bar with friends. The patrons here are exceptionally outgoing. Thus, Hand in Hand is conducive to meeting people while hanging out with friends. Â As for the food, I've been here dozens of times and have never even seen an entree being served. I' m guessing the kitchen closes early and doesn't offer anything special. This is a cool location, and it's not hard to find parking in the area. I recommend this bar for a night out.
