5 stars for the BAKERY.. . I stop here every time I am in the area for pastries which are unrivaled. You can get a box and fill it up with all kinds of random goodies and none of them will disappoint. Great for business meetings, friends or just to have around the house for breakfast or dessert!!!. . Lunch here is decent with some interesting twists and hidden gems (try the meat stuffed dough ball) but overall average lunch. . . Split a sandwich combo and save room for some pastries!
