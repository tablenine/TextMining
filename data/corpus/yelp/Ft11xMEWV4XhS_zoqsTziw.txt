Restaurant: Front Page News
Category: Cajun/Creole
Let's start with the biggest positives. Front Page News has a nice patio and fountain. In fact, without the patio I wouldn't even stop by. I've spent a number of early Sunday afternoons chilling, reading a paper and drinking a couple of beers. Also on Sundays, they have a band until 4 or 4:30pm and a bloody mary bar. The staff is friendly but I consider the food average. It's worth a visit. I here that late weekends it can get interesting too. It would make a good addition to a bar hop, but I'm not certain I would want to camp out there for hours.
