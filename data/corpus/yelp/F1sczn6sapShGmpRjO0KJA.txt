I still don't know how I feel about this place.. . I went there a little while back and it was interesting. We sat outdoors and I felt like they sort of forgot about us at times. The caesar dressing was more of an italian dressing than a legit caesar. I had a chicken caesar salad which was sort of meh, the lettuce got soggy as if the caesar dressing was left on it for a while before my chicken was ready. The chicken was average, not fantastic but far from bad.. . The people I were with had the frito pie which they loved, I didn't try any because it looked like a heart attack waiting to happen.. . I'll probably try this place again, I've heard good things about their burgers.
