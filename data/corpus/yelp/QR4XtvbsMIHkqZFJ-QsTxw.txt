Fabulous orzo/eggs breakfast and super yummy white peach tea. Great atmosphere with satisfying jazz playing overhead, the warm colors and wood tables/chairs. Staff is friendly and pressure free while I lounge with my book. (Thx for the rec Lance!). . Went back again and had the amazing Blu Jam Benedict and super scrumptious Chocolate Monkey hot tea. Highly recommended!!!  This was my favorite combo.. . Actually went back a third time.... the crepe was good but I would rather order the other stuff on the menu... it's so much better.
