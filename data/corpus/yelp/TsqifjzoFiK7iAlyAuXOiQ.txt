Restaurant: Green Sprout
Category: Vegetarian
Green Sprout is really tasty, healthy vegetarian Chinese fare in a convenient location. The menu is varied, and most items are dairy and egg free, or can be modified so that they are. I'm pretty sure that the mock meats are made in-house as they're different from any I've ever had elsewhere. (I do wish there was a little more "meat" in each dish, as it seems a little sparse.). . A lot of vegetarian Chinese tends to be pretty greasy, and I don't think that's the case here. (The lo mein is a little more so than some of the other dishes I've tried, but I think that's to be expected.). . The service at Green Sprout is friendly and attentive, and the servers are happy to offer suggestions, which can be helpful since the menu is quite extensive. (That said, I do think they tend to offer the more expensive chef's specials. I haven't been to Green Sprout often enough to know if that's definitely the case, and it if's merited, which it very well may be.). . Lunch specials here aren't very much discounted and I think come with a soup, but not an app. Still, nice to save a couple of dollars. Either way, prices here are certainly reasonable and the food is great. I'm a big fan.
