Restaurant: La CrÃªperie
Category: French
You just can't go wrong here. La Creperie has delicious crepes of all kinds from sweet to savory. Today I ordered the ham crepe (with swiss) - the good ol' stand by if you're in the mood for savory. . . My friend ordered the strawberry crepe with vanilla ice cream - another great stand by. Mmmmm!. . Yeah, we both chose to be safe and simple, but their bourguignon is wonderful if you're in the mood for a heartier crepe.. . The ambiance is super cute - and yep, it did remind me of being in Paris at cute little crepe cafe.
