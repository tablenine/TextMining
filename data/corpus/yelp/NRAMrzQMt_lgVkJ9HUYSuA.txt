I decided to get the Creme de la Cream  which was two french toast with Sugar crumbs and cheesecake creme.  The maple syrup compliments the french toast well.  My dad being a huevo Rancheros fan, ordered the "Tequila Sunrise".  The french pressed coffee is a must.  I look forward to my next visit at the Griddle Cafe.. . (Arrive early to await the line)
