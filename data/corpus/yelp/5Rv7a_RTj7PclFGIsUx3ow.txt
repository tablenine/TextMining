Wife and I had a wonderful meal there last night - I'd strongly encourage it to anyone interested in an upscale technique/Southern flavors type meal.  It absolutely holds its own with Miller Union, Watershed, etc., but isn't as well known or as hot, so should be easier to get into.    . . The summary - the service was excellent (albeit a little slow), the food was perfectly prepared, and the price was strong but not awful.  Several seasonal options on the menu, from apps and entrees to sides (the fried okra is wonderful at the moment), and we were both very pleased with everything we ate.  Didn't try dessert, but only because we were full.
