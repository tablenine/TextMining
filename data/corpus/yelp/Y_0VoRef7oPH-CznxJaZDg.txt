Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
Went out with my gf and her cousins for tapas, since spanish was the only thing we could all agree on. I'm glad we did. The restaurant was pretty comfortable inside, there were a lot of people there enjoying the night. One complaint I kinda had was the fact that the atmosphere was a little too loud, and you needed to talk pretty loud so the person next to you could hear... but on with the compliments.. . The place is well priced for tapas, and byob free corkage is awesome. There is a wine store next door if you're waiting for a table that has some decent bottles. Â I ordered gazpacho, the house cured meat, chicken with some coriander sauce and paella. My gf and I split all this, and were very full. I was surprised at how large their portions are, since some tapas bars really skimp and I end up spending like 80 for a dinner of 2 and still leave hungry, but this place had me very much satisfied. All the dishes, minus the meats, were nicely prepared and delicious. The chorizo that they served in the paella and meat dish on bread/garlic was a little too tough and chewy. I also was expecting jamon serrano with the meat dish, not chorizo.. . Overall: The food was very good, byob free corkage, and nice atmosphere made this place a success, but the service was lagging a lil for most of the night.... but then again it was near closing on a friday night.
