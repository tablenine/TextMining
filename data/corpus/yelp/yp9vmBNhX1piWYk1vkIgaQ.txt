I pretty much started this Yelp account so I could write a bad review on R. Thomas.  Food quality seems questionable, is certainly unnecessarily priced and to be seated in plastic lawn chairs?  Service is virtually non-existent.  . Certainly some good menu items and it is so nice to have a place open serving at any time.  . This place has been open for decades?  Not much like it in Atlanta.  Seriously, this place is laughable.
