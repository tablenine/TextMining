Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
I was really impressed by the quality of the food. I tried the Pad Curry Noodles with Tofu, my wife had the Yellow Curry with Chicken, and one of my friends had Pineapple fried rice with shrimp.. . My dish was outstanding. I was a little concerned by how the vegetarian appetizers were bunched in a small area with vegetarian entrees, but the noodles were so good I didn't care. It's so rare that I shy away from cream curries and peanut sauces, but I can't recommend my new dish more.. . My wife got the chicken version of my tofu staple at Thai places- and she loved it. She doesn't like what peanuts do to yellow curry, and this is one of the few places that doesn't combine them. . . My friend who got the pineapple fried rice, well, his eyes bugged out as he was served an entire sideways pineapple, hollowed out and stuffed with food. We looked around the restaurant and notice other folks were drinking out of whole coconuts, the bottoms cut so they can stand freely.. . This place has a ton of charm- and yes, they have so many quirky dishes it will make your head spin. A large sign announced "Yes, we have Fried Worms! (Caterpillars)" . . It would be a surefire 5 stars, but it is tiny and the service was painfully slow. I'd let that slide, but we did sit and have our water refilled twice, something like 20 minutes before anyone even took our order. And before I could let it pass from memory, a couple in the booth next to us left in a huff without ordering. I'd definately avoid on a weekend night.
