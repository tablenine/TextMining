Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
I've been to Uncle Julio's a few times, always as part of a group and both on weeknights and weekends, and it's always the same story: crowded, loud, and distracted service (note: they are distracted, not inattentive, which would not be accurate).. . Ultimately, this place is a chain restaurant that's trying to pass itself (and it's frozen margaritas) off as something a little fancier. Â It's not bad, but it's not great either.
