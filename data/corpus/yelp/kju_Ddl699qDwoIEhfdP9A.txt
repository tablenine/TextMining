Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Joys . . Is a staple of Lake-view. Very affordably price food, great for dinner and lunch. The lunch special provides an egg roll, and won tons. Everything on the menu is above par for the price. The wait staff is very nice, and the setting and atmosphere is pretty friendly. Would definitely recommend. As its BYOB, bring a bottle of wine, and have a good time.
