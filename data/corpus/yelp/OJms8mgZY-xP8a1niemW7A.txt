Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I really do not know what all the hype is about...been going here for many years when I have company in town...and only then because they have heard about this place and it seems to be a must see for them.  . They boil their hot dogs!  The only true way is grilled, I think.. Anyway, go if you want to wait in long lines and are hoping to see a "star"...I have never seen one there myself...nor do I care!
