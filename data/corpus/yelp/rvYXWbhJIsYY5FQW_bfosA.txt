This place has become a hit and miss lately. I would say on most occasions this place is quite delicious and has one of the best ramen in Los Angeles. The broth is thick and full of flavor. Add a little garlic sauce to it and you're good to go. There's also the koeterri (I think I spelled that wrong) that you can add to your broth. It makes a bit more fatty, but to tell you the truth, I can barely taste the different (just makes it a bit more lip smacking good). The ramen noodles is probably the weakest part. It's just your average noodle. I've had better noodles at Mitsuwa food market (not a diss on Daikokuya's noodles, just saying there are better noodles out there).. . The sides meals that come with the combo are tasty, nothing to write home about, but if you're extra hungry and want a little variety with your ramen, it's good enough to order.. . The service is average at best. They're usually trying to hustle people out because the lines are so long. There are times you may have to wait a hour to sit down, but the usual is 30 minutes.
