Just thinking about Canton House makes me wish I had a plate of their shrimp dumplings right now.  My friend loves their turnip cakes and the eggplant is pretty good.  You can't leave this place without having some of their mango pudding.. .  The only thing about this place is that it's so big the carts sometimes take a little while to make rounds.  This place draws an interesting crowd and the people watching is pretty fun to keep you occupied while waiting for carts.
