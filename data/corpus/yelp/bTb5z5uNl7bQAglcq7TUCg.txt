I get a craving for Versailles from time to time, and today was one of those times.  I haven't been to Versailles in about 2 years (there isn't a Versailles where I live now).  I've always loved the atmosphere there.  Family-friendly, casual, and fun.  The servers there are always very friendly and attentive.  They also have a really good sense of humor.  They are always the type to joke around and are very light-hearted.  . . The first change I noticed today was the prices.  They have gone up.  I am not sure when the prices went up, but it went up quit a bit.  I was a bit surprised.  Despite the rise in prices, the food was as good as usual.  I always order the RABO ENCENDIDO (my favorite Cuban dish) with a refreshing iced cold IRONBEER.    It was as good as I remembered.  The ox tail fell off the bone and the stew was saucy and flavorful.  Perfect to eat with white steamed rice.  I tried some of my sister's Garlic Chicken and that is also just as good as I remembered, too.  Nice and tasty and juicy.  You must be a big fan of garlic to eat that dish, because they do not hold back on the garlic.  Not the kind of dish you would order if you were on date :).  . . Although the prices have changed, the food quality definitely has not changed.  I would definitely continue to come here for their rabo encendido.  I've been to several Cuban places and Versailles is still my all time favorite Cuban restaurant.  We also used go to the one in Manhanttan Beach, too.  Both provide good quality food.. . The parking lot at the Venice location is small and the spaces are tight, so try to carpool or take the smaller car :).
