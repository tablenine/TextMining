It's delicious and has the best cheese bread I've had. It's really expensive compared to the other churrascaria restaurants. I went during LA restaurant week so it was way cheaper and included dessert. The great thing is they'll bring you the meat the way you like it cooked. At most other churrascaria's, you have the take the meat overcooked. Not here. If it was overdone, I asked for medium rare and the server would come with a new hunk of meat. If you want to try this place and the price is keeping you away. Wait until LA Â restaurant week.
