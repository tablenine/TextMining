Bob San is the best sushi place I have been in Chicago thus far. I had a great meal last night of a salmon with avacado roll and a salmon with cucumber roll. It was delicious and fresh, and the salmon was reasonably priced. I am drooling just thinking about it! Our waitress was great and attentive and at the end of your meal they bring you a fresh cut orange that you get to eat with toothpicks as a little refresher. MMMM!. . But the REAL reason you have to go to Bob San is to check out their interior decorating and the sinks in the women's bathroom (I don't know if the same sinks are in the men's bathroom because my husband refused to check it out since he said just going in there to look around would be weird.) Apparently their influence is sperm and red blood cells? There are big white drops hanging from the ceiling and sticking out of the wall, and then there are red blobby lights everywhere. The sink was like a giant hollowed-out kidney that you stick your hands into with a confusing spigot. I felt like I was Dennis Quaid in Innerspace and had been injected into someone to explore their insides.. . I loved Bob San, we are definitely going back when we want some quick sushi and to be entertained by the weird decor!
