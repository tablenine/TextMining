Nice atmosphere/ambience, extremely fast service!. . We had the baby beets, wrapped dates &amp; dried meats on bread, all of which were not too expensive and very yummy. My favorite was definitely the bacon wrapped dates.. . I like the bring your own wine thing a lot, we didn't know though, so we had to go next door to the little store where they sell it (owned by the same people...strange), my friend said the wine there was a little expensive.. . Things I didn't especially like: you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom, and I probably would have liked this place less if I had to sit in a different place (it's a little cramped). . but all in all, I'll definitely go back.
