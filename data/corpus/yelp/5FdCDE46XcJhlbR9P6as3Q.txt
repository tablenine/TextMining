The best sushi I've ever had.  Love the restaurant because it's so authentic and a hole-in-the-wall.  You would never see this place or know about it unless someone referred you.  Place gets crowded to expect a wait.. . I usually like to list my favorite dishes in my Yelp reviews but everything here is good.. . I think they're also known for their iced green teas.  I noticed a lot of people drinking it when I was there.  I just got the hot though and it was good.
