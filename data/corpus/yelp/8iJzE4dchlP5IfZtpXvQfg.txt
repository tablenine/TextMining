I think a lot of the reviews have been a tad unfair to this cozy establishment.  For one, their portions are kind of amazing.  It's true that their food doesn't quite stand out but I figure if you're looking for exotic fare with extra servings of, I don't know, arugulla, you'd be better off looking elsewhere.  I just came back after trying their chili dog, which happened to be a chili CHEESE dog  (looks like my reading classes are paying off!), which could be what one might expect from a chili cheese dog.  It was kind of bold for them to use a flavorful sausage, considering that other places tend to use fairly bland sausages to make a point that the sausage serve more of a vehicle for the crazy blend of spices they call their chili (ahem, Pink's, I'm looking your way).  Not only that but it came with a side of fries coming out to a little over $6.  . . The reason this place doesn't get a five is solely for the fact that I don't think it's possible for anything to earn that rating, especially a restaurant.  I sat at the bar which was nice, there was no overbearing sense of exclusivity filling the air as I had initially feared, and it's most certainly a number of notches above the Sysco-tot'n likes of Denny's.  . . Perhaps I'll change my tune once I frequent some of the more higher-tiered places and pull in the dough to cover the costs, but for now, Fred 62 does it at a really good price with the type of restaurant chatter soundtrack I'm a sucker for.
