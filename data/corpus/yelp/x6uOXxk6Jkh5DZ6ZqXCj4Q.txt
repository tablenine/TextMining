Must bump it up to 5-stars! This has become my go-to Thai place in the neighborhood. I mostly do take out and the food is always excellent. Â The Tiger Cry and the Miang Sa Wan (dried pork) appetizers are incredible. The Tom Yum and Tom Kha sups are awesome. All of the curries we've tried have been delicious. I highly recommend the Panang, Green and Red curries. The Khao Soy noodles are one of my favorites. I like spicy food, but "medium" is plenty spicy at this place (can't even imagine what "very spicy" would be like). Prices are very reasonable and they have never screwed up our order. Highly recommended!
