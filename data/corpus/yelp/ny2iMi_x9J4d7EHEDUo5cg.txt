It was kind of crowded for a Wednesday night but we were seated quickly as they greeted me with "Mr." . The staff is easy on the eyes and there is always someone coming around to make sure is everything okay. . the open dining area with the 20 ft ceilings make it look huge. . It does get pretty loud but it doesn't take anything away from any intimacy. . We had the pizza bianco and fettucini belmondo with rosemary potatoes and garlic spinach sides. The pizza was perfectly crispy and the combination of cheeses made it savory. We ended with the dessert selection of berries and cream and the fresh cream was worth the preparation time for it. . They have a large wine selection and a nice bar area near the entrance. . This place gets 5 stars easily!
