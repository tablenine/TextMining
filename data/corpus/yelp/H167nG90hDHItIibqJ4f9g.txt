Meat heaven.   Thats pretty much what this place is.  The house special fillet minion is awesome.  Its like melt in your mouth goodness.  The rib eye is also awesome.  Bacon wrapped steak?  Heck ya.  Also got the strawberry cheesecake that was massive and delicious.  Honesty i felt like i was going to roll out of the restaurant after this all you can eat meat extravaganza.  Only down side was the price.  For dinner me it came out to about 80 dollars a person.  But on the plus side.  lots and lots of meat.  Great place to go for a special occasion but not somewhere i would visit frequently.
