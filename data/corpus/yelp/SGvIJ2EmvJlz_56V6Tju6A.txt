My first foray into Korean food, and it was intimidating! First the super huge wait lining out the door, then sitting down at the table to stare at a menu that was complete gibberish to me. Luckily my friend and her boyfriend were old hats at Korean and explained some things to me. After calming down I realized I was thinking way too hard.. . Overall I was happy with the experience. I wouldn't get the same dish again, because it was ice old, but super spicy and those two just don't mesh with me. . . Also, next time I'm going to bring beer. We had wine, and my class kept getting grease splattered into it from the grill on the table. Ew.
