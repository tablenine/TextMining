Okay, I have to admit Yelp was right about this one.  It deserves three stars.  Go here for the atmosphere.  It's a cool spot to hang out.  It's kind of dark and there's a lot of red everywhere.  . . i was a quite disappointed with the food.  I should have listened to Yelp and not my cousin whe raved about how good the food was here.  My friend and I had the black cod and 3 other sushi rolls. The black cod smelled a little fishy.  It tasted okay.  I've had way better black cod in San Francisco.  The rolls didn't stand out.   Four dishes for about $70 barely put a dent in our appetite.  It was an appetizer.  But then again, we already knew we were going to stop by Pink's Hot Dogs afterwards.  . . Service was pretty bad.  I would have expected better in Hollywood for this kind of restaurant.  . . After dinner, I went upstairs to take a picture with a girl dressed up in a geisha outfit who was walking around mingling with the guests.  Upstairs was pretty cool.  They have a private dining table enclosed in glass.  This would be nice for a little private party.  They also had a few slightly more formal booths with nicer light fixtures than downstairs.. . If you want good sushi, go somewhere else.
