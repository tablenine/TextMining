I'm diggin' on this place, the neighborhood in general, so my review is a little biased, I'd say...Still, we ordered mainly Nigiri (which was fresh) and . enjoyed the kinda funky drink menu. Avoided the sushi rolls because I can't stand mayo w/ sushi, but the names of the rolls were cute and I'm a sucker for that stuff. Didn't try it this time, but there's a drink involving wasabi...I'm working up the gumption to try it next time around. Great way to end a night at the Castleberry Art Stroll. Cheers!
