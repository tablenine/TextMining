No reservations allowed, but we were seated automatically at a table for two on a Saturday night.. . The rigatoni with mozzarella di bufala and zucchini in cherry sauce was a light dish, and I first thought the pasta was a little bit undercooked. It got better though (and no, no wine involved). The dish was really well proportioned, and I ended up savoring every bite. . . Friend had a meatier dish with tagliatelle (I think). I had a bite or two - delicious. . . By the way, I could have just their bread basket and aromatic evoo for dinner alone.
