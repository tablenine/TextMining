Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Shanghai-style dumplings.... -also features buns, soups and noodles.. . i live ~45 mins from arcadia, and im the type of person who will drive miles and miles JUST to HAVE GOOD FOOD.... . prices are bit over rated, otherwise, i approve... . . $7 for these teeny weeny suckers????? o, COME ON! i hear these lil suckers are less than $2 in taipai... aiyaaa..... . fine, i admit, they are superly yummay ... but they didn't blow my mind.. . here are several words that just fill my mind whenever i think of din tai fung... juicy, tasty, a MAJOR tease .... . . the line is seriously a "shoot me" line.... the best advice i can really give you is to SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY start thinking about what you want to order while you wait... TRUST ME ON THIS.. . is it really worth waiting in the line? ehhh... Â but at least i can check it off my list... NEXT TIME, i'm going to buy a ticket out to asia and stuff my big fat belly with these tiny dumplings...
