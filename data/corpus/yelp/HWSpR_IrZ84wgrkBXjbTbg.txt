=). -wonderful ambiance. I was watching the Olympics while waiting for food, but boy if the walls could speak.. The paintings and decor were beautiful and full of life. Tree pots were filled with potpourri (although that is a bit on the eccentric side).. -pizza choice: potato gold pizza. and save the crust for last. I'd probably go back just for this one pizza. The appetizer tried (potato skins, to go with our pizza theme) was nice and average.. -Being able to see the chef handle that pizza dough with his hands, from our table. Of course, not everyone would be able to get a view, but just the fact that the cooking was public is a good plus.. -Personally, I like a place with a clean restroom. The women's restroom for this place was really pretty and gave it that extra bonus "yay" point for me.. . =(. -hmm. i'll have to think about this.
