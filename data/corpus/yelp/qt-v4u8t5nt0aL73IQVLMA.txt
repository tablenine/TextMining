Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
"Every lil step I take. You will be there. Every lil step I make, we'll be together...". . Din Tai Fung Dumpling House, you'll now be apart of my life with "every lil step I take." . . Took it back to the old skool cuz Bobby Brown knew what he was talkin about! It was my first time here after a friend had mentioned that Din Tai Fung was THE place to get one of the best dumplings in the area. So who am I to stop myself from tasting the goodness?!. . I was impressed by the contemporary decor as I stepped right in and was greeted with a smile from the friendly hostess as I mentioned that I'd like to place my order to go. . . I ordered my friend's recommended dish Xiao Long Bao (Juicy Pork Dumpling - 10/pcs for $7.25) and Shrimp &amp; Pork Shiaomai (recommended by one of the staff - 10/pcs for $9). As I bit into one Xiao Long Bao, my taste buds were met with a surge of juiciness. The Shrimp &amp; Pork Shiaomai was equally tasty. Love the soy/vinegar and ginger dip and I appreciated the instructions on "How to eat a dumpling" on the chopstick wrapper. Big shout out to the Dumpling Makers behind the glass dome who were quite entertaining as I waited for my order.
