Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
(Actually a 2.5 rating). . Not really sure why this place is so raved for. I tend to agree with most of the lack luster reviewers on here about Pink's.. . So, I ate here w/ my gf after a night out, we were both drunk so hot dogs sounded perfect. We had just left the club / lounge at Standard Hotel and realized we were literally only 3-4 mins away from Pink's.. . If there had been a huge line for this place (as there usually is), I would've givin this place a 1-2 rating. But for the fact that we literally walked right up with only 2-3 people before us, helped.. . The hot dogs weren't terrible, but just OK -- not bad you know.. . Again, I would never really wait an hour to eat these though, as some people have............only to disappointingly arrive at the same verdict as mine -- but with an hour wait. Damn I'm sure you feel like a moron, sorry.. . Anyways.... . Not bad, but just a name brand more than a 'stellar' hot dog. I would only go try these if you see the line down to a 5 min. wait.
