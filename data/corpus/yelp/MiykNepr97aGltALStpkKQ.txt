Absolutely Delicious! I order the shrimp stroganoff, white rice and black beans with a side of plantains and was in heaven :) The wait staff was very friendly and we were seated right away, and promptly offered a glass of sangria. I like their style! Their menu has a nice offering of Brazilian fare as well as some american-ized items (pizza) and plently of entrees and side dishes. I would definitely go back!
