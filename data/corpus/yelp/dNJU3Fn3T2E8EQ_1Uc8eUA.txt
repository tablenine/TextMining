Restaurant: Pure Taqueria - Inman Park
Category: Mexican
The one star is due to the spattering of decent Tequila.. . The food is pretty much not worthy of review. Flavorless, unappealing, un-authentic. What a shame. The location may be accursed. Grape was a travesty in wine. Pure is a sham in Mexican food.. . Tacos are a mess in the wrong tortillas. Beans flavorless. Rice a mush of blandness. Meats under-seasoned. . . Ceviche had too much citrus, too little heat, and not macerated long enough to tenderize, or perhaps just really lousy quality to begin with.. . And exactly what is Mexican about lump crab fritters with bland "avo" mayonnaise and SWEET AND SOUR chili? Really?. . Please. Taqueria del Sol is rather dull, but at least they try harder. . . Salsas were average. Chips were alright. . . Abandon. All. Interest.
