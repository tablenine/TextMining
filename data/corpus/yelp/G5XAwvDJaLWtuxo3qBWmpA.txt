Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
I give a slight edge to Bollini's in monterey park as the best pizza in. Los Angeles. This place is a near second place as best pizza. In terms of value, you can't beat Bollini's, but original toppings, Mozza is. the best. It's sort of a toss up between the two. I guess it comes down. to mood. If you want an exotic pizza with nifty toppings come to Mozza,. if you want a more traditional well made pizza that's also cheaper, go. to Bollini's.
