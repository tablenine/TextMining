We were in the area, but I really went because what I had heard about this tres leches cake (photos at . http://livetonibble.bl.... ). To act somewhat normal, I fought the urge to eat dessert first and got some tacos to start.. . They were fine. The ingredients seemed fresh, but neither the duck nor the fish stood out. Of course, I am spoiled by what can be found for less than a dollar on Buford highway. These are competent for their Decatur location.. . Now back to the cake. In short, it was good, even bordering very good, if I haven't already tried the fluffy and creamy slice at Tierra. But in comparison, the frosting was a bit denser than the dreamy marshmallowy mound on the Tierra cake and tasted a bit frigid from the refrigerator. Maybe it has been sitting for a while and lost it's youthful lightness. Maybe what I really need to do is to try both cakes back to back. Now that's a good thought.
