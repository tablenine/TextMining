No reservations = long waits = crowded waiting area. All I have to say is that if you're going to go with a big party expect a minimal of an hour and a half of wait. If you're desperate they would shorten your wait by packing a party of 10 into table for 6 (No joke).. . Only reason why I come here is cause they have Hoegaarden. It's a beer pronouced (Who-Gar-Den) a must try. Besides that, the food is decent. Not the best but the big portions get you full. Service isn't up to par but it's not exactly the worst I've seen.. . They enforce a few obsurd rules, however, that I'm very much displeased about. If you dance they will tell you to stop stating, "We can't allow dancing, because we don't have a dancing license." Someone call the dancing police?? If you fall asleep or doze off they will immediately ask you to leave. Better not come tired, even if you aren't drinking.
