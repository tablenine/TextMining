Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Unbelievably good fish tacos.  These kill those at Seite Mares.  Lightly breaded, perfectly fried and the best fix-ins bar.  I came here when the stand first opened and the owner showed me the proper way to dress up a fish taco.  Start with the green avocado salsa, then some red salsa (the mad mango is bomb), a little radish relish, then the cabbage then the cream.  I try to come here once a week.  Grab some Pacifico from the Cap N' Cork nextdoor and enjoy your tacos outside.
