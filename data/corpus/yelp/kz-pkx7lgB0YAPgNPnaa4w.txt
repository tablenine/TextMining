love gloria's, it always hits the spot!. the tortilla soup is one of the best i've ever had, simply a must.. the taquitos are great. the one appetizer with the seafood (it's like a seafood cocktail/ceviche(but everything is cooked)) is OFF THE CHAIN!!!! so fresh, so yummy! . . and please don't forget the sangria!. . the portions are big, the price is right, and the service is always on point. some of the nicest around.. definitely hit this spot up!. shout outs to chicoooo!
