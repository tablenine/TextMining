Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
this is review only for the restaurant side and not the wine bar side.. . the wait was pretty long.  the girl quoted us about 10 minutes and it took about 20 or more. she told us we could wait inside by the bar but it was very cramped and i felt like i was hovering over people's food (which made me more hungry). . . the bread was unimpressive. cold and obviously not fresh.  maybe some people care about the bread, i know i do.  . . i ordered the risotto, which was excellent but it was a special so i don't think it's available anytime.  overall, the experience was just average for a price that should've demanded more.
