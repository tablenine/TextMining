Gluten free Mondays!  Thank you, Chef David!  Fish taco's with mango salsa-yum!  Reuben-yum!  Gluten free brew for those in our house who have to be gluten free- tasted like a good ipa, gluten or not!  The cask &amp; scotch ale were exactly on style and delicious!  Chocolate flourless cake for her desert so good she forgot to save me a 2nd bite!  Now that's a local, organic, gastropub!
