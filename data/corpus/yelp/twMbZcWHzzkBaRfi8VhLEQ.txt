In May we visited Langers, the center of the food universe. This family business since 1947  may have the best hand sliced pastrami in America period. (I got that from David Sax.) They have sold over 4 million pounds. . From the original store's  12 seats, to its current location (135 seats) since 1968 the food and décor remains the same.  Owner, Manager Norm Langer says," I try to pride myself by putting out the same product today as my dad did 63 years ago.. The greatest food there is: hot, hot, hot pastrami from a location where, not only do they make it great, but they do it by hand. It's a lost art. Flavor, mmm... love it! The baked fresh bread looks fantastic. Where else in Southern California can you get manna from heaven.. People come from all across the world for the famous 19. It's got Swiss cheese, cold slaw, pastrami (of course) and it's on Rye bread cooked fresh minutes before service.. For Langer's 60th anniversary Langer's for the founder turning 94 years old, the city of Los Angeles honored him in permanently renaming the center section Langer's square. Free parking lot on 7th, just East of the place.. Come visit Langer's with us and meet some of the people that make it so great:. . http://www.youtube.com....
