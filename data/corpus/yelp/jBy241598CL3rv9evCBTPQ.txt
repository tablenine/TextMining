What's left to say? It's an amazing dining experience!! If you have not been, you must try it. It is expensive but it is worth it.. . Like other Churrascarias, they serve all you care to eat (and I care to eat a lot of what they've got). They have what must be the best tasting Filet Mignon. Along with the Filet, my other favorite cuts of meat are the bottom sirloin and top sirloin. The salad bar and the sides are amazing and I would probably be satisfied with just that.. . This place strength to strength but Fogo De Chao leaves you wishing for two more things: A bigger wallet and a bigger stomach.
