Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Having been to Father's Office in Santa Monica I was eager to see the layout of the new location.  To my surprise it was a lot bigger and definitely an urban bar feeling.  My friend and I stood in line for about 15 minutes...not too bad considering wait at the Santa Monica location was about 35 minutes.  Walking in I was confuse as to where to order.  No one tells you that you are suppose to go up to the bar and yell your order.  At least at Santa Monica you had a cashier and a board to read from...We decided to go find a seat first as its first come first serve..found a seat...ask the nice people sitting in the same place to hold it for us and we went up to the bar and ordered the famous burger and sweet potatoe fries...also had the duck confit salad...salad was alright...burger was yummy...fries were great too!!! definitely recommend this location over the old one...
