AMAZING! The lines are usually long no matter what time of day you go, but it's worth it. As long as you have good company to kick it with outside. Â . Had both the ramen and the cold ramen, same things. Just depends on how hot you wanna eat it. . Salad/coleslaw has a great dressing and their gyoza are cooked well with a good amount of crisps. . I have gone to the one in Montery Park its good because they have 1/2 sizes but for some reason it was just not the same as Little Tokyo.
