By now, you are well aware of my burger obsession. I can't explain it, but I just love me some burgers. And there is little else--except fantabulous Chinese noodles--that can get me as hot and bothered as a good burger. I'm not big on filler (cheese and beef only please), which is why I got so giddy over Holeman's burger when they opened. I went to lunch with my good friend, neighbor and bon vivant, Jonathan Baker (the editor of Citysearch Atlanta among numerous other titles) at Bocado (887 Howell Mill Road, 30318. 404-815-1399. . http://www.bocadoatlan.... ) the other day. Amidst the list of interesting sandwiches and sides on the menu, my eyes zeroed in on the "burger stack." So, I ordered one just to check it out. Sweet baby Jesus Christo. That burger. That burger. It is still haunting me days after. Yes, it was THAT GOOD.. . As you can see (picture above) the burger closely resembles the H&amp;F burger--note the double patties, American cheese and homemade pickles. Bocado is even using the same bun, which H&amp;F bakery sells to many restaurants around Atlanta. They butter it, toast it and top it with two freshly ground patties made from three cuts of beef. This thing is epic. Epic, people! And I love that you can get it at lunch or dinner.. . Another thing I appreciated about the burger was the portion size. It wasn't some unmanageable monstrosity. Instead, it was just enough for my greedy little mouth to devour in mere seconds. I think I may have given Jonathan one bite before I inhaled the rest. I want one NOW, but my last dress fitting is next week (the wedding is next month) and my diet has to stay clean. Blargh.. . More to come on Bocado at a later date. But my initial experience was incredibly positive and I've got a good feeling about this place. Dinner's next.
