the wait sucks.  the parking sucks.  . . but the food is GREAT! . . is it worth the wait?  I would say yes because im a glut.. . Whole shebang, shrimp, crawfish, sausages, and LOTS of corn.. . thats what you should get.  or at least start with that, then try other stuff.. . the main downside to this place, is that you eat too much, and you might clog your toilet.  if you can deal with that, come here.. . actually, do not come here.  I dont need more people in front of me in line.
