We were treated by a friend here and quite the treat it was. I love the location and the ambience, the wait staff were so very helpful. We had dinner and the chef was out to personally explain each dish and suggest something suitable for everyone's palate. The food itself was outta this world. I enjoyed every bit of the meal and I must say they have some unique food preparation here. I would suggest it for a great family dinner, or a romantic date too maybe. Enjoy!
