Ok. So I had been here before a long time ago with one of my friends. But I had forgotten about it until recently that I visited again.. . The service was ok...as they did not provide much but from what they did provide it seemed ok. . . The food was good. The portion was not as big as other thai places but the food had good flavor. The crab rangoon specially was delicious.. . My friend and I ordered the same thing since it was her first time trying out Thai food and she enjoyed the place, the athmosphere and the food.. . I'd definately go back some other time and hopefully I will not be disappointed with a bad experience as some have had in this place.
