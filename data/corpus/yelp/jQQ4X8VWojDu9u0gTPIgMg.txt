Restaurant: Hashiguchi Jr.
Category: Japanese
One of the best Japanese restaurants in Atlanta. I love the selections; I like their Agedashi Tofu, Salmon Onigiri, Udon, and the sushi too. Well I think everything I've tried here has been good.. . This is a small restaurant so you may have to wait if you're with a big party.
