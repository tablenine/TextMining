Thanks Yelpers for pointing me in the direction of Sushi-Gen!. . I'm in LA for work this week and staying in Little Tokyo.  I checked out sushi restaurants in the area on Yelp and decided to try this one after seeing all of the positive reviews.  My friend and I walked over to the restaurant and thought about going somewhere else when we saw how crowded it was.  Although there were lots of people standing around, we got seated immediately.  I'm assuming the others were either a big party of wanted to sit at the sushi bar.. . The best part about Sushi-Gen is the quality of their fish.  Everything we ate was fresh and delicious!  We started with a bottle of cold sake that we had the waitress pick out.  It was smooth and crisp and reasonable ($18).  We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a yellowtail roll, a california roll, a couple orders of salmon nigiri, and a couple orders of albacore nigiri.  Each piece of fish was better than the next.  The rolls were just the right size and the pieces were perfect too.. . Our bill wasn't outrageous and we left full and very happy.  If I'm ever in Little Tokyo again, I'll definitely come back to Sushi-Gen!
