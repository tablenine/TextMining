704 reviews for this place, I'm sure I'm just going to be supporting what the rest said. I didn't get a chance to read any of it though.. . I like this diner, it's stylish and hip. People who come here are usually cool and know the deal. I eat here late after going out or something. They have all the dishes you can imagine at a diner, huge onion rings, crazy sandwiches and other full meals.
