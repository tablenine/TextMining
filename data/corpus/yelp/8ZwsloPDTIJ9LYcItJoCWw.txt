Restaurant: Abattoir
Category: American (New)
Brilliant, just brilliant.  Maybe it's because a) I'm picky, and b) I almost never get out of the house, but when I finally find a place that impresses, it seems *really* impressive.  A tip to tail approach to the animals we eat seems to have infiltrated even the least adventurous of restaurants, as chewy pork belly slices and deep fried chicken hearts pop up on the blandest of menus around town.  Abattoir is one of the rare places that takes it seriously, not just as an exotic line on the menu.. . Or, as the couple that were seated halfway through our appetizer course said, with noses crinkled and corners of the mouth turned down, "Why would anyone EEEEAT that?"  (This was just as I was stuffing my third heaping forkful of steak tartare into my gaping maw.). . Anyway, the answer to their question is that *I* would.  Because I like food that tastes good.  As a sidenote, this is the same couple that ordered - of all the things on the menu - a burger.  And then complained that it wasn't cooked long enough.  As the host so kindly explained - it is a beef and *pork* burger, so part of it will always be pink.  Like ham.  GTFO.  . . Nothing was really a total miss.  The apple pie was a little weird - the sorbet on top was overly sweet and reminded us a little of fluoride.  But who comes to Abattoir for apple pie?. . Where else in town can you get rabbit terrine, steak tartare, and all the other jellied, canned and pickled offal on offer here?  And complemented with such inspired relishes and seasonings?  If you know of one, please pass the word along.. . This is not the kind of place where I could eat five nights a week.  I feel the urge to eat nothing but fruit all day today.  But I will be back, and excited to try entirely different items off the menu.
