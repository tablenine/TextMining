While trying to write this review everything I wrote was followed by a "that's what he/she said" in my head.... . "Omg its so big" - me about the pizza slice. . "I guess that guy only likes to give it to pretty girls" Â - my roommate Steve as to why the guy at the counter wouldn't give him dipping sauce too. . "Can I dip mine in yours?" - Steve wanting to share my sauce. . "Too bad its so small" - about the set-up and lack of seating. . "At least I got what I paid for" - cheap prices. . If you want something cheap, large, and can fill you up, go here.
