Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Okay, so when places get hyped up as much as Pink's does, I feel obligated to try it at least once. Pink's is no different, unfortunately. So let me start out with the line... it's long, obnoxiously so - which I took as a good sign. This place MUST be good.. . So I ordered a hot dog, plain and simple, and also some chili cheese fries. Let me tell you that the hot dog was simply that, a hot dog. One of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh used to serve $.25 hot dogs with their $1 Coors Lights, and I've got to say this was on-par with that (save for the peanut shells on the ground). The chili cheese fries looked like something you might get from Wienerschnitzel.. but of course, you have to wait in a ridiculously long line for these ones. The tables themselves were dirty and I should also mention that my friend got food poisoning from eating the food here as well.. . I don't know where the hype came from, I can only assume that at some point in the distant past, this place had to be phenomenal, or maybe it had just somehow become a hot spot for celebrities to go and be seen? I suppose it's possible I came in on an off-night for them, I'm not quite sure - but this place is over-hyped and underwhelming. I can definitely say that one trip was more than enough, I won't be coming back.
