I am giving them the one star because their food is good, and I'm giving them the one star because their service sucks.. . My family and I went to eat here literally the other day and after we had our meal which was fine,  we were handed the bill.. . My father who decided to be nice and treat us, handed them a $100.00 bill since our bill was around $60.00.  . . This is where the problem begins..... .  now I work in retail and can usually spot a weird bill.... . Joy Yee's refused my father's money.  With no other explanation other than, we cannot accept this.  It was so utterly rude that I myself was furious.  . . My question is what if we had no other form of payment?  What would they have done then?  Called the police because we tried to give them good money?  It was unbelievable, I will never go to that place again.  By the time we left we felt insulted.. . I have never experienced such bad service in my entire life.  The manager then tried to make amends before we left by giving us some empty reason why they could not take the bill. I then proceeded to question, did they want us to pay with 60 one dollar bills, or 12 five dollar bills?  Was 100 dollar bill too much?. . Safe to say, Joy Yee's has lost my business.. . Sorry.
