Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Light light hard! lol. . I've been coming here for years.  Very consistent and not very expensive.  You can eat yourself full here.  Soup and Noodles are customizable (light, medium, hard).  If you order appetizers or any side dishes, they will come immediately after receiving your ramen.  I would recommend ordering your appetizers/side dishes when you order your drinks.  . . This place can get packed so prepare to wait outside.  No, its not as long as Daikokuya which is why I'd prefer this place over Daikokuya.. . Overall, if you can't decide on a place in SGV, pick this one.
