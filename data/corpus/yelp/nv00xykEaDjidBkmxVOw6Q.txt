Restaurant: Doc Chey&#39;s Noodle House
Category: Asian Fusion
I can't believe I've waited so long to review the ONLY restaurant that is in my iPhone contact list.  Not that I need to have it there to remember the number - I probably can spout it out quicker than my social security number.  This could be my "I can't live without" place to eat in Atlanta.  Let's get to the details:. . Waitstaff - EXCELLENT - they have the best people working for them, which makes every experience there great.. . Atmosphere - GREAT - no problems here - I've been eating here for 10 years and it's always been fun.. . Food - GREAT - what's not to like?  The Dim Sum (Appetizers) are fantastic - I like particularly the Shanghai Dumplings, Veggie Spring Rolls, Edamame, and Wok-Seared Green Beans.  I make a meal from the Dim Sum alone over 50% of the time.  For entrees, I usually go for the Japanese Teriyaki Udon, which is fantastic!!  Also try the Chinese Lo Mein, and the Fried Rice.  All great choices.. . Take out is always excellent - well constructed containers and very fast preparation make the call ahead unnecessary.  . . If I had to complain, the only thing I would suggest Doc Chey's change is the cleaning solution they use on the woks - if you are at the counter when it steams up the wok, the smell of the solution is not pleasant.. . This is one of the best places to eat in Atlanta.
