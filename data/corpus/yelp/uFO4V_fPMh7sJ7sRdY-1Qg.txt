If you live in San Francisco and you want to eat someplace at 3am you are out of luck.. If you live in Vegas you are alright, but why would you want to do that? . If you live in Chicago you can go to Pick Me Up.. I wish there was someplace like this near me. . Open until till 4am, 24 hours on weekends, decent food, decent coffee, decent service, decent atmosphere, vegetarian friendly, fair price, and Morrissey and Jesus and Mary Chain and so much more on the jukebox.
