this is currently my favorite restaurant.. i ate a special they had on the menu. it was their version of a philly cheesesteak. i was skeptical of ordering it b/c how great can a philly cheesesteak be? but our very friendly and knowledgable waiter convinced me to go with the special that he too would be eating that night and that would probably be off the menu sometime soon. this sandwich blew me out of the water. it was so amazing. so favorful and juicy (my fear was that the sandwich would be dry). i had a side salad which was also amazing. im rarely impressed with salads. i was impressed with this salad. . . the only bad thing about my experience was the hostess. i went on one of those sub-zero temperature days where it feels like the insides of your nose are frozen solid. we were seated near the door and there was a draft everytime someone came in or out. i politely asked the hostess if there was any available seating in the back. she seemed confused by my question. she said there was a seat in the back but that it was near a window and that i'd probably still be cold back there. her tone of voice made it seem like she was annoyed and did not want to move us. so i told her it was fine and that we didnt have to move. i was in no way demanding or rude. i was polite and literally just asking a question. she proceeded to bitch about me to another server. i really hate bad/rude service and attitude when it is unmerited. . if it weren' t for the hostess i would give this place 5 stars in a heartbeat. but i really cannot stand bad service. . . overall - amazing food, seasonal menu, great waitstaff (cant say the same for host staff), a bit pricey but worth it, very nice and cozy ambiance.
