OH WOW! I wasn't sure what to get because I was stuck between the lamb and the burger but the waitress recommended the pork chop and I didn't want to be rude having asked her suggestion and then veering another way so I said, "One pork chop please". . . My friend got the burger and it wasn't as big as we had both expected... but damnnnnn girl, it was good! Juicy since it was medium rare and had caramelized onions and bbq sauce hit by the arugula, yumm. Our mushrooms were okay. The aroma of garlic hit me and I loved it but when I plopped a bad boy into my mouth, the garlic flavor was minimal :(. When my pork chop came out I wanted to die. It. was. so. good. It was a thick cut of pork so I thought it would be dry but quite honestly, it was the most tender pork chop EVER. MMMM *drool* I felt like the flavor of the pork chop was Asian inspired.. reminded me of my roots.. . They have coke in the bottle so it's the "good" coke and for $3 it better be. They also have old fashions!! My friend flipped since he loves them and it was strong. . . The inside of the bar is so awesome; they have beers on tap and each tap lever has a unique "decoration". . . Note: You need to be over 21 for this place even for lunch!. . It was more expensive than we thought it would be (almost $60 before gratuity) but we both thought it was worth the experience and the pork chop *shudder so good*.
