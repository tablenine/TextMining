Expect a 45min -1hr wait if you come on a weekend with no reservations. Grabbing a few glasses of wine at the bar makes the wait more tolerable. . . When we were finally seated we had the Chicken livers, capers, parsley &amp; guanciale, and Arrancine alla bolognese to start of. The arrancine was good and the chicken liver was delicious. It had a mixture of tangy and buttery goodness.. . For the main dish I had the Coach farm goat cheese, leeks, scallions &amp; bacon and my friend went with the Gorgonzola dolce, fingerling potatoes, radicchio &amp; rosemary. I thought both were equally good. It had the perfect amount of oil, its not greasy and the crust is just the right amount crispiness. . . Dessert we had the banana gelato pie. The dark chocolate syrup was a bit much for me. I just avoided that and it was pretty good.. . Overall very good food, make sure to make reservations ahead of time if you have a party larger than two.
