this has got to be my favorite bakery. i love love love this place. i love the fresh squeezed orange juice. i love the cheese rolls. i love the potato balls. i love the chicken croquets. i love the chocolate perisan cake. i love the creme brulee. i love the steak torta. okay, those are my favorites Â that i get pretty much everytime... but the other stuff is good too! line can be long, but they're fairly efficient in moving it. best time to go is a random weekday in the middle of the day so there's no line. even so, it's so worth the wait. just do it, you won't regret it.
