Definitely worth the drive from Eagle Rock, that's how good it is :). The Santa Fe chicken is amazing. The texture, the taste and that yummy burger bun that comes with is simple delicious. The steam kale is also amazing with the dressing. The burger is also another hit. Taste just like the real thing and the sweet potato fries are the best we've tasted. All and all, a great happy find thanks to the many happy yelpers that have raved about this place.. . Happy eating!
