Food is really good, though I wish they had more selection on the menu. I don't eat red meat or pork so my options were limited. The guac is excellent. They also have a good brunch if you want some spicy tex mex on a Sunday morning. The margaritas are little, but strong. It's a little expensive to frequent regularly though. Overall I really like this place; especially on a date when a guy is paying!
