Completely overrated.  I ordered the "Manly Burger" and fries; the skinny ones.. . I can't believe these burgers cost $10 average. Rip off like a mofo.   It's only like a 6 oz patty.  If you're looking at pictures in the album and catch yourself saying "Those burgers look small".  It's because they ARE small.  Don't get me wrong, the burger is "good", at best, but NOT $10 good! Also, the fries are $3.50 and honestly, they taste like frozen fries.  That's some bull$*^t.  If I'm paying $3.50 for fries they better not only BE fresh they better TASTE fresh.  NOT FROZEN.  . . Decor is cool, the help is okay, but just not worth spending $14 for a burger and fries.  Not memorable at all. Completely forgettable.  Another note, if you order water, it comes in wannabe PLASTIC stemless wine glass with a thumb grip.  Plastic for Dine In??? C'mon!!!!! Get a Father's Office burger.  You'll enjoy your money spent there.
