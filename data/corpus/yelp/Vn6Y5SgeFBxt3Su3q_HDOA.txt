Restaurant: West Egg Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
West Egg Cafe has to be one of my favorite brunch spots in Atlanta.  It's where the husband and I bring out of town guests.  But definitely get there early (or late) to miss the brunch rush on the weekends.  The wait is worth it though.. . The husband is a big fan of the Banana Bread French Toast.  It is super yummy, but after eating 2 slices, you will be overloaded with sugar.  My favorite is the Peachtree Plate special.  The Pimento Cheese Grits are absolutely amazing and hte candied bacon is to die for.
