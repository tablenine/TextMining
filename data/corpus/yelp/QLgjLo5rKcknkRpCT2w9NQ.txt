Dinner for a friend's birthday on Sat. 5/9/09. . The good:  . A handshake from Wolfgang himself; a sommelier who showed up without being asked.. . The bad:  . Steaks not prepared as requested and, hmm... one too many visits to the bathroom after I got home that night?. . Overall:. Service was courteous and friendly, but I was a bit surprised that our server didn't automatically recommend the Kobe and True Japanese Wagyu steaks be ordered to cook to Medium since the marbling of fat is best at Medium to melt.  One doesn't have to be a d*ck about it, but I've had servers "suggest" Medium with such explanations and I find that helpful.  To be asked how I wanted my Wagyu prepared made me raise my eyebrows.  Regardless, even when ordering Medium, I got it back Medium Rare.  The steak was good, but having it a tad undercooked meant the fat was just fatty versus being deliciously buttery.  . . The sides were good but not fantastic:  I liked the peas, the mashed potatoes were ok, the mushrooms had too much soy sauce, and the fingerling potatoes were good.  . . The desserts were alright - not great.  And the after dinner petit fours were refrigerated and not thawed to room temp which made for inedible pieces of caramel, while the yuzu and chocolate ginger ones were fine.. . And I have no idea why, since we all shared our foods, more or less, but I spent a few too many hours in the bathroom that night.  While I thought it a fluke, a friend of mine just told me tonight that on her visit to CUT two weeks ago, she too had bathroom issues and a friend in her group threw up.  We can't explain it.. . In short:. It's nice and good but the experience at CUT Las Vegas was much better - from the food preparation to the service.. I'll save my splurging occasion for the Vegas location in the future.
