YUMMMM the Hainan Chicken is soooo delicious! The rice is cooked in chicken broth and it is soo good I can eat that just by itself.  The chicken with the ginger and the orange sauce was a party in my mouth :). . The shrimp rolls were good too.  It is just little eggrolls with shrimp in it and they give you this orange sauce to dip.. . The service was good, they refilled the sauces and my drink.  I found myself craving it again the next day... . Def worth driving all the way here despite Asian drivers who refuse to obey traffic rules.  Ca$h only!
