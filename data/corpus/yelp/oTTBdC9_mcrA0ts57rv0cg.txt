Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
din tai fung,. why are your portions so small and so expensive?. . 10 XLBs for ~$7.25 and they're tiny. Â You know, i can go to Mama's Lu, Dean Sin World, J&amp;J, or Dragon Mark for less than your price. Sure your XLB skin is nice and thin..but the meat is not that great. I can go to other places as I have mentioned for maybe not so thin dumpling skin, but still taste just as good (if not better) and have more juice in the dumpling.. . I'll only go here if you're treating me.
