Restaurant: Paco&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Los Angeles.  11:00am.  Hungover.  Operation "Get Some Mexican in You" heads out to rendezvous with Paco.  . . Paco who?  Paco's MotherFucking Taco's you idiot.  Act like you know.. . This place looks like a Pinata exploded in it, and what came out looked like a Tijuana Cinco de Mayo on meth with an Oxycontin back.  In a good way though.  . . Can you say Ole?. . Fajitas and Guac and Beer and Beans.. . Oh, and they make their own corn tortillas here.  Serious grub for a churning stomach.  So good, that there are still a few in my purse.. . Lunch is in one hour.  Start the countdown.. . Tres, Dos, Uno...
