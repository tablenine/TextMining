OOOOOOOOHHHH WEEEEEE!!!. This 5 star comes out like a hurricane!. I was skeptical before going in with my girlfriend and friends. . I had been eyeing this place and the meat that they show in the window for some time.. We finally went there, and the entrance alone is great, waterfall, HUGE doors, and then once u walk in u see the tower of wine bottles and you're greeted to sit down.. . Once u sit down they explain to you how Brazilian Churrasceria's (prob misspelled) work.. Basically u get a card which is green on one side and red on the other. Green means "Bring me meat" red means "No More".. . And that's exactly how easy and fun it is. . . The meats were abundant and to die for, all tender, juicy, tastey, yum!. Many different types too!. . AND THE BEST SALAD BAR I'VE EVER BEEN TO!. . Premium quality meats! Salads! Cheeses! And a huge wheel of Parmiggiano Reggiano with an opening for carving your cheese out.. . And if you're italian, or just a person who enjoys true food, you'll know that Parmiggiano Reggiano is the way to go.. . We also got a delicious red wine from Chile.. . And to top it off, we were all overstuffed of course, so we had some papaya cream dessert which has natural enzymes in it to help you digest.. . It was fabolous!! Very expensive, and a little upscale but definitely worth every little bit of it!
