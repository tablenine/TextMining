Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I really want to like this place, they don't take credit cards and no shit from any customers (my kind of place) --  I even ran into my cousin randomly there, who I never see.  . . Unfortunately, I just think their Tacos suck.  If the name of the place was Tito's Burritos, Tacos, and Fireworks, I could probably forgive them.  But the name is f'ing Tito's Tacos, so you better have some bomb ass mofo tacos, which I don't think is the case.  I mean, I'm no Taco Bell ho, but I was sorta craving a hard shell taco from TB after eating there.  And don't get me started on the salsa, it wasn't pretty.
