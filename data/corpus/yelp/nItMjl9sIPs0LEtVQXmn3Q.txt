Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
In the war of Southland pastrami sandwiches, Johnnies Pastrami is my current favorite.  Many a pastrami have been slain in this war, yet I keep coming back to Johnnies in Culver City.  The Hat in Pasadena is almost comparable, but Johnnies has it beat on production value.. . I once introduced a lady friend to Johnnies, and her exact words after taking a single bite were, "OOHHHH... this is just Sinful!"  I agree.  If Las Vegas were to adopt an official pastrami sandwich for the City of Sin, it would be Johnnies.  When you bite into the sandwich, 1% of your body is rejecting this semi-fatty, salty, greasy, cheesy sandwich, while the other 99% of your body is trembling with ecstasy and thinking, "An extra half hour on the treadmill is worth it for this!". . Johnnies wins extra points for atmosphere.  Imagine a small '50s diner with outdoor patios complete with firepits.  All the indoor seats have access to a jukebox which can be heard outdoors as well.  It's also open extremely late (3:30am on Fridays and Saturdays), making this an ideal late night dining option.. . Portions are large and semi-pricey.  You can easily split a full Pastrami sandwich (recommend it on white bread with swiss cheese) and a side of fries between two people.  Round it out with sodas, tax, and tip and it runs you about $25 total.  The place is CASH ONLY, which is the only real downside.. . Note: If it is your first time here, do not go to a place named "Johnnies Pastrami" and order the Chicken in a Basket.  I've never tried that dish, but I see first-timers order non-pastrami here, and every time you do, an angel loses its wings.  So please don't make the children cry and stick to the pastrami on your first visit.
