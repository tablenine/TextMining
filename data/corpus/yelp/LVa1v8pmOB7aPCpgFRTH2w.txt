Great, fast service. Really interesting atmosphere. Don't expect your typical steak house, this is very modern. Clean, minimal inside and the steaks are amazing. Try the 3 pepper rub. As stated in previous reviews, it's pricy. However, it's definitely worth it. Sometimes interesting, sometimes hilarious crowd.
