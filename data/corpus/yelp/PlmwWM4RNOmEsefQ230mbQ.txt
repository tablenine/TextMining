Restaurant: one sixtyblue
Category: American (New)
Finally went for the first time last night and am looking forward to going back!. . I knew someone else who went on a weeknight and said the crowd was a little on the one sixtyblue hair side (and very quiet), but that wasn't the case last night.  It was pretty full and fun music was playing - but at a reasonable level that you could still have a conversation.  . . The food was great - we started with the salmon and hashbrown appetizer, then I got pork tenderloin and my boyfriend got the beef tenderloin.  The best part of the evening was the dessert special - basically a gourmet PB &amp; J!
