Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Very disappointed. I ALWAYS hear about Pink's and decided to try it one day. Not only does parking suck, you wait in a long ass line which gives you the misconception that you will have the best hot dog you have ever tasted in your life.. . The employees have this thing where they don't take down your order, they make your food by memory, and of course, they got our order wrong with two different items. And I failed by ordering a burger along with my hot dog. DO NOT ORDER A BURGER, tastes like one of those frozen patties you can buy from a foods wholesaler &amp; bbq at home, but WORSE. . . I don't remember much about the hot dogs because they really had no impact on me other than they were not THAT good.. . And I hated how homeless people kept coming by asking for change and for food while we were still eating it! One even asked if we were going to finish our drink, and grabbed it before we could answer. I did not have a great experience at Pink's.
