Here's the deal Rodan. It is really effing rude to serve someone a drink at 1:40am then immediately start stacking chairs on the tables all around the patron in question as well as yank the candle that was lighting my space off the table without some much as making eye contact.  Last call had not been called and not a word was said during this extremely passive aggressive performance.  Your decor may be beautiful, but the performance this past Sunday was ugly.
