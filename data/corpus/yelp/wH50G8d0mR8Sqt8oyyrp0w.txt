So, I was here the other day just to grab a quick lunch. I had pretty high expectations of the place, and I was pretty let down. While I must admit I was impressed by the decor and overall atmosphere of the restaurant, the food alone makes me not want to return. I've definetly had much better asian-fusion cuisine. And much faster and attentive service would have been appreciated. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.
