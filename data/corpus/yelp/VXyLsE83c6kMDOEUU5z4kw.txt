Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
Dim lighting for ambiance...??  or to hide something...??  Maybe a little bit of both but if you are looking for a nice burger (had the bleu burger) and beer with some fires in a relaxed setting this is the place.  Its is trying to be one of those london pubs that we so lack on every corner in this city and it is pretty close, dark wood, dark lighting, dark beer.  The one thing that separates it from one of those british pubs is that you cant smoke...  a welcome surprise for a bar in this neighborhood.  Try out the beer (what I would loosely call) "garden" on a nice day.
