Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
Oh Ping Pong....it gives me the feeling of being in LA but in Chicago.. . The food is generally good. There are some dishes you should always get and definitely some dishes you should always avoid for instance the Pad See Ewe. Which is one of the reasons it got a 3 star rating...its shameful to walk into a restaurant and have limited selections not based on diet but on the taste of the food. . . Their drink selections are wonderful and they have great specials...which leads me to believe that if Ping Pong was just a bar it would probably be better off.. . As far as the service...its hit or miss but I've never had any complaints....more observations than experience. . . My absolute biggest criticism of this place is the horrifically loud music played at ear splitting levels. Oh God..either you sit in side and scream at the person you're eating with or you bring a fly shatter for the outdoor patio. I'm gay and I'm used to loud music indoors but when you're trying to have dinner especially on a date...I would love to be able to hear the other person. . . Moral of the Story....my rating could easily go up if there were some minor changes...but I don't see that happening.
