I love this place. The wait is a tad long, but you'll have a good time once you're inside. The beer alone is amazing!I suggest to try a different one each time.. . If you're 21, watch out...because the second the bartender realizes you're that young, they keep on eye on you all night. That was kind of stupid considering I only had a few drinks and there was drunk 50 something year old there. . . Overall, awesome place. Try it!!!!
