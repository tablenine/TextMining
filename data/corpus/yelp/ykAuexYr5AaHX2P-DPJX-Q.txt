Hype, Hype, Hype. All I heard from my people, "Dam, you have to taste it". "FO's Burger will change your life!". "Better than sex!" . . To start off, I was pretty impressed by the interior. Simple yet clean and presentable. Next, I was pleased with their wide assortment of beers and "soda pop". I ordered a medium rare burger and to my surprise . . . one of the best burgers I've ever tasted.. . This upscale pub's burger is really delicious - all its components fit together. Â Dam, I'm mouth is salivating while I'm writing this review. FYI, there's no table service . . . It's pretty cool because you order at the bar (Bartenders are chill too). Parking is easy too. . . Comparing to the hundreds of burgers I've tasted, I had to rank FO's trademark as one of the finest. 5 Stars.
