Restaurant: Thumbs Up Diner
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This is a *must eat* eatery! The staff is great and always nice. I've almost made my way through the entire menu... . . The chicken and waffles rock, but the catfish and grits are out of this world. I have family that has come through and still talks about it! The wait is a little long at times, (that seems to be in "in" thing), and it's cash only. There has to be a reason for that. I've found that the best local dives are *cash only*. The fact that Thumbs Up has several locations now, they need to get with the times. Will it stop me from going?? Heck no!!! The food is a near religious experience! . . Lunch also rocks! Â The BBQ sandwich is always a fav as well as their Reuben. Yummy!! . . Do not think this is a *get in, get out* place. Take your time, smell the fabulous coffee and taste the food!
