Two words: wear black... I mean, it was literally a living NYC cliche.. . Regardless, coming from LA the sushi was good, but definitely doesn't stack up to places of the same ilk on the West Coast.  Definitely try the Spicy Crispy Shrimp, that was the best dish I had all night.. . If you aren't paying, great, go &amp; have a good time.  Otherwise, I'm sure you can find much cheaper, much better sushi in Manhattan.
