good taco i only tried te spicy pork and short rib. i like spicy pork more. good to try at least once it is pretty decent. IS IT WORTH 2 HOURS WAITING IN THE COLD W/ MOMS? no. now everytime mom passes t.s. emporium. (where the taco truck was at friday night,when we went) she gives me a death glare and complain about time and money wasted.
