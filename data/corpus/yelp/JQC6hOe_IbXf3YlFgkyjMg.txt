Great chips and salsa, even better chicken tacos.  Seriously some of the best I've had in a long time and I eat a LOT of comida de Mexicanas.  Service is hit or miss, but the chips and salsa guy (despite his complete lack of eye contact) is pretty attentive.  Also, go for the "swirl" or "twist" or whatever it's called.  It's a great way to bring your buzz to a "whole...nutha...level."
