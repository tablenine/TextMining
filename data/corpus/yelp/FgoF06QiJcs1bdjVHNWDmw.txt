I can only speak for the music and drinks at this place: we went to see Cale, playing Flamenco music while we had drinks next to the bar. I loved the spot and the service was OK, so I would say as long as you want to listen to Spanish music before the weekend, you can enjoy a beer or two and enjoy yourself here.
