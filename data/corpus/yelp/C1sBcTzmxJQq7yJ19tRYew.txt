Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Good good good, small location but accommodating for a Sunday morning. Had the pesto scramble, yummy but I was totally full after the 2 big pieces of brioche toast so I had a few bites, potatoes were yummy.. . Boyfriend had the boring eggs and toast and he did enjoy that. Server was attentive, decor is kinda old fashioned and boring, but whatever
