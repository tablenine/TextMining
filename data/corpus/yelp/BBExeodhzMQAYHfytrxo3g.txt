I've been meaning to try this place out for sometime. When a promoter sent me an e-mail stating he was having a party there, I had to go. They have valet parking at the restaurant and across the street. When I stepped inside, I was impressed. The place looks very sophisticated. The place has 3 floors, but I only had the opportunity to see two. There's booths, tables, and a bar on the main floor. There's also a flat screen TV at the bar. All the bartenders I dealt with were helpful. . . The menu has basically everything, Fish, Chicken, Soups, Salads, Beef, Lamb, Pork, Seafood, Rice, Noodles, and Vegetables. If you can find at least one thing, then I don't know what to tell you. The prices are a little high, especially the seafood, but I didn't think it was ridiculous. You get a good amount of food and should leave with a full stomach. You have main dishes and small plates to choose from. Small plates is basically appetizer. I opted for the small plates and I got two different ones. Both of them were delicious!!! I've loved Asian Fusion Restaurants before I ever knew what the hell Asian Fusion was. . . The lower level of the restaurant is very intimate. They have a booth with a curtain type thing that you could pull for privacy. The have the seating arranged in a manner for a group of people to socialize. They also have another TV down there along with a small bar. If that wasn't enough, waiters come along and ask if you want something to eat or drink. . . The night I went, they had a DJ, but I hear they also have a live Jazz Band on Sunday's. . . You should definitely give it a try.
