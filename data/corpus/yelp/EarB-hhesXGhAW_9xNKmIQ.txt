Gimmick-y as all heck. Good-tasting burgers, but you can easily get something similar at any non-fast food place that serves burgers for much less.. . You arrive at a ultra-modern burger place. You fill out a checklist for your burger - what size meat patty, type of cheese (they all taste the same....), weird toppings, expensive premium weird toppings, what type of huge bun, salsa or aioli (it's really mayo with garlic powder) and yet the server asks you how well you want it done...... . You're really paying over $10 for the novelty of a "custom" burger that doesn't even come with a side. Â They taste good, but like Flat Top, you run the risk of creating a nasty hamburger with bad combos of cheese and toppings. . . Our server was probably the slowest of the many servers working that evening. We waited about 45 minutes for our burgers and had to ask for the check two times - at a burger place. C'mon....this isn't the Signature Room. . . However, if you like sterile, yuppified places that let you create a burger as you would order options on a new car, The Counter's for you!
