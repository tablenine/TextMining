Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
The Little Door is, consistently, a great choice for ambiance and great food.   Wine lovers will appreciate the wine menu.  My friend always orders the Ribeye, which is quite good.  I like to try the specials, and last night the pork tenderloin dish was fabulous.  It was my "second dinner" because I had been to an earlier Bday gathering.  I thought I would politely order something, then take it home, but after one bite I was hooked, and I almost finished my plate.  Then the trio of creme brulee, an espresso, and a cappuccino!!  I paid the price with my overly full belly.....ouch.
