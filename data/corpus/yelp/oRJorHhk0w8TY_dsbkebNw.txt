It's a sausage fest at this place!  It's a decent enough place.  It's like a Juicy Fruit, or a Tidal Wave (remember those?).  You come to this place, and see all of the options, and it's like the Tidal Wave of flavor, bursting...in yo mouth!  Next, you eat the food, and take in the ambiance, and start to really love this place, but the love affair goes away as fast as it came. . . You think back after a few months, and realize, it was a little bit expensive.  After that, you go somewhere else, or (in my case), a friend brings some links from New Orleans which make you look back on your experience at Wurstkuche as wasted time, and money.  I know, the brat is a whole different beast, but you get my point.  Then you sit, and realize the whole experience was just meh.  Starts out with a burst of flavor and excitement, but it quickly goes away.. . I liked this place, but it's really overrated.  I had the alligator sausage, the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage, the vegetarian sausage, and there are no distinguishing characteristics to the flavor of the sausages.  Everything just seems muddled together.  The fries are alright, and the accompanying sauces make the meal.  That's the highlight of the meal.  The condiments.. . One thing I did like about this place was the service.  The servers were very friendly, and definitely weren't pretentious like people in many Los Angeles spots.  They were actually pretty well informed about the items on their menu, and pleasant to converse with.  the beer....well, I know they have good beer on tap, but I mean, that's not entirely the point of this place now is it?  If I want great brews, I head over to Lucky Baldwin's  In fact, they're nearing the end of their Belgian Fest.  I'll have to make that journey again.
