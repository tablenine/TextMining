942 reviews, 4 stars...... . that pretty much sums it up.  but, what's another 2 cents right?. . well, i'm from the bay area, so my ramen standard is katana-ya in SF.  i compare all my ramen experiences to katanaya.... . i am not going to say daikokuya is not as good as katanaya, but i would say it's a good bowl of ramen in its own unique way.  the broth is lighter.  i liked the noodles, which tasted fresh and not overly cooked.  but what i LUV the most about the ramen was the egg.  i don't know what kind of secret sauce they soaked the eggs in for how many days or months, but i could eat a dozen of these eggs.  . . daikokuya, good ramen, hate the long lines, but LOVE the eggs.
