Went back to Sola and tried the pineapple French toast. If you like pineapple then this is an incredible dish. I actually prefer the banana macadamia Â nut pancakes, but that's probably due to the fact that it's an excuse to eat chocolate for breakfast! I can't believe this place is never packed at brunch. One of the few places in Chicago where you don't have to wait to be immediately seated on the weekends. Highly, highly recommended!
