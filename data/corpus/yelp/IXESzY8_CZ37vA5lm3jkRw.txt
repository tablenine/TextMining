This was one of the best meals I had during my 4 months in NY!  Our party of 4 arrived around 7pm on a Sunday night.  It's somewhat inconvenient that they only take reservations for a party of 5 or more.  So we ordered drinks at the bar and waited.  The wait wasn't so bad though, considering they initially told us at least 45 minutes and a seat at the communal table.  Instead, we waited around 20-30 minutes and got our very own table.  . . We picked this place because it had a separate menu for vegetarians, but also had an incredible variety of interesting dishes.  It sure didn't disappoint.  Our vegetarian diner was delighted with her cheese waffles.  Based on a recommendation from our server, I went with the most popular dish of buttermilk fried chicken.  I didn't even realize it came with waffles as well...and of course syrup for dipping!  =)  It was excellent, along with the bacon wrapped trout ordered by the guys.  How can you possibly go wrong with anything that has bacon in it.  Really enjoyed the sweetness of the prune jam, which worked well with the saltiness of the bacon.. . Oh, I almost forgot about the highlight, which was the complimentary cheesy bread they serve at the beginning of the meal.  It was so warm and lovely; I wanted more!  We also shared the spiced ribs, which were good, although I thought could have been more flavorful.  The squash tart was nice as well.. . For dessert we split the pecan pie sundae and apple bread pudding.  I preferred the warm bread pudding, although my dining companions ate up the sundae, which is apparently their most popular dessert, according to our server.  I found it to be too sweet, but it was finished at our table.  . . I might be generous giving it 5 stars, but we had such a disappointing meal the night before and spent double what we spent here.
