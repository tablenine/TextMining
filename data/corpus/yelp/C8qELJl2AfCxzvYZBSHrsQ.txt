Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Yep. This place is that good.  I rarely give 4 stars out.. . Every other Korean restaurant should study this place and copy.. . Garli was perfect.  Big tender pieces of meat.. . Cucumber gimchi. Perfect.. . Potato side dish thing (cumja).  My favorite.. . Service was great.  Love how they have the buzzers on the tables to call staff.
