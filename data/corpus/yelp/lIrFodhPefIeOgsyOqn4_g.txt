This is still one of my top 5 staple, go-to, perfect blend of fresh to delicious foods, comfortable and fun restaurants! It rocks....not expensive, VERY fresh and perfect portions, hip but not pretentious...what else DO 'ya want? If I lived closer, I'd be there 3-4 times a week. If you live in the 'hood, and are having a birthday gathering here, invite me! I need an excuse to eat healthy goodies and drink strong coffee!
