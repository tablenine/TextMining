Highly recommended for their: . Skillet roasted mussels+shrimp. Tastes just right! . . They have roasted rabbit...... A little bit to our surprise....... Ordered it...... Too dry........Not recommended........ But still 5 star since they actually serve it..... nice try...... . Seafood black linguinie was really good.......... . Dont be scared by their garlic theme because: . 1 Garlic helps prevent cancer. 2 At the end of the meal, they give you little orange flavored candy to refresh your breath and it worked pretty well. 3 You need the Garlic thingy if you date turns out to be a freak
