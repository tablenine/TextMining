Restaurant: 5 Seasons Brewing
Category: American (New)
5 good reasons to dig 5 Seasons:. . 1.  Saison du Bob - crisp golden Belgian brew, perfect for sipping outside under the sun.. . 2.  Outdoor upstairs deck - combined with a beautifully sun-drenched afternoon and a pleasantly cool breeze, there's no better place to be for a relaxing lunch.. . 3.  Cool-ass server - the kind that'll give you a -real- opinion when you ask for one, and makes the food happen.. . 4.  Antelope burger - just cuz you get to say you've had antelope.  Oh, and it's juicy and delicious, although I'm not completely sold on the flatbread it's served on.  Wicked fries, though.. . 5.  Price - ain't necessarily cheap, but considering how full I was when I left, the stellar ambiance, and the no-nonsense service, it's certainly fair.
