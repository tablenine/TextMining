I've been for many an evening meal (side note -- you MUST get the Portobello Fries), but never brunch... until last Sunday. It hits the same strides as lunch and dinner -- fantastic menu options, great server-to-patron ratio and excellent service and food. Go for the Farmers Market Breakfast and try a side of the berries with honey yogurt. The fresh juices make a great combo, and the on-the-house bread and jam while you wait is delicious. It's as busy and loud as any other time, but if you're a downtown resident you can't be but happy to see the place flourish.
