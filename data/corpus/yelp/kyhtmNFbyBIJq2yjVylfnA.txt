Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
I have never been to Hawaii so I can't tell you how authentic the food is.. . The food was pretty standard though. Nothing spectacular but not bad, and not too expensive. I tried the spam musubi which everyone talked about. Good to try, but if I had eaten both rolls (I split an order) I think that would have been overkill.. . I got the chicken combo, which comes with the chicken bbq and donkatsu. I thought the bbq chicken was thin, not like a full breast portion. In any case, it was still too much food for me and my sister to finish. They should seriously consider not putting fried items on top of cooked cabbage. It makes everything soggier.. . The sweet tea was really good and the guy was friendly. Chill atmosphere, cute decorations.
