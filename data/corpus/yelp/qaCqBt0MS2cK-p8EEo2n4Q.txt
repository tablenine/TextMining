So here's the run down. Big ass bowl of noodles and broth. Lots! Two people can probably share one. You have to pay extra for extras, which I was kind of bummed out about. I'm the kind of girl that throws the kitchen sink in my homemade soups and ramen. So it felt very limiting, especially since I was trying to stay within a budget. . . But for the most part, it was tasty and I would definitely recommend it and even go again.
