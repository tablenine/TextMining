Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
I first glimpsed Porto's across North Hollywood Way en route to the Bob Hope Airport.  It winked at me as if to say, "yes, we are a magnificent-looking dining establishment in the middle of the inexplicable void that surrounds us.  What would you rather do: get on a smelly airplane or stay here and let us provide you with a scrumptious [fill in the blank - I had no idea what kind of food it served, just that it was incongruous in location and lovely in appearance].". . Months later, I ended up working nearby and remembered this place.  I was expecting a Disney World-type experience where parking is a pain and the lines make you want to jump in front of a spinning tea cup.  I was surprised to find parking was a breeze and the staff was friendly and efficient.  I sat outside and a passing busboy provided me with a pile of fresh napkins, completely unsolicited.  Who DOES that?  Porto's, that's who.  . . I recommend the torta de pollo, which has a layer of goat cheese that perfectly complements the delicious chicken and soft, ciabatta-type bread.  The creme brulee is some of the best I've ever had.. . I also recommend taking some time in the middle of a hectic workday and looking at the gigantic dessert counter - just look at it.  It's a wonderland of beautifully-iced cakes, perfectly garnished tarts, and whimsically colorful confections.  So amazing it'll make you forget all about those TPS reports.
