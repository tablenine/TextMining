Pretty disappointed with this place, as I had high expectations coming in after reading all of the wonderful reviews.  Anyways, I guess the fairest way is to break this down into categories, and then the overall rating is just a combination of it all.. . Food-- I had 5 different dishes, none of which were good.  Comparatively speaking, the fried calamari was decent, but the paella and everything else was a huge disappointment.  The rice was too soggy and the flavors were just lacking.  The octopus dish smelled good, but did not taste very good.  If I had to rate the food alone, I would probably give this place 1.5/5 stars.  I really didn't enjoy my meal.  I was not impressed with the sangria either.  . . Cost-- Overall, not too bad.  Most of the tapas dishes were $5, and then the paella was $20.  All reasonable.  Sangria was $25 a pitcher.. . Environment-- definitely a fun place to be, given the live music and the amount of people that are here.  However, a very loud place, making conversation a bit difficult.  A good place to go w/ friends, but I would not come here on a first date or anything.. . I would not come back here again, and hope there are other, better places in Atlanta for tapas.
