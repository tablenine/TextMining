Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I love food. I love eating. And I constantly heard the locals speak of Tito's Tacos like it was the second coming of Jesus.. . Well... after living in Los Angeles for over 20 years I finally tried some last night.. . I had a taco with cheese, meat and bean burrito with cheese, and chili beans with cheese.. . I don't know what I expected before I took my first bite... maybe I was expecting too much, like some sort of orgy in my mouth and only Playboy Playmates were invited or something... but after I took my first bite.... . ...meh.... . ...instead of said orgy in my mouth is was just a threeway gangbang. And the chicks weren't even hot.. . I scarfed down all the food since It was about 7pm and I hadn't eaten anything all day and it was a fair amount of food for the price but it wasn't the orgasmic experience to me that people had claimed it to be. The tacos, sadly to say, were "Jack-in-the-Box"esque but with slightly less flavor. The burrito was good, but only after I drenched every bite with a copious amount of the free jalapenos. The chili beans tasted like they came from a can (Hormel maybe?).. . But with that said, none of the food was offensive in any way, it just wasn't the oral pleasure I expected.. . Would I eat there again? Sure... but let's get drunk first. Tito's seems to be good drunk food.
