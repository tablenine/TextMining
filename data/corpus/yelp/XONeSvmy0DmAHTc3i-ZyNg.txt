While I was shopping down Division I was drawn into the place because of the outdoor patio and reminded myself that I should come check it out.  It's got a sports bar lounge-like feel to it.  The upstairs more loungey, and the main floor is more like a sports bar.  They also have a downstairs floor too which may be more of a cross between the two.  We were downstairs initially because there wasn't any seating available and I got to catch a bit of the Red Wings playing.  They closed it up at midnight as well as the outdoor patios have to be.  We made our way to the main floor and the drinks are pretty average in pricing.  Of course, they sell forties here in paper bags, which a friend had to try out.  The drinks are pretty strong as I did not see a lot of red cranberry in my drink.  I like the mixture of music here.  It wasn't all one type.  I'd come back, and it would be a good spot for a party - but I don't know if there's room for dancing.
