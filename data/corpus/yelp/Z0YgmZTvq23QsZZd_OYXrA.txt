If you want delicious Shanghai style cuisine at an affordable price, this is not the place for you.. . Food is overpriced, fillings in dumplings and buns are small, portions are small in general.  I don't know what all the hype is about this place.  Even the servers there act as if they know their food sucks and prices are too high, and we, the customers, are the suckers who are paying their food and salary.. . TOTALLY NOT RECOMMENDED.
