Restaurant: La Fonda Latina

Yo quiero La Fonda. . . La Fonda's one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta. I've never had anything here I didn't like. The margaritas probably helped with that. But the salsa is fresh, the paella is good, and the sandwiches are also very delicious and meaty. Oh yeah, and did I mention the margaritas?. . Watch out for the hot sauce. As a sriracha and tobasco addict, I thought I would like their hot sauce, and I did for the first thirty seconds. But for the next thirty minutes I thought my tongue was going to fall off, and I had to bear the "Are you okay?"-s from my friends as they watched me sweat it out in pain. It's all part of the fun I suppose.. . The outdoor seating upstairs is really nice. Some of my favorite memories in Atlanta started at La Fonda.
