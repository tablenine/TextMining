Restaurant: Ru San&#39;s Buckhead At Tower Place
Category: Sushi Bars
We love Ru Sans on the weekends.  This location is great, but beware....we have had a horrendous experience at another location.  The staff are fun and interact with the customers a lot, especially if they talk you into ordering saki bombs!  This is a great place for groups and anyone wanting a fun, lively place to eat.. . We have tried a lot of sushi places over the last year and this is one we keep coming back to.  We LOVE the Rising Sun roll and always order more than one.  Our second favorite is the Gone With the Wind roll.  It is difficult to actually eat, but has a little of everything and very tasty.. . Make sure you leave room for dessert and order the Mochi.  It is ice cream covered in a rice dough  and drizzled with chocolate sauce.  Ever since we tried it, we go to Trader Joe's and get different flavors of this dessert between Ru Sans visits.. . The menu is EXTENSIVE, but the staff is always willing to make suggestions.  You may want to study it online to avoid being totally overwhelmed before you show up.
