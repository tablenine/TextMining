Category: Breakfast & Brunch
So what makes Yolk stand out from all the other breakfast joints? A more expansive menu, with crepes, lots of different french toasts, and a pretty decent variety of egg dishes.  There are definitely a few dishes that you don't see - such as a Santa Fe fritatta and egg-white omelets.  And for the kids, they've got smore's pancakes and lots of sweet stuff.  . . I had one of their skillets - eggs, cheddar, bacon, onion, and tomatoes.  I really liked the red potatoes they used in it, although they could've been cooked for about 10 minutes longer.  Above average toast as well.  . . The location is a little tricky - you can find street parking if a) you get real lucky or b) you have tons of patience to drive in circles around the near south loop.  Other than that, I believe there is validated parking nearby.. . The look and feel of the place is modern and somewhat nondescript, kind of like an old loft place with booths lining the perimeter and tables in the middle.  Other than the bar and open cooking area there was not too much to catch you eye.  . . One final note, this places works for kids and large groups.  I went with my friend and his three kids (and his parents) and they gave us a large table in the back and kids menus.  The waitress was great and the sugary pancakes and french toast were a hit with the kids - although I am not so sure if they were with the parental units.
