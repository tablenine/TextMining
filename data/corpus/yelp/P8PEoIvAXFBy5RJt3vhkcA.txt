I had the beef burrito..............uuummm okay. . your looking at spending 6+ dollars on food, i bought the kogi special beef burrito and no drink for exactly 6 bucks, pricey for me, but it was a big burrito so i guess that was pretty reasonable.... now dont get me wrong, i know Koreans are not meant to make burritos, but a burrito, is very hard to mess up..... typically burritos are made of beans rice meat tortilla cheese....not hard....and i have to give it to them to make it a little bit differently...but not so much for my taste..... the burrito was wet, meaning the meat juice, and the last couple bites were soaked, and not the good soaked.... the Â meat NOT MY FAVORITE part of it... the burrito is a sweeter taste, just like Korean BBQ should be, but its not very good in burrito form, the rice was soggy and the peppers/cilantro ingredients that they used were not chopped up right. no cheese, no hot sauce. (good they didn't put that in...)it did have good flavor though, don't get me wrong, but the burrito didn't do it for me, also the meat in the burrito had fat! AND LOTS OF IT. if your like me and cant stand the fat of meat, then don't eat the burrito, there was barely any meat in the darn thing to begin with and it was all fat chunks, no thanks!. ill try this place again, in the FAR future and ill reedit my review then, but for now, me no likie...... . enjoy, . tee hee
