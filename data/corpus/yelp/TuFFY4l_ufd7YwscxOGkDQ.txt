This is a good place to eat meat.  I think I might have had a meat hangover when I finished.  My favorite by a long shot was the "House Special."  I did not like the lamb or pork.  Do NOT even think of coming here if you are a vegetarian.  This is a MEAT restaurant and you will only have the mediocre salad bar to choose from.. . The experience was a bit overwhelming.  Waiter attack you with bad gaucho pants  wielding spears of meat.  If you are "green" (which is a card that says you want to be served) the waiters come in droves and do not stop until your plate is piled with meat.. . The meat is really the star of the show.  The sides are all carbs--fried polenta, mashed potatoes, fried plantains.  I would have liked to see something greener.  It would have rounded out my meal.
