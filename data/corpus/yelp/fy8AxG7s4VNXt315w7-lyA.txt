Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
I hear very mixed reviews about Ford's. Some say the food is great, others think it's overrated.. . This was the 2nd day of celebration (right down the street from the night before) and the bf wanted to take me here since we'd both never been. . . The moment we walked in, we were seated and our server said he was honored to be our first. I admit I took a while to decide on what to eat (nothing on the menu really stood out to me), and ended up getting the burger. I'm a real man when it comes to burgers, and I was a little worried they'd be the type of place that chars the crap out of the patty. To my delight, it was nice and pink through the center. The bread was a nice rustic roll. My only beef was that they give shredded lettuce that falls out of the burger, and that they gave onion rings when I expected fries.. . Also got the mac &amp; cheese since I was still craving it from last night. Theirs is a nice upgrade from the blue box - that Fresno chili gives it a nice kick without the punch-in-the-face heat. Coulda done without the ham/bacon bits though. . . Was actually way too full for desert. Yeah, my bf was just as shocked as I was. We went to 7-11 and got Slurpees instead. Word.
