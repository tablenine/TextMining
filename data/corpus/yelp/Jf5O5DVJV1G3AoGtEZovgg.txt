Delicious! I had the black-eyed pea hummus with homemade sweet potato chips to start, and the North Atlantic Skate Wing for dinner, and the warm fudge tart for dessert. Though it was a little loud, we could still hear everyone at the table. Loved that the desserts were smaller. My husband loved the calamari he had, and the shrimp and grits were also a hit. We would definitely go back.
