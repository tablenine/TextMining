Philly... Cheesesteak ....Pizza. Do Â I have to write more?. . OK: Yes, this place gets slammed. It's in Wriglevyille and after games it's something of a zoo. Also, there's very limited seating, so chances are your going to be getting your slice to go, but what incredible slices they are--oversized, thin crust, with a beguiling list of ingredients. Besides the Philly, I also love the black bean and guacamole and the regular sausage with mushrooms. It's one of the most innovative and consistent pizzerias to arrive in Chicago in several years. Highly recommended in every way.
