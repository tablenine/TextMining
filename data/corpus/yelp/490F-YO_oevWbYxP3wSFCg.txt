The first time I was here (out on a Saturday before I knew not to come), I'm pretty sure I hallucinated that SMOKIN' AWESOME time I had. I talked to everyone about this place and gave it rave reviews! Came back with some out of town friends-- just to show yall how wrong I was, we went to Two Urban Licks and then I made everyone come here-- wow was I super embarrassed how terrible that decision was. Sure, it was crowded, but no dancing upstairs, just lame-os standing around. On the main floor, rowdy obnoxious girls yelling at each other and dancing on the ballet bars (clas-sy) and sketchy guys practicing their prowler moves. Hence, I drank too much to wash the ick away...this story does not end well.
