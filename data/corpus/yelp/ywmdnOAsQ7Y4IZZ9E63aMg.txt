Restaurant: The Marlay House
Category: Pubs
I'm a big fan of this place for a variety of reasons.  It never seems to be as crowded or loud as some of the other restaurants in downtown Decatur, and it is possible to have a conversation.  You can basically disappear in a booth and not worry about crowds coming and going.  Or you can sit at the bar and enjoy drunken revelry.  Or on the patio for some ideal people watching.  I've never had to wait for a table here, even on the weekends.. . The food is typical Irish pub fare.  My favorite is the Guiness braised brisket with mashed potatoes.  The meat is fork tender and you come away comforted.  A close second is the bangers and mash.  Third would be the fish and chips.  I've tried other entrees, but those are the three that stand out.  The beer selection isn't extensive, but is well thought out and you can find some quality here.  They also do a brunch on the weekends, if you don't feel like waiting in line at the other places.
