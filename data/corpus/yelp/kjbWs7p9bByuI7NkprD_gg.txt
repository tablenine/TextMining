Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I could write all day, well maybe not all day, but for a really long time about how amazing these tacos are... but I won't. I'm just going to say that the women who run this place, (middle aged hispanic women) operate quickly, cleanly, efficiently, godly, etc. They, alongside the super friendly owner, make this place what it is.
