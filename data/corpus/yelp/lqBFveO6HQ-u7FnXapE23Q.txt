This place was pretty disappointing, and I think it was mainly the service. I swear, anything we specially requested, the waitress did NOT get. My friend asked for a "BLT without the T,' but she got a BLT without the L, lol. Someone else ordered a oreo milkshake with chocolate ice cream mixed in, and she JUST brought a plain chocolate shake. Come on now... She didn't even have a lot of tables. If you can't remember, then write it down!!!
