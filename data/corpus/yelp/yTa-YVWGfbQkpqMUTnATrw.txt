Every time I leave Agave I say, "That's the best meal I've ever had there."  It happened again this weekend.  Agave gets better and better, outdoing itself with every visit.  Located in funky Cabbagetown, this eclectic Southwestern eatery hits on all cylinders - service, drinks and food.. . You'll be greeted at the door by a host or manager and seated promptly, unless you arrive during prime time on the weekend when reservations are recommended.  Once seated service is attentive, friendly and relaxed and you won't be forgotten once your food arrives.  You'd be remiss not to grab the best margarita in town.  These are truly terrific margaritas, made with fresh squeezed lime juice, not some mix that arrives pre-bottled.  When ordering you could close your eyes and point to the menu and land on any number of stellar entrees.  Try their signature dish, Cayenne Fried Chicken, at least once.  I've sampled about half the menu and everything I've tried is stellar.  What currently has me singing their praises like a Baptist preacher on Sunday are Chile Seared Jumbo Diver Sea Scallops served over creamy fire roasted tomato and Serrano stone ground grits.  That's a lot of flavor.  And don't tell me you don't like collard greens until you've had their honey cider collards.  It will make a believer out of you.  . . This is upscale eclectic Southwestern food, not Tex-Mex as some reviews erroneously state.   . . Discounts and specials abound if you sign up for their email newsletter.
