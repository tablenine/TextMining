Restaurant: Mana Food Bar
Category: Vegetarian
I thought Mana was a nice upscale restaurant. I had the hummus, which was good and full of garlic, but the pita isn't Vegan so I had to eat it with just vegetables. Some of the other stuff looked really good and I hear the lasagna is very good as well [it's not Vegan, but Vegetarian. If you want to impress your veggie girlfriend/boyfriend, this would be a nice place to take them, otherwise, there aren't many Vegan options.
