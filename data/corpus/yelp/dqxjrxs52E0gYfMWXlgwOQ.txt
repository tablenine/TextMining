Okay, people. [vurst-k(ih+oo)-(voiceless palatal fricative)uh] That's how you pronounce it. If that doesn't help you, just refer to it as "That delicious wiener place!" It makes sense and hopefully it will get you some giggles.. . And I rate this as absolutely delicious. I have only tried their vegetarian selection so far, but I'm hooked. The rolls are FANTASTIC and the peppers and onions (to me) are the only way to go.. . Oh yeah, and the truffle fries are out of this world. You won't want to eat fries anywhere else because you'll miss how crispy and deliciously earthy these taste. And the dipping sauces are mostly great, too. [I've had the buttermilk ranch, thai peanut, curry ketchup, and tzatziki-- the honey mustard was lacking.]. . Schnazzy interior, great beer selection, even cucumber-infused water (unnecessary, but I appreciate the extra effort)! Is there anything this place doesn't have?
