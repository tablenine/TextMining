Every time I eat here I'm reminded of why I love this place: cozy non-pretentious atmosphere, short wine glasses and generous portions of excellent pasta.  I always enjoy the duck  tortellini with the simple Mista salad before. The lasagna is vegetarian and one of the best in the City.  Plus, the outdoor seating in the summer is great for relaxing and sipping wine.
