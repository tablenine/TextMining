Roscoe's lives up to it's hype! It's been a while since I've been here! I need to go again!. . POSITIVES:. -THE FOOD...everything there is great!. . -THE LEMONADE looks and tastes great! look at everyone's pictures if you don't believe me!. . -Every now and then, you will catch famous athletes and peoples here. When I went here before, the whole UCLA basketball team stopped by.. . -I believe they filmed a scene from "First Sunday" here.. . -The people outside sometimes sell good stuff! haha!. . NEGATIVES:. -the drive if you're far.. . -parking can suck, but people are going in and out of this place...it really depends on the time you go here.. . FINAL THOUGHTS/SUGGESTIONS:. -Try the "BIG MAMA SPECIAL"....enough said.
