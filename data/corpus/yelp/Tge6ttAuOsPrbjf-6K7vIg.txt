Who hasn't been to Portos? Everytime I have to go out of town or visit friends. First thing they ask us is, Can you bring some Portos cheese rolls please? Their pastries are great and priced right. I like this location better than the original one in Glendale. Â It's newer, bigger, and closer to me. Plus plenty of parking. . . My favs are the cheese rolls, guava rolls, banana nut muffin, media noche sandwich, ham and cheese croissant, mushroom soup, fruit tart, tres leches, and opera.
