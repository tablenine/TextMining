Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Wow!  There is no Korean BBQ place even half as good as this place!  Came here after 13 hours of poker spread out over two days at Bike Casino.  What a fun place to eat at.  The inside  is very nicely decorated in a modern, cozy style.. . The service is perfect; the meats that I tried here are out of this world.  Try the dish for three (I think it's the letter C dish, which goes for about 59.99) and you have the liberty of eating the ribeye (beautifully caramelized meat), pork belly (ummm!), chicken, and an awesome brisket.  They come with a sweet soy sauce and a nice salty sesame oil sauce that you dip the meat in.. . The staff even assist in cooking it for you.  Also, you get the usual kimchee and other pickled vegetables: all first class.. . Easily, I will find a reason to come back to Los Angeles just to come here again.  The best Korean BBQ experience of my life.  The Korean in the SF Bay Area just doesn't come close to this.
