Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's Bakery is one of my favorite places in Burbank.   Especially, I love chocorate croissant because it is appropriate sweetness (not too sweet).  . . As many people point out, this place has limited parking space.  However, I will go back to this place over and over again for the chocorate croissant!!
