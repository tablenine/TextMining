Versailles is an LA classic.  It's a great place for a quick lunch and a great place to take out-of-town guests for an inexpensive but delicious dinner experience. . . The garlic chicken is probably the most popular dish, but I don't enjoy cutting the meat off of bones, so I prefer the (unbreaded) "chicken steak" which is simply chicken breast in the same sauce. . . For the biggest explosion of flavor, try the roasted pork ("number 1"). There's nothing quite like slightly fatty shredded pork smothered in garlic, butter, and onions with a bit of lemon for flavor. . . Lunch specials (in the $6-7 range) are slightly smaller than dinner portions, but you still will not leave hungry.  The lunch specials normally come with french fries, but you can substitute their delicious cooked plantains (they'll let you call them "bananas") for $0.50 extra. . . Lunch parties get seated almost immediately, but show up early for dinner as you'll have to wait in line on the benches outside.
