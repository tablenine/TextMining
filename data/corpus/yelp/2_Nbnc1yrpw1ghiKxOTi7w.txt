Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
This is my all time favorite deep dish pizza.  I love their crust it is like no other, crunchy outside and soft inside.  They are generous with the toppings and not too much sauce.  I never eat inside the restaurant...always take out or delivery.  I can't imagine having people see me eat half a med. deep dish in one sitting by myself. Only with Lou Malnati's.  It's a good thing they offer low fat cheese and you really can't taste the difference.  And I've tried with butter crust and without  and the taste isn't that much different so if want to save a small number of calories skip the extra butter crust and go for the low fat cheese.
