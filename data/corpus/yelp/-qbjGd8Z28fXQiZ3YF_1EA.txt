Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
taste. taste of pretension. taste of typical west hollywood melrose avenue frou frou ness that i neither need or care to have in my life. least of all in my brunch.. . the menu selection is good. i ordered crabcakes benedict in the thought that two of my favorite foods: crabcakes and eggs benedict, would make a good combination. they do except for the fact that the dish was overcooked. mind you, it wasn't bad, but you figure if the cook is already messing up breakfast on a less than busy day, well..... . the experience wouldn't stop me from coming here again except looking upon the dishes the rest of my yelp friends ordered, it didn't make me wish i'd ordered something different. none of their dishes which included a club sandwich, grilled cheese, and a kobe beef hamburger (not a big red meat eater here) looked promising enough to warrant another visit.. . their prices are reasonable and the decor is chic and clean which would have been the nail in the coffin for a repeat visit if these two points hadn't been up to par. but again i wouldn't drive up from long beach or for that matter anywhere within a five mile radius exclusively for this place.
