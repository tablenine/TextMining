I love this place!  The food is great overall, but the Sunday brunch has the best blueberry pancakes I've ever had.  They are absolutely delicious and are served with this amazing tempeh bacon, hash browns and fruit.  Nom nom nom!  For a while the La Cienega location was the only one that offered Sunday brunch, but now the Santa Monica location also offer it.  More places to get your hands on some of those blueberry pancakes!. Now that I've established that RFD has the best blueberry pancakes in the history of the world, let me also establish that I am not a vegan.  I am, in fact, quite the meat eater, and I have never had a bad meal at RFD.  If you don't head over for Sunday brunch, their dinner options are awesome, too.  The TV dinner, any of the taco dishes and the burger are all amazing.  They also have an amazing capuccino that I recommend trying out as well.  . The La Cienega location is also great to go and grab a bite if you are looking to do a little people watching.  I have been to this location a bunch of times and only once or twice have I been there that I didn't see at least one celebrity.. And finally, RFD is super affordable and the service is great.  And, have I mentioned the blueberry pancakes?
