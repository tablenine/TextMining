Restaurant: Cafe 28
Category: Cuban
Every time I've been to this place I have been impressed. Great food, great drinks, great service. Â Cafe 28 is like a hidden gem, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you're inside the upbeat Latin music and colorful decor make you want to eat some delicious Cuban food!. And drink some great mojitos!
