I love Bite, it's right round the corner from our place and it's a great, hip spot for brunch and lunch (never been to dinner there). Seems some yelpers are put off by the staff. I agree the servers are rather laid back and don't put on the fake cheery attitude you'll see at Bennigan's, but that actually fits the place, simple yet recherch√©. You sit where you want and everybody around you is beautiful and looks as if was 1991. The falafel platter is amazing, and so are most specials. We always bring a bottle of wine, pick up the Onion and Reader in the doorway and get a great lunch for $6-8 dollars each.
