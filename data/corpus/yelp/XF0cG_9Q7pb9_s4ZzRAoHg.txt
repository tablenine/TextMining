Five star view, 2 or 3 star food.   Go up for the view and some drinks, maybe an appetizer or two and have dinner somewhere else.   . . The restaurant literally has a view of everything LA - absolutely incredible.   If you make a reservation, ask to sit at a window - we got stuck in the Zen garden area with zero view.. . The speciality cocktail when we were there was a Moscow Mule with housemade ginger beer.   Fantastic and served in a traditional copper cup, although quite pricey.. . The appetizers were decent, from carpaccio to crab cakes to edamame.   The entrees and rolls were very spendy and were only OK - nothing fabulous.   Sushi was fair...
