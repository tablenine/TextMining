If you're a recent transfer to Los Angeles and want to have the prototypical LA dining experience, i suggest you pull out the piggybank, smash it against your head, and head on down to Beverly Hills, cuz that's where you wanna be... Last time i was here, that lead singer from Sugar Ray was there with a few hotties; apparently his name isn't Sugar Ray, and he's reinvented himself into a game show host or something.  All of the people's comments on this page about the tragicomic social scene is wonderfully true, and makes surprisingly good sauce for the meal.. . And what a meal.  I had the tower of seafood for appetizer, all fresh and of superb quality.  Gorgonzola mac n'cheese- a perfect example of proletariat decadence.  Lobster mashed potatoes.  And wonderful creamy-creamed spinach.  So that was about a thousand calories, and i'm not at the meat yet!  I had a chance to sample some of the lamb, bone in filet, and ribeye thanks to some communal friend sharing policies.  I can't even remember the cut i got- it was definitely something near the bone of course... and this isn't some fancy schmancy wagyu beef, this was usda grade-a buttered corn-fed american goodness.  Best Uptown steak i've had outside of Las Vegas.
