More so wine bar... Less so bistro... . . I went here with a few friends on a Friday night, and I would say it was over all so-so. I agree with one of the below reviewers- who said the flat bread was bland.  I think the food was overall pretty bland and boring.  With that said we got a cheese plate that had some DELICIOUS cheeses on it.  Yum! . . Ambience- nice lighting, posh decor, decent crowd, but nothing really spectacular. . . I might go back for cheese and wine only.
