best eggs benedict i've ever had in chicago...there is a secret spot to get the best eggs benedict i've ever had in my life which is in champaign, but i digress.  the truffle hollandaise is out of this world.  the vibe in toast is perfect as well...just make sure you bring a paper to read while you wait or get there early.  my husband loves the burrito and my kids love the french toast.  oh and i almost forgot, the waitresses indulge my flirtatious nephew who use to live a few blocks away.  once he actually starts dating successfully, we'll credit the wait staff to the development of his early mating dances.
