Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Everyone on the Westside always talks about Titos Tacos.  Titos Tacos always has long lines that stretch out the door.  This place must be spectacular, right? Wrong.  Tito's is ordinary at best.  Cheap, filling, greasy, but definitely ordinary.  I ordered one shredded beef taco (sorry, hard shell only--albeit a homemade shell far better than the mass produced junk at taco bell) and one bean and cheese burrito.  The taco was bland, slightly dry, and needed an extra dose of the not-so-hot salsa to try to give it more flavor and moisture.  Next, I tried my bean and cheese burrito.  This was better than the taco, and was filled with a gooey, savory combination of cheese and refried beans.  Cheap, yes.  Filling, yes.  Worth the wait and the difficult parking? Probably not.
