I took my sister to Fork &amp; Screen for her birthday, and our experience was just ok.  The set up is really cool.  When you walk in, the bar area is nice, and the actual theater has tables for 2 or a bar area for a group.  The food is what brings the rating down.  The food here is disgusting.  I took one bite of my burger, and I couldn't take another bite.  It was that bad.  The typical movie meal of popcorn, nachos, and a hotdog is delicious compared to what Fork &amp; Screen is serving.  The reason people come to Fork &amp; Screen is obviously because of the convenience of getting dinner and a movie, but i won't be making a return trip.
