Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Mexican
I was always skeptical about trying Rosa Mexicano but a friend from out of town swore by it so we went here. I was thoroughly impressed and thought the food was excellent!. . To sum it up quick:. -great margaritas! They had a pomgranite special which was very tasty!. -table side guac was DIVINE! We asked for it extra spicy and it was perfect!. -entrees were cooked well and tasted great.. . All in all, i would go back here if i wanted a nice sit down mexican good place or if i wanted some OUTSTANDING guacamole. Yummy!
