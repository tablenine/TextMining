Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
I don't know if every upscale, outdoor cafe, bakery and coffee house needs to be named with the letter "A" but if you have been to Aroma in Studio City and the Abbey in West Hollywood, you have also (figuratively) been to the Alcove Cafe &amp; Bakery.. . I've only lived in L.A. for 13 years, so I had never heard of this place until yesterday. It is in a modernizing section of Hillhurst in Los Feliz, where gelato, free range green tea hair conditioner and stainless steel chairs have been pushing out hardware stores and key shops.. . But the Alcove is highly charming with its elaborate display cases full of sugary cakes and cookies, and the requisite espressos and capuccinos.  The decor is high royal faggot crown moldings with seven layers of Ralph Lauren painted walls in mocha brown. The glass and floors are neurotically clean and continually polished and wiped.. . I reckon you can order lunch, breakfast and dinner here, but be forewarned, I paid $6.50 for one slice of a rum soaked tart.. . Outside its all umbrellas and flowers and pretty young things with straw hats, henna tattoos and flip-flops. There are gurgling fountains, gargoyles and fragrant vines to drown out the adjoining talk about box office numbers and "that dude who is in my yoga class!" It's very L.A. but I've come to the conclusion that this can be an attribute not an insult.. . This is a good place to meet a date, or a friend, or a business associate, because there is privacy and nobody has to pick up the collective tab, you just pay for yourself and sit down. No tipping.
