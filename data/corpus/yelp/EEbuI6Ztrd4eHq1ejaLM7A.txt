This is a great place for drinks and appetizers with a group of friends, but I would not recommend it for dinner. . . I've been here several times before I decided to write a review. It seems like it doesn't matter what day you are there, they are ALWAYS packed and super busy. Some of the staff I've meet are great, accommodating, and nice and some are not. I think it's a hit or miss just depending upon who you get as your server. . . The hostess stand on the other hand may need an attitude change (just like many of the trendy bars/restaurants in Chicago). They are rude and very unaccommodating. If you are expecting to be here with a group of people, reservations are highly recommendated. . . Some of their drinks are unique and quite tasty such as the Bubble-tini and Cool-Aid. The food is also a hit or miss - just depending on what you get. I've tried several things on their menu and can honestly say the only thing I've liked is the mac and cheese muffins with side of cheese sauce (the only thing that makes the whole plate). Even the food is quite mediocre, however I do give them an A- for presentation. The popcorn shrimp served in a cute old-fashioned popcorn container and the cotton candy is served in a little shopping cart. It definitely is true that you eat with your eyes first, so if it's served in a cute presentation, it's supposed to taste better, right??? Or maybe not... . . If you are looking for a trendy bar in the West Loop, enjoy a few drinks, and take advantage of the outside patio or rooftop, then this is the place for you.
