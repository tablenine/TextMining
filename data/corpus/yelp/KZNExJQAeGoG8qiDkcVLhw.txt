I wanted to like this place b/c it's the perfect little outdoor place for breakfast and/or lunch. But ordering is a pain in the ass and it's sooo busy that it's not worth the hassle for food that isn't spectacular. I was bummed with my veggie burger. It was very bland - hardly had any flavor. My husband's dish was OK, but again lacked in the "wow factor" My friend had a salad and that did look pretty damn good. If I had to go back, I would try a salad, but I most likely wont be back here unless I'm in the neighborhood and someone else insists on going here. The desserts do look amazing and the outdoor seating area is nice but not worth the wait.
