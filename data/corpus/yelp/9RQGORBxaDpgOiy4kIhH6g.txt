Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
was going to come for vdai and they were supposed to close at 10 but they closed at 9:30 ...my boo &amp; i got locked in their parking lot and had to call the cops to get us out...so we went bak the next morning to pik up his kar and ate lunch there...good amount of ppl went for opening hours . . i'd say im a fan tho not of their burgers...their onion rings w/roasted GARLIC aioli is just so damn good!. . Tempura Onion Rings $3: mmm...nicely seasoned &amp; perfectly crunchy! Â . Umami Burger $10: i honestly don't see what the big fuss is about. Port &amp; Stilton Burger $9: not a fan of blue cheese but if i were i'm sure i'd like it. the portion sizes of the burgers are pretty small for that price...they're not much bigger than a mcD Big Mac but it's still a mouthful.... . service: great! and they informed us that they just got the beef in and it's organic free range . . atmosphere: omg it's so kute...they have sketches on the wall and the inside is clean &amp; gives an eco friendly vibe...very small place tho...a lot of the tables are sittin right next to each other . . parking: private lot
