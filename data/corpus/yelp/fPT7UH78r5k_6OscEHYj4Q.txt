OK, I love that place, but not for its food. The food is a fusion of Japanese cuisine with some other stuff, which I couldn't really define. My preference is always classical Japanese, that's why I am not a huge fan of their dishes. But I love it for its atmosphere. It is so elegant and charming and romantic! You can sit by the window and enjoy the view of the whole LA with the night lights and everything. It has beautiful Japanese garden inside and its just a pure delight to be there. Another one of those places where you can create some extraordinary and special memories.
