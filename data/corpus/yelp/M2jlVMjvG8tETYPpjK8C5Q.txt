I stopped into Parish for brunch after a friend recommended it.  I met some other friends (who had already ate) at the bar, and ordered the green eggs and ham.  It was a cute name for a tasty dish.  The first layer on the plate was a base of home fries.  The next layer was a delicious ham steak, then eggs, all topped with a nice chimichurri to add the green.  I haven't had such tasty ham in a long time!  The drink menu was good, too, with some tasty offerings.  They served one of my favorite drinks a little different though..  A dark'n'stormy with a twist!  The bartender was wonderful, too.  Mallory was charming and engaging, and had the gift of a great bartender.  She served us many drinks and a hefty tab at the end.   I would return despite what turned out to be what probably turned into my most expensive brunch ever.  The breakfast was only $14, but the cocktails added up after the first couple hours! ;)
