Restaurant: Alon&#39;s
Category: Bakeries
Our picnic planning party purchased grilled salmon, pepper crusted tuna, Israeli couscous, fruit salad, spring rolls, a blueberry muffin, and a raisin scone. The bakery items were a highlight, but everything was quite good. Expect to pay for all this freshness, though.. . In addition, I also highly recommend the coffee bar items, in particular the cafe au lait.
