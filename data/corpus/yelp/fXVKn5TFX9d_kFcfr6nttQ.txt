I heard / read really good review about this place and was really looking forward to try it.  Bf also said he's been here before and food was great.  But on the night we went, everything was just terrible.  The cod cake was served cold.  Fried food served cold?  It just tasted yucky.  The Paella was like a soupy porridge.  The portion was so small and it was $18.  The Skirt Steak smelt great when it was brought to our table.  But when we cut it and tried it, it was so burnt that it was barely edible.  We didn't even bother to send it back because we just didn't want their food anymore.  But I thought the dessert wouldn't be that bad and ordered Churros and Chocolate.  Man, it was bad.  The churros were so greasy.  Usually I'd lick my dessert plate clean.  But I had two bites of the churros and gave up.  What happened?  Did I just go on a bad night?
