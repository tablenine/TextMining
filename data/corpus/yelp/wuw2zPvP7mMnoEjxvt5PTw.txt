This is one of the best seafood rest in the area. they are little bit priecy. their crabs are fresh and their sauce is very salty and spicy ! it's perfect with beer ! but get ready to get your hands dirty cuz they dont take the carbs apart. they give you the whole thing ! Â you have to do all the dirty works ! hahahaa
