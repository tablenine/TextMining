Restaurant: Sushi House Hayakawa
Category: Japanese
Finally decided to check this place out.  I have to agree the reviews from yelp- the sushi is top notch.  I sat at the bar and had chef Hayakawa prepare me his choices of sashimi and nigiri.  The offering reminded me a lot of eating sushi in San Francisco (which is the sushi capital of the U.S. in my opinion).  The selections were very original and very fresh.  This isn't a place to get Americanized sushi (you know, the crap covered in mayo and "crunchies").  This place is all about the fish.  5-stars all the way.
