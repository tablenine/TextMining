Restaurant: Little Bangkok
Category: Chinese
How did Little Bangkok fall off our radar for over five years?  That wasn't fair of us!  It's literally the "hole in the wall" Cheshire Bridge neighborhood restaurant with a quirky elbow-to-elbow charm and terrific food.. . At dinnertime, you can park at the office building next door.  After a 15-minute wait outside, we were finally seated.  We ordered a  firepot of Tom Yum (i.e., peppery seafood and chicken) soup.  The sterno-fueled firepot was unwieldy but kept our broth perfectly warm.  I loved my spicy shrimp dish; Ms. D also made a great choice with a cashew broccoli number.  The spiciness never overwhelmed the other flavors.   We both ordered Thai rice dishes, but they also serve Chinese.  When received our check 45 minutes later, there were people still waiting for tables so we were sure not to "hog" ours.  . . Little Bangkok has a good casual "date" ambience; you can learn a lot about your company from how he or she reacts to being there.
