Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
If my office was like Father's Office, I would never leave work. Let's face it - at work, I don't have food service (well... the delivery around the office isn't as good as F.O.) and my liquor, beer, and wine selection is limited to what's in my desk or the office fridge for the day.. . My friend and I met for dinner early on Saturday night. The parking is free (yay) and F.O. shares its lots with a handful of furniture stores and 2 or 3 other food joints. It was about 6:30pm, and we were lucky enough to snag a table outside on the patio after ordering. There is an amazing selection of beer and wine on tap, including a rather satisfying white wine from one of the Santa Ynez wineries. My friend got a stout beer that tasted familiarly of chocolate, but I can't seem to remember the name of it.. . We started off with the bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizer, which came with 4 perfectly cooked shrimp. It didn't taste like anything special, but can you really go wrong with bacon-wrapped shrimp? We continued with some mind-blowing beef bone marrow served with toast points. It was my friend's first time having bone marrow, which I insisted on ordering since I've been craving it for a time, and I'm pretty sure that I've converted him!. . For our main course, we absolutely had to split The Office Burger - medium-rare dry aged beef, caramelized onion, applewood bacon compote, gruyere, matag blue cheese and arugula on a heavenly bun. Yum! Blood red in the center, the thick beef patty and its toppings makes my top 5 burgers list. We tossed in a side of amazing shoestring fries for $2.50 more, and I was more stuffed than a Thanksgiving turkey.. . I would definitely recommend F.O. for friend outings, dates, or what-have-you. 21+ only. They card even in broad daylight.
