I got a groupon and my boyfriend had been interested in checking this place out so I figured what to we have to lose.  I'm happy I checked out it but its not a place I can imagine having a craving to go back to.  Its a spot for people who just love meat.  The sandwiches must have had a pound each.  . . That said I can't give it more than 2 stars because its just not my forte.  If you want a pile of greasy food, then check it out.  I mean its unique in its own right, but I don't think I'll go back.  I felt sick when I left from all the greasy pastrami.  Not a big fan
