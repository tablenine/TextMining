Restaurant: Cafe Selmarie
Category: American (Traditional)
Goodness gracious! This is the kind of cafe that can make a neighborhood a destination, and it looks like Cafe Selmarie has done just that for Lincoln Square. I recently had lunch here for the first time, and I was back for brunch the next morning, it was that good. The wait can verge on ridiculous, but if you call ahead, they'll add your name to the list. I recommend that strategy. I also recommend the croque monsieur. :)
