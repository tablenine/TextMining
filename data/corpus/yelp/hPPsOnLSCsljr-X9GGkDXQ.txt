Sometimes you just gotta break the carb-less diet for some man meat between a pair of soft crusty buns. . . Mistor Lee's buns are not too shabby... 3 for a dolla, that made me holla. The secret to a good banh mi sammie here is the timing. When the bread comes out fresh from the oven it's amazing but when you go late they get kinda stale. At $2.50 a pop who can really complain about a giant sammie that can feed a family of 5... Especially on Buford Hwy. Muy bien!. . The gwilled pork banh mi is the standard. Thick slices of red glazed pork is tender at every bite. The special combo is pure offal and tastee at the same time. The best banh mi in town? I think Quoc Huong still holds the title.. . I don't know what underworld syndicate runs Chambodia but every banh mi shop have the same special... Buy 5 get 1 fwee. . . CÃ¡m on!!!. . Burp.
