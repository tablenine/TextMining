Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
PROS: Amazing food, colorful atmosphere, parking a plenty. . 4.5*. My first time there I had the V-Burger, their version of a steak burger, and after the first bite went into catatonic shock. I hadn't tasted anything that close to the real thing since I used to eat the real thing.. . In December they had a promotion for comping lunch for your office. I picked up their pre-made tray of Santa Fe Crispy Chicken burgers, Baja Fiesta salad, and Carrot Cake. Of us four at my work, I was the only vegan/vegetarian although the others are health-conscious. Well everybody seriously loved the food and went back for seconds. I was relieved since a worry for me is turning meat-eaters off of vegan food. . . I ate three of the carrot cake slices in one sitting; it was unbelievably moist, perfectly sweet, and so damn good. I'm not even a huge carrot cake or cream-frosting fan. You just wouldn't believe it was dairy-free.. . Also, join their e-newsletter and they mail you a coupon for a free entre during the month of your birthday!
