Restaurant: Miller&#39;s Pub
Category: Steakhouses
Love Miller's Pub. It holds such good memories for me and for my family.. Over the years my mom and I would come here for lunch after Christmas shopping at Marshall Fields, going to the Christkindl market or after seeing The Christmas Carol play. This place oozes coziness in every facet of it's wooden trim and beautiful windows. The food is comforting (see hot turkey sandwich and mashed potatoes) and very good. We came here with the whole family last year around the holidays and though we are a small group, all eight of us found something we could live with and enjoy. A big triumph not so much for me mind you, but for the picky eaters of my brood.. For me, this place will always be synonymous with family, holidays and fond memories.
