Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
Oprah says this is her favorite Mexican restaurant in Chicago, but she must be confused.  This place serves weak drinks, mediocre food and most of the staff isn't even Spanish, let alone Mexican!  Top that all off with outrageous prices and you have yourself a real bust for dinner.
