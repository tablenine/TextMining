Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I don't know if I can say if it is the BEST pizza in all of LA, but it is really damn good.  My hubby has been eating here since he was a little kid - unfortunately we don't eat here quite as much anymore due to the heinous crowds (especially on the weekends).  . . I guess it's my fault since every time I go here I happen to be STARVING, and by the time I get to eat I'm so famished I practically inhale my plate and don't really have time to relax and enjoy myself.   I swear that it's not worth the lines and I won't go back... but I always inevitably do! . . If you want to try out the place, go on a weeknight, the crowds aren't *quite* as bad.
