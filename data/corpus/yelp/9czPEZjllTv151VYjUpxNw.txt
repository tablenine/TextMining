went to reza's last nite for dinner and had a great experience. the service started out kind of slow but then got much better. we had falafel for our appetizer and it was so yummy! then we got our soups which were also very good (we had vegetable and chicken soup) and for our entree i had lamb kebobs and my husband had lamb loin chops. they were awesome! the portions were huge! we ended up taking some home. we (i) decided that we should get dessert so we tried the raspberry cheesecake and it was probably the best cheesecake i have ever had! overall it was a great experience. i highly recommend and will definitely be back!
