Yum.   This is my kind of sushi.  I lived in DC for a year and the thing I missed most was places like Bob San.   . . My favorite rolls are the original dragon; the mayo spicy tuna or taco; and the house crunch.  Some of their handrolls are really interesting too.  And if you like sweet sauces, the pan seared scallops can't be beat (they are flattened and seared and then covered in a sweet bbq-like sauce).  . . After the expansion, you generally can get a reservation without too much difficulty--which is a welcome difference from many sushi places in the West Loop.  Living about a block away, we also do take-out from this place often, and they are always prompt in preparing the order. . . It's a great choice on the weekday night when the weather is great. The patio is fantastic for people watching and sipping a glass of wine... . I ended up with a 4- instead of 5-star because I would much prefer Mirai or Coast if given the choice (Mirai when I'm in the mood for the lychee martini and more complex favors; and Coast when I'm in the mood for BYOB and simple but good rolls).  Oh, and because the miso soup is a bit overpriced.
