Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Best shabu house in all of los angeles county. Probably is one of the oldest shabu places in little tokyo and most well known. Prepare to wait around 2 hours during lunch time. The service is fast and attentive but you definitely feel pressured to eat super fast because there's a lot of people waiting. The price is definitely reasonable for shabu shabu, I would definitely go during lunch hour because of the lunch special prices. The ice coffee is done just right, probably the best ice coffee i have ever tasted. And the rice is like crack, it is unlimited refill but it taste sooo good. Definitely not the place to go if you want to chit chat with your gf or a date or friends, and definitely not for large parties. You can tell this place is delicious because there would be 2 hour lines at this place but empty at all the others, and people are always so patient to wait in line here. Even my father, who is probably the most impatient person in the world, would wait in line to eat here, and/or send me to wait in line and call me when we're almost called lol... the old man working there might seem mean at first, but that's because he works both the lunch and dinner shift, and have been working for over a decade at the same place, but if you catch him when there's not so many people, he is the nicest, cutest old man ever. The whole staff has been working there for years. And the best is, after your meal you can hop over 100 feet next door to the ce fiore for fro yo.. yumm.!
