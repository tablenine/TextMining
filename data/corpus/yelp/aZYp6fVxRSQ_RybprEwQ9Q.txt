Restaurant: Coobah
Category: Latin American
I love Coobah. The food blows my mind every time, and the mojitos are AMAZING. I could drink them like juice. I wish they made them to go so I could sip on one all day long. It's worth the trip to Coobah just for the mojitos (but then you get to eat delicious food, too). . . The staff is incredibly friendly. I planned a birthday party for my friend there, and they accommodated us in the back room and were super nice about us staying for a really long time. I knocked a star off because every time I go in there it's so loud my friends and I have to yell across the table to each other in order to have a conversation. If they'd turn the musician's mic down just a little bit, they'd get the full five stars.
