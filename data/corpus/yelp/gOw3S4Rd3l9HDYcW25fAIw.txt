Delicious! This place is so hip!. . I came here for a Saturday lunch with a friend since we both haven't tried it before and he heard it was good. Also, I requested something light and not to heavy.. . First and foremost, you can see your food being made which I'm always a fan of. You come in and order at the front and walk down what appears to be like those cafeteria lines (but it's not) and watch your food come together. Everything looked so good.. . I ordered the herb brushed albacore tuna sandwich. It comes with a salad and you can choose between the arugula or spinach. I chose arugula which came with some diced tomatoes and dressing. My friend ordered the marinated flat iron steak sandwich. The tuna is seared and rare in the middle - very very delicious. The tuna is also very fresh, not so chewy. We split the sandwich so we each got to try each other's. The steak was cooked at medium rare and very well. I am normally not a fan of medium rare but it was very very good to me. They have an aioli sauce in their sandwich which is amaaazinggg!. . Anyways, I definitely recommend this place for the food. It taste very fresh. The atmosphere is really nice too especially on a sunny weekend. I would suggest going their for a lunch on the weekend. . . Also, if you're a vegan, a definite place to go!
