I'm not raving about how this place is the finest in Seafood, I'll give that credit to other seafood joints, but that's not to take away from the fact that their food is still very good. I went here for a New Year's Eve dinner, and really had a great time.. . I loved perhaps the over the top place settings and attempt to be fine dining, It was really a beautiful space. It has a very modern feel, a fusion of what I felt to be Asian and French aesthetics. The food was delicious, the wine was good.. . I plan on returning to try out the happy hour though, I was more dazzled by the bar area that is located at ground level. (Note the restaurant is below ground level, so there will be no window views.). . I do remember having a weird waiter, I never was sure what that was about, so there were occasional awkward moments between guests and wait staff but that could have been a one time occurrence.
