Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
ugh, i really wanted to write a positive happy review of gloria's cafe. i got such a kick out of having our order taken by gloria herself, i heart small businesses, i thought the decor was cute, and like latin american food. . . the pros: . - reservations taken and obeyed. we arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation for 9 on sunday evening and the table was ready. - yummy food! i enjoyed the adobada (well-marinated and tender) and grandma liked the not-spicy tamales. the pupusas (get the ruvueltas!) were yummy too, just make sure they give you the cabbage and sauce.. . the cons:. - forgetful service. we asked multiple times for hot water for grandma; everyone seemed apologetic whenever we asked (so they knew they forgot) but no one actually got it to us until halfway through our meal. we also didn't have our utensils or enough napkins, they didn't bring our tortillas out for our adobadas, and i didn't see anyone get refills on waters.. - just OK-appearing mexican food; probably opt for the salvadorian dishes, esp since delicious mexican food restaurants are so plentiful rounds here.. . we'll probably try this place again (definitely in a smaller group) but they need a new organization system (or maybe hire another person?) to take better care of tables
