Yeah, yeah, it's what everybody says: the food ain't that great.  But the ambience more than makes up for it.  You feel real cool when you're sitting there and able to see the whole landscape of LA from so high up.  I'll be honest, I've only ordered the sushi here and even though it's not the best stuff I've ever had, it's totally edible.   Besides, the point of this place is not to come back and tell all of your friends, "I just had the best sushi in town," but to be able to say, "Yeah, I just had dinner at Yamashiro's" and watch them look at you with a little more respect.
