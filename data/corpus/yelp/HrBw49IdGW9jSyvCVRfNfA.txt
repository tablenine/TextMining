grrreat place for breakfast when i dont feel like whipping up a feast of my own. ingredients are fresh and im a HUUUGE fan of organic/whole grain ingredients. any omelette with a side of bacon and cheese grits makes me a happy camper. although i lean more on the savory breakfasts, the french toast is a guilty pleasure which i order when taking a break from eggs. the coffee is strong, making me wide awake and hangover free within 5 sips. . . if the weather permits, sit outside. you wont regret it. . . the only gripe i have is with the parking. finding a spot becomes a bit stressful when you're hungry. . . hands down, this is my go to place - HOME, the alcove, or the coffee table dont do it justice.
