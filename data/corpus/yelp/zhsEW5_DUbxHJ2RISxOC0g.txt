Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Father's Office is SO yummy! I love the burger and sweet potato fries. A while back one of the bartenders told me that I would love the Alaskan Amber beer (don't remember the exact name, but that's always enough to get me the right beer) since I am a hard-core Sam Adams lover like any good Boston-raised lady. Anyways, that beer's fantastic. My friends always gets the hefs here and they say they're great, but it's not my cup of tea. My only complaint about Father's Office is that it gets really pricey fast meaning I cannot go here 3x/week as I would definitely do otherwise.
