amazing. simply, overwhelmingly, unimaginably AMAZING.. . here is what we got, and a little verbal finesse to how amazing our meal at mozza was!. . Meatballs al forno $12  - YUM. DIP THE BREAD, TOO. YUM!. White beans alla Toscana with extra virgin olive oil &amp; saba $8 - holy crap this is like a bite sized taste of heaven. Mozza caprese $12 - they should clearly mark that this has baratta cheese, because WHO PASSES UP AMAZING BARATTA. (ridiculously good). . Pizzas:. . Coach farm goat cheese, leeks, scallions &amp; bacon $15 - tasty!. Pizza alla benno: speck, pineapple, jalapeno, mozzarella &amp; tomato $16  - amazing, but spicy so beware (but amazing!). Tomato, mozzarella, sausage, salami, bacon &amp; guanciale $18 - for meat lovers, tasty tasty tasty! . Burricotta with peperonata, olive taggiasche &amp; oregano $15 - delicious. . ok. so i know, my descriptions aren't that ...descriptive. but seriously, AMAZING. a must try. just make sure to make reservations (way in advance!) and be prepared to wait a bit even if you have a reservation. but totally worth the wait. . . overall, one of my favorite dining experiences in LA!
