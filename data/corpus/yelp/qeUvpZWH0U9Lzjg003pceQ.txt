Restaurant: Ecco
Category: Modern European
Ecco is my place to go when i want to see a be seen. The bartenders there are amazing very personable and professional. They have great knowledge of the wine list. . . My favorite entree there right now is the rabbit pasta. I always tell the bartenders that I'lll have the Bugs Bunny : ). . Great place to have dinner before going to an event at The Fox also. . Great singles scene. I've tried to make it my regular Friday late night dinner and a cocktail.
