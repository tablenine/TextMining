Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Fish taco: $1:50. Shrimp taco: $2.00. Drink: $1.00. . That's the menu, folks. You can't go wrong with something so simple. I had been wanting to try out this little fish taco joint for a really long time now, but for some reason, never made the trip. I always ended up at Yuca's right up the street. Oddly enough, Yuca's was closed due to their crazy hours, so I finally made the decision to head on down to the Best Fish taco in Ensenada. . . I was greeted by a very welcoming gentleman who I presume is the owner, and proceeded to make my order. Two fish taco's and one home made horchata. I was not disappointed. Now, while I won't say these are the best fish taco's in Ensenada, these are definitely the best fish taco's in the Los Feliz area, and I left perfectly satisfied. The fresh assortment of toppings and salsa's really sealed the deal for me. And I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to their horchata now.
