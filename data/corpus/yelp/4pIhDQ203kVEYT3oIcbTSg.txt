I went there with 3 of my co-workers when we were travelling to Atlanta.  All of us, coming from Seattle, we did not have a high expectation about a sushi place in Atlanta.  Man, we were wrong!  This place rocks.  The Chutoro, Otoro, Ikura and Tai were excellent..... and then their special rolls were fantastic as well.  The only bad thing about this place is the price.  It is really on the expensive side.  However, being a sushi fanatic, their stuff is really fresh and high quality.
