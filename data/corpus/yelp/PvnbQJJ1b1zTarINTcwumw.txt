Let's be real - the only reason I go to this place is because (1) it had a fantastic patio and (2) it is directly behind my office building. Still, it's not bad if you're in the mood for beer and bar food. The crinkle fries are perfectly salty and crisp, corn dog bites are delicious little nuggets of yum, the chicken fingers are large, hot, and come with delicious honey mustard. There's a decent selection of beer on draft (Peroni!), and last time I ordered some fruity martini and was actually impressed with its tartness - not bad. I've also done many, many Irish car bombs at this joint.. . Three stars because I am not a fan of this joint as a lunch spot - most of the menu is just too heavy (read: fried) for lunch unless you want to snooze your way through the afternoon back at the office, and I'm not a fan of the salad selections. Apparently they are revising their menu for the summer, so I'll have to check it out, but I'm thrilled that we're getting some new lunch spots on Crescent (check out Noon Midtown!).
