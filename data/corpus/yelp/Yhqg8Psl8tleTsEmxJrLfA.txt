This place did not live up to all the hype. First off, the wait is not worth it. I don't mind waiting half an hour for good food, but I was soooo disappointed. The xiao long bao was not special...very mediocre. Also, you can see the Mexicans making the XLB though the glass in the kitchen. I really question how authentic this place is?!?! I've had the real deal in Shanghai, and this does not compare. I've even had better XLB in New York and the Bay Area. . . Even though I'm Chinese, I felt discriminated! I'm from San Francisco, and I know there is a predominately Mandarin-speaking population in Socal...but you can't just assume I speak Mandarin too! When I spoke to the hostesses and waitresses in English, they would always respond in Mandarin. Then I had to keep repeating myself to them that "I don't speak Mandarin." I don't assume you understand Cantonese, so don't expect me to understand Mandarin. Also, I did not appreciate their slow service.
