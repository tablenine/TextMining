Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Came here for the second time for the 1/2 price sushi on a Saturday, and man oh man, am I reminded just how heavenly the maki is at Tank.  My fiance and I stuffed our faces with the goat cheese tempura appetizer (I have a newfound appreciation for goat cheese!), and 5 maki rolls, including the spicy tuna (my oldie but goodie), Philly, California, Ebi Tempura, and veggie tempura (absolutely scrumptious).  For $36 including tip, you just can't beat Tank before 6PM.
