OK, I'm going to throw down the gauntlet here. Can any 1 human eat a complete order of ANY of The Griddles pancakes in one sitting? I have been here quite a few times now and can only get about 2/3rds through them. I can finish off any of the french toasts but the pancakes still own me.. The Griddle straight rules. I am going to blow the lid off it. It is pretty tiny, in the heart of Hollywood so it fills up quick..  Choice of french press coffee, check. Endless gourmet pancakes, check. A few choice options of french toast (Peanut Bubba rocks!), check. Well-rounded breakfast and lunch menu, check. Get your butt in there so I can say I told you so.
