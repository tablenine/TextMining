I ABSOLUTELY LOVE PORTOS!. cheese roll are crazy good, i don't care about my diet anymore when it comes to porto's! hahah.... tres leches is gooodd. caramel flan is goooodd. chocolate croissant is gooodd. the danishes are gooodddd. white chocolate mocha is way better than starbucks.... but i always go for the cheese roll when i go there. never ever i don't buy them whenever i go there....
