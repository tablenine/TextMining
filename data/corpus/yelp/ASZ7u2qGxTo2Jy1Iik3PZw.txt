I went here because I saw a line so I thought it'd be good. This is like the subway for salads. You go through a line, they make it in front of you, and you get your food when you reach the cash register. They have premade choices, however you can add on whatever for several dollars more. They have nice choices, but $10 for a chicken salad? Hmm... maybe not. Cheapest salad without meat runs about $5. Nothing really spectacular about this one.
