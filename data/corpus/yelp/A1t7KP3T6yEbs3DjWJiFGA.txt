Roscoe's is a "must-vist" when you go to L.A.!  With 550+ reviews, I'm not sure that there's more that I can add.  I gotta say that I didn't find the drink, Eclipse, that great.  I agreed with my friend that it tasted like Tang but the novelty of it was pretty cool but $3.25?  I think I'll pass next time.
