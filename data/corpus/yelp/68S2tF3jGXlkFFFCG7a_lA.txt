Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
I can hardly believe all these negative-nancy reviews.  Readers please be assured that the swathe of negative reviews is not an accurate representation of the public, as moody's continues to be packed every single afternoon and night with happy-go-lucky patrons.. . First, is it dark?  Yes.  Why is everyone complaining about this so much?  Are all these reviewers 90 years old?  What's the big deal?  "Ohhhh, I can't find my walker, it's soooo dark1"  Yes, it's dark, which many people find cozy and romantic.. . Is the service slow sometimes?  Yes.  This is because the place is always packed and waitresses tend to serve about 10 tables at a time.  If you're looking to be pampered and catered to, this is not the place to go.  Again, are you 90 years old, reviewers?  Chill out!  If you are the kind of customer who needs a lot of customer service, be sensible and show up to the place at the early or the late end of the dinner rush, or on a weekday.  Don't come in at the height of dinner insanity and wonder about the delays.. . Is the food greasy?  Yes.  It's bar food, people.  Seriously, were you expecting a white table cloth and brand-new menus for your eating pleasure?  The menus are greasy, get over it... . Moody's is a place to come drink, munch on some food, and spend time with friends.  Plenty of people do it and love it and the restaurant isn't exactly hurting for business.  All these high and mighty complaints won't change that.
