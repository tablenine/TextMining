Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
The elevator didn't  work properly. So it's was a race up those stairs. A party of 8 vs us 3. Two girls, not so nonchalantly about cutting in front of us to get to the restaurant first, stopped right at the door of Orochon. There was really no contest as our party size differed. But it's the fact that these two girls made it so obvious, the race was ON!! As they stood there, they made a wall of 2 in front of me blocking the front entrance.  My wifey with her ninja fast reflexes squeezed right beside them and got inside. YATTA!! we got our names down first.  SEE, all you pirate vs ninja thread people. Ninja always wins. . . We got #3 soy sauce and #4 miso with fried rice and gyoza as sides. I was surprised that the soup base wasn't as spicy as I remembered. My #4 tasted more like a #5.5 but the flavor as always is excellent. The miso soup was rich and noodles cooked just right. . . The service was prompt and we didn't feel being rushed out even though a crowd of hungry people started to form.  We just went there on Friday and I'm already craving ramen again on Monday. Will be back soon.
