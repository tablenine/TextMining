Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
This place is classic and a must visit in Chicago.  I really like Chicago style pizza and since my last visit Giordano's has really grown on me.  I couldn't wait to get back and try some stuffed pizza.  It's really a deep dish Chicago pizza with a layer of crust on top.  More sauce is on the crust, so it looks like an open face pizza.  My favorite is spinach and Sausage.  An appetizer of mozzarella and tomatoes and I'm set.. . In the same style as Pizzeria Uno, and Gino's, but a different animal.  I love all of them.  During my most recent visit I loved Giordano's the best.
