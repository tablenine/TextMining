If this place didn't have a wait at 1:30pm I'd be all over a 5-er, but it did (though only 10 minutes on Easter Sunday no less) so I'm rounding up anyway.. . 1 word: delish!  1 lame word: yum-o. . Either way you slice it that place is great.  Tiny and unassuming what belies is brunch fare on the more inventive side.  I had a keylime and blueberry french toast that was perfection on a plate!  My better half had a Spanish-style omlette with creamy melt in your mouth goat cheese and green salsa!  The OJ was great but a little small and a little pricy ($3) but the coffee was strong yet smooth.. . The wait staff is really nice and our food came super fast.  They provide nice glasses and chilled tubs for your byob!  The guy who seems like an owner thanked us for coming - though we've never been there - I still appreciated the sentiment!. . I wasn't overwhelmed at the amount of food presented and that's probably a good thing though I did wonder if I was getting value.. . Overall: really really good!  I will go back and bring friends!
