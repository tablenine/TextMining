I have been here a couple times because they have an awesome appetizer special!. . I go for the lobster on Wednesdays and Thursdays which they advertise at cost which usually means I pay around $11-$12. They also have $6.50 martinis and a wine special which is amazing.. . I always sit in the bar so I can people watch and I've had the same waiter everytime. He is nice but his voice can grate on you. The atmosphere is great and I really look forward to coming to this place!
