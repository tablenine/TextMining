Eggs Flo - way to go!! I've had these twice now. They were so good I didn't want to order anything different the second time I went! They are big enough for two meals, so get ready to take some home. The turkey is so deliciously smoked, I thought it was ham! I tried my friends' dishes, as well. The french toast was great. I also had an excellent coconut cream cake. The waitress said the place next door makes the desserts. All around excellent. :)
