Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I'm a convert, I admit it.. . When I was pregnant last year, my friend couldn't believe that I "don't crave Roscoe's."  I had to admit that I had never been there.  Bad Mo.  Bad.  Apparently I was really missing out.. . Then once I she took me there...I DID start craving it.  I had the chicken breast, waffle, and eggs.  Now, sometimes I just grin and order the Stubby.  Just cause I like saying it.  The biscuits and gravy are also top notch.. . Service at the Pasadena location is friendly and fast.  (A good thing for a pregnant woman.)  They also let you sit, even if your whole party isn't there which is a rarity, but also "a good thing if you are a pregnant woman."
