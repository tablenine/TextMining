To whoever thinks he knows the history in the review above mine... Sure, Malnati was an employee of Unos and may have been there in the beginning (don't have the time or patience to research that).  The bottom-line is that he was an employee of Uno's and not the owner.  The way it works is the company always owns the recipe or whatever IP is involved, regardless of which employees were involved in creating it.  Anyways, Lou's is close, but Uno's is the original; no doubt about it.. . Lawsuit?  That's not practical.  You can easily change a few ingredients or ratios here and there and claim it's different.  Bottom-line, the recipe is lifted from Uno's.  You can clearly taste it.. . In terms of an actual review of this place.  It's still the best Chicago deep dish I've ever had.  No ifs ands or buts.  Remember that?  Refer to my original review for details.
