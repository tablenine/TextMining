So I visited this place a few days ago with my after school group, a total of 28 of us. The theme we've been working on was eating healthy and the difference between organic vs. non organic. We spoke with the owner numerous occassions asking if he would be able to speak to our students. He cancelled one day for unknown reasons and we reschedulled. . . When we reschedulled the owner still didn't show up, citing that he doesn't start that early in the day! OMG! Who cares, you have 28 people going to eat at your friggin' restaurant, to learn, support, and appreciate the whole idea of organic food (putting $200 in your pocket), and you can't drop by...if not for anything else but to talk to the kids?!?! Personally, I was highly disappointed by the fact that the waitress was a subsititute for describing what organic meant; sadly our 5th graders knew more than she did. . . They messed up our order. Gave us too many pizzas, to our enjoyment we got the two extra pizzas free (9 pizzas). I think business owners need to take more tact and concern in how they run their establishment. I would have preferably patroned a different organic restaurant for a owner who actually cares about their customers.
