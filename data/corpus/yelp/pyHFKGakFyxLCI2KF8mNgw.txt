The service could improve.  While their food is good, average to good food mixed with slow service does not make one want to revisit.  I have probably been here around 10-15 times (to be fair before writing this review).  Every single time I go, it takes at least 5-8 minutes to be initially greeted by a waiter or busboy, another 4-5 to order and another 7-10 for the drinks to arrive.  That means, it can take up to 16-23 minutes just to get your drink.  Sometimes the appetizers come out before the drinks..a major no no in the restaurant world.  From watching the waiters work, I don't think they are lazy or slow, I think they literally just need to bring in one or two extra servers so their stations are not so large.   . . So when you go at night, just know that the restaurant itself will be loud, you will be packed in closely and you will have to wait a while to put your order in.
