What a great meal this was............ . My wife and I had to try it as we were in the area of the "Verde" Kogi truck. We got in like at about 2:20pm (and they were scheduled to leave at 3pm). The line took about 15 mins so.....it wasn't that bad.. . I wanted to try almost everything they had so I thought.........3 of 4 tacos each one with different fillings. Then I saw a guy in front of us and those tacos as small with a small amount of filling......So my wife got the Short Rib Burrito and I got the Spicy Korean Pork.......... . You know what...........the burrito was awesome!!! So my wife and I bragged about each one's choice so I took a bit of her choice and ....wow....that Short Rib was also good in a different way. Most of the time, different fillings end up tasting the same, especially truck food, but these were 2 differently wonderful filling.. . Spicy Pork Â - In my opinion had more flavor than the Short Rib, more garlic, more tangy-ness with the traditional korean sesame, soy and green onion.. . Short Rib - Sweet Kalbi!!!
