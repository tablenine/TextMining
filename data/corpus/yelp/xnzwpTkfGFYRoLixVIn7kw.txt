I've been here twice. . . The first time was during the summer. I sat on the patio with my girlfriend and her friends and ate a bland but decent chicken wrap. The price was whatever you would expect the price to be-- $8.95 or whatever for the chicken wrap, $3-$5 for the draft beer. I remember going away gassy, passing the crazy Ukranian men hanging out on the softball fields as we walked home. . . The second time we went, it was TERRIBLE. I got the "Teriyaki Sandwich" which for some strange reason came with bacon and mozzarella cheese. And crunchy, burned ass fries. The sandwich-- which had little potential to begin with-- (I ordered it because I have this ridiculous habit of ordering "funny" foods) was even worse than I could have imagined. It was literally a piece of basted cardboard that tasted like it had been stewed in elephant urine. The fries, as I previously mentioned, were crunchy and burned and the beer-- dear God how do you fuck up beer?!-- was warm and flat. . . Our server was inattentive and slutty (she spent a majority of her time hitting on the guys at the table behind our multi-sexual group-- "Oh, did you GO to Ohio State?! How COOL!") and didn't write anything down, always a sure-fire route to hilarity when you're incompetent and the menu is new(er). . . As much as I'd like to say I'd never go back here, I probably will because it's it's close and I'm a glutton for punishment. . . And warm beer, apparently.
