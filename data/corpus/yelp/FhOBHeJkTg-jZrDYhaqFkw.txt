This place is always ridiculously busy, you usually have to wait quite a long time for a table but it is quite good.  It's not quite as good as Kushi Shabu which is near here, but you can't go wrong here either (although you  wouldn't have to wait at Kushi).  The owner is really cool, if you don't know what you are doing he'll gladly and enthusiastically help you. THe sauces are very good here, give a nice flavor to the meat.. . The prices are quite good, which accounts for the ridiculous wait. The decor reminds me of , well nothing good but don't be put off by it.. . Food - A-. Ambience - C-. Service - B-. Value - B
