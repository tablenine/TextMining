Category: Italian
Interesting decor. (.5 stars). . Waiter was really.. whatever.    . . The garlic ice cream was $7 dollars and it was HARD.. wth?  Steak was dry, creamed spinach looked weird, pasta was okay, and the lasagna looked small  ):  The only thing that tasted like garlic was the garlic on the table (for the bread).. . All in all, the food is not worth the price.. but the bread.. I love the bread. (.5 stars)
