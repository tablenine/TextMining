Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I think the reason this place gets bad reviews is because friends talk it up too much.. . I wish the people who wrote bad reviews would go to Tito's one more time.  The first time I went, i would have rated it 1 star.  But then I found myself thinking about those greasy, amazing tacos, and I had the strange urge to go back. So glad I did, as they get better each time you go.. . Oh, and don't get anything but the tacos- at least, nothing else there has impressed me.
