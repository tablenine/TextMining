This is one of the best places to eat at in Hollywood, especially if you have a hunkering for some good eats in the late evening.  . . The goods:. -This location is open until 4 a.m. and has a pretty wide delivery area.  I've never had anything that I didn't like, though the Coulotte steak "Picanha" is like a party in your mouth! . -Also, if you're a fan of Sangria, they have a pretty tasty one.  Of course, we were "forced" to down the entire pitcher in about 15 minutes because it was approaching 2 a.m.  (That may be a little fun at the time, but it leads to a lovely and throbbing next morning). . The bad:. -As if the (sometimes) ridiculously long wait weren't bad enough, they won't seat you until everyone in your party is there AND you can't put you name in via phone.  Annoying.  But, oh well, it's worth it. . -Parking can sometimes be a little bit of a mess, but it's LA so that's expected. . -Lastly, some of the staff can be a little stand-offish.  But in my experience, if you're nice to them, they're nice to you.
