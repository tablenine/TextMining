I think the baos here are pretty good. They come in a variety of tastes but I think the BBQ pork is probably the best, since I can't really take spicy. The meats although don't seem real, are extremely tasty and the bao texture has a good chew. I also love their rices but I hardly ever get them since I'm alway son the go when I'm up on N. Michigan. Â I'm happy that Wow Bao has been able to expand so quickly and so well and I commend their success. Keep up the good work.
