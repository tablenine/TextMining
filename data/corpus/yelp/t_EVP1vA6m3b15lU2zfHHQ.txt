My arteries are hardening as I write this.. . I love chicken.  I love waffles.  But I thought the idea of the two of them together was totally weird and gimmicky, especially as someone who is very wary of mixing savory and sweet.. . But mmm . . . .it's crazy good.  Not the best fried chicken you've ever had, or even the best waffle you've ever had, but there is something about the completely unnecessary combination of the two that makes this unforgettable.  Go ahead and drown that thing in syrup!  Might as well go whole hog.. . This is a place you can really only go maybe once a year, but it will have you patting your belly in contentment afterwards (while groaning and wishing you'd worn your fat pants.)  Plus the slight but ever-present danger of being caught up in the middle of a rumble kind of adds to the overall experience.
