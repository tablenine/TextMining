My thoughts are much along the same lines as Laura D. and Molly S. A few thoughts of my own..... . Definitely my favorite Emory/Decatur brunch spot. Also, it's my favorite eat-at-the-counter breakfast/brunch spot place in town; I never want a table, because I love sitting at the small bar counter so much. And, ditto ditto ditto to all who praised the coffee- it is YUMMY!. . I like the breakfast potatoes and all the egg dishes I've tried; usually I get a made-to-order omelette with spinach and cheese. The service is always super friendly and prompt. It's just, overall, a totally cool spot!. . The only downside is that parking can be a little tough and tight, with a not-quite-big-enough lot in back and the usual hassle streetside in that area. But if you're nearby....don't let it deter you! Definitely worth the trip!
