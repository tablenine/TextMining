Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
this place is good if you like to spend a lot of money and think you are eating healthy. the food wasn't really all that great and it was pretty expensive for what you would get at a regular sandwhich joint. i over heard a couple of other customers comparing the price of veggie grill versus mcdonalds or in and out. my advice, only go here if you want to con yourself into think that eating here will somehow offset all the fried foods and carbs you're stuffing into your body the rest of the week. lol.
