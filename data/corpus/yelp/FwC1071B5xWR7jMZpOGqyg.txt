Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
This is a fantastic date restaurant. I went here on a weeknight so it wasn't crowded, and the wait staff got us in fast. They were also really attentive and nice. When my steak came back with a little bit of a pulse still they offered to take it back and cook it a little longer - it came back perfect. All of the food was great and they even didn't blink when I asked for more ketchup for my fries before I even started eating :-)
