Category: American (Traditional)
The one and only quintessential townie bar... where teeth or seasonal baths are not required.. . When you're tired of seeing college kids acting the tool w/ daddy's plastic in hand at so many other places...Manny's is a breath of fresh air. Well, mebbe not inside...but when I said my vows to this joint, it was for better or worse...seems like 8 Miles of the latter.. . Cheap dwinks, cheaper beers and tasty grub is all this Bumpkin wannabe needs...sans the adult OshKosh overalls. The pub grub is pretty pretty pretty tasty...from wings to burgs, with a couple of standouts. . . --A thing called the Loaded Dogzilla is the half brother of the Hamdog...and should be only eaten once in a blue moon or right before a high colonic. . --The Fish n Chips are very tasty eventho it ain't cod...the steak fwies seemed like it was salt cured. Suck it up and down it with a tasty beverage. . . PBR on draft supposedly tastes the same today as it does 50yrs ago...I don't doubt it, I'm sure the tap lines hasn't be cleaned since the first pour. The only way it should be...if it's a flowing, don't be a blowing.. . This is one of Atlanta's true remaining landmarks and I'm glad it's still up and running strong. Not much more can be said that hasn't been already...it's Classic.
