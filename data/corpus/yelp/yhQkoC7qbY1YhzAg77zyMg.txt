well ... this a a gem ...if you dont mind driving into Downtown LA ...  There known for the Ramen .... Spicy to mild... your in control of the temperature ... my fav. is the Miso Ramen ...  and a cold beer. . the is a nice little shopping center ...below.. and a Asian Market.. . def. worth the journey :)
