Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Big name, average food . Must me something about having lived in the Great state of Texas but, it seems you can find a dozen restaurants serving better steak back in the Lone Star State. Lawrys has a moderately upscale feel to it but, the steak is about average. Does not seem a whole lot better in quality than Outback Steakhouse except you are paying 4 times the price. I guess people go here for the name rather than the food.
