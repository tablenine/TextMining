The food is literally an explosion of flavors so intense and powerful it's like getting kicked in the skull.  In a good way...if that's possible.  . . My favorites are the Kimchi Quesadilla and Short Rib tacos.  Those delivered the power packed flavor punch in the jaw we were expecting. The two "newcomers" to my Kogi truck experience, the Blackjack Quesadilla and the Spicy Pork Tacos, were so tasty they made me want to curl up in the fetal position and weep openly. . . Fast, efficient service, nice people and the food is to die for--what more could you ask for?  . . If you haven't tried it yet, follow them on Twitter and check them out.  You won't be disappointed.. . Long live the King--the Kogi Truck rules!
