Restaurant: Uncle Bill&#39;s Pancake House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
two thumbs up for uncle bill's! definitely one of the best breakfast spots in manhattan beach. amazing views - check out the patio if you can, and the pancakes do not disappoint! as for the waitstaff, i've experienced nothing but good service when i've been here - but the last time i went was on a weekday morning. obviously way more relaxed than the weekends.
