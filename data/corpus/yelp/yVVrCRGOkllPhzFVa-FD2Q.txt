Restaurant: West Egg Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
West Egg Cafe should be perfect for me.  My favorite meal is breakfast.  And the cafe serves breakfast all day until 4 PM.  However, what is the point of serving breakfast all day if the cafe cannot consistently serve good food food during that time? On a recent afternoon, I had overly dry scrambled eggs served to me; and on another day, a sunny side up egg with raw egg white arrived.   My bacon was limp and with pools of grease.  I had to request their cinnamon butter for my biscuits -- otherwise it is not forthcoming.  And most troubling, the kitchen service seems to have a problem with serving orders warm/hot.. . On the positive side, West Egg's pancakes are classically good, especially with cinnamon butter.  The pan fried potatoes are a herb seasoned delight, and coffee/espresso drinks are strong and full bodied.. I still prefer West Egg to The Flying Biscuit. If you go, be advised to go at peak breakfast or lunch hours for a  more consistent food preparation and service.
