Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
This place is soooo good!!!. . I came here with a few business partners. We came in and had to write our name on a list. They only have one thing, beef shabu. They of course had drinks and such, but pretty much beef shabu is the only food you get. You can choose to have a large (15 pieces) or a regular (10 pieces). We had to wait for about 1.5 hours. There isn't really any waiting area in the restaurant. But it is in a japanese plaza, so you can walk around and take a look at some of the cool little shops. Once they got to us, we walked in and sat. The food was all ready for us to sat eating. The beef was sooooooo good. It practically melts in your mouth and the sauces were so good. . . It was well worth the money. The place is pretty systematic though. When you sit, they give you a plate of veg and noodles that you can put in the soup. And they give you the plate of beef. You put the veg and noodles into the pot to cook and you dip a piece of beef until it cooks (which is about 10 secs). dip that in the sauce and yum! But, once you have eaten all of your meat, they took the pot of soup that you have created and put it on the side. They already start cleaning the cooking area and place a new pot to boil. Once you leave, the next person comes in and starts. But soo good and sooo worth the wait!!!
