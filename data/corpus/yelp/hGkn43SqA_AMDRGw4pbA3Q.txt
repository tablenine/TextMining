Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
A hot dog's like pizza like sex--even if it's not up to par, it's pretty good.  I come here only when out-of-towners want to see the hot dog place--then get seriously disppointed after they eat.  I can make better hot dogs, although without the snap, at home, but sometimes it's fun to stand in line and talk to people as you wait--as long as it's not too long.  Otherwise, I would never stand in this crazy line to get this.  And everytime I pass by and see a line, I shake my head... knuckleheads...
