Let it be broke!  Mayan is fantastic for Groups.  I threw Sonia a birthday party there over the weekend.  The staff was great, the food spectacular and plentiful.  Everything worked out awesome.  We fit about 40 people in, no worries.  If you've got a similar group and you want to party, this is your place.
