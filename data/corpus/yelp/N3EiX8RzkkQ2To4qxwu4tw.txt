My review is solely based on the pastries as I have yet to try their sandwiches. Huge Bakery with never-ending selections of delectable rolls, cakes &amp; pastries..The place is really clean with a franchise feel, but I know it's family owned but they did a fairly good job with the decor. I've only been here a few times. My favorite so far are the guava cakes, the pastry is so buttery and flaky with just the right amount of guava in the middle. One negative about this place is the line and parking. The lines always super long and the parking situation is horrible. There's a designated parking lot in the back of the shop but finding a parking space is the difficult part.
