GOOD: . . probably the best coffee i've even tasted. and i've even had the elusive caphe cut chon cat poop coffee. . . BAD: . . - it's like those orange county homes that take up the whole lot. i mean was it REALLY necessary to make this place take up a whole block of stores?. . -there are people (not all of them) who work there who look and act like their other job is at banana republic.. . - the coffee is extremely expensive. i paid almost 5 dollars for a latte. WTF? and it barely filled the cup. in fact the whole place is expensive out of scale for the area.. . -it seems to attract a lot of homesteader-types who moved to silver lake because 'it was cheaper than mid-wilshire and it feels like soho here.' i actually heard someone say that. it feels like soho here? only because of YOU...all the gentrification.. . - the whole experience feels less silver lake/east side and more brentwood/beverly hills. i really dislike what silver lake is becoming. it feels like it was established by outsiders for outsiders.. . -the whole place feels like it was designed to appeal to the blogosphere: pretentious, self-important, and trendy. . . - the only people who like this place on yelp are people to whom 'silver lake is the new brentwood.'. . - why do hipsters insist on wearing knit beanies all of the time?. . SUMMARY:. . um, i'll be back.
