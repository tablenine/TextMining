I held a private party here this past monday.. I planned it about a month in advance, with Joncarl the owner.. Honestly, we did very little correspondence thru email and ended up having the most enjoyable party!. . About 25 people arrived to passed hors de oeuvres. Let me say, the artichoke edam fritters are amazing!. We then sat and had family style salads and ordered our entrees. . Our food was delicious! Oh and we had an assortment of desserts! i think it was an orange creamsicle mousse that was my favorite. . . We drank plenty of wine and had a great time!. I had such great feedback from all the party guests as well!. i totally recommend having a party here!. . Thanks again, Joncarl!
