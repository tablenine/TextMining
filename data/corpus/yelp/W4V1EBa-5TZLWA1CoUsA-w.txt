The bar is relatively empty tonight. I find a corner seat. Across from me are two babes, blonde and brunette, noisily emptying their margaritas and luring the Aussie bartender over for drunk talk. I whip out my latest tome and signal to all that I am the literate sort (hopefully no one will see the basketball on the cover of my book). I order a standard frozen margarita and the Pure ceviche. A man places a basket of corn tortilla chips and small bowl of salsa before me. Gracias, senor. Tasty chips. Muscular margarita. The ceviche arrives, artistically garnished with hard corn tortillas and stiff strips of plantain. Fish of indeterminate variety, cilantro, celery, lime. Broad bottomed bowl. Thoroughly satisfying. The Aussie checks in periodically, in his cheerful downunder tone. The patio is full, the windows down, the screens letting in the night breeze. I am content. I ignore the tome and just listen to the buzz of conversation, like a chorus of crickets in the lawn. Nice place.
