We actually found seating for a group of 6, but I'll test it out again a few weeks from now as word gets out that it's finally open.  . . I like the location. It's not as crowded in this part of Culver City, so parking is easy.  . . Great selection of beer.   The burger is tasty, but it's not the greatest burger in LA as some have hailed it to be.
