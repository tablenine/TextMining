there's nothing about Daily's that I have to complain about, but there's nothing i really have to rave about either. . . its a typical bar and grill. . . the menu is okay. the food is okay. the staff is friendly, tho slow... i can't really say anything stands out.. . i'll go back when i want a burger.. but its nothing to write home to mom about.
