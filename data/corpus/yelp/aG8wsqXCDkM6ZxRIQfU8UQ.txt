Restaurant: Shorty&#39;s
Category: Pizza
Shorty's 'ZA is as good as frozen pizza. The crust is soft and chewy, there is no char or crispiness to it. Its baked on one of those junky 'za pans with holes all up in it. Sauce and cheez is terrible. In the same Chuck E Cheez league. The only good thing is the guac.
