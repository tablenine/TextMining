Everybody loves this restaurant, except ME!  I dont find the Hainan chicken sooo whoopee!  The chicken itself doesnt have flavor until you dip it into the sauces.  The waitresses give you a choice of white or dark meat.  . . There's outdoor seating but it's not  spacious at all.  The restaurant is small to begin with.
