Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
I had been dying to eat at Phillippe's for a long while. Ever since I watched (my boyfriend) Anthony Bourdain consume a beef dip sandwich on "No Reservations".. . First glance: The lines were long.  The customers were rowdy. All the ladies behind the counter looked like their  name should be "Flo".  Hmmmm......not what I was expecting. But I stayed, my mouth watering while I stood patiently for my turn.. . I had the beef dip. It was really good. Not too soggy, not too dry. Mr. N had the lamb dip, which he gave 2 thumbs up. The mustard.......ohhhh man. That shit was good! I'm kicking myself in the butt for not buying 8 jars of it to bring home. It was like wasabi, but in mustard form. It made the sandwiches taste heavenly.. . The coleslaw was good, but a little bland. Ditto for the potato salad. The beer was cold and reasonably priced.
