Great view, great service and great wine... For our first course we had the wonderful Crabcakes and an order of Seared Hamachi which was what you would get anywhere else and went quick.  We realy enjoyed our entrees, the Grilled Seafood platter had a lemon-tarragon cream that needed a kick in flavor but I loved the scallops although the lobster didn't taste fresh.  The Short Rib plate was some good comfort food except the polenta had way too much truffle oil.  I don't know about you guys, but that was just too overpowering for anybody.  It kinda made me not want to finish the polenta.  But, I will go back to try the Black Cod and the Salmon next time.
