Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
With a 100 year history, it's no surprise that they have a ton of reviews so I don't really have to say much.  Heard about Philippe on the KQED show "Sandwiches you Will Like" and I've always wanted to make an effort to check out this place and enjoyed a beef french dip sandwich, lamb french dip sandwich, lemon merigne pie, vegetable barley soup, and part of my girlfriend's pork french dip sandwich.  Man, was I full afterward.. . It was neat seeing the Dodgers/Red Sox game at the LA Coliseum on at the time, but I wouldn't mind seeing them put more TVs up so you can watch stuff from different parts of the restaurant.   I guess you can't tell from the outside, but the interior is so huge with so much room to sit.  It seems as if the seating options just keep going and going and going.  And at only around $5.50/french dip, you can afford to have two of em and top it off with a dessert.
