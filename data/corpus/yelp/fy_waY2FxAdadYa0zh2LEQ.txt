Restaurant: Cameli&#39;s Gourmet Pizza Joint
Category: Pizza
After a few people suggested that I go back after all these years, I submitted today while in the area.  I stand by my prior review.  Cameli's has improved though.  Gone is the dive interior, I couldn't even believe I was in the same space, completely updated with bar.. . The crust has improved but not nearly enough.  I ordered 2 monster slices, one cheese, one pepperoni.  The crust is super thin, and while it is improved greatly over a few years ago, it still breaks apart like a typical cracker crust, and it was also dry...which is what I remembered from my last time there.  No chew!. . Very little sauce and slightly on the sweet side, cheese had good melt.  It's not horrible but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.. . It still gets....my 'average cheese in Atlanta' rating....from the NY Pizza Guy.
