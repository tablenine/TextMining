what else can I say that hasn't been said about Porto's? Â Just wanna chip in my 2c then. Potato balls, Cheese rolls, n strudels are pretty much common knowledge now but did y'all tried the dulce de leche cake? Can ya say a scoop of heaven in a spoon?? I tried almost all of their desserts and that dulce de leche takes the cake! Can't wait to try the rest of their stuff.
