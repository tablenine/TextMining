Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
Having this establishment just a few blocks away is a godsend. As much as I enjoy Mary's year round, summer is the best time of year to head over there. With their open patio area and great mix of drinks its a perfect weekend afternoon. . . Another bonus is the inside shows random movies and old cartoons. I even caught Felix the Cat once while enjoying dinner. That was epic. . . While their service is sometimes strange and distant the food has never caused me to complain which is why I return time and time again regardless of my feelings over their host/waitstaff choices.
