Belgian beers, exotic sausages, cool spot. I came here on a weekday after work to grab a few beers and try the rattlesnake and duck sausages before heading to the artwalk. It was delicious! I love the sweet potato fries, and all the sauces they offered. They have huge tables and benches and it can get loud. But it is a neat place to chill and people watch and drink drink drink beers!
