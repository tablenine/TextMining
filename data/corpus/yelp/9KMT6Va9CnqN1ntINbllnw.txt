Restaurant: The Nook On Piedmont Park
Category: American (Traditional)
This place is new and it sort of shows. The crowd is mixed right now. But the outdoor space is huge and great. It's right across from Piedmont Park, so the view is great. The beer selection, with the new addition of Fat Tire, is getting better. The mac n' cheese is where it's at!. . Also, they have tator tots! And they make Nachos with Tots. Called Totchoes! Such a good (or bad) idea!
