There was a time a few years ago when i LIVED off of Bossa Sunset's food. I regularly alternated between the Willy's shrimp burrito (way too big to finish-especially with the plantains on the side!), Andrea's Favorite salad (THE yummiest dressing even though i normally HATE honey mustard-theirs is soooo GOOOOOD), the Santa Fe salad (i could live off of that crispy shell alone!) and the grilled Mahi Mahi with chargrilled vegetables (yummy asparagus and squash, sliced thick, charred around the edges...heaven!). Mmmmm. I used to work extremely late hours and since they delivered until 4AM, i had errybody in my office in Koreatown ordering from this place almost nightly. Alas, in 2005 i moved 5 minutes west to the Miracle Mile area, and now i'm 3 scant blocks outside their Delivery area. Booooo. Many a night i have wanted to drive up to Sunset just for a can of Guarana and a side of plantains.....but i try to actually stay away fromn this place now if i can. I seem to remember having eaten so much of their yummy food that i'd get addicted. . . Is the Santa Fe Salad like CRACK? Why, yes, it is. And that bananas with chopped almonds and vanilla ice cream thing...and the fried shrimp and cheese in a little round dough-ball thing...OMG, yum. And the caipirinha cocktails truly outdo any mojito, so have a few if you ever dine at the place instead of ordering takeout. Not crazy about their pizzas, the uncomfortable patio seating and the parking lot SUCKS ASS. But the food is so good-and relatively inexpensive-whi cares if your ass hurts and you ding up your car a little?? Trust me, as you gnaw on a sweet soft-yet-crispy plantain, you won't even give a damn.
