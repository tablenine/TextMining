Love this place-- how could you not? It's got great pastries at a pretty amazing price. Even though it is often crowded the line goes pretty fast. I tend to stick with the pastries and the Parisian cake is absolutely the yummiest chocolate cake. I suppose it's the mousse layers that are so great. I do avoid it on the weekends because it's gets REALLY crowded, but other than that no complaints.
