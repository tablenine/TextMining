The BF and I are huge meat eaters, so we were months late in trying out this relatively new place in our hood.... . All I can say is WOW. . . I regret being so slow about it, because we both now love this place. The food is simply awesome-tasting, mouth-watering-ly amazing. I don't know how they manage to make it so magically yummy. . . Maybe the Mana folks are dabbling in the black arts? . . Our favorite items from the menu:. . - blue cheese tart with caramelized onion. - mushroom saute over creamy polenta. - coconut water and fresh lime sake cocktail. - rhubarb with nigori sake. - seaweed and cucumber salad. . Also, they serve Two Brothers IPA, one of my all-time faves.. . We were surprisingly underwhelmed by the sliders, but maybe it was just an off-night; I'd be willing to try them again.. . Also, the service was impeccable. . . A big thumbs-up for Mana.
