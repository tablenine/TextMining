Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
After several attempts to find good Korean BBQ, tonight I finally nailed it. Based upon good Yelp reviews, I decided to check it out and see for myself. I wasn't disappointed!. . The place is in a part of the neighborhood that doesn't stick out as particularly beautiful. Surprisingly, though, the interior was quite nice... modern and clean. Service was prompt, the food was delicious, and the price about the same as the mediocre places I've tried before.. . This is my new place...
