This place is great. I mean, who wouldn't like a restaurant where dozens of waiters come running to you with delicious meat at the flip of a coaster?. . The salad bar is extensive and very good (includes cold cuts of meat, cheeses, many types of salad and more), the various types of meat that they bring around are all excellent (and endless), and an underrated part of the experience is the also endless supply of side dishes. When I went last night they were cheesy mashed potatoes, fried plantains (amazing) and some type of fried cornbread-like thing that I didn't catch the name of. Also, the bread they give you is like small lightly toasted rolls that are filled with melted cheese, unique and incredible. Basically, it is a bottomless supply of amazing food of all types. . . The one bad thing is that the meal is very expensive, especially if you order wine, dessert, etc. with your meal. For me it isn't a place I could go often, but it's a great place for those special occasion meals.
