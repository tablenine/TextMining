I love this place - the chimichurri sauce with the french bread is so addicting. Sometimes, I will go just to enjoy a sangria and bread. sangria is very well-made, and there's plenty of fruit in it.. . I've had the skirt steak with the side of mashed potatoes. (they call this the entrana) the milanesa sandwich is also very good. . . the inside of the restaurant can get very loud - there are no windows, so this isn't a good place to come to if you want to talk.
