why is there a chicken silhouette by this garage?            oh. got it.. so i know it centers on chicken &amp; eggs (i'm assuming) but for the entire breakfast menu to be completely vegan unfriendly was strange considering, i dont know, it just seemed vegany (word? no, don't think so.). . so i'm not vegan but can't have milk so i couldnt have a suitable breakfast (i love bacon but dont think a meal of it would be the best idea) because i guess they only use butter in their eggs &amp; hash so i went to the lunch menu (already thinking 'dang this place has 2 stars max: one for their fresh squeezed OJ and two for their helpful waitstaff) and i choose the bbq chicken sandwich w/ fries.. . in a frumpy mood, disappointed, wish we would have gone to flo (mmm craving their amazing bloody maria)... get my plate and........ . OH! really good fries.... how's the sandwich? woah, good. mix it up w/ the slaw heavy on vinegar (in a good way) &amp; you have yourself an amazingly good and huge sandwich, skyrocketing you up to 4 points, FEED.
