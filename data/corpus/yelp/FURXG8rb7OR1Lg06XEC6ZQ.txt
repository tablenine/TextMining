Fraiche was as good as advertised! Had a wonderful New Year's Eve meal with even better drinks. The service was very thorough (even if the hostess was a tad self important) and our server made excellent recommendations across the board. Our table loved every "house" drink which we tossed back; the hit of which was called "the grape".  The wine list appeared superior and reasonable as was the menu. I enjoyed my beet salad and was really impressed with the Monkfish, which was the best fish dish that I have eaten here in a while; it had tremendous flavor and had a lovely simple accompaniment of spinach and a  smear of mashed potatoes. . . The only negative I would throw out was the ho-hum and cheap looking decor. Everything appeared very "Faux". . . The desserts were very good as well. The carrot cake is not to be missed.
