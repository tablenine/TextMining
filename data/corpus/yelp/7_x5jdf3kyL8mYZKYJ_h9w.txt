I try not to eat steak much, but if i do, I would want it to be at Gibsons. I guess they call this a classic Chicago steakhouse--looks like any other steakhouse to me. I wasn't in the mood for their gigantic house ribeye, so i opted for the big filet.  Medium-rare goodness.Double baked potato was as smooth as the sour cream and cheese smothered over it--or maybe that was just the sour cream.  Nevertheless, be sure to get their veggie combo-- a whole head of broccoli, asparagus, spinach, and these amazing mushrooms packed with umami flavor.
