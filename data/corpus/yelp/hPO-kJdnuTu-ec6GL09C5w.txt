Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I think this place is a bit overrated... after hearing many amazing things about Roscoe's Chicken &amp; Waffles (which has always sounded like a weird mix to me) and hearing the rave reviews, we came to this place with high hopes. . . While the food was okay, it was overpriced for what it was (14 bucks or something like that for two pieces of chicken &amp; 2 waffles? how much do these ingredients cost??). I might have been able to forgive this if the food was great, but it was just so-so. The fried chicken didn't have any amazing spices or spectacular flavor to it, it was just plain fried chicken, the waffles were just okay, and our mac &amp; cheese was over-cooked. I've definitely had better of all of those things, just never eaten them all together in one sitting.. . Afterwards we even joked around that we should've just gone to the KFC next door and ate there instead to get our fried chicken fix... haha. Needless to say, it didn't live up to the hype.
