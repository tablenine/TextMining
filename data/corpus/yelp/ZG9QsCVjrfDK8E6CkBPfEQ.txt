Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
I'm not so much of an aficionado when it comes to Cuban food, but after visiting Versailles....lets just say I changed.. . I ordered the #13, and I have no idea what the name it was but it was the Ribeye. It was tender juicy and served under french fries. I believe all entrees come with steamed rice, fried bananas, and black beans.. . The service was very authentic, i'm confused with the differences between a latino and cuban accents.. . I'm rating this restaurant according to the tastiness of the food because I feel I don't have the right to grade it according to the cuban authenticity.
