Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
This is a great little cafe, smack dab right in the heart of Lincoln Park. Despite it's small, cramped size, and no wi-fi (which is a cardinal sin in a coffee shop in the 21st century), this place is filled with great antique decor, and great pastries and deserts. The staff is always pleasant and helpful, and they make really good drinks. Not very good for bringing a group of people, but it's cozy for just yourself or with a friend/significant other.. . For your munchies and chocolate cravings, try one of their enormous brownies. Sip on a tall latte and enjoying reading up before your next class across the street at DePaul. I haven't had a chance to try their sandwiches, but from what I hear they are pretty substantial, good and cheap.. . Try the Bourgeois Pig Cafe, you won't regret it!
