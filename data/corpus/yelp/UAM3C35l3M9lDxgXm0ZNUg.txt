Why did I never know about this place?! I'm almost ashamed to say I've lived within walking distance since before they opened and I was apparently Â oblivious to the awsomeness that radiates until now. . . Sacrilegious it may be, but this food is like heaven threw up on your plate and baby jesus was refiling your lemonade. Yes this place is small and there can be a wait if you want a table verses bar(There's literly only like 6 tables in this place), but less room equals less people which equals less people staring at me as I shovel food in my mouth in ways you didn't think were possible.. . Thank you Mana, my life is better with you in it and from now on I will walk with a new swagger only referred to as the Mana Slider strut.
