Restaurant: El Cid 2
Category: Mexican
Yummy yummy in my tummy!  . . Since I was craving Mexican food and we had to take a walk anyway someone suggested that I would like El Cid and I liked it very much!  Sooo yummy, soo good!  I got the nachos with beef, beans, and quac.  super yumm-o!  The pate was huge!  I was afraid I wouldn't even make a dent in the actually meal but Actually as I sit here and write this review my mouth is watering!. . I wish this place was closer to me because I would frequent it every chance I get.  But alas I will have to wait for the next time I am in L Square to get some El Cid.
