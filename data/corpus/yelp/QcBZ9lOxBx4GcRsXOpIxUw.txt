Chops definately exceeded my expectations! I knew that we would be getting high quality meats and seafood, but I was blown away by the number of options. I didn't even opt for a steak or lobster, rather sea bass. I asked for it blackened and it was the best cooked and seasoned fish I have ever had.. . They brought out a cold seafood platter in the beginning which was probably the highlight of the meal. Different, oysters, shrimp, lobster, crab-all the best I have ever had.. . I loved the more traditional sense of service and atmosphere-all top notch, but not fake or flashy.
