Soft-shell crab was a bit stale... barely warm. The rolls were smallish, and really didn't have a whole lot of flavor. The rice-outside rolls were not packed that well, and kept falling apart. The nigiri looked like it had gone through hell. . . Chic decor, and loved the staff, though. Be sure to grab a chipotle chocolate ice cream next door when you're done.
