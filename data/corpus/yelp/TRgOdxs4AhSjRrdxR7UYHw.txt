Often, it is the little things in life that can totally make our day - a warm gesture from a stranger, the gaze of a loved one, or THE. BEST. HAINAN. CHICKEN. IN. the U. S. of A. . . How can something so effortless like chicken and rice taste so good? Complement that with an unlimited supply of the aromatic chrysanthemum iced tea, and I seriously don't know where I'd rather be on a Saturday night. . . I am still amazed that in this busy, harsh world, a simple, unassuming plate of chicken &amp; rice from Savoy can bring such a grin on my otherwise fatigued face.
