As good as The Boiling Crab is, and it is GOOD, nothing beats a good ol' crab/crawfish boil at su casa!  Don't get me wrong, I still drive from Woodland Hils to Alhambra to eat at The Boiling Crab, but to have it at your home with friends; is even better.  Also, we can help the State of Louisiana by eating more crawfish!  They sure as hell could use the help.  Anyhow, if you do decide to try a boil on your own, DON'T go with what everyone else uses for their seasonings; USE Chackbay Crab and Shrimp Boil if you can find it.  It is by far the best, and I have tried them all.  It is not too salty or too spicy.  Just right.  If you want it spicier then add more cayenne pepper to make it spicy.  One of the keys to a good boil is the seasoning, in my opinion.  You can get it from this website: . http://www.crawdads.ne....   I swear this is the only place you will find it and you can thank me later.  . . But go and enjoy The Boiling Crab!  It is the next best thing to having your own boil.  Happy sucking!
