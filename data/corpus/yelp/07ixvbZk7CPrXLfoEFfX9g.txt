Savoy Kitchen makes the best Hainan chicken and cappuchino! I love their escargot and just about everything on their menu. I've been coming to this place since I was in middle school and there was always a wait. I haven't been to this restaurant for awhile since I'm no longer in the area, but I am tempted to make a drive out there soon just to have their Hainan Chicken again. . . So what makes their Hainan Chicken so good? The owner grates the ginger herself and salts it to make it very flavorful..and the spicy oil that goes with it..mmm.. just makes it sooo good. I've had Phoenix Food Boutique in Arcadia and it was not nearly as good. The ginger sauce served here was very much like what I had in Hong Kong. Yummmmaayyy
