Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Okay...havnt yelped in a while and just came back from the original Philipe. I ordered a regular beef french dip and was very disappointed. The sandwich was tasty but not hot at all. The sandwich isnt that big in size and the bread tasted a bit stale. This is my second trip to Philipe and its good for a quick lunch if your downtown, but I would not venture anywhere past 5 miles for this so called legendary place. Yes its like taking a step back in time, the decor is somewhat cool..but overrated. 74/100
