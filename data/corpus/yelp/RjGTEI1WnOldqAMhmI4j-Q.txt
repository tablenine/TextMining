This review is purely about the bar aspect of Noni's. I went there for the first time last night. I thought it was just a bar, which maybe it is after a certain hour. I thought the design of the place was excellent- lots of dark wood but with a modern feel. I spent most of my time on the patio out back. The beer and wine selection was excellent and our server was very friendly. The music wasn't too loud and the place was not crowded. I could hear my table's conversation without any problems! That, for me, is one of the key signs of a good bar. But then again, I did go on a Sunday night. It might be different on a Friday or Saturday.. . I imagine parking could be a problem sometimes. It has its own off-road lot but its small. If you go there at a peak time its likely to fill fast. The neighborhood is one of those "transition" parts of Atlanta. I would not feel too keen about parking on the street at night.. . I will be returning - I need to try the food!
