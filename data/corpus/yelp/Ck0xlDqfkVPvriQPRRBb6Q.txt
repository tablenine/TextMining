GREAT! Had that chile relleno with enchilada combo and it was really wonderful. I had tortillas with butter AND chips and salsa in the beginning. Usually Mexican places only give you one or the other. The only thing I wish they had was sweet or apple butter... I had that someplace with warm tortillas and I couldn't get enough. Anyhooo.... REALLY great place. The salsa is spicy, they don't fool around with you... but it's damn good.
