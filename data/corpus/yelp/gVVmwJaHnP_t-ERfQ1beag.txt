Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
We attempted to hit up the KBBQ Festival in K-town a few weeks ago but were amazed with the turn out (never under-estimate the marketing power of Yelp I guess, lol).  Due to the long lines, we knew we were never going to be able to chow down at the KBBQ Festival and Yelp'ed the surrounding area on our iPhones for a decent KBBQ place, preferably within walking distance.  Our unluckiness at the KBBQ Festival led to our SUPREME luckiness in stumbling on Soowon.. . We walked over here and had to wait about 10 minutes for our group of 9 people to be seated (not bad considering we were a group of 9 people, it was Saturday night around 6:30pm).  While we waited for our table, we agreed on getting two combo meals with a variety of meats (pork, pork belly, thinly sliced beef/brisket, chicken, short rib, etc.)  The quality of the meat is DIVINE. The portions were enough to feed everyone (our group of 9 consisted of 6 girls and 3 guys) and the combos came with beer and/or soju.. . We also ordered two orders of babimbap and one order of cold noodles.  Hands down, the best cold noodles I have ever eaten.. . Service was pretty attentive and for the most part really friendly.  They cook the meat for you but they can be a little bit slow in re-filling side dishes or getting the check.. . Ah-mazing. My new go-to place for KBBQ in K-town.
