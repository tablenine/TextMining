Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If I wanted to eat a mediocre hot dog with onion rings I would have went to a regular fast food place to do so. So overrated! Not worth the wait, the food was NASTY! The chili looked like it had been excreted from some unknown creature and the price of those hot dogs are absurd. . . It is absolutely ridiculous to pay 5 or so dollars just for a hot dog. For 5 bucks it better be the best hot dog I've ever tasted... but it wasn't!
