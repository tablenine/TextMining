I don't much believe in updates, writing them or otherwise.  This may be why my computer is flooded with viruses and why I still wear high tops with parachute pants.  Phooey.. . But I digress.  There come times when change is warranted, necessary even, like for parking meters, vagrants, or not wearing parachute pants anymore.  As such, one review cannot possibly contain the greatness that is Gloria's Cafe and so I must write an update.. . For example, how did I get away with a singular mention of their sangria?  Or without mentioning their garlic and lime marinated grilled shrimp?  Or their siete mares soup?  It's like neglecting to insert the American Revolution in history books.  . . My girlfriend is in love with that siete mares soup.  Literally, it looked like she made love to it.  She was elbow deep in that bowl with broth streaming down her forearm.  She tore apart the crab legs with the ferocity of a vagrant tearing into my parachute pants for change.. . I did the same with their tamales, except with a fork and in a civilized manner.  I kept one in my cheek like a chipmunk to enjoy later.. . Anyhow, there's a chance that I'll write another update for Gloria's in the future as I plan on taking my parents there, possibly to eat.  I won't, however, relinquish my parachute pants because I am much too legit to quit, my friends.
