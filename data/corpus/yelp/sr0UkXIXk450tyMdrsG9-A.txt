I am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews. I live within walking distance to crust so I have been there quite a few times. Every time I've visited, I was satisfied with the fresh quality of food and friendly service. . . Most of the veggie pizzas are delicious. I enjoy a simple, thin crust pizza that highlights the individual aspects of the pizza. I think crust does a superb job of providing fresh ingredients that please the palate. I have tried the meat/fish pizzas and they are not my favorite. But the veggie ones are very tasty. The salads are great. I impatiently wait for the day when the sun salad reappears on the menu (seasonal in summer). I have dreams about that salad. And in the winter they have a superb beet salad that melts in your mouth. When a crust salad lies in front of me, I raise a glass and say, "here's to fresh ingredients presented as they are"...thank you, Crust. . . Drinks are WONDERFUL here. Impressive, unique beer list and delicious mixed drinks with organic vodkas. Yum. And, you don't have to scream over the music to converse with your chosen companion (I really detest loud music).. . The staff has always been very friendly and charming. I was there last night and they gave us Â a complimentary appetizer to go along with our drinks! As we were leaving, every staff member managed to thank us for coming. We walked home into the moonlight feeling gastronomically content and loved. So if you do happen upon Crust, I hope you have the opportunity to savor the superb and simple taste of the ingredients and appreciate the friendly service.
