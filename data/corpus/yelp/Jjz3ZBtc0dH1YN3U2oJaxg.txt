The wait is usually absolutely ridiculous (2-3 hrs), but we just happened to get there as they were opening at 3 and got in. Since we had never been there before it was just luck that we avoided the usual crowd, but by the time we left there was a line out the door.. . We ordered 1 lb of shrimp and a pound of crawfish, an order of fried oysters and Chad had a cup of Gumbo. Crawfish is a lot of work for very little meat, but they are tasty. The shrimp was delicious. You have no eating utensils (you use your hands) and no plates. Your table cloth is a piece of white butcher paper, and your napkins are a roll of Paper towel. Luckily they give you a plastic bib, which is very much needed. I was covered in garlic and spices. The steamed items arrive in a plastic bag slathered in garlicky red Cajun sauce. We got the 'whole shebang' (cajun seasonings, butter, garlic, and lemon pepper), and you can order it as mild or spicy as you like. The service was attentive and they do swing by around often to check on things. It was a fun, though messy eating experience.
