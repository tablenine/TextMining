You had me at vegan egg cream, but when i tried your cake batter soft serve, i knew we were meant to be. Lula, you truly do inspire the classic cliched question, "where have you been all my life?" Â Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly vegan ice cream and Johnny Cash on the jukebox...you just keep getting better and better.
