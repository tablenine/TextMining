Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
While touring the Chicago History Museum our friends were wanting us to experience a bit more of local cuisine, this being a perfect specimen. It reminds you of one of those restaurants ran by the mafia. I do have to say that the mob has always been up and up on their customer service, they just like cash so that the money cannot be tracked. Their food was quite unique and delicious. I suggest the flatbread and salads more that the pizza bowls. The best part of the pizza was the best mozzarella cheese that you could ever imagine.
