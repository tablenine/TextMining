This is my HEAVEN! If you're going out for dinner and do not care how much money you're spending on it, please go ALL out here at Mastro's. This is my FAVORITE place to eat once in a while (who can have steak everyday?), and would definitely be my last meal on earth.. . Everything is exquisite and carefully made, from the bread basket to dessert. If you want appetizers, the seafood tower is the BEST. Crabs, Lobster, Shrip, Oysters. I'm usually full after this, but that doesn't stop me from getting more. MY favorite is the Bone in RibEye (around $45). I don't even know how to describe how yummy it is. It comes on a sizzling plate, and the taste is perfect, the steak is tender, and the area around the Bone is SO good. My uncle's favorite is the Porterhouse. It's $79, but it's meant to be shared by 2. I think it's great too, but i love the Bone in RibEye more. . . They also have a great wine selection. I've also had the best wine i've ever tasted here. It's called Abacus, and on the reserved wine list. It's really really expensive, but SO worth it. When the waiter uncorked it, I could smell the aroma wafting from the bottle. . . If you want to eat here, remember to make reservations WAY in advance, and ask for a seat upstairs where there is a pianist. The ambience is a lot better upstairs, and it's closer to the restroom. Â . . This is a MUST MUST MUST go to before you die.
