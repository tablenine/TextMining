Just went here again and ordered the onion rings since the debate is still out on them.  They cost 50 cents more than the fries but aren't worth the extra charge.  The onions were thin and way overcooked (slightly burnt but still served).  Plus the amount given for the to-go order was 1/3 that of the to-go crinkle cut fries.. . Do yourself a favor and just stick with the fries.
