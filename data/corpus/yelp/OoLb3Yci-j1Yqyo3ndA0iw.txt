I made it on the Wall of Fame, but my GI tract hasn't been the same since.  Possibly my body revolting from the huge volume of broth, salt and spice!  This place was small, so it took a while to seat our large group, but once we were seated the service was quick and friendly.   Not sure how the rest of the food tasted, but I thought the #2 Challenge was about what I expected.  I'm giving it an extra star for the fun-factor with all the laughs from the challenge... otherwise, not sure I would come back for more.
