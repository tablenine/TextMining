This is really one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta.  The food here has never failed to satisfy.  I just came here with my parents and boyfriend who is from San Francisco, and he agreed that he loved everything about this place.. My favorite dishes are:  . . 1. the Roti Canai (a poofy nan that you rip apart and dip in curry) - I love to keep the curry and pour it over my rice later. 2. the Satay beef with peanut sauce . 3. Char kway teow - spicy stir fried noodles with seafood. 4. Hainanese chicken - plain chicken but with the special HOT SAUCE omggggg good. 5. Sarang burong - edible taro root bowl with goodness stuffed inside :). 6. Kacang pendek belacan - string beans with spicy meat sauce. 7. Tofu nyonya - the tofu in this dish is amazing.. my parents know the owner and she explained to them before that they hand make the fried outside of the tofu themselves out of egg.. really one of my favorite fried tofus... sooo tasty. . and just a comment about all the complaints about the service/cleanliness... really.. just take a look around you... this place would be considered clean compared to 99.99999% of the other restaurants on buford highway.. the service/cleanliness/ambiance at "ethnic" restaurants such as those on buford hwy can in no way be compared to the ones that specifically target the general american public such as top spice.. if you're going to go to these "ethnic" places you might as well get used to the fact that their restrooms are gonna be the next step from hell... if you really want to be shocked by service/cleanliness and want to give a restaurant a 0.00000001 star review on yelp based on these categories.. take a walk through san francisco or new york chinatown
