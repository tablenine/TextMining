The only reason I can see someone giving this a good review is for the view. Yes, the view is beautiful but the food just 'aint that great. I mean, yeah the food is tasty but it is nothing special--especially for the price. Also, the overall ambiance is dreary and it like you're in an old theme park. This location already has one too many theme restaurants with The Magic Castle and don't get me started on that place!
