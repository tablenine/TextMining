Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
On the street valet parking sign indicates parking for Hungry Cat. Later discovered the Hungry Cat does not validate. Valet cost $10. . Poor service outside on patio and waiters seem preoccupied. Sea food seemed to have been cooked and then frozen so mussy. Â Nieman Ranch beef for burger was not really so tasty for $18. Derick who said he was the manager was unwilling to listen to any complaints.. Clip joint probably catering to tourists.
