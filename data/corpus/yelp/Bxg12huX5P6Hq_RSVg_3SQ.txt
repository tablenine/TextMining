I really wanted to like this place, but the experience left me disappointed.. . Everything is about $2-3 more than it should be, starting with the dumplings which are $7-8 for 4 medium sized ones. Next you have the rice bowls which are viewed as appetizers, but are priced at $8-9. Finally, the noodle dishes are $12-14, and just ok in terms of flavor and quantity. . . The rice dishes are the best item on the sparse menu, with the soups being second. 1 dumpling order, 1 rice dish, and 1 soup cost us $38 with tip, and we were still hungry afterwards. Good, not great food, and much too expensive for what you get.
