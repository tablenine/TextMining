I appreciate a well-made soup.  Sitting here at the computer for some reason I was reminiscing my visit to Souper Jenny, so I decided to write a review.  I didn't know what to expect from this place, though. About a year ago a friend took me there and promised that it wouldn't disappoint. We waited in line but it was worth it. For 10 dollars we had a big hearty bowl of soup.  I had a soup with lots of beans and leeks that was vegetarian; I think it was "white bean and something-something", half of an awesome chipotle egg salad sandwich, a cookie and a can of soda.  They have a nice little patio area where you can sit and enjoy your meal.. . From what I understand, all the soups are homemade.  The service is great and very friendly.  I can't wait to go back and try some of their cold soups!
