I've been here both with a couple people and a group of around 50. In both cases, the staff was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. After living in New Orleans for a couple years I was stoked to find a place like this. I love all the decorations and the patio is really cute. . . I'm to allergic seafood and not a big fan of traditional NOLA fare (I know, I know...), so I had the burger and it was good, but I can't comment on how the rest of their food translates for people who are connoisseurs of Big Easy cooking. It's nice a place to hang at during lunch and have a break from work. I'm still eternally on the search for a place in Atlanta with beignets. Especially since Huey's closed less than a week after I moved to Atlanta!
