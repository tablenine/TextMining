Some of the best Thai food I've had!. . Very reasonable prices, generous portions, and quick service.. . I tried:. . Pineapple Fried Rice with Shrimp. - Great flavor!  Huge chunks of pineapple and good-sized, relatively  fresh shrimp (as opposed the dinky frozen shrimp you find in most places).  . . Panang with Beef (Curry). - Also great flavor with loads of meat.  Oddly enough, despite giving you a vat of liquid curry, it isn't "served" with rice.  Do they expect you to drink it?  We asked for White Rice.. . Fried Trout with Mango Salsa. - This was probably my favorite thing there.  I was expecting a tiny, bony fish, but it came with two HUGE fillets, deep fried, and cut into 8 generous size pieces.  The Mango Salsa isn't very "salsa-like" - its more like the fish sauce that you would have with your stuffed chicken wings.  . . Definitely a place I'd go back to when I'm craving some cheap eats in Hollywood.
