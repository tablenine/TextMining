Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
If I have to pick one word to describe Umami's burgers, I'd have to say "Tasty!" I've tried Truffle and Hatch burgers. I love both of them. In general, each burger's patty is a crispy around the edges, but so-very-extremely juicy on the inside. The buns are also a bit crispy around the edges, but very moist &amp; soft everywhere else. Each burger is rich in taste.  My favorite condiments: garlic aioli. . . I'm not too crazy about the sides and definitely hate the ketchup (why can't they serve regular ketchups?!?!) Their sides are also so-so at best (McD has much better fries than Umami). . . What you should know before going there:. 1. Parking SUCKS! Lot is tiny, almost non-existent. Some street parking, but good luck finding it without getting honked at on busy La Brea. Sure they have valet, but they're not there all the time, and I don't trust valet service (have you seen what those valet guys do to customers's cars?) So - carpool, people. It's better for the environment &amp; your pocket anyway. . . 2.  Food is greasy, especially the burger patty. Their food is definitely not for those on low-fat diet.. . 3. Patty is cooked medium rare - might be too bloody for some people. I can handle beef sashimi, so this is not a big deal for me.. . 4. Unless you love waiting in line, come during odd hours (between lunch &amp; dinner).
