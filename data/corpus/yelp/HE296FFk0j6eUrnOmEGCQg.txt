Yes, their subs are great. Maybe you even read their article in the paper reviewing the Italian subs of chain's and how lovingly they construct their sandwiches, but here's something else:. . They are one best the resources for anyone who cooks Italian. . . The guy building your delicious sandwich of exquisite Italian meats on the crusty fresh bread from D'amato's next door; that guy is also a genius if you want to talk pork loin or brisket. . . We're talking old school Italian deli with all sorts of cuts of meat and and variety of cured flavor. Got a question about the difference between salamis? They'll answer it for you with care. Their Italian sub is the best in Chicago bar-none and their spectacularly fresh and delicious meats and cheeses. Also, their olive salad will make any olive-fiend break.. . 2 words: Sharp Provolone. Oh and OIL-CURED as in oil-cured Sicilian olives that you'll find nowhere else this far from a whole foods or Andersonville. . . This is the square stuff if you're a fan of the sub of East Coast fame. . . Then there is their broad selection of fresh pasta including spinach stuff tortelinis or roasted red pepper gnocchi. They also stock Isola sauces which are a bit pricey but the best jarred tomato sauces I've ever tasted. I highly recommend the zucchinni flower sauce which is slightly more flavorful but less salty than capers, but similar.
