I should admit that I always had a bias against this place - or perhaps just this location. It always seemed uninviting from the outside, just another dark bar full of beer. This led my thoughts to "standard bar food" and thus I never went in.. . Oops, my bad.. . Feeling forced to go with a group, I found myself with a delicious heaping pile of fried artichokes and an even better potato curry soup! At least my food was delicious. I tried some of my boyfriend's fries and those tasted like your typical bar fries (in other words, frozen is about the same level). His sandwich looked okay, but he didn't seem to be wowed. Guess he should've gotten the soup, huh?. . The wait staff wasn't too attentive, but it's easy to annoy them with our group. We have 10 people say they'll show up and then 25 come in scattered fashion. A servers worst nightmare, I know! Still, they tried to squeeze us in as more showed up, and for the most part kept glasses filled and bellies happy.. . What shocked me, though, was the lack of people on trivia night. I'm assuming it was the rain (people melt in Atlanta, you know!), but it was strange to see it - and even Porter - only 10% occupied... with my group being about 9% of the occupation at Corner Tavern. Maybe they heard the fries aren't great? Yikes.. . The moral of the story is that some bars can't handle standard bar fare, but when they try something above and beyond like that soup, it's a standout star.
