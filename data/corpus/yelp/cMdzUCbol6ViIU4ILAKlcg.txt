Every trip that I take back to Atlanta has to also include a trip to Eats. This is on my top 5 favs for restaurants in Atlanta. . . Simple and delicious would be the two words used to describe this place. It's not the fanciest or the cleanest place to dine at but the food sure is yummy. . . Torttellini w/ alfredo sauce - YUM! . Lemon Pepper Ckn w/ cous cous and mac-n-cheese - YUM! . . Homemade southern brewed sweet tea - YUMMMM!!!
