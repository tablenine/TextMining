Garlic lovers....welcome to paradise.  Just by the fact that when you walk into the place, they have garlic hanging all over the place makes me love it.  This place is Dracula's nightmare come true...and garlic heaven for me!. . Food is awesome...but I might be biased, because I'm a garlic freak at times.  The bread they serve you comes with this pretty much baked garlic clove butter stuff that practically breaks on the bread when you spread it.  From the garlic chicken to the rabbit(a tad gamy, but I like that kindof stuff; it's actually my personal favorite entree), to the garlic ice cream(sounds gross but you HAVE to try it)...the place wreaks....I mean, ROCKS!  . . Service - definitely a plus.  They often go into the whole garlic theme of the place just to give you some more 411, esp if you haven't been there before.  It's on resto row on La Cienega, so they compete with the neighboring spots, one of them being Lawry's, so they're usually on par with having great service.  . . Parking - I think they have Valet-only here too, because it's on a busy street and the neighborhood is a good distance away.  But there are some metered spots a lil ways down, just depends on your preference.. . So if you're interested in tantalizing your garlic side, come on in!
