Porto is always busy. You know, their cheese rolls and potato balls are too die for. I also love their sandwich(Cuban sandwich, medianoche sandwich etc). I used to come to this place a lot when I lived in Glendale area before. I hope they will open portos in many locations. Delicious, Delicious, Delicious.
