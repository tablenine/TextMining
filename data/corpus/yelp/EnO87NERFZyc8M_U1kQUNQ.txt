I've only been to  Park Tavern 3 times.  The first two were for crowded holiday events that I barely remember because, well, I like to drink and they have lots to drink.. . This represents the unfortunate third visit:. So, the BF and I were looking for something to do on Friday, it was raining, and as I'm in the middle of planning a corporate event in the Garden tent, I suggested we head to Park Tavern for $1 rainy day drafts.  $1 beer will pull me out in a hurricane, so the little drizzle we had going on was nuthin.. . It was a little crowded but we only had to wait for about a minute before being seated.  I didn't realize that the only beer for $1 is their own brew.  They had four choices that night, scratch that, three because everyone had drunk up all the Pilsner.  They apparently knew better than we did cause every other brew sucked donkey balls.  The Octoberfest tasted like vinegar, and the pale ale and IPA tasted burnt and well, just gross.  Bad, bad, bad, home brew.. . This stuff does not stand up to the quality of local brew I am used to imbibing.  I mean, come on peeps, you're in Atlanta, home of Sweetwater and the Atlanta Brewing Company.  You're gonna have to try and bring it - just a little bit.. . Didn't try the food, but I got a pretty good idea from what was stuck on the menus.. . I'll definitely keep attending the large events at Park Tavern cause the patio is awesome, and it's nice being right on the park, but somebody needs to smack the brewmaster please!
