Love the salmon salad, great onion rings, lovely lovely seating in the outdoor garden with twinkly lights.  I'm not a huge fan of the desserts--they are fine I suppose, just on the less remarkable side.  But I've always enjoyed everything I've eaten here, and we've always had great service, great atmosphere--one of those places that makes me wish I lived on the eastside so I could go more often.
