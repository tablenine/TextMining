This place is open late and the food is good. Compared to the other options around 3 this is amazing. I have never been here sober so maybe my opinion would change. I like that they have outside seating if you want to have a smoke or something. The first time I was here I had puked earlier on Hollywood Blvd. then came here and orderd Udon soup. Which the chopsticks proved to be too much for me and I ended up trying to eat them with a fork and eventually my fingers. Not such a good night. I like you Fred 62, will be back soon.
