Came here a few nights ago with a co-worker after a long hard day.  She was in crappy spirits when we first arrived but we were both smiling when we left.. . I've passed this place a lot and finally decided to give it a whirl.  It's really dim and slick inside.  Very lounge like.  We sat upstairs at the bar and decided on a couple glasses of Pinot Noir.  Bartender was cute and quick with the drinks.  The wine was wonderful and smooth.  I wish I would have remembered exactly what label it was.  Oh well... I'll have to go back!. . I ordered the oysters rocker feller and the crab cakes.  My friend ordered the salmon.  I had a little taste of her fish.  It was good but nothing compared to those oysters.  . . Dear lord I could have eaten a dozen.  I got the appetizer portion of 3 but devoured them pretty fast.  They were done to perfection- the spinach and butter on top was almost gooey like cheese and the oyster meat was substantial.  The chunks of smoky bacon on top were meaty too.  I'm getting hungry just remembering it!. . The crab cakes were big (two) and all lump meat...not indefinable flakes like  you get in some places. They were served with a creamy creole remoulade and mango tartar sauce.  I swooped up every last bit of it.  Delicious!. . It wasn't a expensive as I thought it would be either.  For the ambiance and the quality of the food I thought it was really fair.  The oysters were under $8 which I thought was awesome.. . I will definitely be back.  My BF loves seafood but can't do shellfish - he will love these oysters for sure.
