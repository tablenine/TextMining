My favorite place to get blurred at in Chicago next to my friend's houses.  I've been going to this bar for years and it's the one place where I know I will always run into friends.  Going there on Mondays for the $3 lychee champagne is awesome, even though it drags in a bunch of people I'd rather not be around.  My boy and I go there for cute dinner dates and we are always happy with the $12 kobe beef burger.  I also enjoy their maki and the wasabi fries are on point.  Did I mention the Pho? I forgot to mention the Pho. The Pho is also great and $3 on Sundays.
