Been coming here since they opened. It's a little too sceney for my taste but early in the morning or later at night, I am a happy patron.. . Everything is pretty wonderful.. . I am currently madly in love with their bread pudding. The best bread pudding I've ever had and I used to hate bread pudding --- probably because my father told me it was made with leftovers when I was small.
