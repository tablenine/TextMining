This is a cute little place that I went to on Saturday for date night.  We showed up at about 8pm and only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  This place is quite small and would not be good for groups.  Most of the tables are practically on top of each other so I hope you like your neighbors!  If you have the option, try to grab seats by the window in the elevated section for a little more privacy (unless you enjoy awkwardness).. . As for the food.... . SUPER DELICIOUS: Jalapeno Gnocchi (This alone deserves 5 stars). . PRETTY GOOD: Eggplant with marinara. . PASS: Goat cheese with marinara (I've had much better elsewhere). . If you're a vegetarian and your boyfriend is not, you might want to let them know which items are your and which are his or else all of the meat items will arrive after you have finished...just sayin.. . I will probably head back but it's no Mana.
