I went here for drinks last night after work.  A few friends had been before and what better than a rooftop patio on a nice summer day?  . . ZED and I started off all wrong.  I walked in the restaurant door instead of the rooftop bar door.  When I entered I was greeted by about 5 smiling faces, when I asked how to get to the roof and they found out I wasn't there for dinner there was a complete change in attitude.  Fortunately, I found my way to the right entrance.  I'm told there is normally a line, but I only waited a few minutes for what I was told was a "capacity issue".. . Once I met up with my friends on the roof, I found out they weren't kidding - it was packed!  The drinks were good and it's a great atmosphere, but we had trouble finding a place to sit since it's first come first serve.  . . Overall, ZED is a cool place to check out.  Just be prepared for staff with attitude and wear comfy shoes since you will be standing for a while!
