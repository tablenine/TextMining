I have to thank Mr. Batali for introducing me to my favorite foul.  Several years ago I had the pleasure of going to his New York restaurant Babbo.  That is where I discovered quail and the fact that it is one tasty little bird.  So when a friend's wife invited my wife and me to a birthday dinner, I knew we had to go.  We were seated quickly in the little side room adjacent to the private room.  I was worried that we would be off the radar for the waiters, but we never had a lack of service all night and it was nice being able to hear each other and talk.  As you can guess, I had the quail wrapped with pancetta, which was amazing and perfectly cooked.  The rabbit was not on the menu, but will probably be what I will try next time.  My wife had the duck and  it seriously is a huge amount of quacker.  The corn relish and orange marmalade was delicious when you combined them all into a bite.  The unexpected highlight of the night was how unexpectantly good one of the items on the menu was.  I am talking about the calf brain raviolis.  Normally I do not do anything cow related and for several years I did not eat anything with a hoof.  While traveling I realized that it says a lot when a chef or even a culture can make a dish that most Americans would turn their nose up at and make it delicious.  The raviolis were creamy and delicious and satisfied my inner zombie.  Really if I had you try these you would have no idea what you were eating and wonder what the delicious rich filling was.  All in all an amazing meal and with wine and a ton of food set us back about $200 for a couple and was worth every cent.
