Category: Barbeque
You can taste the smoke! I was so hungry when I came here and what I really wanted the most was the coleslaw and the fries. Â I wouldn't have wanted to be sitting across from me because I felt like I was just shoveling them into my mouth. Really, really good. The mac and cheese has a perfect crust on top and I could have had a bunch more of that. The ribs and chicken are good and the sauces you can pick from at the table are really good too but not the best BBQ I've ever had. This is a great place to have within walking distance and if you go early when there is no wait it's a great place to have some beer, eat, and relax after work. People getting there closer to 7pm could face up to an hour wait and I'd never wait an hour to eat here. The staff here are very nice. I haven't been here when they have a band playing which is probably a good thing, it seems like that would be incredibly loud in such a small place. They have a nice beer selection!
