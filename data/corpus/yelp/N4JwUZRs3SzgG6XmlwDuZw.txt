Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I went back again to give this place another shot, but I was still disappointed.  I had the sausage pizza, and my friends had the Louie salad and the fish.  The pizza was VERY disappointing.  It was large, but the dough tasted quite salty.  There were little crumbles of sausage, and the cheese and sauce were very average.  Pizza Next Door has better pizza.. . I really don't see how this place can have so many stars.  Maybe my friends and I keep ordering the wrong things???  . . Another thing we noticed about eating in the restaurant was that the acoustics are really bad b/c when the place started to fill up, it got really loud and my friends and I had a hard time hearing each other talk.. . Anyway, the staff was more organized this time.  In fact, I think they are trying to hook people with their customer service.  Our water glasses never went below half-empty (the waitress, her assistant, and even the manager kept filling them) and I was constantly addressed by my last name by the staff.
