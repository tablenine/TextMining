Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I walked in here expecting that it would be better than what I experienced. I found the pastrami to be rather bland, and the overall taste of the sandwich sub par. I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately I'll have to get my pastrami sandwiches elsewhere.
