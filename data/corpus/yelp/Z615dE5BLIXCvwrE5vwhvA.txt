I went to the Santa Monica location.... . I wanted to like it, I really did.  I'm not vegan, but eat veggie about 75% of the time.  So, I've had tofu, tempeh, etc many times.. . I got the black bean tostada, and it was bland.  It really doesn't take alot for a meal like this to have flavor.  Give me some cumin, red pepper,  green chili, somethin'.. . Maybe I didn't order right, so I'll return someday and give it a go.  . . I did love the tiramisu though!. . Waitstaff was very friendly.
