I would've been better off going to Denny's or Norms for a late night after clubbing grubfest. This place looks old and waiting in line by the deli ruined my appetite. I saw things I don't think people should be eating. Globs and blobs of stuff. Really grossed me out. . . Food tasted whatever. Dry and just not appetizing. Usually after a night of dancing and drinking I'm ready for some of the greasy good stuff but this just didn't cut it for me. I knew I should have just bought an LA dirty dog!!!
