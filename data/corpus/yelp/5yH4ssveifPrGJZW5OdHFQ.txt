Category: Gay Bars
Four stars for the server alone - guy was hilarious and super nice even after spilling a drink all over my boyfriend's lap on accident. Everything that came out of his mouth from that point onward was nothing short of amazing, and the guy earned himself a great tip for being so awesome. Kudos, servers! You guys rock. Not to mention I love it when three gay men come to my rescue when I go to sit in a chair in a fancy dress (came from a red carpet event) and they quickly catch me with a "Oh honey hang on! Let me get the water out of the chair for you!" Score.. . The food isn't the best in the city, but it's far from the worst. The chili is actually good considering I normally loathe chili, and the burgers are very large and filling. There's enough options to please anyone, and all the burgers have a veggie burger option. You can also have your dog with you on the patio AND they provide water for your pooch. Score again.. . Whether you come here for trivia, Crazy Bitch Bingo, the food, or the atmosphere, you'll always be greeted with a smile and a slap on the rear from some of the funniest servers around!
