ive been here a few times and i always tell myself to try something else on the menu. but i cant. the hainan chicken is too good. . . my usual order here is the hainan chicken, shrimp rolls.. . hainan chicken: okay so this is singapore style hainan chicken. i love it. makes me want to go to singapore and raid their kitchens! chicken is tender and luke warm. comes with soy sauce, ground ginger, and some orange colored sauce. the rice it comes with is amazingly soft! never had such soft rice. normally, i wouldnt write how good rice is at a restaurant but this place has fluffy rice that just totally compliments the soft chicken. . . shrimp rolls: fried, crispy, and very hot. also comes with some orange colored sauce. its alot of thick crispy skin and some thin veggies and small chunks of shrimp inside. the dish is yum.. . i also tried their smoked duck salad? salads alot of veggies! overflows the plate! salad itself is okay. the pieces of duck meat makes this salad. i would recommend it if you like duck.. . space wise, yeah its kinda sorta really crammed. its a tiny store. they have a choice of indoor and outdoor seating. i always sit inside. too hot these days. they have table seats and bar seats. the good thing is its not hard to get a waiters attention since the stores not big. . . service is friendly, and the store for being busy all the time, its pretty darn clean! . . parking: good luck. there is no parking lot. you better park in the street! not horrible but you might have to walk up to savoy for a block. thats if your unlucky or came at an incredibly busy hr. i probably need a walk after i eat here though.
