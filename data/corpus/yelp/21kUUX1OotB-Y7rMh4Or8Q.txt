I'm really bummed that they were out of the moon pie cupcake yesterday when we came in! But the ones that we did get were out of this world good. I had plain old vanilla with vanilla frosting, and it just about melted in my mouth and was so deliciously good. The Boy got a Malt cupcake - marble cake with frosting that had bits of Whoppers candies in it. He loved it so much that I didn't even get a bite! We also got a chocolate raspberry that my sister loved, and an Elvis (banana cupcake with peanut butter frosting). I will definitely be back to Taste of Heaven as soon as possible to try some more of these deliciously good cupcakes!. . Update 6/1/08: We went back for brunch today and absolutely loved it. I had the grilled cheese omelet, and I loved the omelets and the potatoes that came with it - but I was a little confused by the haricot verts salad - not really my cup of tea so early in the morning. Mike had the breakfast burrito, and he really enjoyed it. We each had a moon pie cupcake to go, and it's probably good that I don't live so close to Taste of Heaven, because I could eat at least 2 of those a day. Can't wait to go back...
