The most popular ramen restaurant in J-Town. The food here is pretty good, although I was hesitant to give it a 5 star because some stuff excelled while others were a little shortcoming. Plus, I've had better ramen in Japan. Nonetheless, the restaurant is still worthy of most of the hype.. . First off, the salad appetizer was pretty cheap. Shredded lettuce with thousand island dressing on top. The gyoza and pork bowl rice dishes were pretty good. As for the house special ramen, the soup is fantastic. Very very tasty as is the pork, which had very good texture. The quality of the noodles itself could've been better, but it's still passable. I really do love that soup broth.. . In all, I recommend this restaurant. The lines are long, but the food, both ramen and rice dishes, are pretty good.
