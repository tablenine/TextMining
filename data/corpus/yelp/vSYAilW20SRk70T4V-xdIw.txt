Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Milk is unique and adorable.  They have a variety of ice cream to choose from as well as a bakery case your eyes and stomach will get lost in for days.  I got the brownie sunday, and it was so good.  They had their rich chocolate ice cream with their creamy vanilla ice cream, home made brownies, peanuts, hot fudge, whip cream, and a maraschino cherry of course.  I went with my friend and he got this sandwich with prosciutto and it was really salty, I didn't like it.  He got some cupcakes and other goods to go, and I told him not to get the mini cupcake bites because they tend to be dry.  There was a lady cleaning the bakery case and said they weren't dry because she baked them herself.  Of course a baker will stand by her goods, but I told him so and of course the next day he tells me they were dry.  Whatever haha.  Milk is a good place to go to get some real good comfort sweet treats.  Next time I go, I want to try the blue velvet cake!!
