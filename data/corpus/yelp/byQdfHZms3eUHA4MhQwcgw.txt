I ate here awhile back and forgot to give it a great review (silly me!). . The ambience is what hits you first...very chill and modern. As soon as you're seated, they open up your BYOB wine and get you started on ordering. I had the sesame beef, which was AWESOME! Hot and a generous portion. We also had dessert, which was a chocolate soufflet. While not your typical Asian dessert, it was a very nice way to finish off dinner and the wine.. . I highly recommend this place both for dates and a fun night out with friends. It'll be a hit!
