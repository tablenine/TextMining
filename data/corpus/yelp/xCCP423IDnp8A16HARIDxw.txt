The burgers are delicious. The Hatch Burger was mouth watering...the fries and onion rings were good. The pickles...eh..not worth the $5. The real soda...eh...they were flat. . . Service was great; Rick was very attentive and knowledgable. Street parking sucks, but the do have valet for $2.50.. . For the overall deliciousness, they get 4 stars.
