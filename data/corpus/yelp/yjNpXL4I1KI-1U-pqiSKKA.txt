Sushi shouldn't get this expensive unless it comes with sprinkles of platinum inside the rolls, then I'd understand. Other than that, you're paying to be a part of the scene. Yes, the sushi is great if you have deep pockets, but you can get that same quality (even better) anywhere else for half the price. If you really find it really necessary to eat at Geisha House, then you're not really in it for the sushi, now are you? It's ok, here is a box of tissues, acceptance is the first step.
