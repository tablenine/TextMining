Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I've always heard that Pink's is overrated. . . But nonetheless, my friends and I decided to give it a try. We waited roughly 2 hours and the line started near the back of the parking lot. . . Was it worth it? Well....sort of.. . I ordered the Muhulland Dog which was bacon, nacho cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms, on top of a hotdog. It was good. It was delish. It was artery clogging awesome. . . But with such simple ingredients that I can prepare myself at home, I'll pass on the 2 hour wait and make them myself. . . It was worth the experience but I doubt I'd make a repeat.
