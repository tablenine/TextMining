Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Ok, they must come in early and often and put cooked steer beef into semi cooked corn tortillas and freeze them.. . They have so much volume I assume they have to.. . The flavor is good if you crave Tito's.. It hasn't been crowded at dinnertime lately. Easy to stop recently.. . The all Meat With Cheese Burritos Are Great.. I like to scoop out the filling with some of their chips.. . Lately a cheese enchilada and one taco have been satisfying my crave. (under $4). . People swear by this place.. . It's fairly close to me and I like it that way.. . PS People I Know Love Tito's Â Salsa. It's Made Fresh Daily Like The Chips.
