I had my 22nd bday here...and it was  a great choice if i should say so myself (taking a bow). I ilove it.....there's Geisha's walking around everywhere......the young hollywood crowd dressed to impress......wierd music...but lovely....great ambiance...... . The food is sooo good! The odong....is wonderful....i always get the teriyaki salmon....which taste awesome also..... . Valet Parking is $5 unless you want to try and park in HOLLYWOOD....which is a no no no!!!. . Great place to dress treny and bring friends to chill, have drinks, enjoy good food, and hang out in a  nice atmostphere!. . Service can be slow sometimes :(
