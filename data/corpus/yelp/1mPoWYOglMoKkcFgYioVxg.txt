Two star toasted. Went there on a Saturday afternoon after being recommended to the place by a friend who seems to know all these Design District places... not a bad experience, but not great either. Parking was a breeze, but only because my friend has a radar for open spaces close by - a good thing. That's what friends are really for!!! . . Food: Mainly bland and rather boring. Had the so-called "Favorite Omelette"... which was... boring. Spinach was fine, mushrooms were fine, eggs were fine, it tasted a lot better after I emptied the pepper shaker on it. "Fine" isn't a very inspired description, but that is what it was. As I said, we got lucky - no way would I drive over there from downtown and fight for parking on a weekday, and I guess weekends are tough too.. . Atmosphere: Not great, not terrible. Wouldn't want to sit on the 3rd St outdoor tables, it is a mid-block location and feels like having lunch on the freeway. The side street patio is better, if you like parked cars and concrete for seat-mates. Inside has cheesy decor, though it is very, very noisy. If there were a bunch of Hollywood types, I didn't notice. Then again, I never do, and that's just fine with me.... . Go to Joan's - another funky place but the food is a whole helluva lot more interesting, and better.
