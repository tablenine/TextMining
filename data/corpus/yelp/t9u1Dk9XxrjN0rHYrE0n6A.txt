Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
While en route to Burbank's Bob Hope Airport, hunger pangs set in just as we came upon the bustling street corner that is home to the unassuming facade of Porto's Bakery.  Curious, we pulled into the parking lot.  Inside, the snaking lines were a mirror of Los Angeles's population -- every age, class, and cultural background was represented, all of us gazing with saucer eyes at the bounty.  Porto's menu includes savories, including house specialty Cuban sandwiches, and sweets.  We sampled a few of each.    I want an excuse to return to Burbank so I can have another go at it!
