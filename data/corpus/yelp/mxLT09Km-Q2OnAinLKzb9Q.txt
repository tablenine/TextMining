best thai food in thai town!! its in a mini mall with lots of other good options, too. but this place was a huuuuge surprise. a) open till 4am i think. b) cheap as hell!!! c) best pad see ew ive ever had! makes me never wat to eat pattaya or leela thai EVER again. puts them to shame! the service is kind of slow, though. we were kind of like, trying to make eye contact with our waitress and it took ker forever to come over. but it was worth it! plus, you know when they do that its probably not rude, just some cultural thing. right?
