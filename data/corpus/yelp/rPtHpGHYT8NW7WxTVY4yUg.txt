i love love love garlic! mmm.. this place does not dissapoint!  i got the 40 garlic clove chicken and it was juicy and very flavorful- garlic of course!  we also ordered the garlic steamed clams, and the zuppa di pesce (really good) and the seafood black linguini.  the zuppa di pesce has muscles, crab, fish, shrimp, and calamari in a tomatoey garlic broth.  I wish they put more garlic in their food still!! =P  the restuarant is decorated kinda dark and quirky  but its a fun place to go!
