Wow. It is SO filling! I got the #26, as suggested by someone else on here. It was very hearty, a beef stew of sorts that came with crusty french bread to dip. There almost wasn't enough broth for the amount of meat and carrots and other various goodies submerged in this big bowl of soup. My only problem with pho is that the meat is so fatty...I wish they could cut off the fat! I also got some bubble tea, but I made the mistake of getting the smoothie kind; not too good. And pineapple flavor tastes a bit artificial...so I'll try icy and another flavor next time. And as far as the service, they weren't too fast for me this time; they gave us a minute to decide what we wanted, which was cool. All in all, a great pho place!
