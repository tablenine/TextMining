Savoy used to be my favorite place for Hai-nan chicken, but I was a bit disappointed last time I visited. The portion got smaller and the taste wasn't good as before. I don't know if they have a new chef now or something. It tasted totally different now than the past several years I had visited. I think I will still come back once in the while, but not for Hai-nan chicken anymore. I think their curry is better than their chicken now.
