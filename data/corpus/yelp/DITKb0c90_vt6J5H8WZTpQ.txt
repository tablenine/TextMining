Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Hide's consistent quality, excellent prices, fresh fish, and delicious food have brought me back and back. Â I've only had traditional sushi here, with the exception of one roll, my favorites are their yellowtail, as well as red snapper. Prices, which start at around $3.80 and top off at $5.50 are excellent, while the freshest of fish never ceases to amaze. Although the wait and parking around the area can be quite atrocious, the food will have you coming back. Unfortunately Hide does not serve fresh wasabi, or 'real' ginger (only the artificially colored pink stuff). Some chefs are a little bit stricter than others, but Yugi or however you spell it is the best.
