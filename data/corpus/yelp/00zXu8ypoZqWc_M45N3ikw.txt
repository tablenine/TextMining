As everyone else is saying, Furaibo's chicken wings are above average.  But oh my goodness, the grilled smelt is yumdillyicious! Bowl of white rice on the side.  Yes, the little smelt heads remind you you're not in Kansas anymore (my friend says it reminds her of baby bird heads) -- but they're tasty.
