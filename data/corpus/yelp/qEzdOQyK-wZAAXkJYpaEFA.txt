If you know me, you know how a) desperate I am for something new in my area and b) how much I crave/dream about/live for noodles and dumplings.  I do like the austere, lowkey take on panasian dining, and it reminded me of a few spots in LA that have the same formula - strip mall, modern austerity and pan asian food that also attracts a mixed but trendy young crowd.  But, honestly, I was turned off by their price for the quality of food I got. Picky detail here - there were no big, soup spoons available for my soup and you know you need a decent-sized spoon to pile on the noodles, meat and broth for a perfectly crafted bite.  . . Again, if you're hankering for noodles and dumplings in the Logan/Avondale area, you're in luck. BYO is a plus as well.
