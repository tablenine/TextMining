Excellent sushi, reasonable price.  . . Highlights:  uni, saba, albacore. . We ordered the chef's special, which had a roll that looked and tasted like cooked salmon and carrot, which sounds like something you'd get at Cheesecake Factory (not in a proper Japanese Sushi restaurant).  That almost knocked it down to three stars.. . The uni and mackeral were phenomenal though.
