I really dont know how to write this review since Ive never tried the food.  Ive made a total of 4 attempts.  The first 3 I never got to sit at a table because the wait was an hour plus.  Ok its popular Ill let that slide.  Last night I made a fourth attempt to go. They said 20-25 mins I thought Finally!!! I get to try Chow Baby.  Ive been to wok style places in LA before but it has been a long time.  So we wait at the bar have a few drinks and enjoy watching the storm roaring outside.  25 mins passes we order more drinks and continue to wait and try to keep the enjoyment level high and spirited.  After they tried to pawn 6 of us off on a table that would be tight for 4 we continue to wait for a bigger table.  We reach the 1 hour mark (ugggggh again) and finally get a table outside (well two tables no where near the same height) I let it slide and we get in a line (great more waiting) to grab some food.  The line is all over the place! everyone is bumping into everyone and everything else.  Even the servers do the same without much care.  We wait in line for 20 mins and are still no where near the start of the buffet section.  OK this place has been nothing but a problem since people have first started to bring me here.  I had enough so very upset we left.  You can say its unfair to judge a place that you have not tried.  I think even if I did I still form opinions about service and cleanliness and so on.   Ok I did try the mojitos, pretty lame they cant even muddle the sugar, water, mint, and so on but maybe Im being too hard because the overall experience was very lacking.  I will try this place again and attempt to actually eat here but probably not for awhile.  I dont feel like wasting a night on a "chance" I may actually get to try this place.
