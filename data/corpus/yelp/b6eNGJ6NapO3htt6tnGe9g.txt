Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Are you out of your mind?  This is the best pizza I've had in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Brooklyn, and New York City.  I've lived in each city for years (except for Chicago).. . There's only one pizza as melt in your mouth scrumptious, and it's in Connecticut by Yale.  It's a style only these two places pull off, and I'm lucky to live so close to one of them now.. . Okay, you don't review a place like this based on it's other dishes, ambiance, waiting time, parking --- etcetera.  All are reasonable -- except for the typical wait time to get a table then get that pizza.. . But the pizza is so GOOD it doesn't matter.  If it matters to you, you don't deserve this pizza.  Knock yourself out at Pizza Hut, baby.. . I highly recommend their pepperoni and basil.  Slice the pizza, put it your mouth, and then slit your throat.  Better than life itself...
