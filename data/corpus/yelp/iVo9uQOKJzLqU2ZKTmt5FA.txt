For my 100th review, I thought I'd pick an old favorite.  I came to Resto a lot when they first opened up; the back of my head was even featured in the New York Times review.  I hadn't been by in a while so I came by recently to see how things are going and was not disappointed.  Excellent menu of Belgian beers, including some rare finds, plus a full bar and a well-chosen wine list.  The food is great if a little one-dimensional.  The menu changes seasonally but you can always expect a lot of hearty, Belgian-inspired fare, so don't come without an appetite.  Good brunch, too.  The hangover pasta and eggs benedict served on a bacon-filled Belgian waffle are both genius.
