Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
If there's one word that can be used to describe Uncle Julio's it's consistent. Yes, there are better Mexican restaurants in the city. Yes, there are ones serving more authentic Mexican food. But Uncle Julio's does wonders to satisfy my cravings for Mexican with their huge portions and friendly service.. . I've been here with one other person, a few friends, and large groups, and the service is always friendly and quick. They don't rush you, but they are attentive, and will always offer suggestions if the menu is too overwhelming.. . The food is really, really good and it's the same every time you come in (something that I can't really say for a lot of the little taquerias around town). I love their platters; they're a little on the expensive side, but if you're a light eater, you'll easily be able to save one of the enchiladas and some rice/beans for lunch the next day, and probably keep the taco for a late night snack.. . The other great thing about this location is the free valet parking. This area is hellish for parking unless you're going to a very specific place and it's an off-peak time of day, which makes their parking lot heavenly. What more could you ask for?
