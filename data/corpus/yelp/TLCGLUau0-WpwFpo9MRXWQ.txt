Good service and very interesting dishes.  However, the portions were a little small and unsatisfying.  We have tried other vegetarian places such as Gobo in NYC and not only do they have a larger variety, we were able to satisfy our appetite without spending $80/$90 per person.  At green zebra, we enjoyed the drink and a few appetizers however felt that we would need to order everything on the menu to get a good fill.
