Eats, to me, is a well above average meat and three place. I usually get the chicken, but the meat loaf is tastey as well. I like the sides, particularly the collards and mac.. . Last night, I ventured into the pasta side for the first time, and enjoyed the turkey Lasagna. For me the chicken is the way to go, though.. . The prices are fair, and if you're the kind of person that eats one meal a day, this will do the trick ... or if you just like large portions.
