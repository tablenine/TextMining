While I still lived in L.A., I might as well have been Jewish. All my friends were Jewish American Princesses who worked in the sex biz. We lived off of Ventura. Hollywood was the Holy Land. And Jewish diners were Life.. . Jerry's is pretty darn good, but nothing comes close to the matzo ball or kreplach soup at Canter's. Â (Balls the size of your head... huge.) The latkes with apple sauce are great. The Reubens are stellar. The pastrami is more magic than Jesus.. . There's no place in L.A. I'd rather be at dawn, after a hard day's night in Hollywood, than sitting behind a bowl of Canter's matzo ball soup.
