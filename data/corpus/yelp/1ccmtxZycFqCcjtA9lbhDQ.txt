I have this strong sexual attraction to Adam on Man vs. Food.. . He's tall, he's handsome, he's funny, and homeboy can eat.  He makes me weak.. . So when the bestie tells me she and the hubster are about to visit the locale where my beloved has thrown down with a bowl of spicy ramen, I was in.. . Upon entering this very small place, I looked to their wall of fame to see my man, empty bowl in frame, beautiful smile on his angelic face and I knew it'd be a good meal.. . I started with the cold tofu which was simple, fresh and yummy.. . Then the famous ramen.  First step is pick the broth ( I got salt ), then the spice level ( I got level 6 - the step above mild ) then any extras beyond the pork and veggies ( egg, garlic, green onion ). . . The bowl arrived and was bigger than my head which is no small feat as my head, like my love for Adam, is enormous. . . It was really good, especially the hard boiled egg, and being that I can do as many combinations as possible, the next visit I can explore something new.... . Advice: Order the egg and extra noodles with your ramen - that is, unless you are bold enough to dare try the Extreme #2 Spicy Ramen 30 Minute Challenge...a challenge that 3 patrons were attempting while I was eating.  One guy failed, the other two were in process, my prayers were with them.. . Ever since, I have been craving not just Adam - as is normal - but also, ramen...and one of those bad boys will me mine very soon...
