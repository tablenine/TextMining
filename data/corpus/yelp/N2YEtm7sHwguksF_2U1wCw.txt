The only reason why I'm giving this restaurant four stars is because the amuse bouche made me I want to gag. It was really fishy and I couldn't believe it was being served. I don't know if it's because I got a bad spoonful but my boyfriend didn't like it either. The people in the other table didn't find any problems with it but maybe they have a stronger palette than mine. . . Otherwise, the food here is amazing! I ordered the duck and wow, so good. It was perfect and the skin was crisp and flavorful. This was also the restaurant that got me hooked on lamb. I hadn't realized lamb could be so delicious! The wine selection is also yummy. But of course you would expect something like that from a restaurant of his caliber. . . The servers are attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. They're very helpful with your order if you're not quite sure what you should have. The ambiance is intimate and comfortable. Although the decor is a little strange, with heavy curtains separating the rooms rather than traditional walls.. . Overall, a great restaurant!
