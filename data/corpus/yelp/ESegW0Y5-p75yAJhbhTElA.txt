Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
titos tacos is a place to go to fill up and not spend much.. . when my buddy andy took me here we didnt talk much because we were concentrating on the menu and then stuffing burritos down our throats. it was all business. . . try everything. . . my favorites are the tacos with cheese, cheese enchilada's, tostada's, and tito's salsa!!!! oh maannn im making myself hungry. . . note: dont expect top quality mexican food. lines get long and people tend to cut you off. just elbow them in the head and tell them youre hungrier.
