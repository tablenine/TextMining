Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
I had the Cuban sandwich here. I know, I ordered the stereotypical Cuban dish. But a measure of a Cuban restaurant can be determined by the quality of its Cuban sandwich. When I received my Cuban sandwich, alongside an additional order of black beans and rice, it was huge. It tasted like a fine Cuban sandwich, so it did its part. The cashier at the front didn't look particularly affable though.
