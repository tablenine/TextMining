best ribs in the city next to my own.  I love this place, its cheap and amazing, sure they are busy and the service sort of blows if you get sat in the bar.  You are better off in the dining room or actually sitting at the bar.  But the owners are great, the sauce is legendary, its the opposite of the dark sweet baby rays which i think blows.  Wife who is a vegetarian likes the hummus plate and the salads.  I know the twin anchors is great too but for me it's millers by a nose.
