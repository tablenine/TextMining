I hate being the hater... but the pizza wasn't that great.  Everything else was fine (well, except for the beer that turned out to be $18) -- seated right away, service was awesome, nice atmosphere -- but the food was disappointing.  The gorgonzola and fennel sausage pizzas were a little bland and dry with too much crust.  Definitely not best-pizza-ever level.
