Restaurant: Willy&#39;s Mexicana Grill
Category: Mexican
This place rocked my socks!  I love a good plate of nachos and boy, did it hit the spot when I went here last week with my guy for lunch. I love the outdoor seating area and I noticed that they have a milk jug full of water and labeled it "Dog Water."  How cute is that? I'm sure just doing something simple as that would attract more pet lovers to their establishment. I fell in love with their green salsa and I really appreciated the friendly, yet patient staff when I kept adding to my order or spending time figuring out if I wanted black or pinto beans on my nachos! HA!   My BF might disagree with me on this one but I think Willy's is not bad and just as tasty or even more so than the other Mexican restaurant down the street from him, which serves good tasty margaritas.. . Very fast food like but still hits the spot.  It's definitely NOT authentic Mexican food but it works :)
