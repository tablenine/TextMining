Nota bene: This is not where the fat lady sings!  That would be the Lyric Opera.  This is Opera, the restaurant- located in Chicago's South Loop neighborhood.  Opera specializes in Asian Fusion cuisine.. . If you've never dined at the magnificent Opera before, your eyes will feast on modern decor with a very unique design.  The saturated colors, variable patterns, and attention to detail will wow you!  On a visual level, this is one of the most impressionable restaurants that I have dined at in Chicago.. . This was my second time dining at Opera; once was for dinner, and most recently was for lunch.  At lunch I ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp lunch box.  The meal consisted of a choice of soup, a choice of entree, rice, and a dessert (a creme brulee or a fruit cup).  I ordered the sweet and sour duck won ton soup, the kung pao shrimp, fried rice, and the creme brulee.  The soup had all the tang of the hot and sour soup plus the won-ton noodles with duck.  The main dish arrived in a cute rectangular Asian plate with a divider. The heat in the kung pao shrimp sure put a PAO in my taste buds and I wanted to call the fire department!  If you likey the spicey, then Opera is where it's at!  It was delicious though.  The creme brulee was a small serving of a berry flavored brulee.  Mmm.  It was so nice to have a little of this and that for lunch.  Cost was $14.95.. . Having dined in Opera for both business and pleasure and for lunch and dinner, I found it to be appropriate no matter what time of day and for any purpose.  This would also be a great place to bring a date.. . If you wish to indulge your senses, Opera is sure to make your eyes pop and your taste buds sing!
