Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
i'm a new fan of Bottega Louie.  The moment i stepped in, i felt like i wasnt in LA anymore...reminiscient of Dean &amp; DeLuca in NYC, this new DTLA establishment boasts yummy food and dessert (choco chip cookie is delicious).  You have a choice to sit in the lobby area for more casual fare (you can purchase deli food and desserts from the counter) or you can sit in the dining area and enjoy a larger menu that boasts delicious stone fired pizzas (i recommend the margherita pizza) to yummy apps (mushroom fries!) and much, much more~.   i wasnt impressed by the pastas though. But what set this apart from a lot of other places was the service.  The wait staff was unbelivably nice.  The food was affordable and we got it fast.  Kudos all around for Bottega Louie.  The only con i'd say is the parking but hey, that DTLA for ya.
