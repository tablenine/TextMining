this place was good, but i wasn't left feeling satisfied.  after waiting for a long time (granted it was lunchtime) it still took a while to get our order taken.  and the sushi was alright.  it was definitely good and fair priced.  i would go back again, but not if i was starving and craving amazing sushi.
