help!! take me to the ER! I'mma have a heart attack!! . . The pastrami here is amazing here, people. It's about $20 for a HUGE sandwich, slaw, and a drink. I know it's a bit steep but this ish is tasty! Everything about this place is a lot of fun, the ambiance, the people, the friendly waitresses, the FOOD. This hole in the wall has a 70's vibe to it. I swear, it's so good. The sandwish melts in your mouth, just like it should. Parking is available in one of the adjacent lots, validation is required. Otherwise, good luck finding street parking. ENJOY your meal!!
