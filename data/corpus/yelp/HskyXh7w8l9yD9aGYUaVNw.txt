Minor &amp; mute points are; the coffee wasn't very hot &amp; you have to hold the bathroom door wide open to try to find the light switch. Clue; the light switch is on the left wall just before the sink when you walk in. Don't light a lighter because it's against fire code!. I ate a broccoli &amp; cheese omelette with a bacon side at 1 PM (Saturday.) I probably will not eat until Monday as it was so good &amp; it was so filling. . A very nice waitress served so I don't know what the "no waiter thing" is on lots of the reviews unless it's the time I was there. . It's a very comfortable &amp; pretty room. I live pretty far away but if I am close to Feed I will eat there again. I love breakfast for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
