Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I went there for my first UYE, I had DTF a few times in Arcadia, in Taiwan Taipei (the original one) and the ones in the department stores in Taipei.  I have to say the ones in Taiwan still taste the best, at least the skin is thinner and smoother, the ones over here has tougher skin.  . . We have about 14 people this time, I arrived late so I had no idea how long they waited (probably long...) and we order a bunch dumplings.. pork dumpling, shrimp and pork dumpling, shrimp fried rice, crab dumpling and the stir fried green beans.  They were really good and they came out pretty fast, I think we probably eat about 12 orders or so..the finally bill came out around $270, we left the DTF satisfied and we all look like dumpling face @ the end.  I still think pork dumpling probably the best among all the dumplings, and since we were really full and need to save room for dessert, we didn't order soup and others in DTF.  . . If I were to order the dumpling, I would put two order of the red bean ones to let them try since it's very different..(on the other hand, I gotta save room for the dessert afterward.. shaved ice!!!!)  I think everyone like it tho  =)
