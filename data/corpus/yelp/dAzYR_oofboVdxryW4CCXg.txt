I don't really get why this place is cool... I mean, you can get whatever you want to eat while your eating partner can eat something else. But the prices are expensive, and the atmosphere is loud and a little chaotic. It basically feels like a souped up cafeteria. Nonetheless, the quality of the food was good!
