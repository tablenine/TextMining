Restaurant: Baoguette Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
Although I am secretly sad that BAMN is gone, Baoguette Cafe is a fine replacement. We ordered the B'un pork chop &amp; shrimp in addition to the grilled pork chop sandwich. DELICIOUS! Way more than enough for a tiny girl and a gluttonous friend. . . Service was questionable - there was only one server (she was also the cashier), and she had decided to pass the fine Saturday afternoon giving everyone the stink eye. We asked her for cups of water - response: I was going to do that. You didn't have to ask me /Huff huff huff huff stomp stomp.
