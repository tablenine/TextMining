Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
an order from Duck Walk amounts to little more than a bucket of stinking fish sauce with alarmingly short and curly hairs in it.. . Seriously.. . When I worked at the Alley, there was a year-long phase when every single person who ordered Duck Walk to be delivered to any store in the neighborhood would find hairs in their food. Every single time.. . Don't eat here unless you totally hate yourself.
