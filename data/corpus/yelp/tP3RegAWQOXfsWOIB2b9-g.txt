Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
$1.50 fish, $2 shrimp, $1 drink.. . So simple.  So good.  I like how I can create it to my taste.  I went over board and got excited with all the salsas.  I def liked the spicy guac (after the cabbage and cream, of course).. . Happy to see there's a Glendale location now.  HOORAY!
