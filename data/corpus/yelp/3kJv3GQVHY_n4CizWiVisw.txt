4 stars, really people?  Had the lobster/mango egg-roll. It had negligible lobster and was as exciting as a $3 food court egg-roll.  The mushroom, fruit and onion side salad had an earthy unwashed mushroom taste.  Main courses were dramatically over seasoned w/ minimal Asian connection.  It was probably the most black pepper I've ever seen on one dish.  Ambiance ehh big room with tables tightly packed with fancy wrought iron chairs.. . Service/Management....  FYI when charging 70+ bucks a head please change out the silverware with each course.  Its like eating at a Chili's, the staff takes your used cutlery off your appetizer plate and puts it on the table for you to recyclr.  Completely unappealing, almost insulting at the prices.
