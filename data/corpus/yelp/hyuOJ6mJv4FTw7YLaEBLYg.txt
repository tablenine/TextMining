Coming from a Jewish family with a long history in the food business, trust me when I say that I have had my fair share of deli. . . After reading some of the other reviews, I am surprised by some of the dishes that people order -- pastrami on a french roll with provolone?? That's truly Annie Hall w.a.s.p status.... . Nevertheless, after trying deli from New York to Chicago to San Francisco to LA, for me Canter's has and should continue to reign supreme.  . . The food is awesome -- go for a hot pastrami on rye bread with mustard.  That's all it needs.  Or switch out pastrami for corned beef or tongue. . . The pickles are amazing.  the sides are great.. . The bagels are the best in America, no joke, and their selection of smoked fish is excellent.. . I love their kishka as well.  It's something you can't find everywhere, and although I don't exactly know what it is made out of (and frankly I want to keep it that way), it sort of is like a smooth and bready sausage type of thing.  . . Finally, the baked goods are all great, especially the hamentachen and rugalach, and i have fond memories of them giving me free sprinkle cookies as a little kid.. . The location is cool and funky, right on Fairfax, and parking isn't a problem.  . . Forget Jerry's or even Carnegie's, Canter's is where it's at.
