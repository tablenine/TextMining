Now this is a place that was worth the price - good, quality food and attentive, helpful service.  They had a nice selection of wines and a variety of appetizers, and everyone seemed satisfied with their dishes - pastas, monkfish, steak frites, etc.  Dessert was equally impressive - ricotta fritters and chocolate pavlova (mmmm).  If only we had room for the cheese cart (next time).  . . The place had a great ambiance, too: low-lit, (did anyone else notice those beautiful flower arrangements?), buzzing with activity but not chaotic, and on that balmy evening, the patio was just perfect.  I thought maybe our waiter was a tad pushy, insisting we order his favorite dishes, but his choices were good nonetheless.  No wonder it's so hard to get a table...
