pretty mother effin good.. . THE ORDER:. . ASSORTED PICKLES....2.5 stars....while not amazing, there were a couple highlights: the shiitake mushrooms (heaven).....ok just one highlight. The other pickles were just whatever.. UMAMI Burger.....4 stars....great meat, beautifully crafted, and such a twist from normalcy. The parmesan crisp was weird, but delightful....the juices flowing were gorgeous and greasy. The only thing I didn't like was the shiitake....dunno why, bc I love mushrooms, but maybe there was just a bit TOO much going on? Â .... The BUN!!! The bun is the bomb!! I didnt really notice how much I loved the dense, soft, chewy bun until half-way through....Mmmmm.. ONION RINGS...3 stars....nice THICK cuts of onion, which was nice....but I'm not a huge tempura fan...... THICK CUT FRIES....4 stars...i love thick fries. Mmmm.. SWEET POTATO FRIES.....3.5 stars....yummy, but I've had better. MINT CHIP ICE CREAM SANDWICH....4.5 stars....the freaking cookies were to DIE for....well, since they r from Milk, you know they're good!!!!. . THE SERVICE:. GREAT!!. . OVERALL....... I dont like the location.....but hell, the food is LEGIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, and the size of the burger is PERFECTION.. . I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ALL YELPERS!!. . enjoy!!. xo-. andrea
