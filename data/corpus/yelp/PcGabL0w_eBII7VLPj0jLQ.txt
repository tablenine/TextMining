I don't eat meat so thankfully they have vegetarian options, which are great but its all about the friessssss. Get them with trouffle oil and you wont even need dipping sauce (but i like the pesto mayo and chipotle). Also, the beer is delicious. With the selection they have it would be a shame to order your pbr.
