it's a fun joint since it was good-crowded and the service was still attentive.  we went here after a show and put our name down before the show.  it didn't matter since when we came back there were two empty tables by the window and they served us directly there.. . my skirt steak was good.  my wife's salad was decent.  i loved the little fajita chicken on a crunchy chip thing the best.  it was an appetizer dish.  i won't go again unless a big group insists on it.  there's better bang for your buck elsewhere in this hood.
