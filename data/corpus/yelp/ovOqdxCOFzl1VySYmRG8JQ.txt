I went around 9 on a Thursday. There was lots of street parking available and no line at the place. I got the red velvet cupcake poppers and the banana split.. . The cupcake poppers were worth every cent but the banana split wasn't worth $6.50--if it were cheaper then maybe I'd give it the full five stars.
