this review is strictly based on non-pho items. i haven't tried the pho yet, this place doesn't strike me as having authentic pho, but i will certainly try it when the cold weather kicks in.  so far as my US travels have taken me, Seattle has by far THE best pho i've had to date.  anyway...i do like to come here for their vermicelli dishes. they are tasty, although  the last time i ate there, the noodles seemed slightly overcooked, almost on the mushy side. but the lemongrass steak is very flavorful and the shrimp doesn't taste fishy, so i guess that means it's fresh enough. the service is well, ya know, not the best. but waiting ten minutes for a server is made up by the fact that your food comes out like 10 seconds later, before your tea comes. i like the minimal setting. and i especially like the lights, very unique! like previous reviewers have said it's a cash only place, or go next door to the liquor store ATM.
