I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars. I see why it's a popular place, but I also see why it's not.. We ordered:. 1) Oinkster Pastrami. 2) BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. 3) Piggy Fries. 4) Ube Shake. This all came out to be about $27.. Out of all these items, I would say that only the Oinkster Pastrami Sandwich was worth getting. I think that the pastrami here is better than at The Hat.. I would NOT recommend the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich of the Piggy Fries. The BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich tastes the same at other places and Oinkster is known for Pastrami, so I'd just get that. The Piggy Fries had too much 1000 Island Dressing and the Grilled Onions were soggy. Regular Belgian Fries and the homemade ketchup would have tasted better. An alternative for us would have been the Chili Fries.. . So, I'd suggest ordering the Oinkster Pastrami Sandwich (sharable if you don't eat a lot) and regular Belgian Fries. Don't forget to get the homemade ketchup and maybe some garlic aioli sauce ($0.50). If you like taro, I'd also suggest getting the Ube Shake ($4.50)--I liked it, but it was kinda thick.. . Parking wasn't too bad and service was alright. It's a place where you get a number after you order, then your food is served to you. If you need ketchup or utensils or something, you must grab them yourself. But don't expect anyone to check up on you.. . I was really hungry and was expecting something spectacular but I guess I was sort of disappointed. Oh well, worth trying once.
