This is one of my favorite places to go when I want to eat alone.  Service is nice but not at all intrusive, and the food is delicious when you're in the mood for straightforward fare.  I usually get the turkey ranch wrap with fries, although their breakfast food is also quite good.  If I ever came here with other people, I would probably try the hummus plate, as it looks amazing and, I've heard, tastes great, too.  At any rate, the Pick Me Up is definitely my bag--comfy, tasty, and close by.
