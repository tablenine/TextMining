The first time I went here after moving to Chicago, I was unimpressed. Maybe it was b/c it Friday night before a Bears home game.  Everyone from Philly was there eating and the service kinda sucked.  One memorable moment from that night included this back and forth with my wife- Me:  It looks like that girls is having dinner with her grandfather - Liz: Grandfather's don't touch their granddaughter's like that.  Welcome to the Viagra Triangle!!. Second time we went was with a friend in town from SF.  This time was on a weekday and was impressed.  The food, drinks, and service all were excellent.
