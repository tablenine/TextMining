Came here on a trip to Chicago at the rec of a few people.  We had a reservation, but still had to wait about 20 mins, but no big deal!  The decor is still trapped in the late 80s.  While we enjoyed the meal thoroughly, it wasn't all I would expect for being in the heart of meat country USA.  I ordered my steak medium to medium well, and it came out medium to medium rare- while it was still delicious, the server never even came back to ask how things were.  For sides we got broccoli and a baked potato (my boyfriend's choice).  The baked potato was just an overpriced baked potato, but I loved the broccoli.  The martinis here are STRONG.  I had two and during a large meal and I felt really good!  Haha.
