Not a place to come sober, but drunk, you'll be here in a flash -- if you're not getting Piece. I've gotten the burrito and tacos which were pretty good, and cheap. It's what you'd expect: they have a huge menu, and between the crazy mural on the wall to the Spanish-pop playing on the flat screens, there's plenty reason to come here on any drunken brigade.
