Restaurant: Birds Rotisserie Chicken Cafe &amp; Bar
Category: American (New)
I love it at Birds- it's got a great atmosphere! The crowd (and there almost always is one) is in their mid20s-late30s (which is just right by me- noone really young to annoy me &amp; noone really old to creep me out ;) The clothes on the crowd is a good medium for me too- not too fancy or too lax. The drinks are are about average priced &amp; on weeknights they have a half-price latenight happy hour. The bartenders (Laurie &amp; Robert) are always nice to me &amp; my friends if they're around. I mostly just go here to get a buzz going before shows at UCB. That said I'm here on any given night &amp; it's usually very random- sometimes empty- sometimes packed. As far as food goes it's been pretty tasty but like I said I usually opt for the liquor. If that's your plan then just be aware the bar area is small in relation to the entire building (say 25%) so there's only so many places to sit. But you can sit at the tables &amp; order a drink on the side or sit at the bar &amp; get food so I guess that evens out. There's also a nice patio. Only issue I've had as far as where to sit down or even stand without touching someone has been Saturdays it's been very crowded. Whether or not this is because Birds is gaining in popularity overall (having been coming here for about 16 months I'd say yes :) or simply because of the 2 recent addition hot-chick bartenders I dunno-lol! But despite being busy they get to you in enough time with a fairly-sincere smile so I can't complain. I can say the music (again esp. on Sat.s lately) is a bit too loud which kind of creates that nightclub problem of having to scream into the ear of whoever you're talking to. The music (a CD) is also pretty eclectic &amp; ranges from The Beatles to Sir Mix-a-lot. But it's all stuff everyone can sing along to so that's a plus!
