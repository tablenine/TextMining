YES!. . If you go on the weekends, expect to wait about 10 years to get a table. It's cash only and it is reminiscent of a hobbits house. . . With all that aside, I love, love, love the pizza. Everything about it is fresh and it is all made from scratch. I also really like the flatbread appetizer mostly for the spices they put on the top. When you get your pizza ask for the shaker that has those spices in it (so good.) The salad dressings are homemade and are available for purchase. One is sweet and the other is creamy. They work perfectly together so don't forget to mix them for a perfect blend of creamy sweetness.
