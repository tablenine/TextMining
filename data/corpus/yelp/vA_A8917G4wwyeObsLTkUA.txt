Kogi! I kept hearing about the Kogi truck and long behold, instead of me going to find it it found ME! How awesome right??????. . First time I tried it I was so drunk that I only had a bite and didn't want anymore food.. Second time I had just eaten and didn't want to eat anymore. hahaa. . Third time I had it at the 4100 bar and it was good! I finally got to enjoy the darn thing!. . I had a bite of my friends burrito and that was yummy. I think he got the pork?. . Short rib taco was ok but my faves are the spicy pork and spicy chicken. I think those two are awesome!!!!! Get some radishes too to add some crunchy texture. MMmmMMm.. . Kimchee quesadilla? Is someone messing with me? Who knew right? I think my mom will fall off a chair if I told her about this concoction. Interesting thing though is that it's well........ interesting. hahaha. I can't have more than 1 piece since it leaves a confused feeling in my brain and mouth. I like the one piece though! Just not more than that. Kimchee, tortilla, cheese, and korean spicy sauce? Interesting.... . . You must definitely try it though! Don't forget. Spicy pork taco, spicy chicken taco, radishes, a coke, and share the quesadilla with a group of your friends. :)
