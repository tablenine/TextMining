Update-I have not been to West Egg in awhile, and sort of forgot about it.  I had never tried breakfast, anyway so I ordered a white mocha and a bacon, egg, and cheeze biscuit.  Excellent-the biscuit was wonderful, the bacon was real good, and the biscuit was one of the best I have had.  I loved the white mocha and can't wait to try one of the other coffee drinks.  I also bought a red velvet cupcake, but have not eaten it yet.  It was real crowded, but I received my order in less than 10 minutes!!  I love you West Egg!
