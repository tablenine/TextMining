I ended up at reza's for a sunday brunch sort of by accident. Now I have nothing against mediterranean food, but the brunch buffet which ran $20 was simply way overpriced. You can't charge that kind of money for a self service buffet that includes (admittedly not bad tasting) but very standard food. Reza's needs to get over itself and lower the prices. I feel like they have high prices to maintain a high class image, but come on.... I have no problem paying $100 for a meal if it blows my mind, but I do have a problem with a $20 meal that should cost $10. Sorry Reza's, thumbs down from me. . . I should add though, that the waitstaff was very nice and friendly. Good service, good place, just...lower your prices to a more appropriate level. Thanks!
