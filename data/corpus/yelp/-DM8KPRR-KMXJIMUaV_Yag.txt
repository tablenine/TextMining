I love Bocado. I love the location, and I love the food, but the service is terrible. This past Saturday, with an 8:30 res, we weren't seated until 9 and didn't get out of there until 11. . . They ran out of 1 of the 3 advertised cocktails, and ran out of lobster rolls. . . Our food was good, but it's disappointing to come in looking to try something and only get turned away. . . The bartender was awesome though, and he made me a different cocktail with tequila that was actually really good.
