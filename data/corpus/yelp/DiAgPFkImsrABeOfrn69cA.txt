Oh wow. Well where to begin?. I have been eating at this place since I was a little girl and still NOT tired of it. Although I doubt it'll happen anytime soon. I have lots of favs at Porto's so I wont even begin that list only cause it wil be soooo long that my review itself will take up the whole firs page of reviews for this place. All I'm saying is, no matter how some people say "ITS HYPED" or "PARKING IS HORRIBLE" or " IT TASTES OKAY" if you've been to this place since it first opened and still go and like it just as much, then you're a true fan. I know I am.
