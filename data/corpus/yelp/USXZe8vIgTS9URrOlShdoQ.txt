Do not visit or live in ATL without going to the vortex.  During the holiday season I thought of no better place to take my girlfriend then a place where you have to walk through a skull to get inside.  Oh, but what a place!  Make sure that everyone whith you is 18+ or else they are waiting in the car.  But the crazy decor matches up well with the creations on the menu.  We had the Laughing Skull Beer that went perfectly with the Fried Pickles.  I have fried pickles else and they were nothing compared to the spears they serve at the Vortex.  We then split one of the eyebrown raising burgers, The Double Bypass.  This burger was on Man vs. Food and is a 1/2 pound burger with 3 fried eggs, 6 strips of bacon and 3 pieces of cheese searved between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches.  We had to spilt it, but it was out of this world.  I don't think that I could find a better tasting burger anywhere.  Worth a trip out to little 5 points to spend some quality eating time!
