I love their veggie panini. It melds goat cheese with steamed asparagus in a totally interesting way. Their veggie burger is great too. It incorporates sunflower seeds, which gives it an interesting bite. And their vegan wrap, especially if you get it with curried tofu, is truly amazing. Plus, they know what they're doing with espresso. Parking is a pain though. They'd rate 5 solid stars if their valet parking was more reliable.
