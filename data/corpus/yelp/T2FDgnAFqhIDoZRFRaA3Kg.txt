Been to quite a few steak houses and Maestro's is my favorite!  I always sit in the bar area, on the second floor.  There is a very talented man that plays a variety of instruments and sings.  The pomegranit martinis are great. . .  I always order a medium rare petit filet, wasabi salad, garlic sauteed spinach, Maestros mashed potatos and  mac and cheese.  We top it off with the chocolate cake, the whipped cream is made fresh and is delicious.  I also enjoy the scallop appetizer and bread basket.  I know I sound like a pig, but my husband or friends are with me.  We always take home left overs, because of the portion size.. . Maestro's is a bit pricey, but well worth the price.
