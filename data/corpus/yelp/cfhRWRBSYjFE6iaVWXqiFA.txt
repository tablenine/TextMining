Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Fried Chicken + Waffles + Syrup = A party in my stomach and you're invited.. I think.. . Chicken is not too greasy and the waffle syrup is scrumptious.  Definitely a must go to if you are taking a trip down south.  Don't be tempted to order anything else off the menu, the restaurant is called "House of Chicken &amp; Waffles" so stick to the staples and your stomach too will be partying like mine.. . P.S.  They really must expand and open up a location in the bay area
