Category: Thai
hands down, some of the best thai food in chicago.  the cashew chicken is effing amazing.  the staff is quite friendly, and the prices (wow) are nothing to shake a stick at.  this is an amazing place to meet up with friends for dinner.  joy's is a delightful, addictive little byob establishment, so get your rear up to boystown.
