It's okay - nothing life-altering.  . The food is not bad... not really Mexican but not bad.  I mostly order their chilaquiles and their pico de gallo is pretty tasty.  Not a fan of their beans though -  they taste too much of cumin (eew). The biggest annoyance is the long wait for seating for brunch- it's not that serious, really.  Plenty of times I've turned around and gone somewhere else because it's way too early in the day to have to put up with that.  The decor is nice and I love that they serve Intelligentsia coffee (*drool*) - have never had a bad experience with the service and last but not least - small.  You can hear everyone's conversation in that place... kinda funny and annoying at the same time... so be careful when you push you chair out.  . So yeah... it's ok...
