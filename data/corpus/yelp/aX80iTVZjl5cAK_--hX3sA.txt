This is my favorite restaurant in NYC by farrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! I have been going to Gobo for the past 3 years and I am never disappointed with the food, however, sometimes the service is HELLLLA slow and/or they forget to give you their awesome bread and sweet potato spread concoction. They serve sooo many types of beverages like freshly juiced veggies and fruits, iced teas, bubble teas, wheat grass shots, you name it, its delicious! My sister, who is vegan, and I always have our little sister moments in this place. It has tight seating like most NYC restaurants, with very dim lighting, but maybe you'll get lucky and get a circle table in the corner. I recommend making a reservation (they are usually packed everyday of the week). Every single time we go my sis orders a bubble tea and the pineapple fried rice with soy protein. I always order something different but I've never been disappointed. We always get a shit load of appetizers, since we can't just pick one. I highly recommend the crispy spinach and soy cheese won-tons, the five spice tofu rolls with mango puree, and the VIETNAMESE SPRING ROLLS with spicy honey dip!!! Holy hell, they are the best damn vegetables I've ever had the pleasure of consuming!!!! And after all of this we still pull off sharing a dessert. Get this, you leave full, but not in a gross "I just ate 20 lbs of food, I think I'm going to have a food baby" way but like your body is thanking you for all the nourishment and you're left feeling happy and guilt-free. ITS CRAZZZZY! So go there and be blown away by vegetarian cuisine at its finest! Sure, I always go there and of course want meat just because I cant have it, but I get over it and by the time it's all over Â I'm kind of considering becoming vegetarian. Its opened my mind and taste buds to an entire new world of food :)
