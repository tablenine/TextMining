Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
I had the pleasure of eating at Parker on Ponce about a month ago.  I was looking for some outdoor dinning on a lovely spring day.  It was the around 2 o'clock on a Wednesday so the place was pretty empty.  There were a few people out and the patio and that's where we sat.  My eating companion ordered a lemonade which came in a mason jar with a glass of ice along side it.  It was too sour for him but I loved it, you can tell it was made by freshly squeezed lemons.  The lunch menu had quite a few items, but I decided on the mix and match sliders and the mashed sweet potatoes on the side.  I had a pulled pork slider, a crab cake slider and the prime rib slider.  They were all good, but the prime rib was by far my favorite!  The sweet potato was delicious but a tad bit too sweet for me, it almost tasted like a dessert, but we ate it all none the less.  My companion had the mix and match sliders also, he had the salmon slider which was fresh, delicate and delicious.  I overall enjoyed the dining experience and the waiter was great.  The wait wasn't too long.  I would definitely return to Parker and try some of the other items on the menu.
