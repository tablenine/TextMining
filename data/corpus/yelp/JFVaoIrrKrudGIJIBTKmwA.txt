The setting of this restaurant is exquisite.  I loved the ambience and the waiters were very knowledgable and helpful.  I had the smoked salkmon manicotti special.  My friend and I shared the aggplant appitizer for a start and it was DELICIOUS.  The only reasons I did not give this four stars was the the Tirimisu (someone else said it was the best they ever had) was dissappointing...too thick instead of light ant airy.  Also, the wine is served in little tumblers, like child juice glasses.  I am sure htis is to be different but I like my wine in a wine glass thank you very much.  Other thatn that a WONDERFUL experience.
