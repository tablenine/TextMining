The toffee coffee ice cream sandwich is hands down, one of the best creations everrr!! It's my personal favorite being that I'm a huge fan of macaroons. It consists of two macaroons with toffee coffee ice cream in the middle.. my two most favorite sweets in the whole world. The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's far from me. On the other hand, the ice creams are really rich and yummy. I guess that's all I'm qualified to say since I always get the same things anyways. Will def try something different next time.
