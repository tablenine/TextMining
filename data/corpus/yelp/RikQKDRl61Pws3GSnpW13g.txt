It was a first date done twice.  The first time, my date decided to self medicate with migraine meds, got sick and we had to leave before eating.  My stomach almost ate itself on the way home.. . The second time, she brought her B game, i.e. no vomiting.  We decided to go outside the box with a 5 course tasting menu.  I brought a bottle of wine that was way too sweet for the food.  But I digress - here's what we had:. . 1. Steak Tartare (Good). 2. Sweet Pea Ravioli (Great). 3. Some fish (Pass). 4. Ox Tail Ragout (Pass). 5. Quail (Great). 6. Caramel Profiteroles (on the house, amazing). . I can't remember the rest.  Just based on this one occasion, I thought that the dishes that didn't try too hard were the best, namely 1, 2 and 5.  We didn't finish 4 and the fish was underwhelming.  Anyways, we ended up dropping a clean hundo per person which I thought was a little over priced but would probably go back and get the sweet pea ravioli, which was simple, fresh and delicious.. . The restaurant can get loud and we had some trouble talking to each other.  The staff was great, very helpful and attentive with the exception of the hostess (the second time around, the first one we had was nice) who seemed vacant, aloof and didn't wish my date a "happy 'do-over' birthday" like I had asked her to over the phone, though not a big deal.  She was the exotic looking one in case you were wondering.. . Bottom line is that if you want bang-for-the-buck, I would suggest going somewhere else, but to try something new and fraiche I would try this place at least once (or twice, in my case).
