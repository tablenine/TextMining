I love GARLIC! This place is something I would recommend to eat at! Since it was my first time I wanted to try the more traditional dishes they served. The waiter was very accomodating and suggested several plates off the appetizer and main course section.. . The pot of roasted garlic was good. Only eat this if you like garlic. Its slow roasted garlic in olive oil. They are whole cloves that you spoon and spread over the bread like butter. You can taste garlic in every bite. I got the pesto fettucine but with angel hair instead. This was a light and refreshing dish. The portion was just right for me. A good vegetarian dish but can add chicken upon request. I would recommend getting the chicken dish because it was more flavorful and juicy. Â The mash potatoes is soooooo good =). . The garlic ice cream was the last course. You can definately taste the garlic but had a nice sweet aftertaste! Very different and very COOL!!! . Yay for garlic!
