Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
This has got to be one of my new favorite restaurants in Los Angeles! I was taken there for my birthday and we had such a great time. The service was spot-on and the ambience was lively and energetic. The food here is outstanding: we started with the squash blossoms and bone marrow. The bone marrow was very interesting - maybe a little too decadent, but it was worth trying alteast once in my life. We shared the egg, guanciale, radicchio, escarole &amp; bagna cauda pizza and I can honestly say it was filled with most interesting flavors I have ever enjoyed in a pizza. I will definately be back for more.
