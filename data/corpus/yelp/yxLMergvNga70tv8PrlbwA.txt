Yes, it's trendy. Yes, it's bordering on the pricey side for small burgers. But the fact that I've been there more than once and that I remember what I ordered is a testament that this place is above average in my book. . . The nutella milkshake is good and very share-worthy. . The fried pickles are interesting, but should be eaten before they get cold. Then they are just cold and greasy.. The fries always look good. And I like fries. . The onion rings are tasty! Battered pretty well. And yay for dipping sauces.. The faux-lafel...ehhh. I think it lacks flavor and spices. You guys at flip hear me? You can do better than this! I can make a better falafel burger by slicing falafel balls from a no-name shack in New York. . The turkey burger was good! Flavorful and juicy. . . It's hit or miss, but I'd give it another shot.
