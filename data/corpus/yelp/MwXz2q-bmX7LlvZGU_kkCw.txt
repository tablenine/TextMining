I am Italian; my entire family is Italian; and as such many family events I attended growing up involved Italian cold cuts from the "Italian store," which we used to make our own sandwiches on delicious Italian bread. I wanted my sub from Bari Foods to taste exactly like THAT, and it did. Favoloso!. . The rest of the store is cool, too. Lots of interesting stuff to browse through!
