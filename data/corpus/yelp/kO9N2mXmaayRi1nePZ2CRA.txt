Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Umami is one of the five basic tastes sensed by specialized receptor cells present on the human tongue. Umami is a loanword from Japanese meaning roughly "tasty", although "brothy", "meaty", or "savory" (Wiki). . This is the fourth time I've been to Umami and I still love it.  There are a few kinks that they haven't ironed out yet, so here i go.... . 1.  They've stopped making my favorite burger - CHILI Burger! Come on!. . 2.  Umami allows BYOB - BRILLIANT!  . . 3.  Kind greasy on the fried stuff.  Not straining enough or something, cause our eggplant fries AND tempura onion rings were way too greasy.  . Good concept but way too much oil.  NO FLAVOR IN THE KETCHUP???. . 4.  Had the Lamb Burger and it was so delicious! It came with a spicy honey yogurt sauce that was beautiful.  . . 5.  The meat is amazing here.  That I do give them that.  Very umami.. . 6.  They should give comment cards with the checks, so they can get feedback about favorite burgers, etc.  . . Our waiter seemed a bit lost.  Another waiter started serving us and gave us our check.  Not knowing we paid already our original waiter asked if we wanted dessert.  Since we declined he said he'll give us our check.  Twice? Funny actually.  . . I heart this place very much but it needs a woman't touch or something to smooth out the rough edges.  . . Music is great but the speakers suck and sucky speaker with hard surfaces don't sound so great.  . . Parking isn't that great and people park like assholes here.  Oblivious to others and not considerate about the way they park.  I see valet happening here pretty soon...
