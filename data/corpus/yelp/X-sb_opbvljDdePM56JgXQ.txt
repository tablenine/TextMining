The upstairs reminds me of my old beat up high school. Crappy graffiti everywhere, lunch tables, separate rooms that resemble and smell like classrooms. . . The downstairs looks like a cleaned up Honky Tonk. Big long community tables &amp; sawdust on the floors. . . The food is cheap. I'll give them that. I also heart the spicy mustard....A LOT! The think i dont get is why they dip the sandwiches for you. The whole idea of the French Dip is to dip your own sandwich yourself! . . Now, I know the history of the place, and how the guy accidently dropped the bread into the au jus, and that became the birth of an era, but I want to dip my own sandwich, damnit!!! None of this single dip, double dip or triple dip crap, I want to dip it at my leisure. Maybe I want to just drop the whole thing in the juice and wait for it to all solidify... ok that's gross, but if I wanted to do that, I would like to at least have the option. The cole slaw was pretty good and the potato salad was almost mecca. . . I like the deli style counter with the long lines. It was worth it taste-wise. I still want to dip my own damn sandwich, though.
