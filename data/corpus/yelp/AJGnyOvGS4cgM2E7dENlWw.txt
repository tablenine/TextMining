I'm kind of split on C &amp; M. . . Liked: . 1. The interior. Small, dark, and cozy. Good for a date.. 2. BYOB. Can't beat it.. 3. Bacon-wrapped dates. Very good and I'd go back for these alone.. 4. Socca cakes with honey and goat cheese on top.. . So-So:. 1. Olives. I guess they're olives and not much more to say about it.. 2. Service: Our server didn't stop by too often and our water wasn't refilled enough.. . Bad:. 1. The lentil plate: Ours was crunchy and almost burnt. . . Next time I go, I'll bring a bottle of wine, order the socca cakes and bacon-wrapped dates and that's it...
