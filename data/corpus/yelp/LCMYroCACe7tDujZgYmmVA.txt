I still cannot believe that my bf and I finished a 5 lbs lobster together, also a side of fried rice.  We were stuffed, and both of us left the restaurant with a huge smile and big belly.  (Check out the picture I post here!). . When I was planning our small trip to LA, I told my bf that there's one restaurant that I must go, so the first day when we arrived, we went straight to Newport Seafood Restaurant for our first lunch meal.   As usual I ordered the house special lobster, and I asked them to pick a smaller female lobster with eggs....we were both stunned when the waiter placed the lobster on our table, but quickly, we finished the whole lobster!!   I think the people next to us were shocked how fast we finished the whole thing on our own.  The lobster itself was about $80...we both couldn't believe how cheap our bill was.  I didn't like the fried rice, but we need some rice to eat with the lobster.  The lobster is chopped, fried in crisp, and quickly stir-fried with black bean sauce, sugar, salt, soy sauce, spices, chili peppers, green onions, gingers, &amp; garlics.  Sounds easy?  Not really, I still can't find any restaurants up in the Bay Area can cook as good as Newport Seafood Restaurant.  Bring enough $$, because it's cash only, and the nearby ATM is about a block away.
