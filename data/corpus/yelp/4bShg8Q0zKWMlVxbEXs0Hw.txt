Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This place is such a b**** to find. First of all, Onizuka is a tiny-ass cul-de-sac street that goes by 2 names (the other I forget), and even when we did find it, Orochon was nowhere to be found. We circled the same three blocks 4 times, entered Skid Row, called for directions, and asked some bystander on the street for help before finally finding the place. Might be enough to make some people give up and go home, but not me! . . Orochon actually is on Onizuka but you have to enter Weller Plaza and go to the 3rd floor to find it. These directions didn't really help us though since we had no idea what Weller Plaza was, so just wander up and down Onizuka. You should find it eventually. . . I wasn't brave enough to try the #2 challenge, but shared the Level 3 Miso Ramen bowl. Their ramen is legit. It's as legit as Daikokuya but good for when you want something spicy, and mmMMM I love me some spicy! And their portions are ginormous so you'll probably be able to take some home although you might not want to take home leftover ramen. . . I will move on to Level 2 next time and work my way up to the #2 Challenge!
