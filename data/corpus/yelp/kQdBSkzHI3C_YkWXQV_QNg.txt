First off, I give this place 4 stars, for the first visit.... To experience it once should be more than enough.... A would give the second visit 3 stars.. We dined in the center garden... it was nice and calm... The food was good.  It did not blow my mind, but nothing was disappointing. . The service was poor. but when we asked  Management why... we found out she was new, and everything was cranked up to # ten.  Some times you need to ask. . . It is a great special night out... something different and out of the hustle and bustle... it almost has a kitsch feel to it. Which I enjoy. . . If you are going for a gourmet moment, this is not the place.... if you want a historic site in the city, with views of the millions of lights... go here.... Finish off with some necking on Mulholland drive  ...
