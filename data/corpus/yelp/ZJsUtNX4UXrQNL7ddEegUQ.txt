Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
everyone knows tito's is good. i lived in culver city for a year and avoided it during that time solely because i didn't think it could live up to the hype, and didn't want to feel the crushing disappointment. so years later, i FINALLY gathered the strength to go get some tacos at tito's. it was like finding an old friend, and i had years of lost time to make up for.. . i never wanted to have sex with a corn tortilla more than after eating tito's tacos. super greasy, super good. i think what i'm trying to say is that if there is a heaven, this would be considered its health food.
