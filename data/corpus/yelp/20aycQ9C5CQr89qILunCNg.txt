We had a table in the back and it was great. Private and enough space for all of us to feel comfortable. The food was seasonal and delicious and the wine, beer, cocktail list was great. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful. We were a group of eight and the waiter (Ryan?) made us feel like we were the only ones in the packed restaurant.
