Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Asian Fusion
i wish i could give zero stars.. . if you are wondering why joy yee's noodle shop has decent reviews, it's because it is located on a college campus. no offense- i was a drunk/hungover/low-food-standard-having college kid once upon a time too.. . trust me - this food is NOT good. beyond greasy, no flavor, generally disgusting. you could find far better chinese in a shopping mall food court. seriously.
