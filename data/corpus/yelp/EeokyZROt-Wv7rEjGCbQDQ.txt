This place is great for Sunday Brunch.  Love the maccaroni and cheese, it is to die for.  They also have excellent bloody mary's, and a perfect dark environment, especially if you are nursing that weekend hangover.  It is a Chicago Cub favorite hangout.  I have spotted a couple players myself, Kerry Wood to name a few.!!  Definitely a fun place to go.
