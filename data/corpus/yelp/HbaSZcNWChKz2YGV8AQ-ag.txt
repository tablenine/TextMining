wow, some people really hate this place!  as far as im concerned, rusans is great for a quick, cheap meal.  ive eaten at this one more times than i can count and have always enjoyed my food (usually an assortment of veggie and dollar maki) and drink (usually a plum blossom=plum wine+saki).  . . i guess if you are like a sushi connoisseur rusans might not live up to your standards, but if thats your situation you probably already know this, right?
