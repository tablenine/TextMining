Ok first let me tell you, do not even bother paying the extra 3 dollars for the "fresh" crawfish. I ordered 15lbs last week for a get together, and we're all from the south, so needless to say we were so excited to finally find somewhere that had crawfish!! so I immediately got a couple friends together and planned this night. Well, we get the crawfish and dump 'em on the table. First off, just by looking at the we could already tell they weren't true "louisiana" style crawfish, the were extremely oily, and 98% of them were dark (meaning they'd already been dead before cooking) which makes them extremely hard to peel, and very little meat, and OBVIOUSLY had been frozen!!!!!! LAME. I felt extremely jipped. Anyways just warning you dont bother paying 7.99 for fresh cause they're NOT!!! . They arent bad, just NOTHING like the Louisiana crawfish they claim to be.
