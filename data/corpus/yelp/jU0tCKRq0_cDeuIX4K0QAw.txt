Boring!  Food worst than anything dropped out of the sky.  I went there as part of a b day deal.  All the magicians did the same trick!  What the hell?  Place smelled funny, expensive food, and lame entertainment.  They do invites because the house is a fire hazard.  Not a good idea here.  . Nothing personal, everyone needs this sort of experience once in their life.. BlaH!
