There's something kind of great about being the only two brown dudes in an Asian restaurant.  Although we definitely got some "are you lost, the 10 is only a few blocks down" stares from many, we definitely felt like ballers eating here.. . The service was exactly what it needed to be.  We even ordered before we sat down in order to expedite the process.  I have to mention, though, it was funny being the only ones offered forks.. . In terms of the food, my favorites were the fried tofu and the French cube beef.  Couple that with some Fischer Beer and you'll be in heaven.. . ...you'll also pass out for about 45 minutes because of how full you are (and the servers may poke fun at you).. . Definitely the sign of a good meal.  I will be back for sure.
