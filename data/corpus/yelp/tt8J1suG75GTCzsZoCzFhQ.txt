Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Holy moley, this place is just as good as the Madison location but BETTER!  Sit down, chomp down on an Isaac A. sandwich, drink a Unibroue La Fin Du Monde beer (It means "The end of the world" - badass and tasty), and watch Wicker Park become more yuppie with every bite.  Take the good with the bad.
