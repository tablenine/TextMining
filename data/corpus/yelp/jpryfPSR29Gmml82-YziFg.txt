What not to like about this place? bartenders are cool, the food is good, and the martini list is very very interesting.. . such a cozy place to hang out. I'm never for a lounge, because I dance all the time (even when I'm working inside of the bar!), but I can totally chill here. They have the industry nights here so good for me :). . Also very classy pool table. I haven't played on it yet but I want to soon!
