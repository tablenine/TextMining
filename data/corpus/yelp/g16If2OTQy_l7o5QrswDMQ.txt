How does this place not have a solid 5?!  Probably the best restaurant I've been to in Chicago as far as the overall dining experience goes.  BYOB, EXCELLENT service, FANTASTIC food.  I've dreamt about this place ever since going.  Truffle fries, brisket, and bread puddings are all stellar.  . . I also had some seafood stew special that is making my mouth water just thinking about it.. . It's pricey, but it's worth every penny.
