Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
I've been to the Alcove hundreds of times and have always enjoyed whatever I've ordered. You do get a lot of food in an order, especially for breakfast, but it is still pretty expensive. It's mostly outdoor seating so if it's really nice out, it's overly crowded. They do have heat lamps when it's cold but there is no roof-like structure to protect you if it's raining. . . I went after work last night with co-workers. We all ordered at roughly the same time, but I got mine like 25 mins after everyone else got theirs! Granted I got mini-burgers but that's still a big difference! They were so good and I was so hungry that I didn't notice until almost half-way through each burger, that one of the burgers still had paper on it! I took it back in and a guy behind the counter apologized and asked if I wanted another burger. I realized that I was decently full and tired that I really didn't want to wait for another one to be made and told him this. So he offered me a desert, which I ended up taking home. I got the banana fudge cheesecake and OMG it is amazing! I'm not even a sweets type of girl!
