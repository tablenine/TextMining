Restaurant: Maison Akira
Category: French
Just went back from the dinner at Maison Akira.This is my first time being there, the place is pretty old, not as pretty as the picture on the website.  Had the food from dine LA menu.  For French-Japanese Cuisine, I had better.... I had: . Smoked Salmon with Asparagus: The salmon was good, to me the sauce is a bit too sour and they also serve you with a big chunk of sour cream. The Asparagus is quite good, juicy and fresh.. . Chilean Seabass with lobster Raviolil:  The miso Chilean Seabass is pretty good, the stuff underneath was not.  The Ravioli was just ok and it is quite dry, the sauce was too plain.. . Apple Tarte with vanilla ice cream: It was pretty good, but I had better.. . My friend had, I had a taste:. Venison Carpaccio: I am glad that it doesn't smell like I would imagine the raw meat would be.. . Chateau Steak: It's very ordinary.. . Mousse Cake with chocolate sauce: The Mousse cake is good, perfect match with the sauce. . . I don't think that I would go back again, for French-Japanese dining in South Pasadena,  I prefer Restaurant Shiro.. . The parking is easy, they have a lot, first hour free, we went a bit over, paid a dollar.
