I had brunch at the new Uncommon Ground on Devon and very much enjoyed my breakfast.  I had the Montana omelet (bacon, potato, scallions, cheddar cheese, sour cream), which was served with crispy potatoes.  I also had the specialty bellini (quince-agave purée, pomegranate juice &amp; sparkling wine).  My dad had the open meatloaf sandwich, which is one of his favorites.  I love that if you order a Treetini (organic ginger infused rain vodka, liquor 43, tart apple syrup and apple cider), they will plant one tree.  I'll definitely be back again soon.
