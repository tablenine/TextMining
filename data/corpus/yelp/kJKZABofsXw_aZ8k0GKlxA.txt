Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Can I say DELICIOUS!!! Love their prime rib and cream of corn ;) Yum yum in my tum tum. Lots of International people come to celebrate birthdays, graduations, anniversary's, and high-level corporate businesses. Â . . If you're visiting California, Lawyr's is one of the places you must stop by just for the experience if not the food.
