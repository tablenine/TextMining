Yeah, I went here to crash a school party thing. It was fun. I had really nice beer for some odd reason that night and they averaged about $9.00 a beer (delerium $10 and this other Belgian that was $8.50) Yum. It wasn't awful and the music didn't piss me off the decor is cute. The party had some food laid out that was tasty I ended up taking like 5 pounds of artichoke dip home because the party wasn't very attended and they wanted to get rid of it. So. I would go here again if I was in the neighborhood!
