Recommend it for lunch and happy hour.   I was there yesterday for lunch and had the appetizer sampler.  It was really good.  But the best was the fish tacos.  I always get them.  I love Mexican food and this place has the mexican flavors with a twist.  . . Their mojitos are excellent and vibe for happy hour is Allegreto!!! Fun atmosphere and some nights they have a band playing background music.  . . This is still my first choice for lunch in downtown.
