Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
We went to Hambuger Mary's for the 4-5th time today, July 15th, which happened to be the hottest day of 2010 so far.  Upon entering, we hot, exhausted, and needed a cold beverage really bad (water - not alcohol).  . . Upon entering, we waited a good 5-minutes at the front door, while several guys wearing "Team Chicago" shirts all stood back by the bar laughing and having a good time.  Upon being "greeted" - we were asked "so just 2", then seated by throwing the menus down on the table and walking off.  . . We waited another good 5-minutes, until we finally ran-down a waiter, whose excuse was "I told so-and-so to come over and take care of you".  He walked away (not offering our drinks - now 10 minutes in with 100+ heat index outside), when finally another guy came over, all he said was "So I guess you guys are ready to order".  (How Friendly!).. . After our drinks were delivered, some friends from work walked in, and sat across the restaurant.  We went over to say hello, and went back when our food was delivered.  We had the fried Brittney Spear Pickles - which were a 5* dish!  The burgers were "Black &amp; Blue - kinda plain" and "Barbra-Q" which was tasty - but VERY messy/hard to eat.  . . The friends that sat across the restaurant, had their food delivered around the same time (came in 15-minutes behind us), and unfortunatley they found - well let's say - unappealing items in one of their salads.  They politiely advised the staff - who apologize - but of course they both got up and left without paying.  . . After all was said and done - one of my favorite burger joints, between the service and lack of cleanliness - now I have to say is somewhere I won't return...
