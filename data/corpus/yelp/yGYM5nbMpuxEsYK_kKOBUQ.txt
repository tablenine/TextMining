Restaurant: Medici On 57th
Category: Bakeries
Shame on me, in my three odd years in Chicago, I had never been to Hyde Park. So when I went to watch a movie at DOC films at U of C, I asked a friend for a recommendation. Apparently the culinary options in the area are meager. So Medici on 57th it is.. . My friend and I sat in the outdoor patio which was pleasant enough. The chairs and tables were more than a little rickety. Our waiter, though friendly, sure took his time! We must have waited 10+ minutes for every step of the dining process: menus (10), orders (10), food (10), bill (10). That's 40 minutes of waiting that ended up making us very late for our movie.. . The food was good though. I had a chicken breast salad with balsamic pesto vinaigrette. The lettuce and vegetables tasted fresh, the chicken was grilled to perfection, and the vinaigrette was to die for. Seriously, where do they get their dressing, because I want that on every salad I have from now on. The extras to salad ratio was good too.. . So: food 4 stars, service just barely 2 stars, and a decent atmosphere bring up the score to a solid 3 stars.
