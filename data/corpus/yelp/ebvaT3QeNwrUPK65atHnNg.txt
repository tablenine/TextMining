I love Bossa Nova! I always get their fish and it is always yummy!  I get the vegatables other than the rice and beans so I can be a bit healthier and they are really good.  The prices here are fabulous.  It's a great place to take a date.  Great prices, great food, and a great ambiance.  . . ***How cute... they have a Roman salad, an Edgar salad, and a Chico salad.  hahaha!
