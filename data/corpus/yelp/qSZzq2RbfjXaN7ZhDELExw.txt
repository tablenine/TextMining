I was brought here one day after hiking...I guess we were feeling healthy.  It's along the strip of downtown Culver City, a cute little place.  The menu is fairly simple, written on a huge blackboard right when you walk in.  I was instantly attracted to the hot plate selection, where you choose a main item ( chose angus flank steak because I'm such a meat eater even when I'm "feeling" healthy) with a side of yukon mashed potatoes and s simple salad (I chose the baby spinach with the cabernet vinaigrette).  It sounded like a great combination of things...You tell your order to a girl and she sends it down the line.  You can see them making your plate in front of you and them grilling the food.  Then I saw some roasted cauliflower and I had to get them because they look so delicious and I'm completely addicted to cauliflower right now.  I also got the mint lemonade.  My meal came out to almost 20 bucks..a hefty price for lunch, but I actually ordered a lot.  It turned out to be a lot of food.  Everything was delicious.  Steak was tender, mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy, and the cauliflower was fantastic.  I love the smokiness it had from the grill..mm!!! the only thing was the salad was a bit dry and I didn't care too much for it.  I started craving this place a week later and realized that they had another location in West Hollywood, so I got some of my coworkers to head out there and I ordered the exact same place again.  Hahah..except this time, instead of a salad, I just had them give me cauliflower...it was the perfect plate!!
