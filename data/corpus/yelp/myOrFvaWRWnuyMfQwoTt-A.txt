Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Prime rib that melts in your mouth and side dishes that make you want to scream out in ecstasy.  Love the ambiance and the drinks are nice and stiff.  Great place for a date or special occasion.  I've been going here for years and have had a great meal every time.  The wait for a table can be long on the weekends, so try to make a reservation if you can.
