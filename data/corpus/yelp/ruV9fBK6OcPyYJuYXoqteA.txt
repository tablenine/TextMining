What a great restaurant for meeting old friends!  My friend took me here because I wanted to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful LA weather and I loved the outside seating area.  We enjoyed mimosas, a steak salad, and a burger with feta cheese.  The burger was nothing to rave about and the steak salad is probably better with a different dressing but I did enjoy my time lounging and eating in this very cool restaurant.
