Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
I've been here a few times, initially based on word of mouth, afterwards on a good first impression and most recently based solely on masochism.. . My very first visit was nearly 2 years back, and the food was quite good.  At the time, I'd have given the restaurant an extra star, docking a point for the snarky decor and cramped quarters.  That virgin venture into Suzanne Goin's ode to New England seafood was quite pleasant, I still remember the "chicken-fried" skate wing I had.    The fish was expertly fried, crisp on the outside and ever so flakey on the inside with a nice, gentle kick of peppery goodness in the breading.. . My 2nd time was with a not-so-special-anymore someone a year ago.  I had the burger, and it was quite good.  The fries were possibly better than the gigantic, bleu cheese covered, over-the-top mound of cow flesh on a bun.  I have a special place in my heart for gourmet burgers, so maybe I'm a bit biased, but I enjoyed my second trip just fine.  My partner that evening had what she described as a tasteless piece of fish, though her vapid opinion holds little weight with me.. . Recently, I went again, and it was a real disappointment.  Service before was attentive to mediocre; this time, it was just downright crap.    The oyster appetizers were bland, but at least they weren't slimey.  I ordered the lobster roll where the lobster portion was over sauced, and the roll dripped oil, resembling a deep dish pizza crust.  . . Inconsistency is my pet peeve with restaurants, but it's hard for me to really fault a place for swinging down over the course of two years.  Some things do remain consistent, however, like the above par mixed drinks.  . . If you're into gawking at attractive people eating attractive, but potentially mediocre food, whilst doing so yourself, then this little hole in the wall would be a perfect night out.
