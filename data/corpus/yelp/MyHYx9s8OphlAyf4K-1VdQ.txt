A great fresh salad place. They know the perfect combination to all their salads but their flatiron steak sandwich is incredible. It's what dreams are made of. I usually get a salad on the side but if you're feeling unhealthy (might as well if you get steak) go with the whipped mashed potatoes. Im not really sure how much butter to potato ratio there is but its insanely good. Â The price is a little high but you're paying for quality and freshness.
