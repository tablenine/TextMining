I love the desserts here.  The fruit tart is always a guaranteed hit at a party, it's decorated so nicely with all the fruit on top and it's just the right amount of sweetness and yummy goodness.  The cheese rolls are so delicious and highly addicitive, I can't have just one which is clearly not good for my thighs or ass but oh so worth it.  This place is always pretty crowded and parking can sometimes be pretty hard to find but once you get a bite of something from their bakery, you won't be disappointed.
