i was really excited to try FO - finally made it out here since i now work nearby.. . honestly, i think the burgers were over-hyped. they were served on a sort of hoagie-type bun, and had blue cheese(?) mixed in with the patty. although i do admit they were rather tasty, i dare say i've had better.... . the selection of drafts was excellent, as were the shoe-string fries, grilled stuffed figs, and soft shell crab.. . definitely a good happy hour/early dinner spot!
