not too bad...i can't really find fault with an irish breakfast combo that includes a pint of guiness. but the hash browns had some weird creamy sauce stuff on them. plus it's a little too 'upscale' for my tastes. good coffee, though. and the bloody marys are about the best i've had in chicago, i love the hunk of salami especially.
