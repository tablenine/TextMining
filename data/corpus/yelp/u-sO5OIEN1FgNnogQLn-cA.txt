"Is 1lb enough? or 2lbs?". "Make it 2, Nance!!". . Yeah, the hungerness got a hold over me..we might have overdid it.. . 60 bucks after taxes and tips for 4 heinekens, 2lbs of crawfish, 1lb of shrimps, 6 orders of the oysters and an order of cajun fries. All that for 2 people, Booyah! . . The crawfish and shrimps came in their own plastic bags, Oysters were served over a full metal trap of crushed ice and the cajun fries were served in a basket. Each pound of crawfish comes with an additional of corn and sausage. And no, you don't get plates, just paper towels to wipe your messy hands and faces. Eat it on the table with your sexy man hands. Forget the crowd, be yourself and start chowing. No, they're not watching you and took any pictures of you. If it is, so what? Being mistaken a prince of brunei ain't so bad... . Parking sure can be a badass, and I guessed that's why everyone just parked wherever they felt like. Every 15 mins in our grubbing, waitress would either ask "Do you drive an avalon?" or "Do you drive a white lexus?" It's cute, but i hate it when i get slowed down by cuteness.. . Oh, the only leftovers we have left are just 8 pieces of the crawfish. We totally just made our mama proud..
