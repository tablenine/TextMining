I LOVE this place. It's a great addition to the growing South Loop restaurant list.  The small pizzas are the best deal and absolutely wonderful.  BUT, you can't pass up some of the freshly made pastas which are also exceptional.  The gnocci is wonderful.  The price is a little high, but worth it! The food is great, the service is great, the atmosphere is great!
