I've been to Nori Nori twice, and I think it's definitely worth trying once. It's not your typical assembly line sushi buffet. It definitely carries more quality. However; I will agree with the other yelper in the fact that in order to feel you got your $30 worth you would have to gorge yourself, and I just don't have the bottomless pit that I once had.
