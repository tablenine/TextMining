Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
De Cero is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.. . Get the taco sampler. All of the tacos are amazing. Softshell Crab, Black Bean, Chicken, Al Pastor, The Breaded Catfish, Ahi Tuna. . I've had the goat cheese tamale. It was good but maybe a little to corn mealy for my taste.. . I've never had any other main dishes besides the Taco Sample platter because I can't believe anything could be better.. . The atmoshphere is cool. Lots of wood. A nicely designed ceiling/light fixtures. The tables a relatively comfortable although it does get a little loud.. . The servers are mildly attentive but they do know about the food. The salsa sampler is good but its ok to skip. . . Their guacamole is delicious but not knock your socks off good.. . Really its all about the tacos. Corn tortillas wrapped in a variety of perfect combinations of spices and flavors.. . The drinks are good. But nothing to write home about (and pretty expensive). They do carry jarritos (mexican flavored sodas) and mix a number of interesting non-alcoholic beverages.. . But just go with a friend. Order the 8 taco sampler. Pick 4 tacos that sound good to you. Enjoy. Repeat as necessary.. . You will not be disappointed.. . P.S.. It can get busy as the area is a popular place to go out and eat. You may want to call ahead so you don't have to delay the inevitable enjoyment.
