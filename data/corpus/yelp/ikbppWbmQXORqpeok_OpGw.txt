Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Just came back from eating at The Boiling Crab. I've tried it a couple of times and yes it is just as yummy as they are hyped up to be (as I am also one of those "hypers"). . . However they lose a star BIG TIME for the LOOOOONG ass wait. The lines are incredibly long (app. 45 min - 1hr 30min). Would I say it was worth the wait. MAYBE... It was drizzling a bit at 35 degrees today... so it was not pleasant.. not at all. . First 10 min... decided to wait in the car with 3 other friends.. chatted a bit.. till it was too darn stuffy. . 20 min... walked around the block.... 30 min... the couple we were with decided to get into an argument.. in which one runs off... 40 min.. we search and find her and wait until they kiss and make up. 50.... deciding that sitting in a car was not a good idea.. grab a seat on the outside benches next to a smelly lady right below the heated lamps.. dont feel much heat. 1 hour we are finally in HEAVEN!!!!. . My boyfriend and I shared a 2 pound bag of shrimp... . seasoning : the whole sha bang! . spice level: XXX . Pain never felt so good. . . To top it off whoever drops by the Boiling Crab MUST MUST order their Cajun Fries. That is a direct order. Hell you didnt wait an hour just to eat some shrimps. Might as well order the entire menu no? So we also get some sausages mixed in with the shrimps, 2 corn on a cob, 1 order of sweet potato fries, couple king crab legs and my boyfriend had to try the gumbo with rice. Tastes... FUNKY!! not my thing... but he is now a fan. . . Everyone should try it out. Some will become hardcore fans. Impatient people stay away!!!!
