This place is pretty much an insult to a kosher style diner.  I guess its been open for 4 years and is known for their deli food in the south loop but for what reason I know not.  . . We were informed they close at 9 so we should order.  They supposedly prepare their own meats and I tried the turkey club sandwich with fries.  he fries were fine, the turkey and bacon were minimal, and it seemed devoid of mayo.  For $15 I would expect more.  . . For a turkey club or breakfast food I think its significantly better at an IHOP.
