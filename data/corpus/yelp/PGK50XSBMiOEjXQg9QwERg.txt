I love this place. It's great for lunch. All the ingredients are super fresh and high quality. The pricing is respectable considering what you are actually getting ($10 ahi tuna sandwich with roasted red peppers and homemade aioli with a huge side salad- you have to be kidding me for this area) The staff is friendly and are willing to explain pretty much anything. I came here the first time during a daze from work and need a little hand holding with menu. They also have a kick ass chicken soup - you can tell a lot of TLC went into it. This is a place where I would go for some healthy comfort food: Soups, salads, sandwiches. . . . Oh and there toffee cupcake is really great too. I would give this place a try if you haven't been here. Parking is kinda dodgy but there is a garage for free around the corner.
