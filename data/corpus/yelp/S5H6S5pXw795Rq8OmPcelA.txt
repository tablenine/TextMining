I went with my family -big seafood fans as a bonvage dinner for my brother who was off tto military duty. We got seated right away on a Saturday around 1pm. No too busy. Got busy right around 3pm. . Ambience: The atmosphere is pleasant to look at but not to listen to! Blaring the same 3 reggaton music videos on all the tvs is not exactly ambiance setting -in fact really gives it a cheap feel. DOnt get me wrong I love reggaeton but seriously can El BArco add more to its collection .. Food: Portions are huge! Ceviche was tasty yum! The dishes included: Camerons al Diabla, Steak and mahi mahi, shrimp enchiladas, and veggies and salmon, veggies and mahi mahi. OVER COOKED -it might as well been microwaved! THE SHRIMP ARE NOT CLEANED! means the veins are left in for you to savor the pooo! illll! mahi mahi was just not good overcooked no seasoning, VEGGIES HAD BROWN SPOTS Â -not all of them but most what the hell?! . Service: Horrible! Is too much to ask for mixed enchiladades (shrimp, chiken, cheese) -their answer "we have to charge you for all three dishes" We got checked on about twice for a 2hour dinner, . . Overall I might reconsider coming here for margaritas and appetizers BUT THATS IT!
