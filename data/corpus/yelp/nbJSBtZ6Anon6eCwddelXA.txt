Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
This place makes the most flavorful fried flower I've eaten. The squash blossoms at Pizzeria Mozza were just plain yummy, like everything else on the menu. . Two appetizers, two pizzas, two deserts and two glasses of wine yeilded a reasonable bill at $65, not including tip. I was super stuffed. Few bits of advice for a successful experience here:. Have a reservation, just park on the street and try not to come during peak dinner hours. 5 to 6 p.m. is what has worked best for me.
