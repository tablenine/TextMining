My wife and I have been hellbent on finding a decent slice of New York pizza here in Chicago; since we originally hail from that northeastern state, we don't look kindly upon what passes for "pizza" here. ;-) Based on some recommendations online, we descended upon Santullo's; while not perfect, it's the closest we've come yet to satisfying us. The cheese and sauce were largely done right; our crust was a bit too thin and soggy. The prices are a tad high -- $3.25 for a slice would be considered a rip-off in New York -- but they don't have much in the way of competition for non-Chicago-style pizza, and they probably know it.
