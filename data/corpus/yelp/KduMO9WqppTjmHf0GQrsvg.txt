it's pretty classy... I love this building.  like, really really love this building.  The stark white washed walls, knoll torledo chairs (I'm a dork for knowing that, but let it slide.), and the little cooler on the left side of the icecream?  yea... I'll be eating dinner here on summer nights...  their ice cream is divine.. . just go for the sake of the building.  it's art deco, the original Richard Tyler show room and it's being saved through adaptive re-use. get out embrace what Los Angeles used to be.
