This place is friggin' great. I must have ignored/driven by it about 10,000 times over five years before ever giving it a shot. I'm sorry I waited so long!. . Tasty Thai (Garee curry...never heard of it prior to this and I'm now a fan) and above-average sushi selection and taste. Quiet, clean, beautifully decorated and suitably priced.. . Amen.
