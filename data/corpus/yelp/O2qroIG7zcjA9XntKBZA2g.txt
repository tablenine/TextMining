Size doesn't matter - well size of the restaurant. In response to everyone else who keeps bringing up the size of the restaurant: There are so many fantastic restaurants throughout Chicago that have a smaller space (see my other reviews of Adesso and Sapori Trattoria). It doesn't make the waiters less friendly, the service less prompt nor does it make the food taste any less delicious. Unless you are looking to book a table of 10 or so, you shouldn't make size one of your overall factors to go to a restaurant, that is, otherwise fantastic. . . I went here with a group of six friends taking advantage of the BYOB without the corkage fee (gotta love that!) and we were able to sit comfortably after a short wait. I also love the tickets they give you so that you can just check mark the sushi you want for the all-you-can eat. . . I only wish they had more specific descriptions of the types of sushi on the ticket. What I also liked about the place is that I didn't feel rushed at all even though they were fairly busy. Sushi was great, came out earlier than we expected and we had a great time.
