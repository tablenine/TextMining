Crazy as usual. Man what happen to the empty chill days with the side room all dinky? Haha still good fun but super hyped &amp; saturated. . Checked In &amp; now at home reviewing?  Man I really hate reviewing places that have so many reviews already haha but what the heck, I'm trying this check in stuff yelp has &amp; seeing how it works in reviewing after.. . So I came here before anyone came, before anyone even knew about this place.  The food is the same quality but the interior and atmosphere has definitely changed.. . Parking: Not horrible, extremely horrible as usual. Theres a lot of whole in the wall restaurants, pubs and company offices... so good luck?. . Service: Great.  It actually got a lot friendlier.  . . Food: Decent.  Dips aren't as great as people think but still pretty good dip, really can't think of a place that has better at this time.  Sausages....um...can't beat europe but definitely still pretty good. But would I wait in a really long line for it? Doubt it.  Its a craze for good atmosphere &amp; better food in So Cal.. . Atmosphere: Use to be really really chill place, like a chill german bar.  The have the benches set up.  The little open room they had never had a divider, so thats new.  Great for smaller groups though (2-4).  However if its a huge group &amp; its for a bday, call ahead &amp; rsvp!  And buy the $95 Chimay bottle, its worth it.  . **CHANGE IN Review: Kids are allowed, I personally just dont' recommend it for dinner &amp; later.. . I've been here a couple times before yelpers spread the news virally haha darn us &amp; our problem of sharing good stuff haha  To those how have yet to visit, just go for drinks &amp; chill time with friends - don't expect it to be some crazy show or something, its water hole.  This place is similar to the same atmosphere you get going to NY bars.
