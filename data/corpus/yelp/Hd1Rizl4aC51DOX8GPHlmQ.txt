Category: Sushi Bars
Hands down, my favorite Japanese restaurant in California-- but only for lunch.  Dinner there is pretty much the same thing as lunch (plus a couple extra sides), but twice as expensive.  Yeah, no.  Lunch is the way to go.. . I always tell my friends that the only things I miss about L.A. are Sushi Gen, tacos and really good Corean food.  Okay, there are other things, like the warm weather, the red velvet cake at Doughboys and the mochi boutique in Little Tokyo, but Sushi Gen's one of the big ones.. . Here are a couple tips (besides taking advantage of the great lunch menu prices) for dining at Sushi Gen:. 1.  Go 20-30 minutes before they open for lunch and wait in line.  Otherwise, you'll be waiting 45 minutes (or more) to get a seat.  I've waited almost an hour there before.  I admit, I was insane for sashimi that day. . 2.  Please don't order the teriyaki.  Sushi Gen is known for their raw stuff.  And they really deliver.  Incredibly fresh (they get frequent deliveries throughout the week) and well-cut (the sushi chefs are trained well).. 3.  Check out either their Sashimi Lunch Special (not the deluxe, it's pricier for no reason) and their Chirashi Deluxe Lunch Special (the deluxe in this case does matter). . Oh, for all you uni lovers, Sushi Gen will occasionally have their Uni Lunch Special.  People tell me it's fantastic.
