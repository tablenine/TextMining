Category: Mexican
I HATE LARD! And guess what? everything here is swimming in it! Especially the tortilla chips that felt like bombs to my stomach--as I write this now I suffer from the effects (aka explosions). . . The food is served in industrial portions. First adjective that came to mind: grotesque. It just looks like wacatelas!!!! I had the enchiladas rojas con pollo. Couldn't finish half of it... And no way on earth I could handle their burrito, which looked like the meal for an army.. . Best thing of the evening: will.i.am. He was there eating, that being a close place to eat in his childhood as he grew a few blocks away from there.. . Other than the random celebrity sight-seeing, El tepeyac offers cheap, vein-clogging food, that might make you happy, if you survive the heart attack...
