Restaurant: Ria&#39;s Bluebird
Category: Southern
Pros: Great food, friendly staff, has some vegan/vegetarian stuff.. Cons: Limited parking, crowded on the weekends, you can't substitute different items cause they can't keep up apparently, they don't split checks, watch out for hipsters.. . We went on a Sunday afternoon which was probably not the best idea. The wait was about half an hour, and with no standing room inside we had to stand outside. The server also messed up our order, but he was nice enough to take some of it off our check. We ordered the Bionic Breakfast and The Fat Stack. Both were delicious.
