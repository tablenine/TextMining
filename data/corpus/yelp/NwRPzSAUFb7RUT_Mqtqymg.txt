Can you say Awesome with a capital A?? Because this place is just that.... . All the food two people need when dining here is the yummy-licious Garlic Chicken, which comes with the oh-so-loveable plantains, white rice, and beans, and an order of the mixta salad. All this for $20!! That's right, for two people, it's only going to cost you $20. . . You get the most bang for your buck here, I promise. I took out one star for the awkwardly small parking lot they have (but at least they have a parking lot and it's free), and for the ambiance coz it's real informal.
