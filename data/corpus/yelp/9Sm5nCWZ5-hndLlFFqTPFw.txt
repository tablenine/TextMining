Review based on 5-10 visits.. . This place is seriously overrated. I've tried their xiao long baos every single time and have NOT been impressed. I need to stop lying to myself that this place is having an off day when I eat here! The portions are small for the prices they charge. I've had NOTHING here that was extraordinary. I do like how the place looks though. Other than that, I don't have much else to say about this place. Average food. Way overrated. Din Tai Fung's xiao long baos is like Pinkberry's fro-yo. Big name, very well known, but just very average taste.
