Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
The one thing I will say about the Apple Pan is that it is consistent. I started going there when I lived and worked in LA almost 20 years ago. I'm now in the bay area and haven't been back in years. However, on a recent trip I decided to take my husband (who is from the east coast). It looks the same and the food is the same. . . We ordered the hickory cheeseburgers with fries. After his first bite he said "this is the best burger I have ever had." I don't know what they do or how they do it, and I'm not even a big burger eater, but those hickory burgers are unbelievable.
