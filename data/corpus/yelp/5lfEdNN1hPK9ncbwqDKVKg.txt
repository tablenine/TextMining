I moved to ATL from California and Whole Foods was a Godsend for me. I love the Foods and the Buffet and the choices. I have been going to Whole Foods for 9 years now and I could not have been more pleased to discover that there was Whole Foods Market here.. . The Meats are to die for. Anything you want. Humus is always the best. Frutis and Veggies always highest caliber. The drinks are pricey but there is something tasty always to be discovered.. . The best thing is the cheeses. God I love thier cheeses. Nice Alte Kase Gouda mit Wien sounds great to me.. . Try the Santa Cruz Lemonades (I grew up near there), Any of the Marinade for their Meats, ceasar chicken/salmon salad is to die for, The ever changing buffet, any of the Humus, and all the Granola and snacks (honeyed sesame sticks are a fave). ciao ciao
