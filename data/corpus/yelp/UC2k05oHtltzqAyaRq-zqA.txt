Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
The hype is big, the lines are long, but the dogs are so-so.. . That's all I really have to say. . . The worst Chicago dog is better then the best Pink's dog.. . Go there for tradition, but don't go there for the best dog on the planet... maybe best on the block.. . PS: if you're one of those people who wait 45 mins in line? you're freakin crazy.
