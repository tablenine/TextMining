Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
I LOVE FOGO!!!. . given that basically its one of the most expensive meals i have yet to eat in my short life, fogo de chao is pretty much worth it.  The salad bar is AMAZING  , i like the cheese and asparagus, and endives.  The hot food is great, my personal fav being the polenta (ive had better cheese balls but they arent too bad)  AND of course the meat is TOTALLY amazing.  I wish i had a bigger stomach so i can eat more meat.  The chicken, pork loin, and picahna are my favs, but each time i go i try to sample all the kinds (try being the key word) the service is really good, Last time i came i spilled sauce all over the table, but the waiter jsut smiled and said it happened all the time and got another table cloth really fast.  Also, (i came for mothers day) they gave my mom and i little gifts which was cool.. My mom loved the restaurant and shes not that into meat (i kno wierd) but yeah im totally going to come back here again~
