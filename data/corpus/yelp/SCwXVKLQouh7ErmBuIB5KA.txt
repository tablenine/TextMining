Well, i had passed by this place a few times and noticed it full but the music did not seem so great (was 50s/60s pop/soul often in the evening it seems) and it was the only place around after all... . But stopping in on last Sunday night  for a quick drink we ended up staying for 6 hours as the music got progressively better and could not bring ourselves to leave.. . As it turned out, we were there less than some other groups, seems to be a real neighborhood hangout.. . Music was really great.. From a jukebox apparently.  David Bowie, Morrissey, Neil Young, Pixies, The Clash, Morphine.. right up my alley anyway... . Late in the night a large group of goth/biker/metal looking people showed up but they were nice enough and either they didn't care to hit the jukebox or the queue was too long, it didn't turn bad until near closing time (which is only 12 on sunday.). . Drinks are not all that cheap though they can be if you drink Pabst.  Not very exciting beer choices if you are a connoisseur but oh well, it can be a lot worse.. . Art was interesting, and the food really quite good and cheap, the righteous salad very good and healthy, quality vegetables.. Good BBQ sandwich.. . Football on the TV could be a downer but fortunately no one was paying attention.. . Patio is quite small and overlooking a parking lot and busy highway (ponce de leon) so not the biggest draw i'd say.. . Great place all in all.
