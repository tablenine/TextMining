The third stop on my June 08 burger hunt, and for a spot that specializes in seafood, this burger was top notch. . . Fellow Yelper Alexander G.'s burger description is right on, so check out his take, 'cept I do not recall mind being too salty. . . My four stars are, of course, limited to the one item ordered and my experience, but clearly I'll be back for sure.
