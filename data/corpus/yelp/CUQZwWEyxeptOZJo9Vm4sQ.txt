i dunno.... I dunno!!!!  . . I'm very disappointed by all the hype.  Maybe it was an off day.  Maybe it was me.  Who knows?  But something was not right about this place.  First of all, the place is a zoo.  Let's just get that out on the table.  It's a zoo and a circus.  And forget about parking.  You'll be circling for a long time.  Better to find street parking down the street and walk to it.  . . AND, it would be different if the food was bomb.  But I didn't think it was very bomb at all actually.  I got the Cuban beef sandwich.  The meat was kind of rubbery.  The bread was alright. I think the lines just threw me off and messed up my expectations.  I mean even if there wasn't a line, the sandwich wasn't that good.  I bet it's more of a dessert/ bakery place.  I'll have to try that next time.. . Anyways, this place totally bummed me out.  Damn you Portos!
