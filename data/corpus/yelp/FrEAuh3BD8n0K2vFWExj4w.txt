This is one of my favorite tapas places in town, especially if you get there before 7pm, when everything is half priced. The sangria is good, and the tapas selection is large. Don't miss out on the mussels, meatballs or the steak...they're all yummy! Wednesdays are Ladies Night and they have free salsa lessons, which are good fun. Never enough men to go around though! I've not been here on a weekend night, but my friends from Brazil go all the time, and always come home at 5am drunk and sweaty, so I'm sure it's a good time!
