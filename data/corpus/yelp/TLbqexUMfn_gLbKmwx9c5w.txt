Restaurant: Heaven On Seven
Category: Southern
Heaven on Seven is a great spot for an informal dinner with great food. I spent more than half of dinner staring at the hot sauces and trying to try all of them. Some of the actually looked like they had been there for years but I didn't notice that until the *end* of our meal. bleh.. . I thought everything we ordered was really good especially the pork po boy and andouille sausage. I thought the prices were reasonable as well. We ended up spending around $10+/person. I thought the gumbo was just alright. . . There's not too much to say about this place, I guess I agree with the others when they say it feels a LITTLE bit like a chain (probably because the decor is kinda cheesy and over the top) but sometimes that's what you want. But I think people should check it ou because it's unique enough and the food is pretty good too. . . FYI... The entrance is actually on the corner through mall . doors and you have to go up a set of escalators to find it.
