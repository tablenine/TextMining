Went there with a client we both shared everything. It was amazing. We both got fish. The little tiny TINY bites of things they bring in between courses are AMAZING! The little melon soup-who knew! A MUST MUST MUST MUST are the FRESH doughnuts for dessert- honestly the most amazing thing i have every tasted. The chef is a woman and literally goes OUT in LA every day to get all the menu's items that day. Pricey but worth the dough!
