What a let down! . . I have been trying my best to like this place as it is close to my house and they have a ton of TV's for watching games. They also have trivia at least one night a week. The new restaurant at perimeter mall is well laid out, tons of plasmas, one giant projector TV, and a decent bar. . . That was the good part. Despite all of this, I think the restaurant management and ownership should take a good look in the mirror and rethink their approach to the restaurant business and service industry. Our waiter was dressed in a shabby all black t-shirt and looked like a thug. Polite as he was when he was at our table, those moments came few and far between. . . The food itself is below average or terrible depending on what you order. I have ordered the buffalo chicken wrap, wings, and a burger and all of them are sub-par. The cheese dip appetizer may as well be space food. It comes out an awkward pink color with a pile of diced tomatoes on top and its served with red tortilla chips. My guess is that whoever designed the menu thought that changing the color of things would distract for the terrible taste. . . My advice, if your at perimeter mall go to the food court. If you are considering going to the one in Brookhaven keep driving to the nearest taco mac. I promise you'll have a better meal and probably enjoy the game more.
