I've always heard how amazing Tom's breakfast is. When I lived in the area I attempted to go there for brunch a couple of times but found that the wait was WAY too long for me. So I finally came here for lunch on a weekday and immediately decided I had to have the eggs florentine. Our waiter was all excited about my choice and even delivered my dish while singing a little song. So funny.. . And holy crap was that an excellent plate of food! Tom's definitely makes one of the best eggs florentine that I've ever tasted. The eggs were perfectly cooked - not too runny, not too hard - and there was plenty of Hollandaise sauce. I hate it when places skimp on the sauce. But the best part was the spinach: it was creamed. YUM YUM YUM. I mean...it's clearly a heart-attack-on-a-plate kind of dish, but if you're gonna go out, it may as well be eating this.
