Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
After a challenging 2 hours of Ice Skating I was brought to the famous Johnnie's Pastrami in Culver City. . . I went right for the signature Hot Pastrami. I added swiss cheese and snacked on a side of peppers. Huge sandwich, great flavor. The price is fair for the taste honestly. You're given a dish of pickles but sadly I did not save the room for them. . . We sat outside near the stone bonfire. Service was super friendly. Parking is available in the back. Cash only so duh, bring cash.
