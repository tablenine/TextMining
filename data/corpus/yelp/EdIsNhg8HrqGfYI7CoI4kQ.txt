Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Parking here in the congested parking lot, if there is space, you'd best have good comp insurance as it is a nightmare!. . If you are faint of heart, be prepared for 911, when you get the bill!. Meat  Choices for Bbq. begging at $25!. And there ain't much for $35 bucks being spent on 'family' style divided dinner bills!. . Meals come with typical Korean Restaurant salad, side dishes, Free water, and free hot tea!. . This place is upscale Korean Bbq. in a run down neighborhood, charging upscale prices!. Service is 3rd rate!. Slow, to take order, slow to get food, and with an attitude!. Korean Service sucks!. . There is  nothing special here, maybe antiseptic ambiance!. I amnt into Black &amp; White background cloors,,and like somethng showing traditional ambiance with character, here it is about Money!. . All around here on Vermont are 'hole' in the wall Korean Joints, which most charge reasonable prices for meals!!. . If you want value, great Bbq., all you can eat, with all since dishes - check out:"Ma Dang Sea Korean Bbq. Buffet , right down the street at 901 S. Vermont!. . Her is the ultimate hole in the wall, with great food, value, and an ambiance you can take with you!. . Never Again!. ~
