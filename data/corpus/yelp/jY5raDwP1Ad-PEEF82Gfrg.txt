Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Hands down the BEST ramen I've ever had in the states. Recently coming back from Tokyo and experiencing the holy grail of ramen, Daikokuya was comparable and exceeded expectations. It's not one of those places where you can add a lil bit of this and a lil bit of that to your bowl (which btw, totally destroys the essence of Japanese ramen). They kept it traditional - noodles, pork, egg, and soup. You can order the kotteri to enrich the soup with more flavor, but the regular soup was perfect on its own. I love the fact that you have the option of ordering a half bowl (for you non-hearty eaters), but even though I didn't have much of an appetite at the time, I was forced to stuff myself silly with such deliciousness.. . We didn't care that it was 90 degrees outside and there was no AC inside the restaurant. Our meal victoriously ended in sweat dripping down our faces and our guts expanded to the max. Our mission was to finish every last bite and down all the soup...and we succeeded! We even drove 30 minutes out of the way just to come back here a second time before hittin the road for a 5 hr drive back home. I can now die and fly up to ramen heaven.
