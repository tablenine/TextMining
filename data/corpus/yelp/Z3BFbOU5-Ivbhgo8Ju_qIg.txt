Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Upon entering the cafe and taking a quick glance at the decor and waitstaff--I was immediately reminded of this restaurant back in NYC called Coffeeshop--you know, where everyone looks like they came straight from the glossy pages of a fashion mag or an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch advertisement. Upon feeling the 'I'm cooler than you vibe",  I wanted to leave, but my stomach said otherwise and I like to give new places a try. . . Overall, I liked the decor of the cafe, the service was so-so and the food okay. I ordered the La Vida Loca burger since I like hot and adventurous food. It was anything but 'livin' la vida loca'. First off,  the wrong dish was brought to me, but the guy mumbled something that sounded like 'hot something..' and whisked away before I could say, 'hey this wasn't what I ordered. " A full minute later, he realized the mistake. . . When my order arrived, I was impressed with the presentation, but man looks can be deceiving. I felt that the burger itself was bland with the occasional smattering of green peppers and I guess what made it vida loca was the chipotle mayonnaise. Yaay! a little spice in my mayonnaise--I'm really living on the edge. I did like the steak fries. . . Mmm, maybe if I decide to return, I should try the breakfast that everyone is raving about.
