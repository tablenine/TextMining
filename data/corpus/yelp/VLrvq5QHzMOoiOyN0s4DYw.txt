First of all let me start off with the good, the atmosphere is great I love all the tv's and the comfortable chairs, and thats about it.... . . I went there on a date first and had to wait an hour before we got a seat and then once we were seating the waiter made the comment that they were out of wings....... like what made him think thats all we wanted to eat.. before he even haded us out menu as if we were going to walk out after he said that........ . Then he stated that they were out of fish cause my date wanted to order the tilapia, but the table right next to us that was seated after us received the same dish needless to say I request a manager and he didn't have anything to say or offer, Just stated that it was a really busy night and maybe the waiter was confused about what was going on in the kitchen. yeah right........ . This would be a good place if you wanted to meet with 10 people or so and watch a game, but for me this place sucked.
