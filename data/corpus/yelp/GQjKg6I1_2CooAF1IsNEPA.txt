Restaurant: Italian Village
Category: Nightlife
A friend and I were here last weekend and went to the Village (upstairs restaurant). It was a busy Friday night, but we only had a very short wait for two.  Our waiter was prompt and friendly, took our drink order, and brought out the fresh baked bread, which we devoured.  . . We took plenty of time to look over the menu. I had been there once before, but sat in the lower level restaurant.  Our waiter was almost TOO attentive while we were looking over the menu.  Twice he came and asked if we had any questions which rather irked me.  I know I have a very bad habit of reading the menu cover to cover and probably more than once as I decide what I want, but my theory is that we were in no hurry so the waiter shouldn't be either.. . I ordered the Meat Ravioli in the spicy Arribiata sauce and my friend ordered the Cannelloni in the cream sauce. Our order came out really quick.  Thats ok, but we had just finished the loaf of bread in front of us because we thought we would have some wait between ordering and our food. Apparently not.  My ravioli dish was good and a generous (but not gluttonous portion), but there wasn't anything to write home about.  I had this before but this time the sauce was much spicier than normal. I drank two glasses of water just during the entree portion!  . . I tried a bit of the Cannelloni dish and it was AMAZING!  If I didn't think she'd notice, I would have tried swapping dishes. The next time I go back, I would definitely get that. . . Two chocolate lovers just couldn't say no to desert, not where there is a chocolate mouse one. It was great and came out in a little glass. It was very rich - and you'd definitely need to share it, but it was a nice end of the meal. . . I love Italian food but had overpriced meals - the prices here were reasonable.
