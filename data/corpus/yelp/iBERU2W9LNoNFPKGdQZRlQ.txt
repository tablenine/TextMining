I know what beer i like and i stick to it, so i'm not giving it 4 stars on its beer selection.. . I'm giving it 4 stars cas of the overall experience coming here and the quality of food, the quality of food is not the best but its not disappointing at all, which you would somewhat expect it to be at a place like this.  . . because their food is served to patrons who are near drunk and have the munchies... i had expected it to be something just a lil better than what they serve at D&amp;B.  . . I was wrong, Their grilled sea bass was delicious.
