Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery

Mmmmmm.....yum!  I love the Alcove.  I had gone to the Alcove with a few girlfriends for cake but I had to try it for breakfast.  I am a huge breakfast fan and love to go to restaurants that serve "fancy" breakfasts.  . . Alcove is delicious.  We had an omelette and a bowl of fruit and were filled up.  Also the sangria had lychee in it!  I love this place, great ambience and fantastic food.  I will be back.
