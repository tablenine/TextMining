Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
We went on a weekday for lunch, got seated pretty quick.  The place is smaller than I thought it would be and it was packed.  Service was quick, food was good.  My favorite was the pork dumpling and their green beans.  Something new I learned....if you want more tea, u turn the lid upside down on the pot:)...if you cannot find parking, you can park in the lot of the Arcadia Market shopping center right behind.
