I LOVE THIS PLACE! All the food is amazing and the service is really good. They really got the atmosphere right! I feel like I'm in Europe when I step in here. Â The prices are pretty reasonable and the location is good. The only thing you'll have trouble with is the parking! The secret is out and a lot of people are going. Street parking is available, but more than likely you'll have to pay 5 bucks across the street. . . Happy Saint Patricks Day EVERYONE.
