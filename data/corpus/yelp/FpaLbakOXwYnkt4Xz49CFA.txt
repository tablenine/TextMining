Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I've been to feast a few times over my ten years in this city.  Once, I tried someone else's black bean burger and thought it was good.  That is it.  Nothing I've ordered has ever been good.  I just can't figure it out.  Who and why do people go there?  Talking about how important location is I'm a believer that you could sell cow dong out of that intersection and get $10 per.  Back to Feast.  I swear the chicken is processed on their salads.  I ordered the salmon and when it can they forgot the soba noodles and the garnish.  Basically, they half plated my meal and sent it out.  I got it back after I asked my waiter how much longer it would be.  Also, I had my baby with me and they told my wife no strollers and sent her away.  So, I went back in and said that was nuts and how could they turn away business like that.  They replied sorry, we'll take your stroller and store it.  I mean, they might have mentioned that before they sent my wife away.. Food is overrated, it's crowded and what they could use is a real chef in this place.  I don't usually write bad reviews but please, complacency is not the way to keep or get repeat customers.
