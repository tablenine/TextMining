finally.. theres a excellent sushi buffet restaurant here in atlanta. i never knew nori nori was a chain from ny minado's, till i saw the plates. this place is awesome, brings me back to the tastey sushi at minado's. just like minado's, they hire mexicans to make the sushi's. how sweet is that???!!
