Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Burgers are a dime a dozen in this town, but Umami's signature Port and Stilton burger stands out from the pack. Succulent and full of flavor, the burger is worth a visit. So why the one star you may ask? HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE. . . It takes a lot to make me cry, like if I chip a nail or my sandwich gets eaten by a co-worker, but this is the last straw!!!! The waiter confronted me after I knew he was carrying my order. "That's for this table" I said. "No, one second, hold on" he barked, in a rude dismissive manner. I didn't realize Stalin was working here. Before that, we saw a different waiter take dirty napkins and give them to an adjacent table full of people. Sanitary? I think not. A straw, what one would think might be a simple, straightforward request, was delivered to us about fifteen minutes late. The couple next to us agreed with our outrage. They clapped as I told the servers off.. . The manager and assistant manager were nice and offered my boyfriend a cookie. The cookie was good, thankfully, and didn't require a straw. Otherwise, there might have been trouble. Though the tempura onion rings were quite delicious, this place is poorly managed. I will not be frequenting this establishment in the future and I hope Umami II or Umami Cahuenga is sufficiently better. Clearly the servers were on edge after getting scolded by the managers. One was so edgy, he spilled a glass of ice into my boyfriend's lap. Thankfully, my boyfriend found it refreshing. . . I know it's just a burger and their cooks are certainly talented, but service is important and they unfortunately, don't have their act together.
