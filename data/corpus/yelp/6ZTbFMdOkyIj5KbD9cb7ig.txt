The food was fine, it was just not what I expected. I had heard the food was really good so maybe my expectations were too high. The decor was unique and our server was exceptional. I think a cold sandwich was not the best choice for me. I will definitely try it again since it has received solid reviews, but next time I will get something hot.. . One more thing, the parking during lunch was terrible. I had to search for almost 20 mins. So get there early to make time to find parking.
