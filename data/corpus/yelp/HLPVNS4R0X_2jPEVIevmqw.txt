Sausage Kitchen...I wanted to love you. I really did. I don't mean to be be shallow, but your wiener just didn't do it for me. . . I love Bratwurst, and after reading all the wonderful reviews, I thought I would fall in love. I did not. I was thrown off at first because I thought it would be more like a restaurant and not a fancy fast food place. The place was done up really nicely and the beer selection was pretty good too. . . I ordered the bratwurst with sauerkraut and spicy peppers. What made me take off a couple of stars was the kraut. It wasn't flavorful enough and how can you eat bratwurst without kraut?!??! That is the definition of deustchland. It was served on a bun, which was too bready for me (yes I like to create words). The mustards were all over the place, and I had to go from table to table like a vulture to grab the brown mustard. And the peppers were NOT spicy. I do not like bellpeppers,but I guess green bellpeppers were their version of spicy peppers. The bratwurst was tasty, but after going to some German restaurant in SF, this one just doesn't compare. . . Their truffle oil fries were amazing however. So kuddos for that. I will however not shut myself from trying all their other options so I will be back.... . . Maybe Wurstkuche, you can woo me back....we shall see.
