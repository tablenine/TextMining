Good basic diner food. The mac and cheese is yummy comfort food, and the buffalo chicken sandwich is just what you want it to be. They also have a really tastey gooey molton chocolate cake dessert. . . I've never had to wait for a table (though I often see lines on weekends) and service is always quick and pleasant. . I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's a great neighborhood joint and a good place for a quick cheap meal. I've never spent over $15 for 2.
