Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Let me just start off by saying this place is TRASH. By far the worst "mexican" food i've ever tasted. I'm not a picky eater at all, especially when it comes to mexican food. The first (and last) time I went to Tito's Tacos, I had to wait about 10-20 minutes just to find parking, wait in a long line while starving and craving some what was supposed to be AUTHENTIC mexican food. When it was my turn to order, the lady told me all the tacos were only shredded beef. STRIKE ONE. $0.50 more just to put cheese on each taco. STRIKE TWO. I take my food back to my car and took the first bite. and guess what? the taco was basically greasy with no flavor. hardly any meat which wasn't even decent. way too much cheese. and the shell was soaked in grease. by the way, their salsa was basically diced tomatoes in water. STRIKE THREE. Never again will I waste my time, gas, or money at this place. Don't let the long lines fool you. The only good thing about this place is that it's cheap; but then again, what tacos aren't?
