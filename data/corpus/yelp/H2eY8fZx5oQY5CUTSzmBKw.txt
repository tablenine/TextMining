Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
my opinion about this restaurant may be a bit biased but i have to say, the quality of meat here is awesome. i came after a long day of studying/school with friends and was pleasantly surprised to find that the interior looked so much better than the outside surroundings of the restaurant. everything about this restaurant is top notch. the service is excellent, the ban-chan is brought out in wide variety pretty quickly and of course the most important, the meat is delish. you won't get a better deal for what you're paying here. it's totally worth it! i'm not picky about food but i am picky about saying what's good and what's average. out of the many korean bbq restaurants i've been to, this is probably one of the top restaurants i would recommend going to. i also have to note that it's super duper squeaky clean; i was impressed. great service, excellent food, clean environment; what more can you ask for?
