Touristy?  You bet.  . . Tasty?  Sure.  . . Greatest pizza in the world?  In Chicago?  Welllll, probably not the best in Chicago or the world, but it's pretty darn good.  The wait is long---too long to wait in line, in fact--so just put your name down and go off for a half hour and come back to grab your table and pizza (which you order when you put your name down--weird, huh?).  I did love the sauce but be warned, the pizza is extremely filling.  Don't get any appetizers.
