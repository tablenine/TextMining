Take those 5 stars and square it, so thats 25 stars for Pink's Hollywood.. . No Joke here. Whoever Pink is, I thank them for making them this good.. . Although, it is probably the mosty unhealthy meal you can eat, thats probably why it's so damn good.. . The Chilli is a must, and you can add bacon, pastarmi, etc just to make sure your going to be having that healthy meal.. . Lines are insane. Day to Night.. . No Hype here, just the real deal.. . Next time I go, I gotta make sure I make it to the Wall of Fame, for some reason they never regonized my celeb status yet.
