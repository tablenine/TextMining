I'd really rate this a 2 since the food was alright, nothing mind blowing and the drinks were too strong for my liking. A mango-tini with all vodka and no mango isn't for me. Whe edged me into a 2.5/3 was the Chocolate bag with berries and cream. It was amazing, and a must have to wrap up any meal.
