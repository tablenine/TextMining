I've never been for dinner, but brunch is pretty solid.  It's a toss-up on whether the mimosa flight or the very short to non-existent wait time is the best part.  I had the breakfast pizza--it was more "pizza" than "breakfast" but still good.  I ordered without the bacon and that probably would give it more of a breakfast vibe.  The service was so-so...they seemed grossly understaffed.  I don't judge on that unless it happens again.
