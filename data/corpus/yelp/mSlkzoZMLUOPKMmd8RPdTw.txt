Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
Roy's. Yeah.. . There just seems something fundamentally wrong with having to dress up to go to a Hawaiian restaurant. Then of course this isn't Hawaiian food, its Hawaiian Fusion- so I guess its ok. . . The food is very good, but the booze is to die for.. . The fiance and I recently had a friend in from out of town and wanted to take her somewhere different, so to Roy's we went. . . First the food: Lobster Dim Sum was yummy and rich. Roy's Trio, Salmon, Ahi and Butterfish, was  very nice. I loved the Misoyaki Butterfish. The fiance enjoyed his Shellfish Combo. Dessert was a mango thingy and chocolate pyramid. Yum auch.. . The booze: Mango Mojito was splendid and smooth. Lychee Pomegranate Martini---- 100% liquor. Tasty, tasty and guaranteed to make you weeble when you walk. I should point out that I am no light weight when it comes to the drink and walking home was out of the question.. . All in all a nice night out, if you can sit outside. In my experience it is actually quieter and you might see Vince Vaughn. A bit expensive, a bit yuppie infested but nice. . . Here is the breakdown:. .    * Wait staff: Very efficient and friendly. I really wish I could remember our waiter's name. He was great and even gave us info for a new vacation spot..    * Drink Menu: Large and Hawaii themed. Seriously, try the Lychee Pomegranate Martini..    * Dinner Menu: Hawaiian Fusion, hard to define but think pan-asiany..    * Parking: There is a structure attached to One West Superior, but if you can avoid the whole car thing do it. Red Line is a block away and the 36 goes right past it..    * Dress: I guess its supposed to be more formal, but we went in nice tops and jeans with no issues.
