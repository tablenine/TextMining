The Mrs and I are jetting to Austin later this week and I was perusing the Triple D page looking for some gastronomically evil places to eat while in Texas when I come across Oinkster! Hmmm, I thought, let's celebrate "Earth Week" and fire up the Monte Carlo, head out of Torrance and increase our carbon footprint ten or twenty fold. . I had looked at the Yelp page and almost turned away to find some seafood in San Pedro. . But nay I say and park the beast and get in line. It only took fifteen minutes and about ten minutes until our order was delivered. . We like to start with the basics and had a Classic and Cheese Burger with fries, as Guy says that burger is money, so good and the fries terrific. The only better fries I've had were the fries at the "Heart Attack Grill" in Tempe, AZ fried in lard! Yum! . The Aioli and ketchup, both homemade and delishes. . We will be back and try the other items offered.
