Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
CPOG is a unique little Chicago pizza joint up in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. If you haven't tried it, you should at least go once to try it!. . CPOG offers great salads, pizza pot pies, sandwiches ("oven grinders"), and the unique mediterranean bread. A party of two that is very hungry could easily share a salad, bread, and two half pound pizza pot pies. . . The ambiance is retro. You will hear Frank Sinatra while you are enjoying your meal in a dark formerly garden-style apartment and enjoy the lovely little carnations at your table. . . The back of your menu will go over the history of the building, how it is right across from the garage where the infamous Valentine's Day Massacre occurred. That the CPOG might have been a lookout on that horrible day.. . Some things to note: it's CASH ONLY! The wait will be long, no matter when you go. And finally... parking is difficult in this area. . . It is something to try at least once in your life!
