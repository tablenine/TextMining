The view is breathtaking, the restaurant decor is also wonderful. I saw some of the food being carried out and decided not to eat. Bleh, especially not for at least $30 per plate. The drinks were good and there was a decent selection of beer on tap. Annoying that the restrooms are all the way down a flight of like 20 stairs (not fun while your drinking) and the restrooms were dirty!. .  Â I will probably be back to bring people here from out of town and have a couple drinks at the bar but thats about it.. . Its so hard to review this because the food and cleanliness gets a 3 the view gets a 5! So i guess 4 would be right on?
