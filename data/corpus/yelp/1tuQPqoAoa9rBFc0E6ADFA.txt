So far there are 3 words that never go together since I have been here and that is Atlanta and Mexican Food.  However this is closest thing I have had to decent mexican food.   I ordered the chicken quesadilla, which was good, however I thought that meant the chicken would be in the quesadilla.  Oh Well.  To get another star I hope they learn how to make barbacoa.
