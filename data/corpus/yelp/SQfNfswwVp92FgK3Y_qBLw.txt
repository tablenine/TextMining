Restaurant: Pizzeria Uno
Category: Pizza
Pizzeria Uno and Due are the same thing, only Uno usually has a longer wait (on top of the already crazy wait at Due). I crave their pizza from thousands of miles away, so I do think it's worth it if you can strategically show up during a low(er) traffic hour. You don't even need toppings with their deep dish - just a straight-up cheese pie is going to satisfy. It's soo good... but again, the wait kills so I'd advise checking out Due if you don't want to make this an all-night project.
