Food tasty. Service Sucky. We ate at JCT on a Tuesday night, and we were rushed through our whole meal. Our entrees came out as we were still having our first few sips of wine and they had forgotten our appetizer. Â Our waiter kept clearing plates in a way that felt pushy, not helpful. He grabbed my salad without asking if I was done. By the end of the meal we were holding on tight to everything in case it got snatched away! He did not offer cofee or tea and on the way out the door, the host and two waiters were standing in the foyer and didn't not say goodnight. I was debating between two and three starts because the food was mighty delicious, but disappointing service really ruined the experience.
