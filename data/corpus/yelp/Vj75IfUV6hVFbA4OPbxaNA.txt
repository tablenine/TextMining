Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
This cafe is a gem in the middle of Lakeview. The decor is very 90s and seems like Friday's ripped them off due to the license plates lining one wall. Mostly, it's just a colorful diner. . . I went on a weekday afternoon and the cafe was quiet, having only a few diners in there either reading or chatting with friends in a booth. The prices were a little more than I had expected, hovering at about $8 for a sandwich. I ordered the vegan mac and cheese with a side of vegetarian chili. However, the waitress didn't tell me that the chili was served on top of the mac and cheese, but I ate the sloppy, yet delicious Midwestern mess anyways.. . This is a really great option for vegans and vegetarians who don't want to eat diet food when they go out. The non-vegetarian options looked interesting, too. Also, if you just want to read a book, drink some coffee, and grab a bite, I would recommend this place as well. The cafe has a large hot and iced coffee selection. Great place to hit up if you're in Lakeview/Wrigleyville. . . The Yelp information is wrong about the cafe's hours because they're open 24 hours on the weekends.
