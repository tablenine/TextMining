Category: Mexican
best thing about El Myr? . you order a quesedilla, they bring you a burrito...order a burrito, they bring you a quesedilla. It's ok though because turns out the server knew what you wanted even when you didn't. I miss gettin' my mexican food fix on before a show at variety. . . oh, and I once showed up at el myr completely covered in silver body paint and a purple wig and no one even batted an eye. I love you, el myr!
