Perhaps I'd toss it more stars if I actually saw a magic show there.  Unfortunately, Hallow's Eve is quite the popular night, so most of the shows were packed upon our excited arrival.  However, Irma the Piano-Playing Ghost makes it worth sticking around, and in my case, with fresh dirty martini forever in hand (for which I paid for not-so-fondly the following morning).  And this is how it works with our dear Irma: you holler out a tune, if she knows it, she will chirp like a bird, and once you push a dollar bill into the neighboring bird cage, she starts playing the song like there's no tomorrow.  Resist the urge to peek behind the piano's curtain....  And remember, you must either be a member of this oddball mansion, or be accompanied by one.  Arrgh... there's always a catch, eh?!
