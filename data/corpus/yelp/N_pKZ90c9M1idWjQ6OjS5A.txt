Restaurant: Pho Dai Loi
Category: Vietnamese
I have not had asian food in days! I was craving for any kinds, but it had to be AUTHENTIC! We found Pho Dai Loi in the Doraville area and boy was it delicious! I ordered combination pho like always and fried eggrolls. God I love the Vietnamese fried eggrolls. Yummy! David had a simple version of pho (soup, noodle and beef). It was his first pho. Pretty cool! Service was excellent. The waiter we had was so polite. Great place! They also serve anytime during the day because apparently restaurant styles like Thai or Japanese close during the afternoon for rest, so it was nice to have found this place at 3pm and still serving. :)
