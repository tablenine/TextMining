the ramen here is delish!. . and there's only one kind:it has bean sprouts, green onion, bamboo shoots, a very delicious egg with a CREAMY center and kurubota berkshire porkbelly... . . the broth is made with pork bones and joints that has been boiled all night @ a "undisclosed location"... . . you can also request a richer, fatter version for the hardcore. Â i've seen a guy next to me order it ~ you could see all the oil in his bowl. . . you could also order everything on the side (cold) and they give you a bowl of soup as well.... . i got the combo: comes with a small tempura bowl with the most crispy textured tempura i've ever had! it was a little oily but it was really good... it had one shrimp, sweet potato, carrot, onion ring and two green beans all already dressed in tempura sauce.. . i also tried the fried rice and it was one of the best fried rice i had @ a ramen place ~ kind of like really good chinese fried rice with a japanese twist ?. . @ the beginning they also give you a cabbage salad with a very yummy japanese dressing.... . this place is VERY satisfying but a bit of a wait (even @ 5:30)...
