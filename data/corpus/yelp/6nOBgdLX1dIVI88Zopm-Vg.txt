Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
3.5 stars. . I had a ramen competition with my Japanese b-school classmates. We stalked places in Sawtelle and Lil Tokyo. We decided the best spot is at neither of these neighborhoods.... . Anyway, Orochon is a nice spot. The canteen-style dining and simple menu make it a sociable venue, usually filled with tables of noisy diners. I came on Sat before going out bar-hopping - #4 heat, miso soup, extra noodles, egg and beansprouts. Too much food...Hhaha.. . Pretty good stuff. I also like Kouraku on E2nd St. but for rice dishes and beer.
