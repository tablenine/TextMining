Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I had to come here just so I could say I'd eaten at the FAMOUS pinks hot dogs!! I stood in line for an hour and 45 minutes (in the heat) so I was expecting alot!!  I'm sure when Brad and Angelina come here they don't wait in line!!! The parking SUCKS (they have a SMALL private lot that is filled ALL DAY, so you have to hope you get lucky!!) The kitchen is run like a well oiled machine. The girl who took the order was like Rainman!! She took a HUGE order and didn't write a single thing down (AND the order came out correct!!).   Don't expect fancy decor (just walls COVERED with celebrity photos of all the people that eat there) and some outdoor patio like tables. I will say the hotdog itself wasn't as good as the ever reliable Costco all beef dog, but the TOPPINGS that were offered, MADE IT WORTH THE WAIT!!  Where else can you get lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, cheese, chili, avocado, sourkraut and ANYTHING else under the sun on top of a dog??.   Glad I went, don't know if I'd go again (unless I was guaranteed front of the line privileges!)
