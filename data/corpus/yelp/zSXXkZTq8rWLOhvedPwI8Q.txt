My husband and I had been looking forward to dining at Craft for quite some time.  Our experience exceeded our expectations.  We arrived early for our 9 pm dinner reservation.  We enjoyed a cocktail in the bar and chatted with some new friends who we offered to share our table with.  We were seated shortly after 9 in the dining room.  Service was good, but I was confused by the multiple people that stopped by our table, I'm not sure who our waiter actually was.  The amuse bouche was the only thing I didn't care for.  It was an olive mousse.  I just don't happen to like olives.  We started with a beet salad and porchetta (not pancetta).  For our main courses we ordered the Berkshire Pork and Peking Duck.  Both were delicious.  We had sides of risotto and sunchokes (our new favorite thanks to a recent meal at Ad Hoc in Yountville).  The dessert amuse bouche was a really yummy panna cotta.  We also ordered the chocolate peanut butter (something) and it was to die for.  It was topped with sea salt and carmel gelato.  Sooo good!  My husband tried the lemon tart with huckleberries.  It was ok, but not as good as mine!  Then, as if we hadn't had enough to eat already our check came with another dessert compliments of the chef.  Tasty carmel corn and a couple tiny cookies.  Overall the food was excellent and although we spent more money than we have ever spent on a meal, by far, we felt it was worth it.  The only thing that could have made our experience better was a Tom Colicchio sighting!
