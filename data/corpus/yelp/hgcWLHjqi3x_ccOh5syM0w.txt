I came here for lunch; there was only one server, and she seemed a bit overworked. The food is okay but nothing spectacular. The salsa did not have the bite I like. If you put this food in front of me, I would eat it, this is not a restaurant that I would go out of the way for. Props and for having fish tacos and menudo.
