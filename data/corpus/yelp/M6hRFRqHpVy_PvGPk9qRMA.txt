Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Dearest Din Tai Fung,. . Just the mere thought of puncturing your tender rice dumpling satchel, to slurp out your oozy hot pork juice innards, pricks my tastebuds alive. Sometimes I like to make an incision at the side to let the your juices well up in my spoon.  Other times, I like to bite off your top knot to inhale liquid from above.  . . DTF dumplings.  You are my salivation to salvation.
