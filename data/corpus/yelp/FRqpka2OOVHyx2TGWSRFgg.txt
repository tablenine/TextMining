Don't get me wrong, I like Orochon.  May I remind you that my headline says "3 stars is a good review!"  But I didn't think it was as good as Daikokuya, which I tried after Orochon.  Then again, I'm more excited about returning here than Daikokuya, since next time I visit, I'm trying the Special #2 contest (Jessica H., take notes . . . I expect you to remind me).  The Special #2 contest is a race against time, with the participant racing to finish every last drop of the spiciest ramen Orochon serves . . . in 30 minutes.  If you succeed, and apparently that's a big if, you get a Polaroid on the wall of fame for all to see.  Sweet, no?!?. . Ramen makes a great lunch, and Orochon has a great selection, including very mild selections and extremely hot selections (a la the aforementioned Special #2).  I tried a medium, a 4 if I remember correctly, and it was good, though it could've been spicier.  Overall, I was pleased with my experience, if not blown away, and it was well worth the (somewhat) long wait.
