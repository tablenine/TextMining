WOW.  Go here. Eat sushi.  But also eat cooked food.  wow.  I eat a lot of sushi and I am blown away by the creativity of their dishes.  Creamy rock shrimp was fabulous.  yumyumyumyumyum  don't go when you are extremely hungry and about to faint from low blood sugar because expect to wait like 30 minutes while smelling all the wondrous food.
