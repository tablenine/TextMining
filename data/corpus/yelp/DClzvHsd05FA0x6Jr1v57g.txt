Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
Like many on here, I enjoyed my first trip to Brick Store.... . I went there with one of my best pals and his wife to celebrate his birthday. Â I was a little intimidated by how many folks were crammed in there on a Tuesday night- it looked like a Friday night to me!. . The food was good, my friends drooled all over their open faced chicken salad sandwiches, and the beer list was MIND BOGGLING!!!!!!!!. . If you're ever in Decatur I would definitely recommend checking this place out!
