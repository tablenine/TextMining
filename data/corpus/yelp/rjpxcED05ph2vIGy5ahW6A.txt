Me like Beer.  Me want Beer.  Me get Beer.. . Aaah.. it's a place where you can just sit back and relax and drink a few cold ones.  They have a HUGE selection of beers, apparently all are on tap.  Getting a half-yard is not such a great idea unless you're Frank the Tank (see the movie, Old School) since there is no way in heck you can finish that thing in less than 7 mins and still enjoy it.. . The food is surprisingly good.  I had no expectations coming in and was pleasantly surprised.  The appetizers are quite good (we had the buff. wings w/ honey bbq &amp; the onion ring tower).  I've also ordered the chicken pot pie and the rib-eye... both were delicious.  The only complaint... really is the service.  They tend to be a little slow.  Maybe it's because they're waiting for you to finish your half-yard first.
