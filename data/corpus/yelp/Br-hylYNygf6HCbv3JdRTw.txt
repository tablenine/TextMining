This is the BEST Italian restaurant I've ever been to so far. I would give 6 stars if I could!!! . . A friend of mine loves this place as well, but the first time (and the last time) she was there, she waited for over 2 hrs. even with a reservation. I've been to this place twice in the past 2 weeks and I had no problem getting the table. The trick is to go late. Later the better.
