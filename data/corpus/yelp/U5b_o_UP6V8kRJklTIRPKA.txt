Normally I take pride in disliking things most people like. That's what makes me so cute and disagreeable! So when I learned this place was oozing with hipsters, I really wanted to diss it hardcore bish style. . . After about 35 u-turns, my partner in crime Xamot and I found the spot. Lack of signage. How ultra *hip*. . . Sure enough, there were so many skinny jeans and side swept bangs in the house that they were spillin' out of the joint. After waiting for 20 minutes, we were led down a narrow path to our table. . . This is when I became a fan. Menu was simple and items were cheap. Our waiter was nice to boot!. . Dinner came and it was yummy. Not as yummy as OG Vietnamese grandma sellin it out of her cart in Saigon for 5,000 dong pho, but for LA and for being hip, it was good. . . Warning: close your eyes when you enter the toilet or prepare to be blinded.. . So, I guess I have to admit, I am one of those hipster yelp writin pho cafe eatin types now. See ya at the Ray Ban store.
