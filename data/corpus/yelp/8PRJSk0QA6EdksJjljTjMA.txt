The food is great and the lattes are to die for! My friend had a vanilla latte and it was smooth as silk. They use real vanilla bean which is why the lattes are so expensive. My client had a peanut butter, banana sandwich with chocolate. *I think that is the name of the sandwich. It was pretty good, though a bit pricey, it was worth the taste.
