yes they moved... and is much much nicer than whats pictured. . . fancy shmansy chinese food!!! and i love their couch booths... so comfy... . . i could eat and sleep to eat again. pig.... . we ordered the $78 meal thing for just the 2 of us. we couldnt decide and we were hungry... greedy... hungry.... . with that we got the seafood soup (yummy soup with shrimp, nappa, squid, fish, fish balls...), some chinese sprout veggies that i was not a fan of, kung pow (best kung pow i've ever had... no really!! never been a fan of that stuff till now...), whole fish (pretty good), plate of clams, onion and ginger crabs (oh my sooo good...), and i think a chicken dish, i dont remmeber. . . everthing was good... but what makes me put the extra star for the 5 stars... was the kung pow chicken. i dont even know if im spelling this correctly but i dont care. it was friggin good. the waiters were really friendly. they actually smile when they walk by. the booths, again, were comfy. everything was bright, clean, and yummy!!
