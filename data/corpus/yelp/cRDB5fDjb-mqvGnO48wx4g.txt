Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Met a friend here for a late morning, hot beverage.  I put exactly $6 in my pocket (okay, that was the only cash I had) and left the debit card at home (must stop spending).  . . After looking at the menu I wished I had a bit more cash. (Baguette with butter and jam?  Was this menu made for me?)  I kept within my budget (no choice) and got the hot apple cider and a juice.  Friend got a tea and a bagel/schmear combo.  All were good, much better than the offerings at Starbucks.. . Service was good.  Ambience was fun.  . . We chatted and caught up while perusing the wall of travel books; places we have been, places we long to go and places we should travel to together.  Intermixed were fun gifts like the "Jesus Shaves" shaving cup and a snow globe (my friend's daughter likes to break snow globes).. . A quick trip through the rest of the gifts in the back of the cafe concluded our visit:  candle scents we loved, candle scents we would only burn to piss off our neighbors and dresses that no one over a size 0 should wear.  . . It's a cute cafe.  I'll support.
