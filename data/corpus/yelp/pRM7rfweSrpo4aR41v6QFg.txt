i've only eaten in the dining section where its calm. but the barside looks very exciting and a lil crazy. the bartenders do tricks and the cocktail waitresses are dressed in minis, heels, and show lots of cleavage.. . mm.. there was a time when me and my bf use to come here every fri night bc the chips, shrimp baguette, crawfish potatoes, and ribs called out to us.. . ---GET---. . CAJUN CHIPS -- huge mound of warm potato chips covered in crawfish, sausage, onion, scallions, &amp; creamy lobster sauce. packed with flavor, so warm, lots of toppings. DELICIOUS! huge portion! perfect app for 4 ppl. me and my bf, 2 fatties, love eating it by ourselves. haha. . SPICY SHRIMP BAGUETTE -- large french baguette stuffed with this spicy shrimp mix. the shrimp is covered in this kinda dry, kinda wet mix of seasonings. can be a little too salty at times. but very flavorful and tasty and surprisingly spicy.. . CRAWFISH MASHED POTATOES -- fries are the default side item, but you should definitely ask for this instead! smooth mash potatoes with chunks of crawfish. i dont know what spices they use, but the mashed potatoes are like orange- yellow &amp; very tasty.. . BABY BACK RIBS -- big portions, two full slabs! but each rib is pretty small. theres a good amount of meat on each rib. sometimes it was really tender, while at times kinda dry. guess just depends if youre lucky that day. comes with 2 sides.. . ---DON'T GET---. . FRIED TROUT PONTCHARTRAIN -- i got this bc of past reviews, but i didnt like it at all. its fried trout topped/stuffed with almonds &amp; crabmeat. outside was oily and inside was very dry and bland.. . SHRIMP PO'BOY -- nothing special. blandddd. only upside is that it was cheap.
