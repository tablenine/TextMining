Chicago's Finest, the second city is first in Pizza! . . For a real pie of a pizza you don't go anywhere but Chicago . . I love the waiting game in Chicago once seated your pizza always takes 30 minutes atleast to arrive (and damn rightfully so if it's authentic)  You watch as Pizzas go by and your stomach starts grumbling, you wish you would have ordered an appetizer and gnaw on your straw, fingernails the table... Then the moment arrives and you are in Pizza bliss (you don't get this feeling in NYC and I've been everywhere to be had there my friends). . You think to yourself an Asian girlfriend is not the ideal partner to knock one of these out and she puts you to shame!  The Pizza's crust is unique and perfect in that Chicago way Flaky and buttery! YUM! The CHEESE! I call it stretch armstrong cheese because you can almost bungee jump with it.  It's wonderful, I love it!  The tomatoes and sauce are great as well I'm not a chunky tomato person  The student beats the teacher 5 stars to 4 stars my friends.  The calamari sucked, but I will not hold that against you Lou! I always say when in Rome.  The only way to work off the huge calorie intake that is a chicago style pizza and enjoy is it (well you know!) . . Chicago locals as an FYI we outside of your fine city have been poisoned with what is marketed as Chicago style pizza from something claiming to be Pizzeria Uno and after eating at the original one I am very confused ... did somebody steal the name?  Because the Pizza there is really good unlike the crap I get here in Virginia and assume the rest of our readers are accustomed to.. . Agree with other reviews about service issues but this did not roll over into the kitchen in my opinion and solely base this on the Pizza.
