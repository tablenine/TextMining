Restaurant: Yeah! Burger
Category: Burgers
Yeah Burger was a refreshing change from the other burger places out there.  So many options for the type of burger, bun, sauce, toppings and sides.  Great choice of beverages to include beer, wine and whiskey.  . I had the veggie burger on white (gluten free white is also available), with pepper jack cheese, lettuce and sunflower spouts, and roasted garlic aioli sauce.  I shared a 50/50 side with my husband.  He ate the bison burger on wheat with pepper jack, lettuce and sunflower spouts, and bacon jam sauce.  We were thoroughly happy and satisfied with the quality of the food and service.  We sat at the bar and interacted with the staff, who were friendly and appeared to enjoy their jobs.  . The facility is clean, several options for seating, bar, tables or outside on the patio.  Free parking in deck with short walk.  . Overall great place to eat, will definitely go back, highly recommend!!
