Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This is by far the BEST Roscoe's in LA, save for Big Momma (who takes her license to clown way too seriously.  She is unprofessional and overbearing. The character is TIRED).  Oh and if you're in a hurry or you just don't feel like waiting in the long line, you can place an order to go in prison or by Telephone.
