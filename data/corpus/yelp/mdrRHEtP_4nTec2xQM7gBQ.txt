A wonderful dinner menu with a variety of offerings including sushi, tacos and filet.  The eclectic menu was terrific.  Appetizers and desserts were amazing including the chicken nachos and the lemon meringue ice box cake.  Had the filet tacos and the steak was one of the best done pieces of meat I've had.  A nice selection of wines or beers to make anyone feel relatively comfortable depending on your fiscal situation.  The service was very good and valet parking is recommended.  . . There is a great atmosphere and though the music is a little loud for my liking, we were in a corner away from the main buzz.  Make sure you have a reservation because you likely won't get in if you don't.
