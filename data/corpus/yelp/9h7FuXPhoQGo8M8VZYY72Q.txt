Restaurant: Seasons 52
Category: American (New)
Um... so I guess Seasons 52 is a good *concept*... just make sure your visit is during the peak of each season.  I love the idea of a season-centric restaurant.  Isn't the point to have fresher ingredients?  Unfortunately, when we visited Seasons 52 it was towards the tail end of summer... but their menu didn't reflect that change.. . We started off our meal wonderfully with a tomato basil flatbread.  We were told that this is what the restaurant is known for.  Which, in hindsight, makes me wish I had only ordered a bunch of flatbreads for dinner that night.. . Entrees were atrocious.  Not even exaggerating.  My family and I ordered various dishes, including the filet mignon, the cedar plank salmon, and the oakgrilled chicken.. . All of the proteins were totally overcooked and dry.  Overcooking a $25 filet mignon is unacceptable.  The chicken was inedible.  All of their supposedly in-season veggies came out undercooked and unseasoned, and because of that, you could taste just how NOT IN SEASON (aka, rubbery and stringy) they were.. . It kind of makes you wonder if Seasons 52 is really paying attention to local markets and farmers and what's truly in season and what's not.  I've been grocery shopping many times in the last few weeks, and have continuously passed by the green beans and asparagus because they don't look fresh and in season.  If I can make that distinction, why can't a nice, pricey establishment like Seasons 52?  . . Think about it.
