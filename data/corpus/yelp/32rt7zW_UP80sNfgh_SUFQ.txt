If you want to sit on the coolest roof top terrace (sans the attitude that other rooftops have) you have got to go now to 5 seasons. The Food is made with a seasonal thoughts, and the beer made with love will be soon available too! I can see the 5 o'clock happy hour is going to to be a ritual experience at 5 Seasons! The view is awesome.
