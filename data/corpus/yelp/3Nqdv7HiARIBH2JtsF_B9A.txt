Restaurant: Feast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Feast was so much fun.  It was bustling, loud and yummy.  Totally made me think the great big city we live in.  The food was good, but our waitress was not so great.  Not super friendly and we ended up waiting on her for long periods to get refills and to pay.  Nevertheless, the atmosphere was great!
