Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I've been going to this restaurant for many many years with my family and I highly recommend this place for a good galbi experience, not out of loyalty to the restaurant (well maybe just a little), but because the service is excellent because it's not so big that the workers will forget to attend to you (pretty common at bigger name korean bbq places *cough* josun *cough*) and the galbi is really yummy. . My dad calls me "galbi-killer" for a reason. I have been to alot of different korean bbq places, so I can tell you that the galbi here is high quality and you can cook it yourself however your heart desires (I personally prefer my meat a little burned :D). If you ever decide to go there be sure to ask them to cook the bones ("bbyuh") for you. As gross as it sounds, the meat off the bones is the best part because it's interspersed with globules of fat and it's chewy because of the cartilage (wow I never realized how disgusting that sounds). But even if you don't feel courageous enough to try my favorite part of the meal, the rest of the aspects of the restaurant should be enough to guarantee you a good dinner experience.
