Wow, we started off with a plate of raw oysters, spicy fries, and beers.... . Then bag of crawfish and shrimp with the original sauce (medium hot) arrived and it was opening xmas presents...  crazy good.. . We also got a 3.5lb lobster, but the meat was a bit over done and very rubbery.  It may have been because my friend ordered it with the garlic sauce, not as good as the original sauce.. . I used to drive down to redondo beach to get my fill of seafood, but I'm so happy to have found a closer place.. . Great tasting food at a reasonable price.
