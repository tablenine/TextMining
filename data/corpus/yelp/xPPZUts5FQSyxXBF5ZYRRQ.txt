Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
You can never go wrong with Roscoe's!  . . The food is always delicious (at all the locations I've been to) and the service has been just as great!  Although their chicken and waffles are FABULOUS and I heart their cornbread, I LOOOOOVE their mac and cheese much more!  Especially with their hot sauce.  YUUUUM-OOO!  I only wish they offered bigger portions of it :(
