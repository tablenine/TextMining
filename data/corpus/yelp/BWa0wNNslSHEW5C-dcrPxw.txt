They are horrible, horrible, horrible!!!  I dont know how a restaurant can lose your credit card and then deny that you ever gave it to them.  The bartender was an ass and the manager was stupid enough to listen to that ass ...who said I never gave him my freaking credit card!!!!!!!! AMAZING!   They didn't really look for it. either..just believed that I never gave it to them.  I had to cancel my card and it was the only credit card I brought on my Chicago trip.    I MEAN COME ON!!  The manager didnt even comp my meal!!!  What kind of high end restaurant is this???
