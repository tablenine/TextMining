Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
The pastrami sandwich was good, but unfortunately not too impressive.  They had great onion rings though, but a bit expensive at $5 for a side.  The pastrami here is thinly sliced, and then they dip it in this sauce.  I have to say that it was solid, but not stunning, like Langers is.  This place is definitely closer to home, but I would still make that trip downtown and get pastrami at Langers.
