Category: Diners
I've only eaten at Fred 62 between the hours of 3am and 7am.  And I've only eaten at Fred 62 while either slightly buzzed or full on drunk off my ass.. . The pancakes, waffles, and french toast dishes are amazing!  I particularly love the french toast with the caramelized mangoes.  *drool*. . It's neat to realize the funny convo you've been hearing from the table behind you is Seth Green and Scarlett Johansson enjoying a late night meal.  Yes, he really is pretty short and pretty funny.  And yes, she is even more gorgeous in person than in the movies.
