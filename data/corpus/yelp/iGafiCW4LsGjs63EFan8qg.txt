I just went to Rosebud tonight for the first time and I definitely will be back for another visit. We dined from the Monday Brunch menu, but the regular dinner entrees looked really good too. I had the tostada special which consisted of sausage, tomatoes, pico, and two poached eggs on top of two deep fried corn tortillas. The tortillas were hard to cut, but the flavors mixed really well together. The sour cream and avocado were good compliments. Also, I had grits topped with cheddar and those were some of the best grits I've had in Atlanta so far. My friend had the chicken and waffles and, yes, I did steal a few bites using this food review as an excuse... The home fries sucked, but the chicken had nice flavor and was moist. Although, I've never had Gladys Knights' version, so I have nothing to compare it to. Overall, the food was pretty good. The service was attentive and the waiter was pretty knowledgeable about the specials and menu. And, the best thing... Yoforia is across the street. No brainer for dessert!
