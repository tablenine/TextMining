Remember 'Nick and Norah's play-list?' were a group of friends are looking for Fluffy and it takes the whole night to finally find them? . Well that's how I felt with Kogi, you never really knew where to find it. . . As soon as I found out about Kogi on yelp, I bookmarked it and made it my mission to get me some asap. You may say why don't you go to "The Alibi Room"? But that is IMO the easy way out, Kogi is Kogi not because you can just get it. What makes it soo Kogi, is that you actually have to go for the 'Kogi Hunt'. Arousing those primitive, hidden, long time forgotten, hunter instincts; "Me hunter, me look for food!" . . Yes, yes, we don't depend in our search for food, on our hunting skills any longer, but we use modern way of communication; text, Internet, cell phone calls and in my case Twitter. . . Kogi Korean BBQ-To-Go is on my Twitter's 'following list' and that's how I am able to know where to go when my 'tribe' is hungry, and I need to bring something to the table. . . Last night was the night to have my first Kogi experience, my Tweetie application informed me that at 10pm the truck would be on 4100 Sunset Blvd. . We made our way and as we approached our destination, a long line had all ready developed itself on the property of the "4100 Bar". As the line moved slowly, but patiently towards the truck, we discussed what to order. In the mean while it's pretty cool to start random conversations with complete strangers, and hear there life story, and level of relationship with Kogi. . As we finally reached the order window, we made our desire known; " One Korean Short Ribs Burrito, One Spicy Pork Burrito and Korean Short Ribs Taco's, please." . . We got back in the car, went home and truly enjoyed our first Kogi experience ever! It tasted GREAT! I guarantee you, that soon we will go for the hunt again.
