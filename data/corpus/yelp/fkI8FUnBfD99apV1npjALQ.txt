I've always heard about the Magic Castle and never in my lifetime did I think I'd be able to visit it! You can only enter the club if you're a member, were invited by a member, or are staying at the Magic Castle Hotel. Or in my case, knew someone who knew someone. :] . . I got to see a few shows, explore the castle, and sit back and soak up the Castle's grandeur.  I felt soo glamorous walking around, too --seeing all the men in suits and ties, all the women in fancy dresses, everyone with drink in hand mingling. It was like one of The Great Gatsby's parties. Historic. Special. Memorable.  . . The only bad thing was a clogged toilet in the women's restroom. It was clogged all night. The toilet rolls weren't refilled either. And they didn't turn on the heater out front either so we just had to chill there while we waited for our valeted car.
