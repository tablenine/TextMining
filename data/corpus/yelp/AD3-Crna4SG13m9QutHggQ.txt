Business lunch meetings are great for several reasons. 1) It's lunch! 2) It's paid for by the company. Yeehaw!. . My most recent venue for tasty food and a little bit of shop talk: Baraonda. I've been meaning to try this place for some time and was glad I got the chance. Hopefully I can make it back again soon since this first visit made me smile.. . I ordered their daily fish special, a grilled tuna steak served with a generous pile of steamed spinach and a slice of tomato dressed in olive oil. Simple, perfectly cooked, delicious. And healthy!
