Restaurant: Fat Cat
Category: Bars
Fat Cat is exactly the kind of go-to place that I'm missing in my neighborhood.. . The short version: Pool, good food, extensive beer list, a bunch of TVs.. . The long version: The food is delicious.  Simple above average quality bar food, with excellent sandwiches, awesome fries and creative appetizer selections.  The beer list is large, and has a number of my favorites.  It's also not too expensive (many craft beers under $5/pint).  There are at least 3 TV's visually accessible from every seat in the place.  There's a pool table in the back (and it has this wonky Jagermeister felt on top).. . I have not yet been here on a weekend so I can't speak to how it feels when crowded.  Nevertheless, Fat Cat possesses just about everything I'm looking for in a neighborhood bar/restaurant.
