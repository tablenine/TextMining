A little pricey, but pretty darn good for a burger joint.  It's got more options than you might have thought of, and they use high quality beef here.. Sure you won't get the atmosphere, grease, or radioactive green relish you might see at "The Weiner Circle"  but this place almost makes the humble burger seem like something a bit more sophisticated.
