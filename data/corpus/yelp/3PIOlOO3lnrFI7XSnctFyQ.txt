Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
If I could give them half stars this place would have 3.5 stars.. . I did not have any expectations from this place prior to my visit.  A friend and I just decided to go there for lunch one day and he wanted to check out this restaurant.  . . Interior: lively yet warm and inviting. . The pizza was well worth it, but a bit on the pricey side.  I had the fennel sausage pizza with red onions and scallions.  Thin crust, light and crispy; however it was slightly burned on the bottom. The mozzarella salad on the other hand was not that great.  Drenched in olive oil, I was too distracted from tasting the mozzarella.  . . Additional plus:  apparently this is a place for celebrity spotting.  Robert Duval was sitting to my right that day.. . I'd go back to this place in the future but I'd have to check out dinner before I would recommend it to anyone though.
