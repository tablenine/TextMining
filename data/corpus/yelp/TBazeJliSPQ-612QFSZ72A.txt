Crawfish are tough little creatures.  If you look at a tank of them. . .they constantly battle each other for a tiny plot of territory, wielding their mighty claws and pulling each others' limbs off.  They are so magnificent, they are also known by two different names.  Due to their cuddly nature,  I kept one as a pet, coddling him and feeding him bits of salmon or halibut.  However, I was young and stupid and did not know that they were NOT fully aquatic.  .so I plunged my little Pinchie in a tank of water, only to find him belly-up the next day.  I only had my dearest Pinchie for six hours. . .but that event scarred me for life.. . Since then, I've refused to eat Po'boys, jambalaya. . .anything Cajun or anything related to them crayfish.  Until yesterday.  I was brave enough to conquer my fears, and wield my mighty stomach against the hard, tough shells of my bright-red little friends drenched in delicious medium-hot cajun seasoning.  Medium is SPICY, and considering it was 98 degrees outside, my eating buddy and I were sweating up a storm with our little bibs on, crunching on meat, slurping on brains (okay, that was only me), and peeling away the tough exteriors of the little critters to reveal the tender meats inside.. . Despite ruining my manicure, I had an amazing time with a pile of crustaceans in a plastic bag in front of me, and with a cold beer by my side.  We ordered 2 lbs of crawfish with 1 lb of shrimp and a side of cajun fries (with two beers, the total came out to be $35.68).  The fries were surprisingly good. . .crisp and minimal on the grease!. . Oh Pinchie.  My dearest, sweet, brave Pinchie. . .who would've known you would be the best meal I've had in a while??
