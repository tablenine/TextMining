Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I love PINKS! I went there this past summer and I still have vivid memories playing in my head! . . My boyfriend and I waited in line for more than an hour but it was worth the wait. I thought we would not find seating but suprisingly, we found seats rather quickly.. . I ordered the BACON CHILI CHEESE DOG and it was yummo! The bacon was crisp. The cheese was meltyyy. The hot dog had a nice bite! It made an excellent combination.. . My boyfriend had one of the written specials. I think it was called the America's Dog since it was so close to Independence Day. It was very filling and that hot dog was HUGE! I was honestly scared of it! . . We went back to San Diego that night, full and satisfied.... . . I was enjoying my vacation but I kept thinking back to that night at Pinks.... . . I couldn't take it no longer so... on the way back home, we waited in line for another hour! . . But it was well worth the wait... Since I'm all the way here in San Jose.
