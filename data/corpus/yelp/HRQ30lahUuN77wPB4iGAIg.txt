In my never-ending quest (I'm a transplant) to try all the local burger hotspots (and any other local institutions for that matter), I finally hit this place with a group of cousins -- no small feat to sit a party of 6 at this place.. . Wow, I'm underwhelmed.  No, let me rephrase that: ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED BURGERS I HAVE EVER HAD.. . You can criticize me for basing this review on the PRICE, and you can tell me that it's a delicious burger, but I'm not paying $20 for a burger and fries.  NO.. . You can make a place upscale, serve expensive beer, give the place that "it" aura, and in the end it's still a piece of meat stuck between two pieces of bread.  No matter what else you put inside with the meat patty, unless you actually put a $20 bill in there with it, I'm not interested in paying that much money for a burger and fries.. . Does the burger taste better than most I've had?  Sure it does.  But this isn't steak -- what I mean by that is that you can have a $5 steak or a $50 steak and there's a difference.  A hamburger can only be so good.. . Sorry to rain on the party...
