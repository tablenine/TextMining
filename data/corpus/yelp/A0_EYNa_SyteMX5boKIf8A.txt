You have been there for me when the assholes at Piece told me to wait two hours because they had a hipster-runway-karaoke-bachelorette-bingo party and couldn't accomodate anymore people. Â Your pizza is so sloppy and when you fold the slices grease peaks out from the top as if to say "hello and welcome home."
