I'm a little torn on this one, too. So to break it down: . . Base = two stars for the fact that . a) I have previously waited a full THREE hours for a table only to give up in the end. Why the hell did I wait that long? That's what beer does to you, I guess. And blind hope.. b) Is it just me or is the security getting a bit tight ass around here? Friends have been reprimanded for not only talking too loud, but also for "standing on the benches" otherwise known as "getting into the booth to sit down". Srsly, lighten up guys. It's a bar. . . That being said, after a few visits to this particular location to give it a fair chance, I'll add stars for the following:. +1 for the killer burger, mushrooms, and sweet potato fries. You win, guys. . +1 for successfully being able to close my eyes and point to any beer on the wall and chances are I haven't had it, and it's still good. If I could marry your tap selection, I'd be happy for life. Or, at least if you add Leffe. Then I'll be happy for life. Half of that star is for the always great bartender service, too. . . One big HUGE honorary star for the awesome collection of yelpers that gathered here last night. Like true ninjas, we scored three tables in a row, and partook in the best of food and drink, cause that's how we do. It takes some strategy, but a perfect night can be had here. . . So overall four stars, F.O. If only it wasn't a complete Mission Impossible strategy meeting to organize any kind of night here, you'd get five.
