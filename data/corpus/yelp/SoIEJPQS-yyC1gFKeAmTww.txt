This place gets way too crowded and if you want to eat, you have to be a Â freaking vulture just waiting for a table to open up. . . They have a lot of beers on tap which, of course, are way overpriced.. . The burgers are good, but not great. I was not impressed. The fries, however, are damn good.. . It's a decent place, but having to spend so much time trying to find a place to sit really kills the fun.
