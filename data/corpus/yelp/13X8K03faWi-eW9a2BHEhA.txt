Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I can't believe the negative reviews for one of LA's best taco stands.  Unless you are expecting a fine dining experience, you can't go wrong with Tito's.  I've only had their tacos w/cheese (about 1,000 times) and have rarely been let down.  A side of guacamole is a must and even an extra small salsa is a good idea.  . . Service is pretty quick if you pick the right line and follow the proper Tito's ordering etiquitte.  Only negatives are parking (not really an issue), cash-only accepted, and they're only open til 10 or 11pm depending on the day.
