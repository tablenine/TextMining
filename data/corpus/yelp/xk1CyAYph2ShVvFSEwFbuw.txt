One sandwich to rule them all and in their tight pants bind them.  . . The Hobbit is the tastiest sandwich ever conceived by man.  Actually, it might be the pinnacle of human achievement. We could pretty much close up shop, say goodbye to the universe, and call it a species. . . I'm the founder of . http://GrubHub.com.  and this is the place that our whole office gets jazzed about when we start thinking about where to order take out.  We order from here about twice a month.  Given that we actually are *THE* experts at delivery, that's saying something.. . Disclosure:  I work at . http://GrubHub.com. .  B Pig advertises with my business. However, this review is my honest opinion and I wasn't paid to write the review.
