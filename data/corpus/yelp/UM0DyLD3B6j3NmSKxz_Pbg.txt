Saw it getting some buzz so decided to try a casual work meeting here last night. Here is the low down:. . Beer Menu: A-  Better than most places but not a Brick Store Pub, etc. No complaints. . Food Quality: A   Great food. I had the burger and it was great, stood out as a quality burger.. . Atmosphere: A  Great place for groups, thoughtful decoration that is good for any kind of meeting; friends, date, business. . Price: this is what brings down the whole experience and yelp STARS. for 2 people - 2 burgers &amp; 2 beers it costs be $44 after tip. That it now your normal watering hole price making it hard to give much more than 3 starts. If the prices were reduced by 25-35% (yes that much) it would be 5 stars
