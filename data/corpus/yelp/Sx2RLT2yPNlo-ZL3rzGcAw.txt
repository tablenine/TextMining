We went here with a large group for a Birthday. The staff did a great job of getting everything right and accommodating separate checks (though they could only accept 4 credit cards per bill, they split our table on to 2 bills for us). . . My food and drinks were all around excellent. This was some of the best sushi I've had, with very unique options. I enjoyed the flaming geisha roll, I think. Everyone got a great meal. . . The decor is a little over-trendy and it's pretty dark inside. I think it would have been better suited for a romantic date than a large celebration - and I can't wait to go back and try it in that capacity. . . Also, if you get on their mailing list you'll know that on Sunday nights you can get 50% off all food with a reservation - awesome because the prices do add up quickly!
