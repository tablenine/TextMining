Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
I decided to hit Fat Matts again after partaking in Kansas City's and St. Louis' finest BBQ over the weekend. I used to think very highly of this place but now i just think its ok. I like the sauce and the rum baked beans but that's about it. The actual BBQ is just ok, i found myself having to dip the meat into the sauce just to enjoy it. Its not too expensive though, decent meal.
