Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
$15 for all you can eat korean bbq meat, i better not hear a complaint! . . if you're smart like my friends and i are (ha!), you will each order something different and then share so you can have a little (ok fine, A LOT) of everything. in terms of service, all they are doing is bringing you more meat and more kimchee (b/c i ask for like buckets of it) so no complaints at all. also, since it's kind of like a tent, it's well ventilated and you don't come out completely smelling like you are on fire -- a definite plus to me especially if you plan on going somewhere else afterwards (very unlikely considering the food coma you will be indubitably be in). you are bbq'ing it yourself, so if you don't like how it's cooked, that is your own fault and by all means, get over it b/c you have endless platters of meat waiting for you.  . . they get very busy so make sure you are willing to wait.
