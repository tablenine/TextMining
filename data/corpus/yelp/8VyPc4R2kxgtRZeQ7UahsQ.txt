Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
My husband and I are huge fans of Mario Batali's NYC restaurants.  We never had to jump through ultra crazy hoops to eat there (only semi-crazy ones), so when Mozza opened I refused to play their little waiting game.  One day, just for fun, I called them the day of and they actually had an opening for 7pm.  Luck, however, was not on our side that evening, as the whole block had a power outage and the restaurant was closed upon arrival.  A few nights later, fate brought Mozza back into our lives, when our neighbor invited us to  hop aboard his one-month wait for a reservation.  It was, as usual, great.  The moral of the story is - relax and let it come to you.
