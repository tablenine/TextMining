All these people that seem to be ragging on this place are obviously coming in with the wrong attitude. The sushi isn't the best sushi I've ever had, but it's very edible. Their specialty drinks are tasty, and the servers are all very friendly.. . We've been several times for happy hour and all the food I've had was good, with the exception of the dengaku tofu. It got soggy and was gross. We went yesterday and I got the vegetable tempura and I'd never seen so much tempura on the plate. It was delicious! And if you go at happy hour, the sushi is an awesome deal for the quality.. . So if you're on the fence about this place, come for a happy hour. Half off rolls and appetizers make it a lot easier to excuse some of the minor flaws this place has.
