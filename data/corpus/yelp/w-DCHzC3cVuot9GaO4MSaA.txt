Restaurant: Radial
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Radial, in my mind, is somewhat over-rated as a brunch spot. Some of the menu items (such as the french toast) are really quite good, but they skimp on bacon and syrup. The service is usually very slow and it's just not worth the wait on the weekends.
