Wait ... are all these five star reviews for real?   The food would be mediocre for an Orange County strip mall.  The secret recipes are probably secret because after one taste, no one wants to replicate them.  . . I give it two stars for decor and because maybe I was there on an off night.  But what an off night it was!  Go there only if (1) you're not paying and you have no positive feelings towards whoever is paying or (2) money is nothing to you.
