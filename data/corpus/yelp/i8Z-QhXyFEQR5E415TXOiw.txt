We've eaten in the restaurant once and gotten delivery a few times now. In-restaurant experience was really awkward - we didn't have a reservation, but we got seated within 5 minutes or so. Buuuut it took at least 15 minutes before anyone came over to take our order. And I dunno the service overall just felt distant.. . First delivery was just stupid, the guy yelled at me because he had been ringing our buzzer for I guess around 15 minutes before deciding to call us. Sorry dude, I know it was raining but I wrote that our buzzer wasn't working in the GrubHub special instructions section. And those instructions were on the receipt!. . Well luckily all of our deliveries after that have been pretty awesome and always come ridiculously quickly. The food is always good and hot. But that in-restaurant experience was just weird.
