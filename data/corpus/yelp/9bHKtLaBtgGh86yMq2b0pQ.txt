I love a good BBQ restaurant.  Atlanta has its fair share.  But this isn't one of them.  . . First, they were out of both pork and ribs when I got there at 8pm on a Friday - and it wasn't like the place was packed.  So I ordered a brisket  plate with baked beans and potato salad and took my seat (the design of the place is that of a Shane's Rib Shack).  . . When the food arrived, I noted that the serving of meat was much smaller than what you would receive at a BBQ2 or Fox Brothers (although the price might be slightly lower).  The brisket had a nice smoke ring, although the smokiness wasn't very evident in the meat itself.  It wasn't chewy, but it wasn't fall-apart tender, either.  A couple slices had thick ribbons of fat within them, which made them difficult to eat.  I was surprised there wasn't a visible rub on the meat, either.  All in all, perfectly acceptable, but I was glad to have sauce nearby (although the tomato-based sauce almost tasted like ketchup).. . The sides were more regrettable.  The beans, while chock full of meat, had a strange bitterness on the back end.  I wanted to like them, because the consistency and spices were right in line with the way I like my beans, but the flavor was too off-putting.  Neither I nor my friend finished them.  The potato salad was better, but it didn't hold together -- it presented as several mayonnaised slices of new potato - and a couple of those slices were crunchy.  I finished it, but mostly because I would have been hungry if I didn't.. . My friend ordered some apple cobbler when he arrived, and we both tried it.  It was the worst thing we had at the restaurant, with a piquant sourness that made us both get more tea before we left to wash the flavor out of our mouth.. . Folks, there are a lot of good BBQ places in this town.  This ain't one of them.
