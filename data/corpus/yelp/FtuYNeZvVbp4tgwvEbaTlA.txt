The desserts i tried was the blue velvet cake and the strawberry shortcake. Shit these things were packed with so much damn sugar i kept having to drink cups and cups of water sorry i can't have milk =/ I'm lactose haha. Well they were very good. The blue velvet was very interesting it was a good change from its usual red velvet counter part. The strawberry shortcake was very good the strawberries were very sweet but just the shortcake had a little too much sugar, but still very good. . . I do need to come back and try the normal food items they looked very good as i saw many people ordering up on them.
