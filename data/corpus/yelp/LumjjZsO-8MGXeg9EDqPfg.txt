McDreamy who? Forget Grey's Anatomy...Buona Terra is the place to be on Thursday nights!. . A big thanks to the prix fixe king, Edward H, for arranging a fabulous meal for myself and 20 other yelpers at Buona Terra.  Many of the other reviews say this already, but the Thursday night deal is so amazing that I'm going to say (write) it again...any appetizer,any entree, and any dessert from the menu for $19.99.  Amazing! . . I'm a pasta lover, but in an attempt to be healthy (bathing suit season is coming up...ahhhh) I went the fish route tonight.  I started with the grilled calamari (delish!), the tilapia special (it was so good that I couldn't help but eat the entire dish), and then for dessert the chocolate pecan tart.  Ok, so maybe the pecan tart wasn't so healthy, but 2 out of 3 isn't bad!. . A group of 20 people is any waiter's nightmare, but Louis did an amazing job of moving the meal along.  Sign me up for next Thursday night!
