This place was ok. I don't think it was as great as everyone exclaims about. They're described as soul-food or southern-food, maybe that's why my pancakes and eggs had a certain taste to them. I was thinking maybe organic. It wasn't bad, just different.. Went here for mother's day, definitely reasonably priced! I'd go back just to try other things.
