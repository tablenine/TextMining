Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Hmmm. I really hate to rain on such a great Yelp parade, but I went here last night, and I have to say that I was totally unimpressed. . . After reading the reviews on Yelp, I was really excited to try out Friendship Chinese. When we entered the restaurant, I was pleased to see how cute and clean the interior looked--cute blue lights over every table, clean white dishes with black napkins. We were really excited. . . We ordered the crab rangoon, as it seemed to be a favorite of Yelpers. I was not a fan--tasted like sour cream fried in huge won ton wrappers. However, I did like the sweet and sour that came with it, and my s/o was happy to eat the remaining 3/4 of the appetiser that I would not. . . We ordered the Peking Duck and the pepper steak. I thought the pepper steak was okay, but the s/o thought it has WAY too much pepper. Neither one of us were huge fans of the duck. . . By the end of the meal, even the cute blue lights were really annoying as they hung at about eye level, obscuring the view of my dining partner. But maybe by that point, I was just being nitpicky. . . All in all, the meal was edible, but with so many superior Chinese restaurants, we couldn't see returning to this one. Sorry Yelpers.
