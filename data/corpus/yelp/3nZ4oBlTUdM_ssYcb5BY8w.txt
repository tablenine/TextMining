macarons were 3 star or less, not enough filling, dry crust... no love from me. presentation &amp; box were cute though, I will give them that!. . the pear tart on the other hand was DIVINE!!!!!!!! moist, super fresh and distinctively pear :) does not have the dry, crunchy crust like a lot of the tarts. Actually all their tarts looked delicious, I would think any of them would meet your foodie expectation :) looking forward to try raspberry chocolate or lemon next time!. . also grabbed a chocolate croissant, not bad at all. I believe they used semi-sweet chocolate chips as filling, just the right amount, not overwhelmingly sweet or chocolaty, not oily either. . . would definitely do sit down brunch/lunch next time... otherwise paying $6 for parking is kinda expensive for a visit like my to-go order :(. . it's very open, airy inside, loved that!!!! and they have baguette sandwiches!!!!!!! sweet, those mini ones though. . downtown people are so lucky to have Bottega Louie around the corner!!!!
