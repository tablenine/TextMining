this was my first restaurant ramen experience and it was pretty legit.  minus the cluttered hallway next to the restroom, the extremely long wait for lunch and tempura that came with my combo, i had a good experience.  i liked how the broth tasted miso soupy.  i'm not totally sold on ramen in a restaurant though, but i think its because im cheap and usually pay less than $1 for ramen.  hopefully ill come around.
