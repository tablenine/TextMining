I'm in love... seriously the greatest breakfast place in all of LA.  I said it, and it's so true - if you think another place is better try this one and you'll be a believer.. I come here often on the weekends and have never waited longer than 20-25 mins for a 2 top.  Sometimes they say it's that long but seat you in 10 mins. If you go with a larger party then yes you will have to wait.   It's worth the wait people so don't let that scare you off. . I love their pancakes, but be forewarned they are HUGE.  Three come on a plate and they are larger than the plate.  Me and a friend go and share a stack of pancakes and only end up eating half!! and we both feel like fat babies.  My favorite is "a time to love" it has cake batter in the pancake batter!!! carmel, butterscotch chips, walnuts (or some kind of nut) and strudel on top!!!  French toast is original and delicious too.  Egg items are super delicious, and they have THE BEST TORTILLA CHIPS of any mexican place hands down they will win.  The burgers are delicious too, and the chili reminds me of home!. The only downer, and i mean the ONLY one is their fries.  They are these big potato-y things that aren't very crispy and crunchy like i prefer but some people really dig these kind i'm just not one of them.  Also they will substitute the chips for fries if you want so it's a win win!!!. Also let me add the staff are like some of the most beautiful people in LA, seriously requirement one for female servers is have a modeling contract or something.  The boys are pretty too!  And the hostess guy is hilarious and a really sweet guy, always remembers my name (1st time i went he thought i was someone from his old neighborhood in Brooklyn).
