Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
One of the FUZZes of LA.. . All I could hear was "OMG, have you been to Stinking Rose" and I would say" Stinking what?". . So, yeah. . . Don't get Â me wrong on the stinky part, I love garlic based foods but I am annoyed overall that people make big deal out of it more than it should be. It has the distinct flavor-smell more surrounded than other restaurants (even though good Italian restaurants always smell yummy garlic) and the name is catchy for the ones who fall for it. You go there, it's a line, you wait endlessly and you sit somewhere that's s*****, cos you have no choice cos lots of people would kill to get your table, and ur date sucks too (on top of everything stinking).. . I got Salmon with garlic flavor, it was good, can't complain on that and the idiot date had steak, he liked it (it was his idea to go anyway).. . Don't wanna sound mean on this, but it's not that special. After all, it's all about the name....
