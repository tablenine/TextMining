This is one of those places that is so junky and greasy it's good.. . I mean come on they have chilli dogs!. . chhiiiillllliiiiii dooooogggggg!!!!!. . 2 hour wait in line???. . True, but come during the week between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. and literally nobody is there.. . You gotta try it a least once though! you won't Â . . . ok maybe will regret it!
