Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I really liked Father's Office.  I'm a big gourmet burger fan and my burger here was one of the best that I had so far in LA.  The atmosphere is really cool, but the only problem that I had is that our table was too dark.  There was no direct light shinning down which made reading the menu a big challenge.
