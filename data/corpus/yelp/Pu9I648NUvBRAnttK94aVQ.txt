Must get the SPICY chicken wings...not just regular wings.  Otherwise it'll taste like tasteless mediocre chicken.  The flavor is in the spice rub mixture!!  Ok so I had to start off with that note so you don't end up ordering the wrong thing.  =)  . . The parking SUCKS!  It's Sawtelle.  Can't expect parking anyways.  So go right when they open.  You'll find plenty of parking in the back.  Otherwise, it's all by luck.  . . Waiting for a table SUCKS.  This place is popular so go when they first open.  No wait.  Fast service.  Otherwise you're looking at a good 30-50 min wait.  . . Order pretty much anything on their menu 'cause it's good.  Portions are not that big.  My favorite is their spicy chicken wings on crack.  We always end up ordering different things on the menu but I must have my crack chicken.  It's similar to Kyo chon chicken.  . . They have different flavor soju cocktail drinks that are pretty strong and good too.  But don't get drunk here because you want to be able to enjoy their food!
