Came here for the sushi this weekend.  Dimly lit, I first thought I was heading into a "gentleman's club" with those long dark halls.. . Had the albacore, tuna taru, a salmon topped roll and the miso with mushrooms.  The albacore dish was freakin tiny, but the tastiest dish I had.  Who knew balsamic vinegar would have gone so well with albacore? The tuna was good, but nothing special.  The salmon roll was disappointing, as it tasted fishy and was not fresh.  I was bummed because I really love anything topped with salmon.  The miso was some of the best I have tasted though(and came in a big bowl).  I had a hard time finishing that up.. . The place was pricey, and the sushi portions are small.  But this isn't one of those places you come for just the food.  If sushi was its only calling card, it probably wouldn't last. You come to snack on sushi, have a drink and enjoy the ambiance.  For that, I would come back.. . NOTE: For those not in the know (like me), be careful parking in the meters right outside the restaurant on the street.  They start towing cars ticketing cars after 6pm, even if you have fed the meter.  As I was parking there, a parking enforcement officer tells me that I can't park there since it is after 6pm (it was 6:15pm, Saturday night).  As I walked out of the parking garage next to the street I saw 3 cars hooked up on tow trucks.  Watch out!
