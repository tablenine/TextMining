Brought a friend here for her bday. It was one of the best experiences that I've had at a japanese restaurant. I'm sure it had nothing to do with the great afternoon/evening views of LA and the great corner seating we got. I think the server thought we were a couple so we got one of the best seats in the house overlooking the whole LA area.  Ok on to the food. We ordered a couple apps and I remember the yellowtail app was the best. It was clean tasting and super fresh. I also ordered two oyster shooters. It was the first time she tried it and she loved it.  We also ordered a couple of their unique teas and they were awsome.  As for the sushi the nigiri was pretty typical but my friend's lobster with risotto was really tasty. The risotto was buttery and the lobster was sweet and fresh. I don't remember what the tab came out to be but it was definitly worth it.
