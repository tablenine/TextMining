We were visiting our uncle and he recommended this restaurant..very very tasty. Â They serve their bread with this whipped butter with honey and chili peppers..what a taste!. . I had the almond crusted halibut, baked and served over jalapeno mashed potatoes and green beans. The special was Watermelon salad..very good indeed.. . My husband had the Bistec a la Cubana...and it was great too.. . Did not have any room for dessert...hopefully next time..
