BOGO Pizza Wednesdays!. . I've lived half a block from Frasca for a couple years now and only recently paid a visit.  The pizza was pretty good and the outdoor patio was nice and relaxing.  The service wasn't great.  Our waitron looked young and didn't really seem to know what she was doing.  . . I guess the seasoned veteran waitrons aren't interested in working on BOGO Pizza Night.  Maybe it has something to do with Chicagoans' take on tipping on specials?  . http://www.yelp.com/to....
