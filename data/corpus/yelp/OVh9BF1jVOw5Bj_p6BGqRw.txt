I'm always happy to see a new spot open up in Logan Square. I was here early on a Saturday and the service was great. The staff was really friendly in a non-TGI Fridays type of way. They had a very comfortable couch that I was able to sit and read a book. The person taking my order said I should try the bottomless house coffee the next time I stopped in. I really like the coffee cups they give you...no logos..and they appear to be larger than Starbucks..that could be in my head. I stopped by New Wave today, and I could swear I was back in college with all of the people working on their laptops. All of the tables were full, and people were stalking for chairs. Seems like the place has really taken off well, especially since there's more room for group work than Starbucks allows (Cali/Logan location).   They seemed to be having issue with their wi-fi, and credit card machine...but all was sorted out in a matter of minutes.  . . Overall, its a nice spot.  I'll be back.
