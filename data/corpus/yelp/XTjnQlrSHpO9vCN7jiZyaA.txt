Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
Me-OOoWWWWWWWWW!!  . . After talking about it for weeks, my fella and constant dining companion and I finally had our night out at Hungry Cat.  I've been several times before, but it was a first time for Dylz.  Having heard about the FAB burger (at a seafood joint... I know) he was very excited.  . . We didn't have a reservation and I"m not going to lie...  we waited a looooooooooong time for a table.  However, our desire to sample the cat and the delightful proximity of amoeba music greatly compensated for the wait.  Translate:  we basically had to rush back the restaurant an hour later because we were having so much fun music shopping. . . Finally seated and ready to eat (STARVING) I started off with an expensive but DELISH hurricane.  Yum.  Who knew this drink could be so classy.  We started to decide what to order...  but then BAM!  we stated running into people we knew!  It was nuts.  Maybe a little odd to judge a place on its client el... but these were some choice folks; Ones we had thought of often but literally hadn't seen in YEARS.  AND THEN we started seeing stars, the young, famous and stylish kind. . . weeeeeeeeeee!!!. . So, after all that, we FINALLY decided to order.  First at egg, avacado and pecorino salad. Highly recommended, it was really really good.  Then, I had the seared black cod w/ coconut rice and Dylan had the Burger (WITH EGG!!!)  Both were outstanding.  The fish was delicate and paired with the rice it was so fragrant and so pretty to look at.  The burger came with a MOUNTAIN of fries. It was gooy, oozy salty, eggy, avacodoy, yummy good.  It was almost worth the price... $18 is a lot for a buger.  . . I would totally go again, any day of the week.  It IS pretty expensive, but super fun and the food is truly outstanding in a town full of mediocre overpriced resturants.
