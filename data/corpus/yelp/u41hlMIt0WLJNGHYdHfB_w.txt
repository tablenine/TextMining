One of my friends brought my wife and I here on a early Sunday afternoon.  Well, it was early when we first got here.  First off the place is extremely busy, and the wait just to get a table was ardous.  Once we finally got sat we waited well over an hour for food.. . The server was charming, despite the wait, and pretty much got us everything we asked for.. . The food was decent.  I had the chicken and waffles... the chicken was dry, and the waffles were a bit too crispy, but they had a great flavor.. . I think during non-peak times this place might have earned a much higher rating from me, but I don't think they can handle their own popularity.
