Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Ok, I have to downgrade Mastro's, due to what has now been two consecutive not-up-to-standads visits. The first three visits were excellent. The last two - good, but not great. . . First, my friend's steak, the bone-in filet,  was supposed to be medium well. Unfortunately, it came well done. There was absolutely no pink in it. We had to send it back. Kudos to our waiter for immediately taking care of it, unlike the waiter I had the previous time. Good, right? Well, not exactly. . . When I started digging into my 22 oz bone-in ribeye, I was happy, as always, with the steak. However, halfway through my steak, I realized that literally, the remaining half was medium well to well done. It was supposed to be medium, but there was barely any pink.  I mean, by that point, I wasn't starving and I realized I'd already eaten half the steak (the good half), so I decided against sending it back.  My point is, I expected some consistency from Mastro's - just an evenly cooked steak for starters - and I didn't get that. . . Fortunately the steaks for the other two individuals in our party of four came out excellently done - another bone-in ribeye and a new york strip. . . One more pet peeve: when you send a steak back at Mastro's, all the sides you had on your plate will go kapoof!  Make sure you ask for them to bring that back.  I felt bad for the chunks of lobster from the lobster mashed that went to waste. . . So, yes, that's it. By now, I've had pretty much everything on the menu at Mastro's. (The fact that my firm has its annual Christmas dinner there in that private room helps).  It's still a very good steakhouse in my book although I'm beginning to question it's consistency when it comes to the cooking of the steaks.  Everything else has always been excellent, though.
