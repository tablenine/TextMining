Ok, this might be a first for me. I'm going to write a review from WITHIN THE PLACE I'M REVIEWING. Oooo! You like that?. . So I was deadset on walking down 10th Street to check out some of the spots at Midtown Place, but my computer was heavy and I was hungry so I decided to pop in Gilbert's. I had heard phenomenal things about their brunch so I figured lunch would likely be pretty good.. . I've been here for an hour (note that they aren't rushing me, just letting me take my own sweet sweet time) and only 2 other people have come in for lunch. This surprises me, because this is a really great lunch spot! The menu offers up about 15 options that you can combine however you like. The price is right, with my meal consisting of soup, a half sandwich, and a generous helping of chicken salad plus a coke coming in right around $10. The chicken salad was great: very flavorful and not overly mayonaissed. The tomato soup was a special today and was also very good and creamy. The mozzarella sandwich was a bit greasy but the ingredients were all very fresh. . . Service has been incredibly friendly and I foresee becoming a regular here in the future. They offer just about everything you could ask for: Wii on Mon, Tues, and Thurs, Karaoke on Wed and Sun, belly dancing on the last Thurs of the month, half price entrees on Mon, DJ on Fri and Sat, drink specials, and wine tastings. Yeah, there's a lot going on here. . . I'm reserving the 4th star for when I return for brunch or nighttime activities. This seems like a great neighborhood spot, and I appreciate it's proximity to mi casa.
