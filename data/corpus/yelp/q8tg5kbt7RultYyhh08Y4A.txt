YUMMERS!!!. This place is so delish!  We came on Labor Day and the wait was gonna be pretty long for parties of 2 or 4 but we were 6 and a table had just opened up about 10 minutes after we got there.  . My sister and I ordered Old world - scrabbled eggs with cheese and mushrooms and it was seasoned really yummy with rosemary and came with rosemary toast.  And we also split the french toast which was fluffy and made perfectly with brioche bread served with berries.  I also ordered the vanilla latte and seriously, it was the best I ever had.  Defiantly coming back here.  Our waitress  and hostess was really nice too.
