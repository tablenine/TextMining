Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
This was my second time coming to Roscoe's.. the firs time we went to another one in LA... I was suprised that there wasn't a wait this time because the last time we came to Roscoe's there was a waitlist to get seated... . . When we first arrived we noticed there was actually Valet for Roscoe's.. but found parking in the front.. it was my friends first time here.. and they had the #1 with the quarter chicken and waffles mix... they liked it a lot... . . I had the Big Momma's special this time.. which was scrambled eggs with onions and cheese... their eggs are the BEST! It tasted so creamy and cheesy... it came with a side of potatoes and gravy which I could've passed up for something else instead.. I also ordered a side of mac n cheese which also could've been better... The service was timely and friendly.. . . If I ever make another trip down here I'll be sure to try something different on the menu..
