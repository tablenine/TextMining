Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
I was with a group of people who wanted a burger. I decided that we should check out the raved about, Kuma's Korner. We got to the restaurant and the hostess told me "2 hours." I laughed and left and decided on Dunlays On The Square instead.. . I have to say I loved the atmosphere the most about Dunlays. It was open, cool, and quiet. I wanted to sit outside but ended up at a booth, no big deal. I glanced for a veggieburger right away and read the description. The veggieburger was described as being made fresh daily with beans, rice, walnuts, soy, and sweet potatoes. This sounded amazing! I ordered the grilled asparagus to go along with it.. . I have to say the burger was a little underwhelming. I ate the whole thing and enjoyed it, but the description just didn't match the taste. It was very bland and "rice-y" despite having walnuts and sweet potatoes in it, which should have given a nice zing to the taste. The grilled asparagus was also insanely salty.. . I liked Dunlays On The Square. Food was OK. Service was fine. Can't say I was blown out of the water though.
