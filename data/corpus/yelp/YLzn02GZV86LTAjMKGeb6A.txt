This review is based on their happy hour. Yardhouse has an awesome happy hour menu and is a good spot to just chill out either at the tables, booth or at the bar. From what I heard this place can get really crowded but this particular night was not that crowded. Service is prompt, food is good, beer is yummy. . . Give it a try, you might like it.
