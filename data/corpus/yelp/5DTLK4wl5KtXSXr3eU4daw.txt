we wanted to get a quick bite on our last day in chicago and came across this dandy little food court.  there are 13 stations, each with freshly made ethnic cuisine.  once you are seated you are given a card.  the card is given to each station you get food from and then give the cashier the card at the end and pay for you meal once you leave.. . w/ so many choices i somehow gravitated to the stir fry station, seeing that i hadn't tried any asian food on the trip.  this was setup like a mongolian bbq in that you pick your veggies and stack em into a bowl and then you pick your protein and style of stir fry at the very end.  you also have a choice between egg noodles or rice.  i ended up choosing sesame ginger sauce w/ chicken and egg noodles.  the sauce and veggies were cooked well but the chicken was a tad bit tough.  the noodles had a real nice bite.. . i kind of wish this type of place was in downtown SF for all us FiDi working folk.  endless combos of food and i'm sure the foodie populace of SF would love it.
