I recently ordered pizza with prosciutto &amp; tomato and a salad from them. I was surprised at the selection of toppings for both. Very fresh and delicious. Even the greek salad tastes different than most. In a good way. I doubt I will order any more pizzas from the other delivery place that I have been using after trying this.. . Keep in mind that at night delivery is an hour.
