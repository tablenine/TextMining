flaunt your money. take in the view. go home.. . Took a date here and the bill made me feel like I should have chosen Red Lobster. I wasn't overly impressed by the food; for almost every dish I kept thinking "I could make this at home... but better." The oyster shooters were delicious though; a great way to start off the meal. In the end, the $150+ tab made me want to cry.. . One thing I did love was the view. From Silverlake to the ocean, Hollywood, Downtown to South Bay.... that in itself garnered the 3 stars. I guess eating in an old, beautiful Japanese building overlooking LA is something to experience. Pretty surreal.
