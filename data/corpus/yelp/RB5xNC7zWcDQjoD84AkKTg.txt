Hi.  . . I'm Sue.  . . And I am a noodle-holic.. . "HI SUE...". . Yes, that's right people.  I am a noodle whore. . . I love every type of noodle...whether it's fancy italian pasta to a 39 cent package of wannabe ramen from Vons, I'll blissfully eat them all.. . Not to say that I don't have a discriminate palate.  In fact quite the opposite...it's just that I'm a realist.  I'm not going to expect my cup o' noodles to taste like the real thing.  . . But I absolutely love this place!  I come here for lunch, and I love that you can choose how soft your noodles are, how strong the broth is, and how oily you'd like your soup.  Strong, soft, and extra oily...that's how i like 'em!!  . . On top of that, you can add things to top it with (like shredded seaweed) so you are not at the mercy of the cook.   . . the only thing I wasn't fond of is all the yelling by the waiters/cooks.  I know this is meant to make it more like an authentic japanese place, but the place ain't that big, so they're pretty much in your ear when they shout.  I've had many a conversation interrupted this way.. . *slurp slurp!!*. . 'nuff said.
