i heard of this place while watching an episode of "man vs.food." so my boyfriend and i were very curious about it. we're always in chinatown so when we found out this place was within the heart of chinatown we were ecstatic. the place is ALWAYS packed. we came here on a late afternoon on saturday thinking the lunch rush had passed, but it never does. at least for philippes! this place is popping very hour all week. they have multiple lines but even that doesn't seem to help the growing lines. we probably waiting for maybe 15-20 minutes to order but our food came out right when we ordered it. ( they  make the sandwiches right in front of you) which is awesome because  it makes you even more hungry just watching them make it. the prices are insanely cheap! i think it was 1-2 dollars per side and about 5 for the sandwich. my boyfriend and i ordered the lamb and beef sandwiches (both single dipped) with a side of macaroni and potato salad with two drinks. i was a bit disheartened when i saw how small the sandwiches are ( they look a lot bigger in the photos and television) but that was okay. the sandwiches are really good! i think the lamb was a bit gamey but i enjoyed the beef. they also have their own blend of hot mustard and fair warning, it's hot. it definitely cleared my sinuses, and i only put a drop of mustard. that's how strong it was. overall, yummy eats for the person who's in need of a sandwich!
