went on a Tuesday night for the Flosstradamus DJ set.. . Very nice decor, very night ambiance, etc.. Good crowd (not completely empty) for a tuesday, i can imagine this place gets packed on the weekends.  I'll have to check it out then sometime.. . Cover was 10 bucks on a tuesday, i heard it goes up to 20 bucks on the weekends/wednesdays.. . If you have a lot of money, this is probably a great place to go and spend a very chill night out with some other urban people, but you definitely need to be willing to spend money.  Drinks are decently priced but food is expensive, there's a cover to get in, valet is expensive, etc.. . Still, one of the nicer, cleaner clubs in ATL.
