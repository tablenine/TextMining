This was a great meal. But for $320 after tax and tip for two, I wish that things were a bit more polished.. . First of all, an e-mail and voicemail to the place went unanswered, with a call the day before confirming my reservation. I was wary about this place just from that. . . Service was just OK. Our server spoke softly and with an accent, and I didn't catch 25% of what he said to us, but just nodded instead of making an issue of it. . . But, the food was really great. The 5 course tasting was more like a 7 course tasting with a couple amuse's and little extras thrown in, and I added the cheese tasting (that the server had nooo idead about but the reservationist mentioned to me). . . The standouts: the ravioli with an egg yolk in it and oxtail. The pierogi with my tenderloin of beef. the hamachi, served raw in a sweet potatoe broth. The let downs: the chocolate cake. The rest was pretty OK.
