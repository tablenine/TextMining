I am not a hard person to please.  However, when I am paying for service, I expect the following to occur:. . a)  Acknowledge my presence promptly - say within a few minutes.  Don't just show up after we've been sitting there for nearly 15 minutes being COMPLETELY ignored, and then say "you know what you want to order?"  At the very least, be apologetic about the fact that you kept us waiting for so long.. . b)  When a customer orders coffee, bring it promptly.  Don't walk past their table three times with a pot without stopping and filling it the first time.  Also, come back and refill it from time to time.. . c)  When a customer's order is wrong, you should notice this before you bring the food to the table - not just plop the plates down along with the check and leave.. . d)  When a customer has a coupon that is valid on the current date, find a way for them to redeem it.  If you dont know how to ring it up, find a manager or somebody who does.. . e)  Smile at least once.. . I now understand why this place has such a bad reputation for service.  It was atrocious.  I might be convinced to come back on a weeknight when they're not busy, but never again on a weekend.  It was the worst, and the closest I have been in a long time to ditching the check &amp; stiffing the server on a tip.  (She was lucky that Dave was tipping instead of me.)
