Very expensive. It cost $35 for my wife and I. We just ordered 1 grilled chicken sandwich, 1 open faced chili burger, we split a portion of fries and 2 sodas. We could get the same across the road in Carl's Jr for $20 less! . . It tasted pretty good, but at that price I'd rather eat somewhere else. . . They take cash only!
