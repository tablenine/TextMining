this is yet another artsy, funky and tasty breakfast place which is apparently wildly popular. it doesnt look much from the outside, but its definitely a jewel inside. you even have a great view of oakland cemetery, which is surprisingly beautiful, and calming... . i really enjoyed the brisket, which is shredded beef in a spicy broth with poached eggs and toasted baguette - every item in this dish is delicious! no kidding.. another delicious item is the daily omelet special . the only thing is they dont have a lot of seats available so there might be a line during peak hours on weekends . definitely worth a visit!!!
