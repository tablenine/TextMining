coxinha was excellent like diamonds are forever. ($$). . ordered the rafaels pasta which was freaking disgusting. chef bouyardii does better than that. . . so i sent that crap back and got a steak which was superb beyond all expectations. my company ordered the chicken stroganoff which was just as excellent.. . good job ! keep it up and take that nasty pasta off the menu, it is a fly on your fruit.. . 3.85551 stars for the otherwise exorbitant prices.
