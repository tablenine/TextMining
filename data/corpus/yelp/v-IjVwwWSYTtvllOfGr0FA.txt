Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I give it half a star!. My family loves pizza! But this particular one... Is still sitting on the table after 2 days! I don't get it!!! . . I thought the wait would be worth it! this is plain crazy. It was so tough (not crispy) the thick crust was half cooked! Yes! half cooked! So it was like eating uncooked dough! . . It's just unbelievable how people can fall into a hype and actually THINK it's good just because SOME people think and say that it is! . . We spent $50, when we could have spent around $25-$30 Â we c ould have ordered regular pizza and it would have been delivered to our door! . . A frozen CPK would have been so much better! Or even Little Ceasars!!! I was dreaming of that while I was taking a bite on Casa Bianca's pizza. And Little Ceasars pizza is just $5 people!. . I saw RAY ROMANO's picture on the wall! Seriously, Ray must have been JOKING when he wrote finally good pizza on his photo with the owners! Cause you know, er that's what he does for a living? So DON'T believe what comedians say about the food in a restaurant okay???. . Lots of hipsters there! But they were probably stoned, so they'd eat anything anyways! There's not a lot of open restaurants on the block! Except for Tommy's! Gosh we could have just bought Tommy's! And for $50! that's a lot of good old fashioned soggy chili burgers! And it would have been so much better than CASA BAINCA's pizza!
