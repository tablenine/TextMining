Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Okay so after a quick flight from San Francisco my family wad totally stoked over seeing me and they asked if I was hungry and I said hell yeah!! So they were like want tacos? So we stopped here. They SWORE by this place. It was so packed with no seats, so we had to eat in the car and take it to go. The to go tacos came in a box. Okay the box looked like a dozen of donuts box but inside lay a dozen tacos! Loaded with cheddar cheese and shredded beef cooked to perfection. The salsa was tasty and had a bite to it. It was REALLY REALLY GOOD! New LA fave I had two and was satisfied.
