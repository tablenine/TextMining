Went for brunch last Sunday and left a happy camper. We split the smoked salmon with goat cheese - which I literally haven't stopped thinking about since then - it really is as good as they waiter/ress tells you (and believe me our waitress recommended we order half the menu for the two of us, slightly overkill? I think so...)! . . I had the quiche with mushrooms, bacon, spinach and tomatoes and it was solid quiche, but I would probably get the smoked salmon as my meal next time :)
