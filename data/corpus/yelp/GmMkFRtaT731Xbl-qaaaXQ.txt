This is the best vegan food ive ever had. Unique- innovative- fresh- i could go on and on! It's a tad pricey yes, but everything is very high quality. . I started with the Miso soup . it was not a traditional miso but very filling and tasty. I then had the BBQ salad- AMAZING! Made with fresh peas and marinated tofu this is my new favorite salad in LA. My friend got the MexiCali salad which I will be ordering the next time i go to RFD- so good!. . For dessert we split the caramel apple cake. HOW DO THEY MAKE THIS TASTE SO GOOD!!! better than any dessert ive had in a "regular" Â restaurant these days. . . cant wait to go back and bring my non-vegetarian husband!
