What more can I say...hands down my favorite place to go, although I don't go nearly enough as I should.  The crepes are yummy.  My favorite is the chicken curry crepe.  Sooooooo good.  I have tried others, but nothing beats this one.  I really like that you can "create" your own ingredients crepe.  The dessert crepes must be tried too, they are all delicious.  Yea they are a little pricey, but this place really makes you feel Frenchy in so many ways.  Nice staff, friendly and flirty always.  The back patio outside is nice with just a dab of  romantique, but can get pretty crowded if you go in the evening.  Wish this place was open on Mondays.  Crepes like no other in the city.  Are there even any crepe places in the city other than La Creperie?
