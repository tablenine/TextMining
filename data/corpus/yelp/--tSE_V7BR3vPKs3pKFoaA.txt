there was a lot of hype about this place, i was disappointed. . . when i first got there, the line was pretty long. i decided to take a peak at the menu to see my options, i get the nastiest look from theses random people thinking i was going to cut (relax buddy, your short rib ain't going anywhere)..  also notice they charge 2 dollar for a coke or any type of drinks. during an economic crisis, you think they would lower it for the working people. i guess not.. . so we wait in line for about 15 mins, its not that bad cause you get your food like 5 mins after you order it. (you see my two star rating, thats where the first star is going towards)  ordered a spicy pork taco and short rib burrito. . . tried the taco first, it was pretty bombskis. well marinated with just the right amount of spice. ( i had to give it two more stars ) next is the burrito. first bite, no meat, second bite, a little meat, third bite a little meat and so on. plain with no meat, had to subtract a star.  if there was a all meat burrito option, i would defiantly do it .. . so basically buy only tacos, bring your drinks and if you live in san gabriel, the drive is going to be really long.
