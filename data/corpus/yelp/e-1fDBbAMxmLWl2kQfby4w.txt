Unless you're an Andrew Zimmerman disciple, think twice if you're considering ordering from the "Wild things" menu! We were feeling adventurous and decided to try the quail.  Out of all the options there (boar, frog, chicken feet), quail definitely seemed the tamest.  Well I guess quails are anorexic because this little chickee was all bone.  I could have literally scraped off all the meat and fit it in a spoon.  The taste was also gag inducing.  Don't do it. . . The rest of the food is good! I'm especially a fan of the Thai Papaya Salad.  The only downside to this place is the noise---it really does get cafeteria-noisy in this place, and we had to yell at each other from across the table.
