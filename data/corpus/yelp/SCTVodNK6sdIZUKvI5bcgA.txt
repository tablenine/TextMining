Yum! Had the veggie sandwich which was grilled veggies on ciabatta with aioli. It came with a side salad of your choosing. I got the baby spinach, hazelnut and goat cheese salad and it was possibly the best salad I've ever had. Then, I had to try the lemon cupcake. It was a little too big(which leads to a dry top), but was otherwise perfect.
