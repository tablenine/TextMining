Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
After a good depressing movie a burger seems fit...right?  And right around the corner from the Century Landmark is the Counter.  Ok...blah blah new chain, blah...hamburger,blah.  However, not blah here!. . I actually liked this place...a lot.  The look of it inside and out seems no nonsense and unfussy.  The menu too was easy once you decide on your toppings (albeit I think there could be at least a million different combos).  I didn't order anything that was extra on the burger which kept my burger right in price with a standard bar and grill $9.25.   I think that is quite reasonable especially when everything was SO fresh and tasty.. . More suggested combinations would be welcomed more so for those challenged with unlimited options. The staff, was very friendly and all didn't seem a day older than a college freshman at Depaul.. . The most complicated event to happen while we were there was the staff trying to seat a table of nine.  It was like playing chinese checkers...lol.  They asked us to move and comp'd our apps for it...no problem, we'll gladly move.  . . Our food came out super fast.  I recommend sharing the appetizers to go with the dinner.  Might save everyone a couple bucks.  I will go back.  the food was great the service was friendly and inviting.   . . Oh and also people, this is on the North side of Diversey, which is technically Lakeview.  Stop expanding Lincoln Park...PLEASE!!!!
