Can the owner, staff and interior be any cuter??  . This place has a wide variety of breakfast delights-- lots of yummy egg- omelets, Benedict..all sorts of goodies here!!  . Refills of coffee a plenty here!  If you are looking for an old school breakfast diner with great service and fun atmosphere, this is the place!!
