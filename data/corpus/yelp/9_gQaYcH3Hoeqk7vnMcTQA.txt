My friend and I stopped by at Fox Grills for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Upon arriving, we were taken aback by the huge line of people waiting to be seated. I immediately thought "Dang, this place must have some seriously good food or something.." We had to wait to get seated for what felt like FOREVER. I ordered a burger which tasted alright. It is a tiny bit more upscale than your regular sports grill / bar, but I prefer good ol' Taco Mac than this place.
