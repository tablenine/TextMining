lives up to the hype. obviously-- this doesn't replace eating at an actual korean bbq restaurant. it's not even really the same at all. but it is a cool new take on a taco truck. it is fun chasing the truck around and i admire their incredibly adept use of twitter. kogi is food plus adventure. i went for the beef tacos and they were good but oddly-- the tofu taco really shined for me. the people running the show were very friendly and gave us a little tapa as a consolation since they ended up being about 40 mins late to arrive in eagle rock. overall a good experience and i will go again.
