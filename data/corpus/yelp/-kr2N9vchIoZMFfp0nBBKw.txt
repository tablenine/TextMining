Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Whew. Sunday afternoon, the day after EDC. Must eat after all the dancing and hangovers... Must try the famous Pink's in LA!. . My friend and I parked about a block away from Pink's Hot Dogs. It wasn't actually that hard to find parking at all. We totally expected the long line, so it wasn't a big deal to us. It actually went by pretty fast since we were reminiscing about our night at EDC :D But anyways, we took one of the paper menus in the front and went back in line to decide which hot dog to order. It was actually REALLY hard to pick a hot dog, because all of them sounded so good!. . I ended up ordering the Martha Stewart dog (10" hot dog, bacon, sauerkraut, sour cream, diced tomatoes, and relish [there might be more but I can't remember]). It was SUPER GOOD! You know a hot dog is good when the hot dog snaps off when you bite it. All the toppings made the hot dog even better as well. You MUST try the Martha Stewart dog!. . One less star because of the ridiculous long line. But if you're visiting LA, you must try this famous hot dog stand. It'll be worth the wait!
