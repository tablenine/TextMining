i love good food, it doesn't have to be expensive to be good. but when its cheap and good. then i'm a fan!  i'm a roach coach fan. where in the middle of the night i have my authentic mexican tacos run to the dark parts of l.a. for them. kogi is definitely a smart and creative idea. korean tacos? crazy new trend. it has a delightful/different taste. so after hearing about all the rave about this place, i had to go. i found out they are in rosemead on sat from 5-9pm. one sat, i passed by thinking i was going to get some tacos, but man, was i surprised at the disgusting line. that was very discouraging to see a line of people wrapped around that hotel's parking lot (the glendon).  so the next week, i came back and finally gave them a shot on a super rainy sat when the line was a lot shorter (smart people rather stay dry, than stand in pouring rain with no cover!) the sad part was they ran out of galbi so all they had was chicken and pork. i tried both in tacos and burrito version. yes, i am now fan but i do think it is pricey for what your getting. tacos are $2 and burritos are $5 (correct me if i'm wrong) i also got a chance to speak to the people working and the owner has 5 trucks now! apparently they have diff destinations. i wish the line wasn't so long. but i will go back. still need to try the galbi which is most people's fav.
