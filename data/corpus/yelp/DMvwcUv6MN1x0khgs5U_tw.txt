I went here for a private party of 11 the room was booked for 25, instead of having to choose courses, they served us all the courses on the menu!!! And every course had a wine pairing, I forget the end of the night, but the food was off the chain, the atmosphere was perfect, everything was perfect, I felt like a KING!!!!!!!
