Three words: Americanized Chinese Food. . Dont see a lot of places that serves Chinese Buns here in US unless you're in chinatown. So this place is a good place for me when i have some asian food cravings. . . The menu could be surprisingly overwhelming. And going up to the seating area at the 2nd floor is like a long walk of shame with your food. lol. . I would say the price is moderate but it would add up fairly quickly as one or two buns would not fill my hungry stomach. You could definitely get cheaper buns in chinatown. . . I think the buns are too heavy in dough and light on the delicious fillings. I actually find the pad tai salad delicious, if only the portion is bigger. . . So this is not really a place for authentic delicious food but it would still do for me. And I would say this is a snack place rather than a lunch/dinner place.
