We got there around 4pm on a Friday.  There were many people, but it was not super packed.  . . J had a roast beef cheddar panini and lemonade, while I had an iced coffee.  J liked his sandwich.  The small iced coffee had be wired all night.  It was quite strong and did help with the GMAT studying.  . . For dessert, J and I quite liked their double chocolate Godiva cake.  It was super rich and chocolaty, but a bit too cold and solid in the middle.  It probably needed to stay at room temperature for a bit longer.  . . This place also looks very eclectic and cool.  Definitely a great place to go with friends.
