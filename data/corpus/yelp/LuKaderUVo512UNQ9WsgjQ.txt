Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Casa Bianca is a nice family restaurant inundated with hipsters.  I would actually consider that to be a good thing.  It's a nice contrast.  . . The pizza is gooey and delicious.  The service is ok.  Everyone working there is so very rushed.. . I would recommend a couple things to get the most out of your visit, because the place is definitely worth it:. . 1.  There is usually a long wait so leave your name and take a to-go menu.. . 2.  With menu in hand, walk half a block to the Black Boar, a really cool chalet-looking pub with stiff drinks.  Order said stiff drink to open up your appetite as you and your party decide on your pizzas, calzones, etc.. . 3.  Periodically send one member of your party (alternate for fairness) to check status at Casa Bianca.  Continue "opening up your appetite" one drink at a time until your table's ready.. . 4.  Order your drinks and pizza the moment you see your waitress.  It's a crapshoot as to when you'll see her again so you need to nail down your order right away.  And order pitchers.  Generally speaking, if you assume you will never see your waitress again and order accordingly, you will be pleased with your experience.  . . 5.  Once your pizza pie comes, resist all temptation to sink your teeth into it right away.  It will likely be boiling hot, and after the first bite, your burned mouth will not be able to distinguish exactly how good and tasty their pizza really is.  I'd recommend doing your best to not look at the delicious-looking pizza, gulp down another glass, and stimulate some good conversation to keep yourself distracted for at least a minute or two.. . 6.   Enjoy!
