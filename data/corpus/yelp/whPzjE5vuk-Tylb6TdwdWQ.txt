This is my go-to restaurant when I want a fresh, quick, healthy meal. I don't think I can count how many times I've eaten here, and I keep going back.. . I love the Bo Bia fresh rolls, the vegetarian pho, and the tofu sandwich. The mako salad is supposed to be very good as well.. . I had to wait a bit one time and got the mix of lemonade and beer drink that they serve, and it was suprisingly tasty as well.
