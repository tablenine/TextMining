Mea A.:. Thanks so much for an excellent detailed review!. Because of your review, I (literally) printed it out and took it with me so I could know what to order.  I feel pretty comfortable with cuisine of the western hemisphere but (though I like it) am totally clueless when it comes to Asian food.. The ambiance is neat (we sat at the bar) and the people are extremely helpful and welcoming.  My wife had already eaten beforehand (see other reviews from last night) so she just had a glass of wine whilst I ate my ass off (not literally).  I also liked that they had one of my favorite white wines (from Galicia) so I could have it with seafood, as I usually do, but just prepared a completely different way.  Apparently they also have another restaurant that serves Thai or Vietnamese food (which plays more to my spouse's taste) so we'll try it as well.
