For me, Craft was great. The service is exceptional. We did the DineLA menu, with the hazelnut salad and charcuterie to start, the rib eye and prawns for our main entrees, and a chocolate peanut tart and apple/pear cobbler for dessert. Actually we also had a mini chocolate cake that they brought me for it being my birthday, as well as a complimentary plate of their fresh beignets. So 4 desserts total! I was in heaven. . . Our main entree was slow in coming out, so I think they forgot about us, so 1 star off. They brought us more bread as a result. But everything else about the meal was spectacular. The rib eye was cooked perfectly, the prawns were big and juicy and the side of root vegetables went well with the meal. Also got a banana nut muffin to take home after the meal. I have to say I enjoyed it.
