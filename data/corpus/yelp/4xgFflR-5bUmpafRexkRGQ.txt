Go on Sundays from 11am-4pm.   You get to try real Thai street food.  It is soooo good.  I am use to the Southeast Asian flavors.  I especially love how they give you an array of marinated peppers, hot sauce.. all made in house, I bet.  When you go on Sundays, it's mostly Thai people.  I really love their pork noodle thing with all kinds of pork parts, and their papaya salad (soooo spicy)!  5 stars is for the special Sunday menu.  I cannot vouch for their regular or sushi menu.
