The first time I came here I ordered an omelet and chose a cinnamon roll as a side.  Little did I know that a "side" of cinnamon roll was actually two cinnamon rolls stuck together.  Also, little did I know, that these were to be the best cinnamon rolls I had ever eaten.  I don't remember that omelet, although I'm sure it was fine, because after eating the cinnamon rolls I didn't have any room for it.  We had a fantastic server here as well.  I can't wait to come back many, many, many times.
