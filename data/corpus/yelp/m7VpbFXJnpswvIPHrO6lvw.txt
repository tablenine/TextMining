OMG! This is going to be my new favorite hangout. . . My friend and I showed up last night for happy hour. Martini's are $5!!!! Such an awesome deal!! :D We had an appletini and a raspberry martini. They were super YUMMY and strong. . . Unlike other places, the bartenders here were super courteous! :) Â I've been to places were they act like complete douches... but not here! The bartender near the door was really nice when I kept asking him about a super yummy looking martini he was making (its a chocolate martini btw.. which i will make sure to try next time :) ). . Theres a random mix of ppl here, college kids, working professionals and an older crowd. . . Overall, coming here was an awesome experience, nice music, nice atmosphere, great happy hour (5:30-7:30 everyday), nice and hot bartenders and yummy drinks! :) . . Next time I'm here, I will try the "starf*cker" and the chocolate martini.
