Restaurant: Santullo&#39;s Eatery
Category: Pizza
i'm no expert on new york style pizza.  but when i'm in the mood, low on dough and in the hood, santullos is one of my faves.   especially during happy hour-i think 4-6pm when you can get a slice for $2.  and one slice is plenty, because they are massive.  the sausage is by far my favorite.  they also have sandwiches &amp; salads, which are pretty much ok, some of the other pizza flavors also don't impress me too much, so i pretty much stick with the sausage.  they have a good selection of soft drinks &amp; waters as well as cheap red &amp; white wine (which they pour generously italian style) and a couple of decent beers on draft &amp; in the bottle.  plenty of room, good people watching, and always good punk music playing loudly.  i'm  happy santullos is there for me.  cause sometimes if i'm at the map room, i order a whole one which is enough to feed a small beer drinking army.
