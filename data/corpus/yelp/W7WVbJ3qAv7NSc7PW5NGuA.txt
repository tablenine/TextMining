Being allergic to dairy I share a common bond with the Vegans in the sense that I cannot have butter, milk, cheese, casein, whey or ANY dairy proteins in my food...now on the meat part I may get spray painted but nonetheless, Cafe Sunflower has solved the mystery of making food sans dairy, eggs, meat, flowers with feelings (j/k y'all) without compromising taste whatsoever.  The eggplant lasagna is such an exotic vacation from all of the "non-dairy" pizzas and other Italian dishes you may find at Whole Foods; you can't even tell that there's no cheese it in at all!  But oh the best part...what I wake up everyday for...is their peanut butter pie.  I don't know what they have done to make it so scrumptious, so creamy and fluffy, I don't know if there is a secret pact with the devil but I don't care!  It even fooled my meat-and-cheese-only husband when he said, "You can't eat this!  It has dairy in it!"  When I had my son, the only request I had was that someone bring me a few slices of that fluffy, peanut buttery love inside a chocolate hug and we lived off of that for four days...best time of my life.  Babies AND peanut butter pie!
