It's been a while since we stopped in here, but as usual, it feels like you are joining a private family gathering (of the Mexican kind) whenever we do. Beyond family friendly, our 3 year-old and 9 month-old both fit in perfectly with the non-gringo kids. The food is good, though not amazing. I've had both the carne asada plate (a tad dry) and the enchiladas - also a bit dry. The beans are awesome, though. I'd skip the shrimp cocktail. Seemed like previously frozen shrimp, not a lot of flavor. They do provide hot sauce and ketchup and limes to doctor it up, but the quality of the shrimp just doesn't cut it. I'm sure we'll be back. Lots more to sample on the menu.
