Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
my favoritest place to get breakfast in LA, the griddle's menu is perfect for my unsophisticated palate - yes, it's that of a five-year old.  it's no wonder i love the french toast encrusted in oreo cookies (i am salivating just thinking about it) peanut butter cap'n crunch.  pancakes are huge (like spilling over the platter, HUGE) and just as packed with sugary goodness.. . portions are GINORMOUS so i usually split a savory plate and a sweet plate with a friend.  the menu is not your generic omelettes and bacon like at other brunch-y places (ie. toast, quality).  yes, there is usually a wait, but it is well worth it.. . we generally go for a hike at runyun in the mornings (to compensate for all the calories we would be consuming) before heading over in our sweats (nobody gives a crap what you look like because they've all just come over from the gym).. . parking is free and available in the rite-aid lot next door.
