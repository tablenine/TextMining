ugo has a great nifty idea if you have a lot of time on your hands to try different kinds of wine.  you get a card, insert it into the machine, and press the button for the wine that your heart desires.. . too bad we choose wines that were 3.27 an ounce leaving me thinking "that's it???". . the best choice was the pinot grigio.  the ambiance was very pleasant though.  their wine selection is stocked with a multitude of red wines, so visit ugo if you're a cabernet lover.
