Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Eat It OR Beat It?. **BEAT IT!!**. . With all due respect, a friend of mine told me to try this place because it was the "Pink's" version of tacos. First of all, Pink's is much tastier than this place and quite frankly more edible. Tito's Tacos has to be one of the worst tacos I have EVER eaten and I am not being unreasonable. I have consulted with my Latin friends, especially my Mexican friends and they all laughed when I used the Pink's analogy and I couldn't agree any more!. . Beef &amp; Chicken Tacos:. Lacks in flavor and overpowering with cheese. Meat was dry and I felt like the meat was used from the previous day, true or not, that's just my experience on that particular day. The tacos simply were horrendous. The salsa was so watered down that I couldn't taste anything besides watered down tomatoes. Sad to say it, but Taco Bell and Del Taco had more flavor than Tito's tacos.. . First of all, real Mexican tacos are not crunchy, and if you want really good Mexican tacos, you go to those dollar trucks or any other place that has soft corn tortillas and not crunchy tacos! . . CONCLUSION:. Avoid at all costs, honestly.
