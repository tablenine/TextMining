strange that i have never updated my review since i've been there many many times since then!! . . PUPUSAS!!!  that's what you go to Gloria's for.  all of them are good; i prefer the pork&amp;cheese.  lot the cabbage slaw you eat with it. . . the sopa de 7 mares is wonderful.  the broth and plentiful seafood...Mmm.... . my favorite: carne adobado !!!  =). . i've even ordered takeout before.  they pack everything nicely for you. . oh how i miss gloria's since i moved..  go eat some pupusas for me!!
