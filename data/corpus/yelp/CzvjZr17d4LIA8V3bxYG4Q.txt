The perfect date spot.  Romantic fireplace inside for those cold winter afternoons.  Or a nice table outside for those cool summer evenings.  Awesome burgers, decent drinks, average service.  I would rate Moody's a bit higher if not for an incident involving a rude manager.  That one bad experience was an exception, as I've been there many times before and since, but I still can't find myself to go higher than a three.  I guess I'd just advise people not too get too rowdy or loud, heh.  Oh and they have THE BEST sangria in town.
