Pretty decent for all you can eat meat at $17. I wouldn't go there for a date or a small dinner but great for a big group to go party. Your meal comes with a bottle of shoju or beer. I don't remember how the night ended but it was a good time. I'd recommend it but don't think you're going to find food to write home about.
