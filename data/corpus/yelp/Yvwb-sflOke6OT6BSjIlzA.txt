Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Seriously this was just a good one time experience type thing. I mean the hotdogs were ok and gigantic and fattening and good, but 1 hr. and 30 mins isn't exactly worth it. Take friends when you come here to make the time go quicker, but expect to stand in line for a while and expect to gain like 5 lbs on just one hot dog meal..haha or maybe 3? But it's pretty greasy.
