I've only had Haru Ulala as izakayas (japanese tapas) go, so I didn't mind coming out here for a meal.   The place is cozy so if you have a huge entourage, just book the whole restaurant and close it to the public.. . here's the quick rundown. -beef tataki (rare beef): good. . -yakitori (bbq chicken skewer): good. . -sanma (pike):  i find pike too boney for my convenience.. . -the FuRaiBo salad: gross old and cold teriyaki chicken thrown amongst some cheap lettuce leaf is not my kind of salad. . -The buta-kakuni (roasted black pork): very good. -skewers of charcoal grilled chicken: very good. . -agedashi tofu: chinese fried tofu is better.  for $5 it kinda breaks my heart since I know that tofu costs 99 cents for a brick at the market. . -chicken wings: second to the K-town ones.. . I had a large house sake.  Good.. . Verdict?  Good but not special.. . see pics
