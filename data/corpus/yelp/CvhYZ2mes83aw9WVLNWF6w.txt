So they do have a free lot to park in the back...on a Saturday around 8 i had no problem finding a spot. . hot mustard: got a kick and it's excellent. potato salad: pretty good but nothing special. beef french dip: not as moist as the pork but also good. pork french dip: melts in ur mouth delicious!!! so good i ordered another...warm and moist and omg it's s0o0o good. . ambiance: got character...lots of knick knacks...run down but it's part of the charm . service: hit or miss depending on the cashier u get...all the cashiers look like they stepped back in time . food: amazing!!!
