Really fantastic fusion restaurant in Lakeview.  The servers are the cutest men on the planet and so congenial and helpful.  There is nothing bad or boring on this menu and there are tons of options for those who don't eat meat.  It's BYOB (hooray) w/no corking fee.  Sit outside on the sidewalk or inside in the smallish space--you'll also have an adventure if you need to use the ladies room (it's through the kitchen).  I highly recommend the fish tacos, the tuna tartar, and the mango entree.
