Interesting set-up. Modern interior. . . The building looks like it used be someone's house, very unassuming. But once you walk in you discover, this is no longer some person's home. It's been done up, and pretty good too. I like the fact that even though it can get small (hence the personal living room vibe) it can be quite cosy, like you can see the person sitting at the other side of the room. Cosy and intimate. Even better that they can squeeze a DJ into it.. . The bathrooms are gorgeous. . . When I went they were supposed to have this underground lounge but it was empty, so maybe it's "popping" now. . . Haven't had the opportunity to go back though.. . It's one of those places that you need to be prepared for, you just can't show up. Financially and ahem...otherwise, you need to prepare yourself. But the treat is worth it.
