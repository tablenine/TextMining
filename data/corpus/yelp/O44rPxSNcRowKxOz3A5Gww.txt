Yum! One of my friends who lives in the area suggested meeting up here for brunch Sunday and I was happy with everything we had.. Cute dining al fresco, waitstaff was extremely cool, and really believed in the local and fresh concept.. I had the bacon, mushroom, and onion quiche. The mushrooms were sooo good. Idk what kind exactly, maybe baby portabellas? The crust was tender and flaky. It also came with a simple field greens salad. . My other friend ended up meeting up a bit late, so he just got a blueberry muffin. When I saw him practically licking his plate, I decided to grab one to go. Oh yeah definitely worth it.
