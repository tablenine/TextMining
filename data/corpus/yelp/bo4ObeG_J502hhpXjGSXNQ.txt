Comme Ca has some truly delicious drinks.  Pricy, yes, but awesome.  the ambience is also ideal....a somewhat "hip" but not pretentious crowd.  The vibe is relaxed, if a bit noisy.  Ample bread, decent service.  We had a very pleasant dinner here.. . Unfortunately, the food is just ok.  The steak frites was half good...the fries were great,but the steak was bland.  I had the beef bourguignon, and while it was solid, it was about what I can whip up at home.. . It's fairly comparable to other places in it's vibe/price range.  I don't think you'd say it sucked, but you won't be overhwhelmed either.  We'd go back for drinks and appetizers.
