I came here last night after the yelp Halloween event.  It was about midnight and there was a short wait.  . . I ordered the ramen san pork belly but it still had the whole egg.  I was warned to order the half order and I am glad I did because the standard order is enough to feed 3 people.  It was very good and reasonable too and they didn't charge me the full price since I did not have meat in mine.  The prices are very good too!. . Located in Little Tokyo.
