As far as places to go in Wicker Park, it's actually pretty awesome.  I've been here for food during the day and drunk dancing at night.  The food is excellent, a little more than you would pay some places but the unique menu is worth it.  My friend called the fish taco's the best she'd ever had and while I'm not much for fish, I believe her.  The back booths are roomy and have an intimate feel to them even though you're in an open room.  At night the bar becomes a drunken dance party.  There's no cover, a DJ and the night I was there a live drummer.  The music isn't the classically terrible house/dance crap you find so many other places in Wicker Park.  The beer was way cheaper than I expected and the service was really good, especially considering how packed it was.  MY friend didn't even get a dirty look when he dropped his drink and broke the glass, they just cleaned it up promptly.  I would definitely go back, but not unless I was at least a little drunk and looking to be moreso.  It was a lot of fun, drunk.
