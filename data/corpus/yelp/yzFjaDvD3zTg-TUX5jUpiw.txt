Had dinner last night and there was not a thing out of place from our goat cheese pasta, duck breast with fresh cherries, salmon - skin was outrageous- sides of white corn and asperegus. The corn was melt in your mouth delicious. Â Had blackberry pie tart for desert. . I do not know what people expect but this is a five star restaurant period.
