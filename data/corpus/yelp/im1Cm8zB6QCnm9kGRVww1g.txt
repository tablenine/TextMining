Restaurant: Fado Irish Pub
Category: Pubs
Just checked out the new Fado's location in Buckhead.  I must say i was pretty partial to the old one as it really was a great pub even if it did get a little too packed at times.  The space is much larger and is quite nice inside.  It feels more like a restaurant-pub than the old location.  It was quite crowded as i waited in a line for about a half hour before i paid a $10 cover charge.  So i feel more like fado's is moving more towards East Andrew's The Pub instead of old world pub.  It's a nice bar, don't get me wrong.  I just think i prefer the old one better.  But that's just a matter of preference.
