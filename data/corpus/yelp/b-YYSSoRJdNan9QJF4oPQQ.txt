Ahh Bottega Louie is amazing! I seriously cannot get enough of it and this time i convinced one of my best friend to double date with me and the bf. I'll keep this short and sweet and let you know what's good:. . - Roasted Beets with Goat Cheese and Arugala. - Pinot Noir -- my all time fave!. - Bianco pizza -- fresh and light. . -- the fried calamari, portabello fries, and shrimp with garbanzo beans were decent.. . Oh and yes, Odom is a regular and we saw him!! If Odom loves BL, so should you!
