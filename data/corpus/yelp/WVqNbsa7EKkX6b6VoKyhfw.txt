great little burger dive. this place has been around for years and is only made up of an open kitchen surrounded by a counter for patrons. . . any of the burgers are great...and u can order the fries extra crispy or get cheese fries (but only if u like A LOT of oily cheese). . . the service is fast but i wouldn't say it's friendly. it's not cheap either, but i think we pay the price for the old school charm. all in all, i still think this place is fantastic. they know burgers and how to make them right.. . ps. save room for dessert: apple pie a la mode or banana cream pie is dee-lish!
