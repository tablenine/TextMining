Meh.. . I'd tried to get to the original one a couple of times, turned away by long waits each time so I have to admit to some elevated expectations on finally sitting down to the table.. . The burgers were good, although unexpectedly small. I can probably put one down in two bites if pushed. The turkey burger was unbelievably juicy to the point I kept examining it to make sure it was turkey. The hatch burger's chiles+cheese combo was an excellent pairing to the patty. The fries and onion rings were decent as well.. . Less than decent was the $3 price tag on a 8oz bottle of Diet Coke. Looking around, I noticed that other drinks came in their usual 12oz sizes. Price was all the same, though, despite my 33% fewer ounceage.. . Also less than decent: service. Did that guy really just toss the credit card tray onto the table as he rushed by without a word or eye contact? Not that he was warm or friendly up to that point (I'm pretty sure there was some finger snapping at some patrons that were too engrossed in conversation to hear him when he called). I didn't see much smiling from other staff members either.. . Anyway, 3 stars... decent burger, trying too hard to be ... hip(? or whatever), unfriendly service.
