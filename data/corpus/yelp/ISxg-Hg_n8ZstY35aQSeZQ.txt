Went here Friday night after a flick at Landmark.  They had some blues playing which I enjoyed with the feel of the place.. . They were out of the Pork which was a disappointment so had the chicken instead.  Meat was fine if slightly overcooked and sauce was good but I really enjoyed the sides-the creamed corn is especially delicious.  We did have to wait a while for our food which was a little annoying since it was late and the place wasn't overly crowded. Check it out if you are looking for a casual and inexpensive Highland option
