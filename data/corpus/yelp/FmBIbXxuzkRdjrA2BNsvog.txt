Eating fresh organic food is not a new dining experience for me, but I must say, Woodfire Grill takes fresh and organic to an entirely new level!  We recently dined here after meeting its owner/chef, Michael Tuohy.  Chef Tuohy's niche offers a wonderful blend of local, organic ingredients prepared with Northern California influences. . . Our amazing meal began with assorted cured meats (prosciutto di parma, sopressata, pancetta, lardo, coppa).  A taste of local muscadine jam was a delightful addition to the platter.   Lizzie and I decided to share the carnaroli risotto and the wood grilled duck breast served with anson mills polenta.  The risotto was creamy to perfection with a subtle hint of citrus.  Our server confirmed there was a touch of lemon and lime in the risotto.  I'll have to remember that next time I make wild mushroom risotto at home.  The duck had a great smoky flavor.  . . Jeremy's meal was the wood grilled coleman hangar steak served with roasted fingerling potatoes and steel pan greens.  Lizzie and I sampled Jeremy's steak and I have to admit, it was the best steak I've eaten.  It was incredibly tender for being prepared rare.  Lizzie and I have already agreed we will share a steak at our next visit.. . Key lime sorbet (made in house) was served before dessert; we love key lime.  A wonderful surprise came next - a tasting of goat cheese, almonds, date and fig.  Portion sizes were perfect which kept dessert on our radar.  At this point, we told our server to surprise us with dessert.  Two delectable sweets were presented, chocolate molten cake and bread pudding topped with vanilla ice cream.  Oh my goodness, simply amazing!. . Fabulous fresh food.. . Warmly,. Doreen
