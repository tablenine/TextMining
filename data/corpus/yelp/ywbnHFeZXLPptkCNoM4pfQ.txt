Love this place! When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by a host/hostess. Their pitcher of sangria is a must, and so is their freshly made guacamole. I can honestly say that so far, I have yet to find an item on the menu that I don't like. Salmon, and coconut rice...to die for! YUMMY!!! . Basically, the atmosphere is calming and romantic, but I would still feel comfortable dining there with a group of friends.. . I've see people there in jeans and a nice shirt, and also people in suits and dresses. So, it is pretty comfortable, no matter what. I wouldn't go there in sweats, I'm sure you get it ;-). Also, the music they play is out of this world.
