Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
I first saw this place on the Man v. Food episode, so I knew I had to check it out.  First of all, let me say, this was a FANTASTIC experience.. . A long line out the door, but, it moved quickly.  My girlfriend and I sat at the counter, which was the best move, as we got excellent service, and were able to chat it up with the owner, Manuel.  Just like in the M v. F episode, Manuel was there at the door, greeting and talking with everyone, and cruising around the restaurant constantly.. . By the way, throughout the meal, Manuel kept feeding me drinks - so, make sure to befriend him!!!. . I ordered the Hollenbeck burrito - which was the 'smaller' version of what was featured in the Man v. Food episode.  The burrito was absolutely massive and delicious, and was definitely worth the trip out to Boyle Heights.  I most certainly will be going back.
