Best Wet Burrito ( House Special) in the city. You'll think Wolfgang made it himself. Really. They also have many Salvadoren dishes.. . Met a nice lady from Atlanta on Wednesday, noon. Only two of us there. Had a nice conversation about LA restaurants.. . PS If you have to WAIT for a table, know that you are part of the problem---too many people. I will almost never wait at a restaurant for a table. Not that important to me. There is always the next day, next month, etc.
