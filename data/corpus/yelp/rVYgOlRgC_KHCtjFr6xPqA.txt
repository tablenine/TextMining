This seems like one of those places you keep coming to over and over again because it always hits the spot.  Came here for lunch not minutes after my arrival in L.A., sat outside and took it all in.  Clearly the thing to order here is a salad - they were ubiquitous at the surrounding tables (but then again, this is L.A.).  I wanted something heartier so I opted for a pressed sandwich.  Solid, but not outstanding.. . 3 stars for the food, but 4 starts for cute WeHo-ish waiters and my first L.A. actor sighting, albeit somewhat b-list.  So b-list in fact that we couldn't even remember his name, but we still totally recognized him! ( a quick consultation to IMDB revealed it was Mark Feuerstein).  Oh, and don't miss the cupcakes.
