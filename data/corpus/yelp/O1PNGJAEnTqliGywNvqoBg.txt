Pizza with wonderbread dough... Not cool.. . Baguette style bread with Med. spreads... A little odd.. . Meditteranean salad... Suspicously like a plain iceburg lettuce American salad.. . Greek desserts... A little too moist and heavy instead of light and dry-ish.. . Individual parts were tasty, but when put together were not right. Am I just spoiled?
