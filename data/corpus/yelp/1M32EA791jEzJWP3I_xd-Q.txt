I've forgotten how much I missed Yelp.  My memory is so poor these days that if I don't write these reviews soon I forget that I've even eaten there.  I think my copious alcohol consumption has definitely affected my memory and killed some precious brain cells.  But before I forget later, I thought I would do a belated review for the best churascarria place in Los Angeles.  The only thing better would be to fly to Brazil.  I've had churascarria in Rio and I would say that the meat quality of Fogo is definitely comparable.  My bf took me here for my 30th birthday and I couldn't think of a better way to celebrate such a momentous occasion than with unlimited meat.. . And boy was there a lot of meat.  You cannot keep your little card flipped to green for long because you will just be inundated with waiters bringing you too much meat.  I never thought it was possible to overload on meat but you definitely can.  . . The salad bar is pretty good too.  But you definitely just want to sample a little of everything but not to fill up too much as you want to save your appetite for the meat.. . I was definitely too full but the waitress brought by a complimentary papaya cream dessert since it was my bday.  It was surprisingly pretty good...enough that we managed to finish most of it even though we were so full we thought our stomachs were going to explode.  It is s a bit pricey so I probably wouldn't come back unless for a special occasion and I would make sure I skipped a few meals beforehand to really get my money's worth.
