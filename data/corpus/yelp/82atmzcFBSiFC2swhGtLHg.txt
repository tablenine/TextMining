Restaurant: Marietta Diner
Category: Diners
Prior to moving back to the less-than-Magic City, I called Marietta my home for a couple of years.  And even though it wasn't one of my extremely frequented haunts, I did partake of the goodness that is the Marietta Diner on several occasions.  Lemme tell ya, the place is heaven for diners of all hours, ESPECIALLY the late night crowd.  It's a 24-hour place, and offers a full menu at all times.  Walking in, your appetite is immediately taken hostage by the glimpse of a HUGE variety of cakes and cheesecakes in the dessert display.  And once you check the menu and discover that you can order from a ridiculous selection of food, it's all over.  The portions are more than enough to satisfy the 3am munchers, the food is very good, and just the options alone beat the heck out of Krystal's (stale, cold, small, square) any day of the week.  My cousin and I made ventures to the place JUST to get dessert, and walked out with 90lbs of leftover cake (it seemed) in to-go containers each.. . Summary?  You gotta try the place.  Sometimes ya want Steak and Shake, and sometimes you just want diner food - and this is the place to get it.  . . Additional pros:  . - the place is lit up like Vegas so ya can't miss it, . - it's pretty cozy so after a long night out, it's a great rest stop. - if ya like eye candy to go with your cake, the wait staff are all about the Mediterranean-style good looks. . Enjoy!
