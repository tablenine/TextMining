Very tasty, firm ramen at a good price. I love that there were tons of green onions in mine, but this may be a turnoff for some people. Speaking of turnoffs, there was a lot of fat floating in the container when i went to eat my leftovers the next day =(. . Went on a Saturday night at about 7, waited for an hour...don't come with a large group (more than 4 or 5).
