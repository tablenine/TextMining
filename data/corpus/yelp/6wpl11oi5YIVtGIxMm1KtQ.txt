So bad.  I had high expectations after most of the reviews that I read here, but I was sorely disappointed.  My first letdown was the Sangria; it was watery and almost tasteless.  Then I ordered the house salad, which was blah.  The burger was okay, but just ordinary.  The worst part of the evening was the service.  The waiter seemed totally out of it; he forgot to bring our drinks and just seemed like he wanted to go home.  On the other hand, the hostess was nice, but I definitely won't be going back.
