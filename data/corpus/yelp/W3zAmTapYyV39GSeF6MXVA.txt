I love this place for so many reasons.  The food is great (I especially love the Breakfast Burrito).  The staff are so sweet and so nice.  If you stay late until close, they'll give you their remaining scones.  It's beautiful inside: lovely lamps and sparkly decor, so cozy and nice.  Tough to get a seat here on the weekends, but really worth the wait, and definitely a great place to meet up with friends or to do some work during the week.  The epitome of cuteness!
