im only giving it 3 stars because of the crowd.. the food is pretty good but our bad experience sprouted from a couple sitting next to us with rancid perfume and cologne - it was difficult to enjoy our first course.  however the staff was really helpful in seating us far away from them.  french onion soup was yummeee and so were the oysters
