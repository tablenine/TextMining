You can tell how long someone's lived in Virginia-Highland based on what they call it. If they call it "The Highlands" they are probably not a native or long-time resident and they probably wear pastel polo shirts and croakies to boot. For whatever reason, Hand in Hand attracts a lot of these people. The bar itself is fine. Drinks are a little on the steep side, but there's nothing particularly wrong with the bar- the patio is very nice. It's the just the throngs of preppies and suburban-types who flock there that keep me away. If that's your scene, go for it. But if you're looking for a more unique and authentic Virginia-Highland bar you'd probably prefer The Local, Righteous Room, George's, and Moe's &amp; Joe's (except on Tuesdays when it's full of Emory kids).
