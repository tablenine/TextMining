No cream, no sugar.. . This was the best cups of coffee I've ever had. I went here for breakfast, and got the individual brewed cup (the lowest price on the menu) and it was delicious. I was a little jealous of the fun table brewed cups in the tables next to me, but really my cup 'o joe was great without that.. . The food was also good - rich flavors, good presentation, but I want a little more substance in my breakfast. And size:price ratio was just too low.. . If you love coffee, and want to try the best and don't mind spending more, try it out.
