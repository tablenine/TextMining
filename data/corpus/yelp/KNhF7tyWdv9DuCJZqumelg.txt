Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I know everyone has their own taste for when it comes to ramen but I really do like their ramen. I can eat up to three noodles in one bowl of soup =D. Their base is not too heavy and I always get it without beansprouts. They are always good with taking the right order. I alike the thickness of their noodles as well! . Their fried rice is actually pretty good also. I usually get a half order. The dumplings I don't really like. They're too mushy on the inside. Service can be slow when it gets really hectic but I guess that's all places. The food comes out pretty quickly so I definitely love this place!
