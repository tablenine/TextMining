Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
Overall a very good restaurant, but a few things hold it back from being great.. . This has to be one of the most popular restaurants in LA over the last couple of years, and it's evident why. The food is tasty, the menu is very appealing, and it has a very trendy vibe.. . My first trip was for the Amaro bar $35 menu, which is a great value. The mozzarella bar dishes are really a nice treat - I tried the bufala mozzarella with prosciutto and the caprese. Tasty and refreshing. The pasta dishes were also good, with my favorite being the tagliatelle in oxtail ragu.. . Desserts of the bombolini and rosemary olive oil cakes were really delicious. Rosemary olive oil cake does not sound like something one would usually order, but it really works well.. . My second trip was for the pasta tasting menu and wine pairings. I love pasta so a pasta tasting menu is right down my alley. I thought the portions were rather small, not more than a few bites of each, but it was a nice sampling of what the restaurant had to offer. My dining companion thought almost each dish was too salty, however I didn't really think so.. . There are a couple of things I'd really like a restaurant to do when I have a tasting menu with wine pairings. When involves 7+ dishes and wines, there's no way I'm remembering what they are. So, it's only appropriate for the wait staff to tell us what we're eating and what we're drinking at each step. Osteria Mozza was rather inconsistent with this, with certain dishes/wines getting an explanation, and some not.. . Also, while bringing out dessert, the gelato fell over on its side, ruining the presentation, and the waiter didn't say anything. That was kind of crappy.. . All in all, it's really a good restaurant and I'd come back. The Amaro bar menu is really a good deal.
