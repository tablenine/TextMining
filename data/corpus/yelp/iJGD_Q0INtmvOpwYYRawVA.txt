.When I moved to the area, I ate here on a week night and had a good experience, food was decent.. . The past 2 times it has been ridiculously loud and the service was bad. I walked out (both times before ordering) once because of the horrible smell and noise level, the 2nd after really bad service. Thankfully it's on Ventura where you have lots more dining options.
