I like this place! Best Bartender in ATL! She showed us the most extensive selection of Vodkas and gave a little history and the story behind each one! Great Job!. . The service was great! The food was good! I ordered the Lamb Chops of course! They were a little under done and lacked some flavor! The rest was fantastic! The Loukamades (I know I hacked the spelling on that one), were incredible.. . I'm looking forward to my next meal here, great atmosphere!
