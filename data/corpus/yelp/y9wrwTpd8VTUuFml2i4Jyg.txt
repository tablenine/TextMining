5 Stars because this place makes the best dang red velvet EVER! The first time my friend and I tried it (sitting in the windowsill seat) we went bazzzzurck. Deep, rich color together with a dense moist bundt cake and thick not to sweet cream cheese frosting piped on top and inside the middle of the bundt. I asked the wait what wondrous planet these things came from and he said one of the chefs makes them using his own recipe. I would come to Fred's just for this magical, orgasmic experience and don't forget the decaf coffee to go with it. Boom!
