we came here based on a recommendation from a friend, but he's not really a foodie so we were a bit hesitant, haha.  But he was actually right...this place is pretty cool!  It's cute and casual and very spacious.  We were short on time and ended up sitting at the bar instead of waiting for a table.  Customer service was pretty good and the entire staff was pretty easy on the eyes.  They have decently priced food, with decent portions and the food was actually pretty good!  My friend ordered one of the sandwiches and it was huge and came with a side of garlic fries!  I just ordered the spaghetti - I wanted spaghetti and meatballs, but you had to order them separately, which I thought kinda sucked, cuz that would've meant $15 for spaghetti and meatballs, which i was not willing to pay for such a staple food.  So my other friend was nice and ordered the meatballs so I can have some in my spaghetti! =)  I'd have to admit that they were both pretty good...but I've had better meatballs...the spaghetti was yuum though.  We were too full to order a dessert but will definitely come back to try one!
