Restaurant: Doc Chey&#39;s Noodle House
Category: Asian Fusion
All those reviewers who finally "knew better" weren't kidding.  Doc Chey's may have looked appealing to a college student, but the food also tasted like a college student was trying to make food for the first time.  God knows I've had botched attempts as a freshman in college that tasted exactly like some of the stuff this place churned out.  Just because you know how to put some sweet and sour into a limp glob of starch doesn't mean you've made solid pan-Asian cuisine.. . Which was worse, the recipes or the cooking?  It was hard to say, but I'm not about to find out in the future.    . . Lucky for me, when I first tried Doc Chey's, I had just moved to Atlanta and I was already 25, and presumably "knew better".  So I have no "moment of epiphany" stories to tell, just a negative, direct impression.  I'll stick to restaurants on Buford Highway, thank you.. . Kudos to the naysayers.
