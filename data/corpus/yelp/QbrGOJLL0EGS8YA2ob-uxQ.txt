OMG! Their house ramen is the best I've ever had, so far. The pork was so tender it just melts. I'm just in love with their white soup base (pork bone?). I've never tried anything like it. Most Â ramen places would just have miso or soy flavor, but Daikokuya, I'm just blown away. The whole egg was so flavorful along with the bamboo and scallions!. . My hubby ordered the house ramen combo with fried rice. The fried rice was pretty yummy. Our side order of their sauages was really good. Just be careful when first bitting into it, the juices are hot and I think you could hear the skin crack when you bite into it.. . I thought we could beat the crowd by coming in on a rainy day at 2:30, but I guess not. We had to wait for about 30mins, but it was totally worth the wait.
