Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I have mixed feelings about Tank. The first time I went there this past summer, my friends and I absolutely loved it. The inside is very sleek and trendy, a definite stand out for its design in this particular neighborhood and we loved everything we tasted. However, after a second trip last night, I'm not sure I would come here again, unless it is for the half-priced roll special on weekends. . . The place was especially crowded for a Tuesday night and we ended up with a table by the door, which wouldn't have been too bad because we were right by the windows looking out onto Lincoln, however, it was absolutely freezing. The woman at the table next to us actually kept her full length fur coat on during her entire meal. Next, the service was pretty bad. Our server asked us once if we were ready to order and we said we needed a minute and he literally ignored us for the next fifteen minutes, until someone in my party had to flag him down to take our order.. . The sushi itself was simply not as good as I remembered. They have a huge selection of rolls to choose from (I'd say close to 30), but they are lacking in basic choices without all the crap that Americanized sushi places have started to add to their rolls like mayo, jalapenos, and cream cheese. While I don't mind that stuff on some of my rolls, I also like something basic with out all the bells and whistles. (I will say that they have one roll which has strawberries which is fabulous.) But at least their fish appeared to be very good quality.. . In the end the meal was decent, but way over-priced. I ordered two rolls, edamame and green tea and paid about $35 with tax and tip. As I said I will probably come back here some day for the weekend special, but that's it.
