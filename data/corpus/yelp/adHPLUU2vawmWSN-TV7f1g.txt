This place is a hidden jewel.  It has animating servers who speak passionately about their food and well, period.  I have yet to see such an energetic, happy, and respectful waitstaff- especially in this economy.  The food melts in your mouth and not in your pockets.  You get fresh to made food, ingredients purchased from the DeKalb Farmer's Market (I overheard one of the cooks).  I ordered the grilled veggie special wrap of the day, I forgot what it was called but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.  The vegetables were seasoned to perfection, the sweet potato fries with curry dipping sauce was magnetic to my taste buds, I finished my plate completely with pure bliss. Oh, and there's FREE WI-FI!  You really can't beat what this place has to offer.
