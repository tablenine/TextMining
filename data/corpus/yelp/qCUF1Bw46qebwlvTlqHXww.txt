Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I love fried chicken so this was on my list. I have also wanted to come here because of all the movies scenes I've seen that Â talked about going down to Roscoe's. To me, it didn't live up to the hype, but it was still good eats. The chicken is moist and waffles are soft like pancakes. I had the gravy on the side and glad it came that way. Somehow food to me is better when you dip it versus it being covered with sauce.
