Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Taste is a small restaurant with Hollywood flair.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner there.  We started off with the pommes frite (fries) which I personally thought were amazing and fun to eat, although most would think them quite ordinary.  I ordered the chopped sabrosa salad with shrimp, although I should have asked for the dressing on the side because it was really strong.  I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it were use more sparingly, but the taste in itself was delicious.  Very citrus-ey.  My friend ordered the pork chop which was also too strong in flavor, and my other friend the parmesan chicken, which was... alright.  The thing about this place is that when something tastes good, it TASTES really really good!  But it's too strong, maybe because I prefer my dishes a little more on the bland side.  I think it deserves a second chance, though.  I might be raving about it the next time I go.  In any case, I give this place an easy 5 stars for atmosphere, food, and even my waitress was really cute.. . Update:. I went a second and third time and the flavors just punch you in the face!  It's much too overwhelming.
