First time I had BC, it was to go bcuz of the long wait. My friends ordered apound just for me!Got the garlic butter shrimp medium spicy with the corn. At first it took me a while to get used to the taste considering it was my first time eating Cajun style shrimp. One thing I do remember bout my first time is the juicy corn...so full of garlic butter sauce!! YUM. . Next couple times at BC,I definitely became hooked! With the whole shabang sauce as my fav + shrimp + corn n sometimes potatoes! The fries are good as well as the fried catfish(fresh,moist,greatbatter), the osyters,and theclams! BC's sauce makes the seafood So finger-licking GOOD!! And their seafood is definitely FRESH!. . Overall, love the food, the atmosphere,and the quick service/table setup/bibs!! Though the wait is long, I definitely think it's worth it...I always come out satisfied and with a FOODCOMA!. . Note: heard of this new place called The Shack in Rowland Heights! Yelp reviewers say it'sbetter than BC?Hmm I'll have to try and see BC's competitor!!
