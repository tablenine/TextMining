good.LAAAAWD. you need to eat here. no seriously. the food made me exclaim on numerous occaisons throughout the evening and the desert that i had...the great wall brick:: baked chocolate graham cracker crust, toasted coconut, pecans with ice cream...sweet geezus! made me shiver with delight. lol (i know, what a cornball) the menu is very large, so there's something delicious for everyone. its BYOB...somehow they "lost" our B in the back which i was a lil salty about but they brought us something else. and i love the atmosphere which was very mod&amp;minimal and one would think "shi-shi" but the waiter we had practically became my bff before we left. very cool. take your honey.
