We came to this restaurant before seeing a musical at the Ahmanson.  We went there partly cause they had free limo transportation to the theatre from the restaurant and back.  . . A very modern feel of a Latin restaurant.  I was quite intrigued with the menu and wanted to try everything.  . . For starters, you have to get the Peruvian ceviche (mahi mahi, avocado, lime, ginger, aji amarillo chile) so so so good.. I had the Niman Ranch Pork Carnitas. (white cheddar corn grits, braised black kale, smoked tomato sauce, crispy yuca) so good.  The pork was so tender and the white cheddar was so flavorful.  When you take a bite with a little bit of everything a flavorful explosion party's in your mouth.  I was thinking about it for a few days after.. . They also have really good mojito's.  The mojito diez was really good.. . Next time I probably will do the happy hour instead to save some mulah.
