Food coma I welcome you!. . Buffet, mmmmmmm! Everything was pretty good, I drenched everything with mast o keeyar (yogurt and cucumber) and it made everything even better! The soup was good. Their chai was even better, I apreciate good chai. I didn't expect such rich fragarent hot tea, it was a nice way to end my food coma~!
