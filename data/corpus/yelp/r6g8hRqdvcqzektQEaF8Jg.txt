finally caught the truck on the 3rd attempt!  my favorite was the short ribs taco.  we also had a spicy pork taco (ehh, i could live without this one) and kimchi quesadilla (yummm esp. for any veggies out there!)  good food, but not sooo worth the wait or chase.  having caught it once, i'm ok for having tried it.
