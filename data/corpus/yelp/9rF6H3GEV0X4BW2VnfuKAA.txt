This wasn't my first choice for dinner but the place that we were supposed to go is no where to be found and I don't have much time to waste driving around so my friend told me there's another cuban place less than a mile away. . . So we end up going here. this place is not shabby at all it feels like a mexican fastfood place but a bit better. While looking at the menu we opted to get a pitcher of sangria first which is a good deal 15 bucks i think. . . As recommended by my friend that the Pork Lechon is good i ordered that one and since i'm filipino when you say Lechon it should be good! Â And she ordered pork leg. Mine came in like a shredded pork no skin but all lean meat and some thin slices of onion on top, rice , black beans and some plantains. . . My dish was very good but not great, there's a lot of garlic in it, a bit salty for my taste, juicy and flavorful. Definitely worth the try.
