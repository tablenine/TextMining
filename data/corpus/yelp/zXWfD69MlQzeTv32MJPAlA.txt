Restaurant: Kevin Rathbun Steak
Category: Steakhouses
Having gone to Rathbun's original restaurant the previous night, I felt that I should have one solidly great steak while still in Atlanta. I also felt I should try a different chef. But, I was convinced by those in the know to return to Rathbun, and this time, eat at this steakhouse. So I did.. . When I saddled up to the bar for dinner, I ordered a Sweetwater Pale Ale (made in Atlanta - not too shabby!), the 10 oz. NY strip ($36), the jalapeno creamed corn, and the steakhouse onion rings. I had VERY high expectations...which sadly, weren't quite met.. . Don't get me wrong, everything here was high quality and the meal I had was great. But for the cash being put down and the raves I had heard before coming, I was expecting something unbelievable. What I got was a slightly-above-average steakhouse experience. . . The jalapeno creamed corn wasn't anything the write home about, as all the interesting bits and ingredients were drown in the cream taste. The onion rings too had no special effect or quality to them, but I did enjoy the "signature steak sauce" they had for dipping (how do you 'dip' an onion ring anyways...). . Finally, the steak arrived, and it was cooked to a perfect medium. It was juicy and tender, but....that's it. There was nothing more to it. The beef wasn't particularly dry-aged or otherwise well-settled or supremely cut. The seasoning was desperately lacking any originality or purpose. It was just a good grilled steak. But really, at a place like this, I'm forced to expect a bit more. . . Overall, a fine dining experience, but definitely underwhelming.
