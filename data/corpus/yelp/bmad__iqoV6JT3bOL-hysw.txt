Now, i must preface my review by stating that I have only been here once, and I went after a long night of craziness, so perhaps it is not as good as I thought/think it is.. . They are kind of in a strange location . . . Parking was annoying. So if you can walk there, i reccomend it *they are on 10th inbetween the interstate and Spring street on the same side as the Chevron station). . They are open very late, until like six in the morning or something, so that's nice.. . The food is ok . . .not necessarily the best chinese food I have had, but again I ordered the sesame chicken, and as long as it is sweet, I am susually satisfied.. . Finally, the night ended with a guy who jumped over a table and ran out of the restaurant . . . so my mental picture of Â this place with the great contrasting black and red decor will always be a little tainted by a man in a green shirt (or was it blue?) clearing a table. . . P.S. The bathrooms were clean :)
