Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I fell for this hyped up hot dog stand a couple of months ago. I guess I got lucky since I only had to wait 45 minutes in line. I'd say their chili dogs are good at most. Certainly not spectacular like I had expected. I wouldn't wait in line again but it was worth the experience. I'll stick with Carney's on W Sunset. No line + awesome chili dogs!
