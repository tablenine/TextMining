Category: American (Traditional)
Slightly overrated, but definitely better than average. Should get 3 1/2 stars. . . I for one have not quite drank the kool-aid on the Vortex yet. Having lived her for 6 years, I have been to both locations on several occasions. The burgers are good, but I personally don't think they are as good as some people think. I for one, am a fan of the cowboy burger. This 1/2 lb burger has a slice of Canadian bacon and provolone cheese with a sweet honey BBQ sauce. It's pretty tasty. . . One of the highlights of visiting the Vortex is getting to enjoy the tots. Probably not the healthiest of dietary options, but on a hungover Sunday it will certainly help you get over it. . . If your looking for an eclectic crowd and true local flavor visit the Vortex in L5P. Cool people, friendly servers, cold beer make for good times. . . Food - B . Service - A . Atmosphere - A
