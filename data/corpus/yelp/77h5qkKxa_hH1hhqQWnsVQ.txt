I came on a Friday evening after work and if you don't mind scavenging for a place to sit, it will be well worth it.. . They have an obscure beer list which gives this spot a unique charm and every employee is helpful and friendly. Ask for a taste of any beer you are interested in and they will gladly oblige.. . I had THE OFFICE BURGER. Medium-rare and sweet potato fries. The fries were good, the dip was better. The burger is the best I've had yet, but I still have a long way to go. I enjoyed the atmosphere, drinks, and food.
