Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
To be honest, I'm confused because I can't make out the high praise this restaurant has gotten for its food.  Maybe I was just there on an off night?!?!?. . Pros:  Neat entrance that leads into a restaurant with a seductive ambiance and inviting aura.  Good albeit expensive wine list.. . Service was neutral.  . . Negatives:  Food was way below par.  Mushroom and garlic appetizer was bland; pistachio encrusted red snapper entree tasted fishy (thankfully it came with some mashed sweet potatoes otherwise I would have had nothing to eat); chocolate pear tarte was a hard (yes, hard) browny-like base with an almond paste aftertaste, covered by a thin layer of glazed pears.. . All of the above with a price tag of over $60 per person for the meal, not including the wine.  Not worth it.
