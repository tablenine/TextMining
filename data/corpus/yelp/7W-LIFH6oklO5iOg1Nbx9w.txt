We went with a kind of noisy group, and this place can accommodate both a group like ours and an intimate, date-type dinner. Â The plates were well-proportioned for the price, and the service was great. . . We went on a Friday night at 7pm and I was expecting it to be packed, but it was very comfortable. The outside patio is beautiful. The decor is very hip (I loved the flowy curtain thing leading into the restrooms!). . . I loved it! I can't wait to go again and try everything else. I had a sandwich on french-bread style bread with raspberry dipping sauce. It was awesome.
