Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
The Food:  AWESOME, and inexpensive. . The Atmosphere: Nice, if you are lucky enough to get a booth (the place is small, and tight). The service: Can use some work, but i never had a horrible experience.. . The negative star comes from the ice tea. 3 glasses into a meal (What?! I was thirsty) A refill comes to me (in the same glass mind you) smelling of sewage!  I called over the waitress, and explained, she didn't act like she believed me, so she smells it, disgusted she explains she grabbed some pitcher by the cooks to fill with the tea. Never said sorry, didn't seem to care, and didn't comp the drink!  . . I'll still go there tho, their pastas, ALL OF THEM, are FANTASTIC....just bring your own tea!
