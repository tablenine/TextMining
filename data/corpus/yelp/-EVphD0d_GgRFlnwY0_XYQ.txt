Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
If your looking for one of the best prime rib places to go, this is the place. Yes, its about $55 a plate with all the fixings but you will not be cheated, as they provide you with the biggest and fastest piece of meet for your buck, 3 course meal included. Me and My family have been going to Lawry's ever since it was across the street, where the Stinky Rose is now located. I love this place and I try to go at least once or twice a year.
