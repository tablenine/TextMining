I have been twice, once to each location.  The first time was in Santa Monica.  The second location in Culver City is  a welcome change in that it is much larger and there is less fighting over seats.  I don't understand why they keep the policy of making people argue over seats, it detracts from the entire dining experience and makes for unnecessary antagonism.  . . I happened to stumble by the Helms location once and noticed there was no line!  I had to stop in.  I could actually savor the food!  The burgers are indeed excellent, and I think those that complain about the no-ketchup policy are missing the point--this way you taste the burger, unmasked from the usual sugary coating.  The fries are excellent as well, although the dipping sauce they use is extremely heavy.  It is really difficult to finish a whole plate of them because of it.  . . They also have an excellent beer selection on tap.  The first time I went I was forced--FORCED!--to drink an Arrogant Bastard ale, which was pure work.  It matched the antagonistic vibe of the Santa Monica location as I felt like kicking some ass afterwards.  The lack of a crowd at Helms allowed me to chat with the bartender--he's really into his beers, and knows them damn well.  Too bad you can usually barely hear his advice over the din of the place.. . My advice?  Skip it when there's that huge line out front.  It's just not worth it, and there's an organic hot dog vendor outside who is excellent.  But if you happen to stop by when it's not overwhelmed, by all means try it out and enjoy your beer and burger in peace.
