No complaints about service or food....just pricey. I guess you pay for the house music, fancy decor, hype, and nuances found in the menu. . I did think the menu was creative and the place is visit once a every few months, def not a regular joint type of deal.. . Lunch for 2, nothing to drink came to about $28 after tip.
