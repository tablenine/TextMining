This might sound a bit weird, but if Joy Yee's were in a different part of town I think I would appreciate it much more. The thing is, when I'm in ChinaTown, I'm looking for the little hole in the wall authentic Chinese place. Joy Yee's is more contemporary then authentic. That's not to say it's not tasty, because it is. The prices also run a bit higher than the surrounding restaurants. It's definitely good non-Asian friendly. What I mean is, you won't be given a menu written in all Chinese and you also won't be given some Americanized menu that only has a few selections. Also, if you like the fruity smoothies, you have to try one from here. The selection is awesome!
