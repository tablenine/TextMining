Restaurant: Kamehachi
Category: Sushi Bars
I know Kamehachi is one of those places in Chicago that is a classic, but I don't love it.  I can find better sushi elsewhere and I don't feel like I have to deal with the Old Town traffic etc.. . If you are  in the neighborhood, it's a little overpriced, but the food is good and worth a try.
