Just had dim sum with Pete and Dio at Canton House.  This is my first attempt at trying to find good dim sum in Atlanta.  At first glance, the place looks pretty packed but that was due the fact that there was a line to be seated and there was a line for paying.  I actually dislike going up to a the counter and waiting on line to clear the bill.  It is very cheesy like something that you might do at a fast food place.  Here is a list of some of the dishes we tried.. . "Phoenix Claws" (fancy Chinese translation for chicken feet) - definitely below par in terms of taste and texture.  . Sticky rice with beef and sausage wrapped and steamed in leaves - not good because the rice was way too soggy and there was not enough meat filling.  . Clams with black bean sauce was good but some of the clam shell was still closed and some shells had no clams in it.  . Beef tripes were tasty.  . Fried dough with beef filling actually had a good amount of beef filling and thinner fried dough crust so those were pretty good too.  . . The "har-gow", "siu mai", fried turnip cake and most of the other tradition dim sum dishes were OK.  I might come back if I don't find a better dim sum place than this.
