Prepare for some blasphemy!. . After the reviews and the hype and the crowds standing outside, I decided that it was due time I had some Daikokuya ramen... it's gotta be that good, right?. . So I brave the dinner rush, put my name on the list for 1 (best chance to get a seat, right?) and in 5 minutes took a seat at the counter.  Everyone is friendly, and very quick about their service.  It's not quite a hole in the wall, but almost... cool atmosphere.. . I have myself a ramen + fried rice combo.  I was hoping and praying for a mind-blowing first sip.... and nothing.  I'm sorry to say that it's definitely not the best ramen I've had.  Ignore the ramen I had in Japan, I would say that I prefer the stuff at Santouka in Costa Mesa, where the broth and pork slices are much more flavorful.  The ramen noodles were on par with each other.  . . The fried rice was very good, freshly made and terrific flavor on its own... I did enjoy a few drops of soy sauce, but I just like soy sauce.. . Total cost = $16 for a large bowl of ramen, small fried rice (side of cabbage salad included), drink, tax, and tip.. . Now, I will admit that it's some pretty darn good eats but now that I've gone, I'd have to say that I'm not going to go through any extra effort to eat here again.  If I can get a table within 5-10 minutes, then great... otherwise, I'll just go somewhere else.. . NOTE: There is a sign by the door that clearly says NO MORE TAKE-OUT.
