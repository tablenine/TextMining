It was so hard to decide what on the menu I wanted to have, then it got more complicated when the server mentioned the special which consisted of pan-seared scallops and verdolagas, wow! I've only had verdolagas when my mom makes them, and that's rare, because you're lucky if they happen to grow in your garden (its an unassuming weed). I decided on the Skirt Steak Special, and I was very pleased. My family is from San Luis Potosi, and I've grown up on nopales, so its really great to see someone use nopales as deliciously and prominently as they do at Los Nopales, and not just some jarred version stuffed into a gordita (ahem... Comales). . . Go there, take some wine or beer and take your time. The service was just fine, everyone was nice and attentive and I had no complaints. I can't wait to go back.
