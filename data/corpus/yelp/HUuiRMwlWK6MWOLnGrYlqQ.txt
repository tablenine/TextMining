Restaurant: Dante&#39;s Down the Hatch
Category: Fondue
Dante's is one of the last Atlanta institutions left in the Buckhead area. It is totally unique and you won't find anything like it. I don't even know how to start describing the ambiance other than it is a pirate ship inside a building with a moat of alligators and everything! Also, we met the owner Dante while there and he was a delightful older gentleman that can spin a tale like no one these days can. . . The food was good, but not outstanding. You're paying for the ambiance, the jazz, and the fondue process. Go here with friends, have fun, cook some food, and plan to leave full. We ordered a little of everything, but my favorite fondues were the cheese and beef. While I'm usually a chicken person, I didn't like that chicken had to be handled more carefully and fully cooked to be safe to eat.. . Our server was great. She could describe each item in detail and was very attentive.
