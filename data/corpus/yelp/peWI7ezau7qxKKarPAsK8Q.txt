Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
No one is going to argue with me that the restaurant scene in Culver City is booming.  However, the majority of the new/hip restaurants are a little too expensive for a laid back mid-week dinner with friends.  A place like Ugo fills this gap.  . . Decent-sized menu with all manner of Italian favorites: salad, pizza, panini, pasta, meat.  They have lots of salads, from traditional caprese to a spinach with feta.  Pastas are pretty much mix and match, choose a sauce, add some meat if you like, with a fair amount of set dishes (the shells with peas sounded particularly good).. . The wine list is small, but you can get a decent bottle of red for 23 bucks.. . Service is good, attentive.  Our waitress thoughfully plated our split caprese for two.  Our bread basket was never empty, our water glasses never lacking.  The place is sort of devoid of ambience, beyond loud acoustics and a general sense of busy-ness.. . I enjoyed myself, my gnocchi with four cheese sauce and chicken was quite outstanding (the gnocchi itself was cooked right, the sauce was a stand-out).  I'd definitely go back.
