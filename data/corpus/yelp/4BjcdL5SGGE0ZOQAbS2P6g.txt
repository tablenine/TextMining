3.5.  I know.  It's shouldn't have taken me 25 years to get to Langers.  But it did.  See, whenever I'm in the area, I go to Mama's Hot Tamales.  This time, Josh and were celebrating his move back to LA with a grand tour of lunch sopts, and after warming up on a tamale each, we stopped at Langers to split a pastrami reuben.. . well, the talk is worth it.  langers has history, and as i've said before, I don't like paying $15 for pastrami unless they act like they care about my business.  And though deli prices will always perplex me, unlike the lean canters corned beef i usually go for, Langers pastrami on rye was very thick cut, very juicy (and well marbled), and our waiter seemed like he cared.. . To me, deli is in my blood.  We eat bagels and lox when there's a Sunday or a holiday morning.  We eat deli after a funeral if someone dies...there are all sorts of deli-worthy occasions, so I rarely find myself dying for a deli fix.  But if I did, Langers would be the thickest cut, most well marbled place to get my fix.. . ADDENDUM 8/26/07:. You won't be risking your life to come here.  That's crazy, and just promotes fear.  I for one, like William Upski Wimsatt, believe that there's no such thing as a "bad neighborhood".  If you're smart, you're not going to be a woman walking alone in the park at night.  Take a friend.  Or come during the day, when it's beautiful, and there are tons and familes and people hanging out around the park.
