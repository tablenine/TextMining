Restaurant: La Parrilla
Category: Mexican
LaParrilla is an enormous megalopolis of Mexican chews. We pulled up here around dinner time on a Friday. They had so many tables they could probably seat half an army. It was still so packed that they told us it would be a thirty minute wait. I turned around and started yakking, trying to figure out where we should go: not really worth it to wait half an hour for standard Mexi-American food. Then all of a sudden they sat us immediately.. . I was pretty impressed with the menu. They had brisket tacos and fajitas under $10. Definitely a stronger array of Mexican than your typical El ______. The waiter mixed our orders up a smidge (bringing a non vegetarian combo, and forgetting the cheese dip). I'll forgive him. He was nice. . . The food didn't blow my mind but it filled me up beyond imagination. I would eat here again most likely. Their prices are worth what you get.. . They do fried ice cream the fake way: dunking ice cream in a crispy shell. . . It amused the table when the store manager came around to ask how us how our meal was. It always makes me laugh when they do that at regular restaurants, but I guess it also shows they cared.
