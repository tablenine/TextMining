What a cozy place. If you don't know, you must go try! It is truly one of my favorite places to dine in LA. Not only are the tapas awesome, but the staff is excellent. you just feel like you're dining at a friends house. Just like you'd be drinking at your friend's place, there's no corkage fee. . . Now to the good part... their skirt steak just makes me drool... slurp, wipe the keyboard, hehehee, and their sweet potato fries are the bomb. And did i mention the paella? Awesome. . . come here to chill and relax w/ your friends/loved one.
