Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Ok, I can see how this place survived for a hundred years, but honestly, I've had better French Dips... perhaps folks perfected on Philippe's original recipe? Next time I go, I'm definitely getting a Lamb French Dip- it seems to have more flavor than the regular beef dips.. . What I do like about Philippe's is the restaurant interior itself- sawdust on the ground, hardwood tables and stools, cafeteria-style ordering plus the dining trays... You just don't see places like this anymore.. . While I wish the sandwiches were bigger and cheaper, you really can't complain about the sides, drinks, and PIE! Honestly, I'd come back just for those last three things, especially the pie (I had a slice of banana cream pie), which was a tasty surprise given the fact that this place is known for its French Dips.. . So yeah, cheap drinks, cheap sides, cheap pie... not so cheap sandwiches (at least not anymore). Go figure.
