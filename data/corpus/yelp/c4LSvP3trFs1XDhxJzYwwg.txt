This place has a great waitstaff. They were attentive polite and very accommodating. We went on a Sat. for brunch, and there were plenty of tables. Their food is inventive, and they have great drinks. Their bloody mary's have three levels of spice and it tasted amazing. And for those who like beer, they have a pretty extensive list.
