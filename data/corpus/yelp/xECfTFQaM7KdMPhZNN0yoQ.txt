Fancy schmancy.  I felt like I should go home and get a makeover and come back.  Pretty pretty people watching.  Lovely atmosphere.  Nice bar, food was very good, but pricey.  Come here only on special occasions or if you are able to expense it.., Your client will no doubt be impressed.  It's really nice.  I will be back for sure... but not for a while.  The fish below the glass floor is really cool too.
