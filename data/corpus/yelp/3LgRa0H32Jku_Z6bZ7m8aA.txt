I noticed the review knocking the positive acclaim this place got from Top Chef (whatever that is)..but it's more than just an authentic hole in the wall. Â The first time I dined here it was with a friend who was an up and coming sous chef working at a four star restaurant on the Upper East Side. He explained that the head chef in his restaurant had taken him here for a late night meal (so apparently its appeal extends beyond food critics trying to look hip and down and dirty.). . Can't claim to have sampled the entire exhaustive menu, but the simple dishes like roast pig are succulent , well prepared, and delivered promptly and hot. Great spot for sustaining or capping a late night Bowery drinking binge or for taking an out of town friend who focuses more on what you're eating than where you're eating it. Might take a few visits to narrow the menu to your ten or twelve favorite standbys, but well worth it.
