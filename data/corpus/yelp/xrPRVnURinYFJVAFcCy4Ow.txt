Be sure to play the Soprano's soundtrack when you roll in. Ask for Rudy; if it's your first visit the 'Godfather' is the best way to try the hand-cut veal.. . If you ever find out what all the late model Cadillacs are doing there until 4AM let me know, there has got to be a story there.. . Families with small kids should go be a little early it usually gets pretty busy by 8pm.
