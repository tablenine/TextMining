I think this is one of the best well kept sports bars in Atlanta.  I like the location in Atlantic Station, the food, and the ambiance there.  . . If you plan to come to Fox Sport's Grill to watch a popular athletic event, know that you are not the only one and there will be a long line outside.  So get there early.
