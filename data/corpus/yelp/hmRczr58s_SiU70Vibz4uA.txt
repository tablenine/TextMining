Restaurant: La Parrilla
Category: Mexican
When I don't want to brave Howell Mill traffic or a twenty-minute wait for lunch at Nuevo Laredo, I head for La Parrilla. Six bucks gets you the classic Speedy meal and a soda. The service is fast, attentive and courteous, and I've never had to wait for a table. . . An added bonus: the chips and salsa hit your table the second your butt hits the chair.
