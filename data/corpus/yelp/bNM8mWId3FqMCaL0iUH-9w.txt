Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
I ordered the original french dip and it was superb. In addition, I would suggest ordering the purple pickled eggs that are sitting on the top of the counters. (Their color is rather off-putting however they are quite tasty) And although I myself am not a potato salad fan, I would have to say that this was the BEST potato salad that I have ever eaten. Philipe's is a must go to spot the next time you are in Los Angeles.
