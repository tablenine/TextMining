i love metro fresh! My husband and I have elected metro fresh as our new place to go and grab a healthy lunch! We have eaten here numerous times and haven't found something we haven't liked yet. Mango gazpacho? Southwestern chicken salad? delish!.... Â The portions are great and its inexpensive and healthy! . . P.S. Weeknights they offer discounts if you show your gym membership card!
