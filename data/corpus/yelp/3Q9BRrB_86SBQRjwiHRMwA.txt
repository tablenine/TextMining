Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
I'm sorry, but, this place was not what I expected.  I drive by it every day going to and from work, and have always wanted to stop in.  Maybe because it is right next to Tito's Taco's and that other walk-up taco spot, so, I expected it to be similar - a counter service, authentic style fast-food joint.. . It is waiter service only, and a weird mix of a 50's diner, and a dive restaurant.  There was a fancy fire pit outside, but with old picnic tables and picnic condiments on them, furthering the clashing themes of this restaurant.  . . My biggest complaint about this restaurant is the price.  $11 for a Hot Pastrami Sandwich, $7 for chili cheese fries, $2.50 for a soda - definitely NOT CHEAP.  I walked here from a bar, expecting cheap, drunk food, and was not happy with the prices.  Also, they are CASH ONLY, so that was annoying.. . All that said, the pastrami sandwich was delicious, as were the chili cheese fries.. . Bottom Line:  Go here for a night out, and only if you have a crazy craving for Pastrami.  Don't come here looking for cheap drunk food.  Do something else if that is what you want.
