Restaurant: Phoenix Restaurant
Category: Dim Sum
Nice atmosphere.  I prefer the push-cart method of dim-sum, so I'm partial to dim-sum places that serve in this manner.  Severely overcharged for a dish of gai-lan which somewhat turned me off to this restaurant.  Still prefer Jockey Wok &amp; Roll (despite their idiotic name) for dim-sum up in Schaumburg - note this place also runs the stall in Mitsuwa.
