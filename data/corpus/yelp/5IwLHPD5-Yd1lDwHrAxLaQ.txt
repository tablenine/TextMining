I am a huge fan of the chicken, tomato, and goat cheese crepe which is simply heavenly as well as hearty. It's almost too good because I finish the entire thing and have barely any room for dessert, which absolutely must be ordered here, and so I always do. And then I finish the entire dessert as well. Yes, I am a happy glutton. . . By the end, I need to roll myself out the door. And the quarters are a bit cramped and it hurts to have to suck my gut in as I try and maneuver myself around the tables. . . Oh, and order the Lindeman's framboise to drink. Not enough bars/restaurants sell this so it's always a treat to have if available.. . By the way, if La Creperie reads this- can you tell that one water boy of yours to stop stomping around so much? Heavy feet on a creaky wooden floor does not make for a relaxing dining experience. Just a thought.
