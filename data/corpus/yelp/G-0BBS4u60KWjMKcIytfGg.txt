Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
A few friends and I were looking for a place to grab a quick bite to eat before our Amazing Race and after driving in circles we all decided on Bottega Louie.  This was my first time there but always heard great reviews about this place.. . So when I first walked in I instantly started salivating from all the delicious looking pastries and what instantly caught my eye was the MACAROONS!  I LOVE MACAROONS  and good macaroons are always hard to come by.  I thought forget breakfast and lets just eat the sweet goodies.  So i purchased 4 macaroons: chocolate caramel, coconut, lemon and the raspberry flavor and I must say all were amazing! the plus side to buying the macaroons is they were packaged in a pretty purple box.. . For breakfast I got the New York Egg Sandwich which was two fried eggs, american cheese and applewood smoked bacon on a kaiser roll and a shot of espresso.. . Outcome:  Breakfast was definitely worth the price.  The sandwich was bigger then I expected and the shot of espresso was an eye opener.  The turkey sausage is also a must get, very flavorful and hearty in portions.. . I would highly reccmomend this place to others for breakfast.  I hear they also have brunch and is excellent for dinner.  I definitely would come back, in fact I plan to make a visit real soon to try the dinner menu and of course to refill on some macaroons...
