Restaurant: The Izaka-ya by Katsu-ya
Category: Sushi Bars
is this a restaurant or a sound sealed room where all the patrons seemed to speaking through megaphones?. came on a friday night without reservations and waited just 10 minutes for the sushi bar.  also found a regular parking space just across the street for free so was convenient.  . of course the ambiance is not the same as katsuya- this is your typical overpriced hole in the wall hipster environment.  . the food was ok- the sushi was fresh enough.  we had toro which was melt in your mouth fatty fresh, spanish mackerel, and something else i cant remember.  then we had braised eggplant which was way too salty, fried tofu, and a spicy tuna roll topped with rock shrimp tempura which was on the good side.  . our service was good- they appreciated that we couldnt swallow the salt garnished with eggplant and took it off our bill.  . would probably not come back unless i had low blood pressure requiring salt to sustain my life and sensorineural hearing loss.
