Since I love steak, one of my good friends recommend this place to me. Expect to pay a lot since this place is pricey. I took one of my friend to try it out. The steak there is delicious. Since we didn't make any reservations, we decided to eat close to the bar areas on one of those high tables. The ambiance was nice. They had music playing in the background. The food was great. Its definitely a nice place to take someone out for romantic date or special occasion. Parking can be tough so make sure to scope the area out first before going there. Luckily for us, we found street parking.. . Pros: Great steak; great ambiance. Cons: Parking
