Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
We (4 girls) ordered Combo B and we had more than enough...even a little left over.  Tea and Alcohol were included with our meal.  All of the meat was delicious...the sides were varied and plentiful, quickly being replenished as our meal went on.  I don't know what any of them are called but I tried it ALL and it was amazing.  . . The service was absolutely GREAT! We were so busy chatting and catching up, and they quickly caught on, cooked everything for us, replenished our dishes, and refilled our drinks without us ever having to stop our conversations to ask for anything...they were amazing! . . All of my friends loved the food and service and the convenient valet parking ($2-3 can't remember) was quick and efficient.  The only thing I would recommend is to make reservations if you will be there for dinner.  We were there on a Wednesday and it was completely full! Make reservations to save you some time but even if you have to wait, it is worth it.  . . With Combo B, each of the four paid $27 and that included food, drinks, tax, tip, and valet :D
