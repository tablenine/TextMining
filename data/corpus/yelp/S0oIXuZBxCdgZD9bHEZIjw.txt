Category: Dim Sum
I have a self proclaimed obsession with Dim Sum. And while on vacation (from Boston), I found an awesome place for dim sum.. . I've been to every single dim sum place in Boston's Chinatown, and this place actually had some things that I've never tasted back at home. I was particularly in love with this one entree, and I haven't been able to find it here in Boston.. . Overall, a very clean, yummy experience. The only downside was the wait. We went Sunday morning, so basically prime time.
