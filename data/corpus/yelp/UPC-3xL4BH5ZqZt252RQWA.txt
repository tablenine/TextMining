This is thee SPOT! The food, the wine, everything kicked butt!. . The pizzas are Â great. They sell wine by the glass, and have an excellent selection. The bartender cat was awesome and took care of us. Watch yourself with the desserts, they are SUPER RICH! A bit too sweet for me, though. . . Be warned this place is always booked, unless you're famous or good looking like me, you won't be able to dine in. That doesn't mean you can't get your classy drink on! . . Go forth!!!
