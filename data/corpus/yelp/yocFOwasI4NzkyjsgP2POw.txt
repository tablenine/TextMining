It's so cool that nothing changes at "The Dresden" [that's what we in the know call it] in the city of constant change.  The only place for lounge lizards, and aptly so, has been for years.  If you don't know what we are talking about and you are a little hesitant, rent "Swingers".  That movie aptly shows you all the slummin' glam of the place:  White naughahyde booths, the owner in bad leisuresuits, the food is absent (this is a tip, don't eat here!) and the action at the bar.  My Gosh I think they even have pecky cedar paneling if my rum-soaked memories are accurate.  Go!  One of the historically fun joints.
