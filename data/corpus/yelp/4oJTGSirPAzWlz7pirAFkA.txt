Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
I have going to Porto's since I remember...It is sooo delish.  The service is better now, I guess cus they opened a new store in Burbank, but I remember that we used to stand in line for over 1 hour.  Now the wait time is about 15 min. for bread and stuff, unless you go to the express side where its faster.  The place is bigger now and better.  But wait, let's talk about the food...wow those papas rellenas or potato balls are great.  They are sooo yummy you have to try them if there, but wait you also have to check out the tres leches cake.  The cake is sooo juicy and wet its better with dark black coffee.  Wow every cake I have tried is good.  Can't really say anything bad about this place.  The papa rellena sandwich is great too.  Just go and check out the menu...you will not be disappointed!!!
