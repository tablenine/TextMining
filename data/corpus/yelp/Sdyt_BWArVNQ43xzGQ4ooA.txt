Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
Sorry to go against the grain here, but I was not impressed. . . As my wife wrote on our blog, "It has a limited menu selection: salad, mashed potatoes, meat (fish or steak), &amp; soup. We got a combo hot plate, which was $10, too costly for four thin slices of steak, a small salad with few fixings, and mashed potatoes.". . She goes on to recommend Pluto's in Palo Alto, which I agree is much tastier, cheaper, and less pretentious, but it's 400 miles north of Culver City, so I doubt that matters to anyone reading this review. . . I'm sure this place is great for people who want to impress a date by eating quasi-healthy in a trendy atmosphere, but I would rather go to Trader Joe's, pick up some of my own tender greens, and save half the cost.
