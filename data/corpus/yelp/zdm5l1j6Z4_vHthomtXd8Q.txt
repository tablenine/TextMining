Wow. Just wow. I really enjoyed their pizza on so many levels. Quality toppings, great crust, and a cool environment to boot. . . The pizza came out warm and savory and the service was really great.I could taste the unique flavors of all the different toppings and they all still joined together to form an amazing pie. . . I do think their pizza tastes better hot. The slices we had at the end of the meal were still good, but not as great as the first slices we had. I think this will be our go-to pizza restaurant, but probably not our take out place.
