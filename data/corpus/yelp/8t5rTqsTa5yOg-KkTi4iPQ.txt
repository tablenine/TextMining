Restaurant: Hub 51
Category: American (New)
I've been here for my birthday dinner about a month ago, it was one of the few restaurants open on December 24, so I thought I'd give it a try, of course after checking out what my fellow yelpers have to say about it! We ordered bunch of stuff, one and the most delicious being the guacamole. I can't say enough about how good it is, and the corn on the bottom of it, so heavenly. I could see myself going to Hub 51 just for the guacamole oh and of course the huge carrot cake! They had a special holiday menu when we hit up this place, and one of the specials was egg rolls, yummy! We also loveeeed the sauces they were served with, and now I can't remember what they were, but they were delish. I got myself the grilled vegetarian burger and I think it was blah. I think it was the cashews that made it taste pretty bad, the patty was too sweet and the bun it came on was even sweeter, not really for my taste buds, at least not for dinner that's what the desert is for! Hubby loved the black bean turkey chili, but then again he loves chili to begin with! I had Hub Punch for drinks and it was yummy, definitely something I will get next time I'm in there. Carrot cake like everyone else agrees is beyond-this-world good! However it is HUGE, even I, having the sweeth-tooth that I have, wasn't able to finish this, so I brought the left over home, so I indulged in this piece of heaven 2 days in a row, yeeehhaaa!! I also loved the fact that other diners sang me happy birthday when my huge carrot cake with a candle on top was served, always love strangers who sing happy birthday to other strangers!
