I live in San Diego and only go to LA to see my in-laws who are very strange. Hide has gotten me to visit my in-laws on a bi-weekly basis since I discovered it. We drive to LA, I eat my fill of cheap, fresh raw fish, then when we get Â to the in-laws nap in the guest bedroom whille they do whatever strange things they do. It is a win win situation. A shame there is nothing this good in San Diego... . . Great service, great food, a shame it is a 100 mile drive from my house.. . See you next weekend Hide!
