This place is as close to Japan as it gets. The delicious pork broth with noodles and then you top it with their freshly minced garlic, makes my mouth water just thinking about it . To be safe, be sure whomever you go with eats the minced garlic too. I religiously order the combination with Ramen and Katsudon, all for only 13 bucks. . . You know a place is good when you have to wait an hour for 2 people and every restaurant around them are dead.
