food is upscale denny's .   servers look like they walked off the pages of nylon magazine, and try oh so hard to be silverlake cool, but fail miserably...they are borderline rude at times!  . . the best thing about this place?  the owners, who are sweet.. other than that,  they are lucky to have a cute place with a great location,  because the food sure doesnt make up for it.  . . spend your hard earned $ elsewhere.....
