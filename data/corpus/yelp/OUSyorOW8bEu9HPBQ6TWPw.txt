My first visit to Craft I was not ready to write a review.  I was overcome by goodness - what some may call sensory overload.  I tasted every dish with my most meticulous tongue.  I reviewed them to myself in a way that Tom himself would be proud. I had pork belly for the first time.  I had cauliflower for the last time (i just don't like that shit).  I was in lust with olive oil ice cream.  I thought this is why people eat.  This is what food was meant to be.  I am unworthy of critiquing this place.  It is in a class all it's own. . . Then I went back.  This time I was with co workers, not friends.  I drank to get drunk, not to compliment my dish.  I paid slight attention to calories and even less attention to my posture.  Everything changed.  It's like, visiting a college campus in the spring and then having to walk a mile to class in the snow once you're actually enrolled.  The napkins weren't as soft.  The lights weren't as... dim?  Whatever it was, I lost the magic. . . As far as the food went - no complaints, really.  I very much enjoyed all the first courses we odered - especially the tomato platter and the mackerel.  My main course was a finely cooked snapper and sides of mushrooms, potatoes, and sweet corn were all satisfactory.  All in all, a really OK dinner.  But there was no spark.  I'm over you, Craft.  It was fun the first time but maybe I was just desperate for something to do.  It's not me, Craft.  It's you.  I'm sorry.  Please don't call.  It hurts too much.
