Went here last night for my birthday.  Called to make a reservation.  Guy who answered the phone, Joey?.. Was the nicest guy ever, hilarious.  We got there right on time and they said it would be a few minutes and we could go to the bar.  Place is very small, very crowded and very loud.  But what place isn't? So we made our way over to the bar.  Bartender was very nice.  Got a drink quick.  Then our table was ready!  Our waiter was nice, kind of quiet.  Food was SO good! Only problem was I couldn't hear the person across from me because it was ridiculously loud in there.
