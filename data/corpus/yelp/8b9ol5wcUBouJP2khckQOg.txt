Has been 10 years since I've been to Greek Town; and Greek Islands did not disappoint.  Saganaki is WONDERFUL!  As a vegetarian, there are many good options.  No one was disappointed.  Free valet parking- and no wait for a party of 5 at 6pm.   . . Great food.  Did I mention that I love the saganaki so much I want to take it out behind the middle school and get it pregnant?  Thumbs up!
