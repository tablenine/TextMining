After having a spectacular experience my first time at Gloria's, I decided to go again and try their Carne Adobada. It was so flavorful. The pork was stewed in a delicious I believe adobo sauce and was well seasoned. Also, it even tasted great as left overs!!! :-) It reminded me of the stewed bistec that I had the first time. I also had the pupusas. Those pupusas with the cabbage salad and red sauce are so simple yet fabulous. The service was great as usual. Another thing is that their salsa was much better this time since it was not as watery as it was the first time. Â The thing that I love about this place is that there are no unnecessary bells and whistles. Gloria's just has great food and reasonable prices. This place is officially one of my favorites.
