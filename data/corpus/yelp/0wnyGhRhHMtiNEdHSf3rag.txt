I was super excited about the $5 happy hour special but ended up ordering off of the regular menu the whole night. Happy hour menu was really limited and didn't sound that great. There's really a martini for everybody and the waitress gave great recommendations all night. Drinks are pretty loaded too :) I hate really sweet drinks but "Strawberry Fields Forever" was SO GOOD! CAUTION: since everything tastes so amazing and you can't wait to try the next martini, plus you're tasting everyone elses, you reach a point where they all start tasting like juice and before you know it you look like me and my friends skipping down Fairfax Blvd in heels trying to hail a cab.. . You'll spend a long time in the bathroom looking at their AMAZING vintage celebrity photo collection plastered from ceiling to floor.
