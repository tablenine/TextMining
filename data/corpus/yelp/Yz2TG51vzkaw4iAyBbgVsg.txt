Went here for my girlfriends 21st bday last night and had a reservation at 7pm but of course, we (girls) were all running late so I called to change the reservation time and they did it with no problem. I took the birthday cake (violet's bakery) to geisha house before our reservation so that i wouldn't have to lug it around all night.. . We got dropped off by our limo at around 7:45pm and got seated right away in the booth that i requested (made me so happy that we got that booth) Tiffany was our server and she was awesome..she might have been a little annoyed with us at first because I was kind of drunk already but she warmed up to us. We were getting all the attention from everyone including the managers and other servers. We got a bunch of birthday shots and so i gave them a huge chunk of the cake :P. . Y'all helped make my girl friend's birthday so awesome and memorable! we'll definitely go back and chill with you guys!!. and good job getting me drunk Kel! Paid for the whole bill and tipped well ayee
