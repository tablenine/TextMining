Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
The Daikokuya ramen has a beautiful kotteri broth that clouded and melted into the noodles but never seemed to over power the wheat flavor of the noodle. Kurobuta pork, dark, thinly sliced and marbled with fat, comes simmering in the broth (rather than topping it) as well as on the side. With plenty of green onions topping, this made for a tasty bowl of ramen.
