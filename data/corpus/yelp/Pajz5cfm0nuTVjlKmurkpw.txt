I don't know much about wine (although I can pretend I do) but the selection and quality here was fantastic. Out of the 6 varieties our group tried there were no let-downs. I love the cozy atmosphere, the wooden walls, the really cool glass lights. We did not try the food but it smelled great. I have a feeling this will become a pre-date pre-game spot for my husband and I.
