Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
This is a "get away" spot right smack in the middle of the city. Perfect for first dates only because it has that feel of being secluded from the outside world. Just by driving there makes you feel excited, feels like an adventure already with some kind of a lonely winding upward road surrounded by forest trees enhance your anticipation of a great night ahead. The restaurant is literally on top of the mountain above everybody else, you somehow feel special, really. The restaurant itself looks like the emperor lives there, inside boasts of a mini Japanese garden (i think), the whole place generally is clean and well decorated. Service i would say is ok. Food was below par compared to the outside feel and great views this rare jewel exudes. It has this Benihana food taste (sorry), I mean, with the ambiance and all you'd expect something more, something unforgettable..... well, i could only wish. The sushi was ok as well as the steaks, not worth the price we paid for. If only the mountain top views could satisfy your taste buds....    :)--- location, location, location.    :(--- valet only! over priced Benihana-type menu.
