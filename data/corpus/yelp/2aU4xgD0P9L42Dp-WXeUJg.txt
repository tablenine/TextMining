Restaurant: Gladys Knight and Ron Winans' Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I'll come out and say it: This place gets great reviews because it's owned by Gladys Knight.. . The best things I can say are that we were seated quickly and our waiter was pretty hot.. . The food was either dry, bland, or both. Seriously, I make better fried green tomatoes, and I'm from the North.
