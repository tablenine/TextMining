Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Taste is one of my favorite restaurants.  It is a great alternative to the far more expensive options in the area.  The ambiance is cute and homey and the staff is always cheery and helpful.  The food has always been great.  This is a great place for a second or third date or just any romantic but not over the top occasion.  Definitely put it on your list!
