Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
"Waiter, there's a fly in my soup...and wine, and food, and water, and ... everywhere".. . I loved this place.  When I first moved here from NY Ping Pong was an Chinese Oasis in a desert of mediocre Midwest Chinese food.  Fresh food, great decor, nice staff.. . However over the years I've noticed each of those perks slowly descend into mediocrity.  It wasn't until a swarm of gnats joined us for dinner and the staff (that noticed yet) didn't bother to help that I've realized that the $20 entree really wasn't worth it.. . Order from Chen's.  No gnats....
