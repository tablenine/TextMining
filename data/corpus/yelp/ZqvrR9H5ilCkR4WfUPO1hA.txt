Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
It was okay.. . Our service was really spot-on.  The setting was great - they've done wonderful things with the space.  Much of the food was...fine.. . See, that's just it, though.  I wasn't expecting Bone's or Chop's or even Ruth's Chris level steak, but it was about Outback level.. And I'm not a snob on this one - I like Outback fine, but the prices seemed to suggest somewhere between those lines.. I'll try it again, some things sound good that I've not tried, and hey, sometimes a place just doesn't click with you.. . Some reports of unusual surcharge for bar seating with dinner, but I'll let more come out about that from other sources.
