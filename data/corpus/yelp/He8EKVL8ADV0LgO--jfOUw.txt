tasty place. as someone else said, the decor is really funny and random. we sat in "garlic lovers" lane or something like that...which was decorated really psychadelically and colorfully with really odd music playing. but the tables were very cute and intimate - each one had a little curtain and was kind of obstructed from other tables, which i kind of enjoyed. i saw they had a bar too, which seemed like an interesting place to wait for a date or so. . . i had the vegetable lasagna and my bf had the garlic pork chop, which was recommended by the waiter. the porkchop was very good - my lasagna was good too, but just typical veggie lasagna. oh, the bread they give you with butter and garlic oil was amazing! not that great of a selection of beer, but wine list looked good. . . kinda pricey - expect about 15-25 dollars a plate. also, the garlic seafood looked very tasty when i saw it go by - may come back for that sometime! . . service was very attentive, but it was a slow night.
