YUMMY FOR MY TUMMY!!! I always get the same thing when I go... The #22 that comes with your choice of chicken pieces, mac and cheese, greens and cornbread..OMG its enough to last me lunch and dinner, but then again I eat like a bird..lol.. I had my bday dinner here last year..food was yummy as usual Â and i think its a little on the expensive side but well worth it..
