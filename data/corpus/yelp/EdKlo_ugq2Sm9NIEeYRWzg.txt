First off, if you go here late at night, do not ask for a chocolate milkshake, and expect to hear a lot of insults and profanity.. . That said, i like their bag of fries. The sheer quantity of said bag of fries, in the cheddar cheese that is similar in texture and taste to the cheese you find on the chips at buffalo joes, makes me want to go here. The hot dog is an everyday hot dog you expect from any good fast food joint in chicago.. . Open late, but i've been here during the day as well when everyone is normal cause i wanted the cheese fries. Their not amazing or anything, but its close proximity, and predictable solid hot dog keeps me going back when i just want a normal hot dog.
