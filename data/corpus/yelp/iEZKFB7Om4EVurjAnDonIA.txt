Had a great time at Geisha house last night, the food was wonderful as well as the paired wine. . . Last night's lamb chop lollipops are exceptional, it is properly cooked, tender and has a wonderful balance of flavor, the Roseblum Zinfandel served was also a wonderful match with the food served. . . The highlight of the evening is definitely the dessert! Creme Brulee, beautifully plated with banana cobbler, cinnamon ice cream Â and berry cheese wonton. . . Would go back again but like most of the reviews, the waiters could use some improvement especially for a restaurant
