Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
One word: Outstanding! This place is simply one of the best sushi restaurants in the city. Try the spicy tuna or salmon with the crunchy roll, and I promise you won't be disappointed.. . A great spot, in a prime location, and perfect for a date night out. Watch out for parking though, it's rough in that area. Also, the weekends tend to be really busy, with wait times exceeding an hour sometimes. Also, Wednesdays can be rough, since it's hump day. . . Bottom line: This place is awesome, and if you are in the area shopping, or maybe seeing a movie at Landmark theater, and are in the mood for sushi, try out this place and I guarantee you'll love it!
