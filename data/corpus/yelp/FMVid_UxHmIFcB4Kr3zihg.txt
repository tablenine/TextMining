The cage of cured meat hangin' up front is either gonna make you go mmmmm or ewww!  But the real strength of this place is the mixing skills of the bartenders, and according to my fellow yelpers, the 'not-on-the-menu' burgers.. . Nice ambiance and a great in 'da cut location on Peachtree.  Good spot for a late night fix.  Easily accessible, free parking, open late, and good service.  Nice place.. . p.s.  thanks 'Gastro'
