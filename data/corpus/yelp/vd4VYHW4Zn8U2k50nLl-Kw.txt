BEST FRENCH TOAST- EVER!. . Fred's 62 is a diner located on Vermont St. in the Los Felis area where they're open 24 hours and they have a wide variety of dishes!  The joint has a 90210 "Peach Pit" vibe except it's not as squeaky clean, imagine more of a Swinger's Diner.  The servers are all pretty trendy w/ tats and piercings but  they're friendly and very helpful!. . The menu offers everything like spaghetti, brisket n' mashed potatoes, awesome salads, sandwiches, asian noodles like udon or soba and a huge breakfast section!  This place is perfect for after club hours.... . I've seen celebrities there and it's always crowded so try not to go during peak hours.  . . Fred's 62 is famous for their "Bearded Mr. Frenchy" which is french toast covered in corn flakes cereal...it's truly DEEEE~LICIOUS!  Crunchy on the outside and soft and gooey like a hot donut on the inside this plate is yummy!  I always order it w/ sausage patties which they make themselves.. . Everything on the menu is good and home made.  Open 24 Hours a day what more can you ask for?!?
