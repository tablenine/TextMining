Just came back home from LA and the in-laws sent us home with a box full of pastries from Porto's.  O-M-G!  The cheese rolls are DELISH!  It's a flaky pastry with sweet cream cheese in the center (DROOL!)  I'll be sad when the last roll is gone since there isn't anything that comes close to this goodness in San Francisco.
