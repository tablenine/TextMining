I had a great lunch meal here.  I had the Schwartzy on the waitress's recommendation and was not dissapointed.  My wife and I also split a plate of cheese covered fries. I topped it off with a Brooklyn egg cream which was also great.. . While the sandwiches were great, I didn't think there was anything awsome about the fries (they were very good).  My wife and I also tried the desert a few nights later and didn't find anything about the chocolate or carrot cakes to write home about. At some point I'd like to come back and try their breakfast foods.. . The lines seem long for most of the day.  We got there at 2pm on a Saturday and had to wait 30 minutes.  On the other hand, we came back a few days later at 8pm for desert and were seated immediately.
