Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
The line wasn't so bad today.  Maybe because it's Friday or maybe because the restaurant was closed briefly back in February after a health inspector visit (. http://latimesblogs.la.... ).  . . Anyway, the sandwiches are still great.  You've got to get them double dipped.  They're even tastier that way.  Make sure to get a pickle on the side too.  The cheesecake is delicious and the lemonade is fresh squeezed.. . This place has over 1000 reviews but it is definitely not overrated! If you're in downtown, you should try this place at least once.
