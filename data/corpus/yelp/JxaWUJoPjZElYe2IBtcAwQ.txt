Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
After spending three days eating concert food at Lollapalooza I was looking for some real Chicago food.  I remember hearing about this place on the Food Network back home.  My bf wanted to stop by to try something called the pizza pot pie.  . . So we made the stop here and we were not disappointed.  I got the meatball grinder the bf ordered the pizza pot pie.  Everything was delicious.  The grinder was huge, I ate half with the bf's help, the pizza pot pie was also awesome, bf said it was the best pizza he has ever had.  We will definitely make a stop here on our trip to Chicago next year!  I can't wait!
