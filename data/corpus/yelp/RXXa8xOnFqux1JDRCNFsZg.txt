Every time my gay friend Christian takes me and my non-gay little lady to *that side* of town, I have no idea what to think.  Like I literally have no idea where we are about to go.  And yet he surprised us yet again.. . I love the Alcove. Their food is yummy (enough), their chocolate chip cookies are totally melty inside, and the patio seating is as wonderful as patio seating could be.  I like that on a busy Saturday, the nice guy that worked there helped people find seats.  Otherwise I get too much anxiety trying to find my own table.
