The food here is pretty solid but for some reason I dont dig the overdesigned burgers.  . . I think a lot of it is bc I got more of an old school liking to how theyre done.  They gotta be grilled not pan fried like they are here.  Burger meat cant be soggy (juicy is good but soggy isnt) all the way through.  It needs a little bit of texture and little bit of bounce which you only get by grilling it.  And have a slightly chewy kaiser type roll instead the foofy french roll.  . . And the burgers just arent that big either.
