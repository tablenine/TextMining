I haven't been here in awhile and my sister and brother-in-law were in town and wanted to go for my brother-in-law's brother's birthday, so we went!  The wait was about 40 minutes at both this location and the one next door (we put in our names at both places to see which one we'd get first - we obviously got called at this one first).  I hate waiting to get seated at restaurants and I thought 40 minutes was a bit of a wait.  I'd have to say that their shao long baos were pretty good but the portions are definitely small.  We ordered about eight "cages" of dumplings with three bowls of noodles (their bowls of noodles are pretty small - they only fill about half the bowl) for six people.  That amounted to about $90 dollars total for the bill, which i thought was pretty pricey for a chinese restaurant!  The service was definitely lacking - it was busy, but it's ALWAYS busy, so they should have the routine down by now - we had to ask for water twice before it came and when we wanted to order more food, it was hard to know weather the waitress acknowledged our request.  Our tea kettle was difficult to get refilled and they didn't let us eat the cake that we brought for my brother-in-law's brother's birthday!  WTF?  I was kinda pissed cuz we had to hold that cake for 40 minutes in the hot weather and we spent about $100 at their restaurant and they wouldn't let us eat the cake that we brought!!  I have never heard of a restaurant that didn't let customers do that!
