Category: Sandwiches
This is a great place to stop between Olvera Street and Chinatown--delicious and cheap sandwiches, cheap coffee (yes, it's 9 cents), and a wide variety of sides and breakfast items. Most people come here for the french dip. It's pretty damn good--I recommend the beef and cheddar, double-dipped. . . However, what gives this that extra star for me is that nearly everything (the sandwiches, the potato salad, the cole slaw and even the coffee and pies) taste like the food my Grandma used to make when she was still alive. The atmosphere is nostalgic as well, with old phone booths lining one wall, vintage signs for the rail trains, and bench-style seating.. . The only downside is the wait. I've waited up to an hour to order *(you get the food right after you order). I guess the upside to that is that there's plenty of time to decide on which pie to order (they're all delicious!). ALSO make sure to hit up the ATM or use the ATM on-site. CA$H ONLY.
