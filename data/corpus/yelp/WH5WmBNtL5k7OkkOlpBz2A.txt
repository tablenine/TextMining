The Scoutmob-Tour-of-Atlanta continued this morning/afternoon with a trip for brunch at Babs.  Upon entrance to Babs, we were overwhelmed with a staff willing to help us with whatever we wanted.  One thing can certainly be said of Babs: the quality of service is excellent.  We were well taken care of during the entire meal, and the staff was extremely friendly.. . The second thing to note about Babs is this: for what you pay, you will get a veritable feast.  All of the dishes were enormous given the price, and while the menu was small the variety between dishes was great.  There were a lot of options, from the standard waffles, eggs, and sausage (my choice) to a "stromboli" of sorts.  The fruits served with each dish were fresh and delicious, and not your standard grocery store pineapple-melon-cantaloupe-grape mix.  We're talking fresh strawberries, orange slices, and huge apple wedges (this should be a model for other aspiring brunch places).  The only reason Babs gets 4 stars rather than 5 is because I was slightly disappointed in the quality of some of the other food.  Their potatoes were perfect, and their eggs scrambled exactly how I like them, but the waffles left a lot to be desired.  The texture of the waffles was too dry, and it was difficult to get through a whole waffle without drowning it in syrup.  The pork sausage that - by request - accompanied the waffle was cooked just a bit too long, and was a little chewy for my tastes.  . . Normally, these issues would be enough for me to knock this down to a 3-star, but the exceptional service, good atmosphere, and general attitude of the staff definitely earns them enough of a bonus to get to 4 stars.  If you're looking for a nice, relaxing Sunday brunch, this is your place.
