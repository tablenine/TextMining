Really fast service. The burgers are just like In-n-out, but not quite as good. The setup was like a bar; you just sit down and the waiter will take your order. This is troublesome if you want to have your burger there because of the limited seating, but we just took our burgers to go. If you're craving a burger, you might as well go to In-n-out, avoid the line, and have a better burger.
