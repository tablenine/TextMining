Restaurant: Oinkster
Category: Burgers
So we ate at the Oinkster this past Saturday evening, and it was surprisingly quiet.  Was this because it was the Saturday before Easter, or is it because Eagle Rock is dead on the weekends?  I dunno, because this was our first time visiting the "Rock".  Speaking of first times, it was my first time at an Andre Guerrero restaurant .  Considered by some as one of the best valley chefs and a member of the slow food movement, I wanted to see what the fuss was all about.  . . The decor of the place seemed to me a time warp from the 60's, however it was very clean and intersting to look at, especially all the formica.  The bathrooms are interesting as they are accessed outside, and when you open the door you are facing the parking lot.  . . On to the food, oinkster make a mighty fine smoked pulled pork sandwich.  Porky flavor is high to quite strong, just the way I like.  I asked for barbeque sauce and they handed me some of that vinegary sauce that you can find in North Carolina.  I did find the pork a tad salty, and I thought that they could have underseasoned the dish a little more.  I ordered a side of the Belgian fries and they were perfectly crisp with no hints of waxiness.    Also, I tried the classic burger which was good, but not great.  I personally love the Houston's burger.  We tried some of the ube ice cream from fosselman's which was tasty with hints of freshly toasted coconuts.  . . Drinks- Stella Artois on tap!!  Pretty good considering its a diner.. . In summary, I would come back to Oinkster if I was in the area.   However, I do not deem it as a place where I would drive to on a whim from west hollywood.  I do need to try the pastrami next time I am back.  Go there if you are in Eagle Rock.
