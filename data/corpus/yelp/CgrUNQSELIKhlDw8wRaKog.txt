The place is very trendy and the decor is vibrant. Plus you hear lots of people talk about accidentally bump into a celebrity if you eat here. But it's not about the celebrity sightings, it is about the food. Food is mediocre and it is really expensive. It's not worth the price!!! Plus parking was really hard to find.
