The service is great, the staff is always friendly.. . The everyday beer list is good, and they also have a list of special beers that seems to change every month or so.  Last time there I tried the Brother Thelonious" and liked it a lot.. . The veggie burger was very good.  As was the fried rueban, and mac and cheese.  The wings are ok, but I wish they had more sauce flavors.. . They have a pool table, shuffleboard, and golden tee in the back.
