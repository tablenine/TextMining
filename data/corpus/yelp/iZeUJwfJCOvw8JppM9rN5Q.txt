Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
It's like sitting in Ensenada on Spring Break minus the boys minus the booze  Yum Yum.  . . My friends and I love this little easy joint and you can build you tacos high with all the fixings... it's like a salad bar for your tacos.  Cheeeeeap goooood!
