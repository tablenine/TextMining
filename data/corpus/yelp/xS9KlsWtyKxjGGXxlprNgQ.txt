Restaurant: Seasons 52
Category: American (New)
Seasons 52 is on my list of top 5 healthy, but delightfully tasty restaurants. Of course the restaurant is called seasons because they change their menu for each of the four seasons. . . The restaurant itself is very sophisticated to me. Its very dark with dim lighting which creates an atmosphere of intimacy. . . Our waiter took his time and let us know about some of their "favorites". I chose the trout potatoes and asparagus. My friend chose the salmon with potatoes and asparagus. I was kinda jealous because although my food was really good, his salmon was AMAZING. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. If I wasnt in St. louis right now I might head over there just to get some. The potatoes were soooo good and the aspragus was perfectly cooked. I really had no complaints. The sweet tea was perfect also. . . The food is worth the price. . . Outstanding service!!!
