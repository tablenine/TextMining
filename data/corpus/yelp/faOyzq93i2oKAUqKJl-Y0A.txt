Canter's is a favorite to me, but not because of its pastrami, no, its because of their pickles and fries, and thee huge menu. . I have to say, sadly, that Langers has better pastrami, but in Canter's defense, they're better at everything else, and have things that Langers doesn't have, and its open all day:]
