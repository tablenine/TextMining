Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Compared to Tajima in San Diego (which I think is the best ramen in San Diego), Daikokuya wins hands down.. . Apparently, if I remember correctly, I learned that the ramen is "tokyo style"  from a Japanese friend of mine where the ramen is a bit thicker than usual.  Also the ramen soup base is made with pork and the fat adds more of a robust and sweet flavor to it.  I heart pork.. . The pals and I went following a Clippers game to satiate our hunger.  Daikokuya was worth the wait.  While there were other ramen places open with no lines, there was a line into Daikokuya.  We waited 45 minutes.  LOL. . Then, I forgot the word, but you can order more ramen if you have left over broth.  It only costs $1!!!  Apparently, T (Japanese friend) said that not all ramen houses have this option.  I felt lucky and fat and full.. . I slept well that night.
