Excellent martinis.  Average food.  Kinda tool baggish clientele.  Bring friends and head there early (happy hour $5 martinis) if you're gonna go.  Be prepared to be hit on ladies and watch your drinks because Uncle Roofus has been known to make appearances here.. . The 3-star rating is for the drinks, the happy hour and for the fact that they serve food till 2.
