Came with a grp of girls for a birthday celebration. They took reservations for us. We made it for the happy hour (I think it was Wednesday night before 7pm). All you can eat shabu (beef only). The meat looked fresh and tasted delicious. Vegetable selection was good, cabbage, mushrooms.. Service is awesome!! Also, we got free sparklies (champagne bottle) because it was one of our birthdays!
