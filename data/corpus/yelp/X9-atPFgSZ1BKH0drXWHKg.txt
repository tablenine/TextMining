Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
Went here for the first time on Friday night before a show at the Lakeshore Theater and I was very pleased!  Our server was awesome and funny!  She made you feel at ease and checked on us regularly.  . . I had the blueberry pancakes which were very yummy and plenty of food.  I also had a side of bacon.  Now bacon is one of my favorite things to eat and I enjoy eating it very, very crispy - close to burnt.  Time and time again I tell servers at other diners "well done/burnt bacon" and it comes back soggy and mushy.  But not at Stella's!  It was absolutely perfect and I got 6 strips!  Mmmmmm....  My fiance got the Mexican jolt - an omelet skillet - and he was very pleased.  Lots of ground beef, eggs done right, and overall a lot of food.  . . This placed rocked and we will definitely be going back!  Thank you Stella's! :)
