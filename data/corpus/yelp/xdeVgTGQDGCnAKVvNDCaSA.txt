it's all in the bread.... that's what make a sandwich a sandwich and panes has definitely mastered that.  . i'm normally at panes when i'm "working from home" or "sick" as i'm normally too hungry to wait in line over the weekend.  my last visit, 11AM  on a weekday, i still waited...and waited...and waited.  deliciousness takes some time, i get it, but it was bordering ridiculous time span given a) they are sandwiches not steak or souffle people! and b) there were only (2) other people ahead of me, also staring into space awaiting their order.  once my bag of caprese sandwich and chips is in hand, i seem to forget about the painful wait as i continue to go back...
