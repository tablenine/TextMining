Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
The most overrated tacos in Los Angeles, which puts it high in the running Â  for most overrated worldwide. . . Basically, these tacos are like greasy pitas filled with a bunch of cheese. I like cheese as much as the next guy, but I resent it when I fill like cheese is being used to cover up something. . . The queso is closed! Count me OUT, amigo.
