had lunch today. been here a handful of times now and every time very consistent. hainan chicken is delicous and tried the shrimp rolls today which were piping hot and tastey as well. so been to singapore and went to the famous food market where anthony bourdain blessed the hainan chicken stand. i thought my taste buds were going to be Blown away! but eh i think savoy is just as good and it's a lot cleaner and not so stinking hot like it is in singapore with flies and dirty trays while eating in a 100 plus temperature over crowded outdoor food court. This joint gets super packed for lunch so make sure to come early or you'll be waiting. outside seating area is nice and they seem to sell lots of past and some soup dish i have yet to try.
