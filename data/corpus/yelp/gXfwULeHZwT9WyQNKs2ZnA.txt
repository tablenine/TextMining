amazing grits!!!  so creamy and yummy.  i usually always get the piedmont omelette with the grits.  add this with coffee and tip and your bill will be around $15, but it's worth it.  if you stay at the grand hyatt, you can roll out of bed and waltz down to the flying buscuit and i promise you'll have a great day!  oh yeah, the biscuits are good too!
