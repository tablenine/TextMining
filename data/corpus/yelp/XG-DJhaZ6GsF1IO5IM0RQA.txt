There are 3 things to get here. The drinks are awesome although with such an extensive list, I have not tried all of them. Fantastic ceviche! And stick with the apps/tapas. The entrees are good but the other things blow it away. I won a free Timeout dinner so went in on the 3rd for it and it was a Latin BBQ dinner. The guac was underwhelming. The salads they gave us were pretty unipue inclding a chimchurri rub potato salad. ANd the gaucho strip steak skewer was cooked to perfection. And the Beertails were awesome and a great deal at $5. Good service in a great setting.
