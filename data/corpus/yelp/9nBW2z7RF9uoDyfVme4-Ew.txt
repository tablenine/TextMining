Category: Seafood
I'm a huge fan of The Hungry Cat and have been going here often for over a year now.. . The food is fantastic and they always have a delightful special. If you love raw fish, oysters, clams, lobster, sea urchin, soft shell crab and so on, you will love The Hungry Cat.. . If you're not a huge fish fan, then try the Pug Burger, it's incredible!. . I had my first Oyster and Sea Urchin here, both were marvelous. I have since become an oyster connoisseur so to speak and can vouch for their exquisite selection.. . The Hungry Cat is always adding new dishes to the menu and swapping things out, which makes it very exciting for the regulars. Although sometimes I do go with a particular dish in mind and it isn't on the menu. I have never left disappointed in the food though.. . For me, eating out is all about the experience and The Hungry Cat takes every step in providing an enjoyable one. The service is outstanding. The food is select. And the drinks are unbeatable. Their mixologist on staff seems to be at the top of her game as I have never had better concoctions. Seriously, never doubt the drink special, it will surprise you. The modern curves and neutral colors promote a chill atmosphere. Perfect for a date, business meeting or casual night out. . . They also do a lovely Sunday brunch.
