Restaurant: Toast

Marscapone-stuffed french toast with fresh berries: OMG. So ridiculously good I can't even explain. Due to their hideously long lines (1 hour wait at 8AM on a Saturday? Isn't everyone still sleeping? wtf?) I've only had it once but still dream about it. If you get a table, please order it. They lose a star for the horrible wait times. If I were ever able to ACTUALLY EAT THERE again, I think I wouldn't hesitate to give a full 5. It's a bummer.
