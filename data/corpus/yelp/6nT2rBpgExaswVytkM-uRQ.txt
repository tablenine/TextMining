Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This place is my guilty pleasure...guilty? Because when I leave here I'm in shock of all that I ate. I always have to have the Chicken breast, greens, mac &amp; chesse, corn bread, egg &amp; chesse with onions and of course the waffles. MMMMmmmm. It's sooo good. Best fried chicken ever. Not greasy like KFC (right next door). Full plump breast. I've been to the O.G. one on Gower St. Super small. This location is very big. Seats big parties. I'm here during the week so never have to deal with the crowds.
