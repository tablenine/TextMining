I was a little annoyed because they wouldn't seat us until our entire party of 4 was complete (3 of us were already there) even though the place was fairly empty. I mean, I get it - restaurant policy and all.. but really. If you let us sit first, we'd probably end up just eating more. So we waited a good 45 minutes while tables sat empty. Sad, tragic, and very very hungry. . . So anyway, the food was pretty damn good though. I had pancakes with carmelized bananas for a late lunch (that's how I roll), and fresh juice. The fresh OJ here is damn good, but I had them customize a sunrise (half OJ half lemonade), and it's kind of the best version I've had so far. . . Nice space with the version of diner food that you'd actually crave. And yes, they're anal about no substitutions.
