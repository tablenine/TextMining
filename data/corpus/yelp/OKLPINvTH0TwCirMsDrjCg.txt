Expensive but good food. Great beer selection (on tap).  . . I love their sweet potato fries and they make a pretty good burger.  It's not the best I've ever had, but its definitely tasty.  Sometimes hard to get a table, but if your group spreads out and waits for people to leave, you can snag a good table.  The only problem with this is when you are the group that's hanging out/ already sitting down it gets annoying to have people watching you eat/ waiting for you to leave.. . Good food, great beer selection, great place.  . . BTW, they have two locations, one in Santa Monica and one by Helms Bakery in Culver City.  The Culver City one is much bigger and has a cooler set up so I'd recommend going there over the Santa Monica one.
