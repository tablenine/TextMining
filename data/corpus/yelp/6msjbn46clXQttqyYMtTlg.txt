We decided to make a trip here before the Michael Buble concert (I know, you're jealous!) on a Friday evening around 6 and it seemed to be pretty crowded already.  Although there was no wait, we had to scope out a table for a while before sitting since it's a first come first serve basis.  I was greeted quickly by a waitress and got my order in quickly.  I already knew what I wanted: Burger (Medium) + sweet potato fries.  The waitress took my credit card to open a tab and I sat down.  Service was excellent I might say, since our food came out relatively quick and there are people constantly cleaning and picking up your plates.  Well what can I say that others havent said about the food? The burger was cooked perfectly and I absolutely loved all the ingredients in it - bleu cheese, grilled onions, spinach...and a juicy patty cooked perfectly the way I want it! The bun was sweet and soft, not chewy and stale like other places.  And the sweet potato fries....mmm a little bit a heaven! Came out smoking hot and fried to perfection...Came with a delicious garlicky sauce.. . The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the prices were a bit steep ($12 for burger, $7.50 for fries) and I had to wait a while to close out my tab since you have to go back to the bar to close out your tab and pretty much wait to get a waiter's attention while they are preparing drinks for everyone else.  Other than that, service was fab, food was delish, and it was a very chill atmosphere.  I will definitely come back here again!
