Wow didn't know Pastrami could taste this good. Been on my hit list of the Best Thing I Ever Ate from the Food Network. Today was the number 19 pastrami sandwich with cole slaw, rye bread, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing. I also ordered a side of the crinkle fries. Those came out hot and fresh. The food we ordered came out so quick. Langer's has provided me with the best Pastrami sandwich I have ever eaten. The meat was juicy and tender. The taste never got boring like other pastrami sandwiches I've had at other spots. This is a must try spot if you like pastrami.. . Recommendation: #19 Pastrami Sandwich and Crinkle fries.
