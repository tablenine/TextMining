The food here was excellent.  Hubby and I both had the lobster/shrimp linguine pasta.  I also had the fisherman's stew.  Everything was tasty, even the bread was unique (it had olives in it).  The only thing we didn't like was the macaroni, definitely not the worst, but not the best either.  The restaurant is also really nice and the service was pretty good.  The drinks were a bit pricey, so we didn't order any.  Overall, I would and plan to visit again.
