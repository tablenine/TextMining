The Greek food here is bar-none.  So much has been said already, but my two cents: Stop here on your way to a picnic and get a loaf of bread and a container of freshly made hummus.  You can't go wrong.  If you want to eat in, everything that I've had has been delicious and ready really fast.  Last time I was there, I had a falafel wrap and, like I always, I left stuffed and happy.. . Oh, and their tzatziki sauce is drool-worthy.
