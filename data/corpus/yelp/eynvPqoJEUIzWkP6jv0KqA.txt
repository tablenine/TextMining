Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I found Griddle Cafe through a Yelp search and also received this recommendation from someone who has never even eaten there (she has heard about it from Kevin Smith on TV). I thought I'd give it a try, since I'm a big breakfast and pancake fan. We have a couple of great pancake places in Denver, so this place had to serve a really great pancake to get 5 stars. I arrived to find people waiting outside. I walked in and there were 5 seats open at a counter. The host was saying that no one wanted to sit at the counter. I piped up and said, "I will. It's just me - 1 person." So I sat down without a wait on a Saturday morning (3/13). My waiter was helpful in giving me recommendations on their most popular pancakes. I ended up getting the Banana Nana. When he brought out the pancakes, they were bigger than the plate! They come in a stack of three. They are fluffy, moist, and amazing. Griddle Cafe also has 100% real maple syrup. This is my kind of place. I could only eat half of my pancakes... and unfortunately didn't take them with me as I was traveling and I don't think they would have kept well. If you are going with your spouse or even a friend who likes to share food, I'd say split an order of pancakes. Next time I'm in the LA area, I will definitely be back to the Griddle Cafe. Great service, great food, and great location. Oh, there's on-street metered parking (1 hour limit) and some up the street that is free for 1-hour. But if there's a wait, you probably won't be in and out in under an hour. There is also a garage on Fairfax/Sunset for $2 for every 30 minutes. If you're familiar with the area, you may be able to find free, on-street parking that doesn't require a neighborhood permit.
