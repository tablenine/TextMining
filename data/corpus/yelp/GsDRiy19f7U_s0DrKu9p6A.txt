I, along with a couple other softballers, randomly ended up at Silver Cloud last night, to eat a late dinner and have a couple beers after trying a couple other places in the area that were too busy.  Who knew Wednesdays were such a hot night in Wicker Park!  I'm not sure why, but Silver Cloud was almost empty.  There were plenty of outdoor tables available and plenty available inside as well, which was surprising considering how packed the other places that we stopped were.  But anyway, on to the more important things... . They have a nice beer selection, with a variety of beers on tap that are were new and unfamiliar to me.  I can't remember the names of the ones we tried for the life of me, but I guess that's just a testament to how good they were!  For dinner, I had the Cloud Cobb Salad and my dinner companions had the Jerk Chicken Wings Appetizer, a side of the sweet potato casserole and the other had the Cloud Basso-linguine with blackened chicken, onions, tomatoes, basil, garlic and parmesan cheese.  It also came with a house salad.  The food was very good.  It all came out hot and the portion sizes were large.  I have never seen a salad the size of mine in my life.  I maybe made it about half way through.  The jerk chicken skewers were also good-very flavorful but a little on the small side.  It was perfect for 1 person, wouldn't be enough for 3 or more.  . The bartender and servers were very friendly and pleasant.  We happened to have a server in training and the regular server waiting on us, which made things a little confusing at times, but all in all we were well taken care of.  . A nice, laid back chill place to go to enjoy dinner and company.   I would go back.
