Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
3.5 stars!. . What an experience. Like all other large groups, my friends and I waited 1.5hrs to be seated. We killed time by reading FML posts off of someone's iPhone...hilarious good times! Our party's name was called and it was MANDATORY that at least 11 [out of the 12] of us were present and visible.. . Once we got into the fisherman-themed, small restaurant we were bibbed and ready to go. The waitress was allowed to split the bill of our party 3 ways - since it would be easier for all us, so that's a plus. My section ordered 1 lb. of king crab legs w/the "whole sha-bang" of spices, 1 lb. of shrimp w/the "whole sha-bang" of spices also, fried calamari and sweet potato crabs. There was no ounce of healthiness whatsoever - it was just pure fried decadence.. . We enjoyed everything. It came out nice and hot and flavorful. The bill payment went by smoothly and we left w/big bellies. Would I come back again? Probably some day - I can eat a good amount of seafood, but not all the time, and if anything I'd go w/a smaller group. While it was an experience of eating seafood messily w/your hands, I don't think I can wait over 30mins for a meal again.
