Restaurant: f2o Fresh To Order
Category: Sandwiches
One of the many ways to my heart is through an exceptional salad...accompany that with an equally tasty sandwich and you've got yourself a really happy girl! . . I first dined on a "F2O" meal while at a lunch meeting for work. Delicious, but given that the food had been pre-ordered by my office I took what was given to me without a choice. They had prepared a little "lunchbox" per say which included the following, YUMMY sammmmich, regular chips, and a delicious super over sized (try to have just one bite... I bet you can't) cookie. After having eaten this lunchbox meal I knew that F2O and I were in for a new relationship of much much love. . . My now staple meal at F2O is the Chopped Salad with all of it's little chunks of lettuce, the smothering of crisp bacon, mouth watering Gorgonzola cheese, scallions, and fresh tomatoes. . . AND... . . The Chicken Tender Sandwich. This really is one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. The bread is nice and crusty but not hard to bite into. The chicken tenders are seasoned and cooked better than any I've ever experienced. . . They have delicious mint flavored lemonade and their soups are pretty steller as well. I can not say enough about how much I love F20, just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate! . . ** The only downfall is that it is a little on the pricey side for a Sandwich and Salad. However, it is possible to order a 1/2 Sandwich and 1/2 Salad... but, who would want only half when the food is this good???? :-) . . Eat Here! You won't be dissatisfied!
