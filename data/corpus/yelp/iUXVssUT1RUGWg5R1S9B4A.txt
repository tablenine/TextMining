I live very close by, and when we moved in, I thought we'd be eating here all the time. The chicken and sides are good, not great. The staff is very friendly and warm. The one thing that is GREAT at feed is the breakfast and brunch. We make it a point to take people when they come in from out of town. Great backyard patio in the summer time.
