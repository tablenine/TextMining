Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Ode to the famed burger.  Oh how many love thee.  Oh how "I" love thee.  Thank goodness that El A has kept Apple Pan around.  The servers have probably worked there for 30+ years and keep the customers coming and going at a pretty fast pace. You almost feel as if someone will chew their gum obnoxiously and say "Mel, kiss my grits." I love the old horse shoe counter and the no frillsness that the place has to offer.  Nothing like a good old fashioned hamburger or cheeseburger and great crisp fries, complete with coke from a can.  I am not a fan of the sauce they put on the burgers so I order without.  If you have room after your meal,  there are some pies like grandma used to make.  Thanks to Apple Pan, you can get a taste of yesteryear.
