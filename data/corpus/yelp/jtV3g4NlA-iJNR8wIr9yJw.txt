Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
Always have to come here when I'm visiting the city.. some of the best wonton noodle soups, and roasted suckling pig I've ever had.  Opens late till 4am! Went there after going out and it's a good sobering food. I'm all about the hole in the walls and this tops the list.  Very heavy and greasy though.. and can't have it everyday.
