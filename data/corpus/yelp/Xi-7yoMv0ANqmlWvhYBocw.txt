The best ramen I've ever had in my life. The broth, the flavor, the noodles, everything is perfect. The broth doesn't taste like they over did it with the msg, like at other places I've tried. The wait can get very long, but it is well worth it! I have yet to find a place in San Francisco, or anywhere else for that matter, that serves ramen as perfect as Daikokuya. I wish they could open one in SF!
