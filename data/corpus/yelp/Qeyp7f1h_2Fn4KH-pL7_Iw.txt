Probably one of my favorite gourmet burgers! Mouth- watering premium quality, pink-center meat. Not a goat cheese fan, but they promised it would be mild, and mild it was! The bread is also so soft and easy to chew. Everyone knows, NO substitutions or additions, but hey, you don't reallly need ketchup do you? Pricey, but worth it on the occasional visit! Friendly bar-tenders, especially for LA.
