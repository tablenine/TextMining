on wednesday, in the spirit of st. patty's day, bf and i decided to try out langer's. i ordered curbside take-out of the #19 and #88 and a side of fries.. . picking up my order was super easy and took just a few seconds. i made a right off alvarado and pulled over alongside the firelane. someone came out within 2 seconds and swiped my CC. . . grabbed bf and we headed over to ladera park, which is right by his work, to eat our sandwiches, picnic style. . . YUM. the pastrami really does melt in your mouth. i wasn't a huge fan of the corned beef but the bread on that sandwich was so perfectly grilled and golden, that the sandwich was still delicious. bf preferred the corned beef over the pastrami sandwich, said it was one of the best reubens he can ever remember having. ( brownie points for me for finding this place, thanks yelp! :P ). . i could only finish a quarter of each sandwich, so i ate about 1/2 a sandwich total. but i'm a pretty poor eater some days, it's hit or miss. bf is an average eater and ate what would be equivalent to probably 3/4 of a sandwich. so there were lots of leftovers, bf was happy about that, and ate them for lunch the next day. the meat kept well, even though the leftovers sat in my car for about 30-45 min while i went shopping right after lunch.. . the fries were okay, a little soggy by the time we got to them. but there msut have been 8 million of them. which was good, because when squirrels started to attack us at the park, we had a lot of fries to throw at them and distract them from attacking our sammiches. . . i definitely want to go back to try their other sandwiches too. however, this place is REALLY REALLY expensive. i can't afford sandwiches like this during a recession, man! especially when im still in grad school and not making any money. Â so maybe i will wait until 2010 to go back...
