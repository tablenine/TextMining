Came here on a Tuesday night at 7:30pm. We didn't have a reservation and place was only about half full, so we didn't need one. By the time we left at 9:30pm though it was a little busier. We brought 2 bottles of good wine and I luv that they don't have a corkage fee here.. . For tapas we ordered the Asparagus (good), fried artichoke &amp; ham dish(ok), cheese plate (ok), stuffed dates (good), Rosemary Prawns (good), and the Lamb Chops (good). Then for dessert we had the churros with the dark chocolate dipping sauce. The bill came to $85 plus tip. Over all it was a good little meal and the wine was good because we brought it ourselves.
