For my friends and I, this is our work place luncheon getaway.  On those slower fridays, we have a lot of fun heading over here for lunch.  The beers are great, nothing too fancy, but nice micro brew standards.  We're still not sure if the Mug Club is going on, but it's deffiantely a bonus for regulars.  . . The burger menu has been redone and each is unique and fun.  Although some stand out much better than others, these are great.  The mac 'n cheese, pot pie, fried chicken, Rueben...yeah...all tasty tasty bar food.. . My problem though, is that the prices are a little higher than what they should be but eh...eat drink and be merry.
