Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
Sushi Gen is, in my mind, one of the PREMIER sushi bars in the Los Angeles area.  Speaking not only from myself but friends and family also, Sushi Gen has super fresh, super delicious sashimi and sushi on a regular basis.  The quality of the fish combined with the just moderate price makes it #1 in my book.. . For those on a budget date I suggest splitting the Sashimi Deluxe plate.  It is more than enough food to split between 2 people.  And if you aren't quite full, theres always great dessert in Japanese Villiage Plaza ^_^!!. . Come early or make reservations, it gets crowded!!
