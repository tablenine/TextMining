Sure, I'll just toss this on top of the other 500-something rants. A drop in the bucket, but hey, let my growling tummy be heard. It's much like my distended belly, piled high with ramen noodles, scrumptious melt-in-your-mouth slabs of kurobuta pork belly (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ), giant brown marinated boiled egg, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, sesame seeds. And the pork broth -- oh, the creamy savory sinfulness. I imagine a roiling hot jacuzzi with sweaty succulent piglets relaxing in the rich stock, letting their porky sweetness cut loose. Ah, yeah. (If that doesn't make you salivate, I don't know what will.) I lifted the hefty bowl to my lips and inhaled the entire thing, practically without breathing. That is rare.. . The ramen rules here. The lengthy waiting list and sidewalk crowds attest to that. I love gawking at the adorable 1950's Japanese signage and movie posters hung throughout the shop. Just perfection. There's even a David Bowie lookalike on the women's bathroom wall! They make me want to grab my bowl and leap into their happy super-saturated Technicolor world. It would undoubtedly get violent when they'd try to steal my precious ramen and I'd have to unleash my kara-zy. Worth every dropkick.
