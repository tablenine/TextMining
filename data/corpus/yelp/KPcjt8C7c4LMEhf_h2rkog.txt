Restaurant: Craft Atlanta
Category: American (New)
I went to Craft for a New Years Eve dinner, and there were definitely some high points to the evening.  . . First off, it is unusually common in Atlanta to have reservations and still end up waiting for a table, but on an extremely busy night for Craft, we were pleased to be seated immediately upon arrival.  Although be warned, they did call about four times to confirm reservations and even threatened to drop the reservation if we didn't call back to confirm.. . The Food: The gnocchi was the best gnocchi I have ever had (and that is saying something).  It was like eating fluffy little clouds - truly a must have.  The rest of the food was ok, but I honestly expected more.  They were simplistic dishes, well cooked and nicely seasoned but nothing (besides the gnocchi and chocolate donuts for dessert) that I couldn't live without.
