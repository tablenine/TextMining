Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's is not a typical mexican restaurant...so if that's what your expecting this is not the place for you... But if you are looking for an original taste to a mexican classic... then the food here is SOOO good.  . . Think quasi-greasy, crunchy shelled, chedder cheesy, shredded beef good...topped with some watered down tomato salsa... That just about sums this place up. . . The irony is that it is Jew owned.  HAHA
