Restaurant: Le Colonial
Category: Vietnamese
Is the space pretty? Yes, if you don't mind the throwback to one country oppressing another. . Service is good? Everyone is very personable and prompt.. Location? Smack in the heart of Gold Coast, attached to Le Passage if you want to bust out your dancing shoes.. . But the food... oh, the food. Therein lies the dilemma. Read the numerous other reviews. People think the food is stellar, but most of those people are not Asian. Coming from someone who *hearts* Asian food and eats it all the time, I thought it was perhaps a bit more refined than something you'd find in any Vietnamese restaurant. Most of the food that my party ordered, I could make the same dish without a problem. . . If you are into ambiance, then Le Colonial is worth the extra expense. If you just care about the taste of food, spend your money elsewhere. You can feed twice as many people for the same cost.
