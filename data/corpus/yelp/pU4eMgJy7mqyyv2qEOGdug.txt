I am in a freegin' food coma.  I ate about 3x as much food as I normally would, but I had to make sure my Ho Chow review was spot on so I tried some of the dishes a couple of times.  Its midnight and I'm trying to stay awake.  I even had a chai latte from Starbucks that these nice customer folks brought post-dinner.. . When it comes to food coma's nothing beats Brasilian churrasco.  I've been to a few churrascarias in LA over the years, but this time I broke the bank and went to Fogo de Chao's, supposedly the gold standard for LA.  And at $55 per head it better be!. . I'm so *tired*..... oh hell with this review, lets just say the meat was perfectly cooked, nothing dry, nothing over salted, the filet mignon was juicy love, the ribeye was tender love.  The only disappointment was the picanha... I've had much better elsewhere.  It just wasn't tender juicy write-home-to-momma good... like my friend says, butter.. . The caipirinha's were good too.  Just ask them to make it "Brasilian style," which is full strength, not that sissy watered-down version for gringos.  And they use Ypioca cachaca, which is a notch or two above Pitu or whatever junky stuff other places use.. . 4.5 stars, well make it 5 for the damn good service.  They replace your plates and side dishes and are quite friendly.. . Okay, THE END.  zzzzZZZZZ.
