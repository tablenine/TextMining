Restaurant: Ri Ra Irish Pub
Category: Irish
I have been to Ri Ra twice for lunch.  The first time, I was able to get quick outdoor seating and had the Irish Breakfast.  It was 2 eggs with 2 sausages and home fries with an Irish twist to it.  I think the best part was having an Irish waitress with an Irish accent.  The second time I went back, I had a Reuben sandwich with champs.  Champs is mash potato with green onions.  The champs was pretty dry since it doesn't come with gravy.  I think it just needs some butter to give it more flavor.  The food was okay, but it was a little disappointing not to be served by an Irish person since there was no delightful Irish accent that comes along with the description of the day's special.  Oh well.
