Restaurant: Two Urban Licks
Category: Bars
I had family in town, visiting from Idaho and thought they would enjoy dinner at Two Urban Licks. The place has pizazz and can be impressive to visiting small-town folks like mine. In terms of the experience, Two definitely delivered.. . Our server Billy was hilarious, working hard in both selling us items on the menu and in entertaining us with funny comments and witty comebacks. But my dad wasn't about to be out-shined -- he's a wanna-be comedian himself. When Billy mentioned to us that Two Urban Licks is the "busiest restaurant in the Southeast," my father replied, "Busier than McDonald's?" The look on Billy's face was priceless. You could see the cogs turning..."Did this man just compare us to McD's??" HA HA. . The food was pretty damn good too. We shared two appetizers, the salmon chips and the smoked brisket empanadas. Then we all ordered a different entree. I went with the bistro steak with whipped potatoes and this poblano pepper, corn and mushroom mixture that was quite tasty. This cut of meat can get tough, but cooked medium-rare and eaten in smaller bites, its not too chewy. Other entrees at our table included the seared tuna, halibut, braised pork, and the nightly special at the time which was this giant, spit-roasted New York strip that was fantastic. . . I guess I know where I got my ability to be a food vacuum. We all snarfed the food down like it was air. I guess food vacuum-ness runs in the family. And what better way to please food vacuums than to order dessert. Carrot cake and the Nutella white chocolate bread pudding. The bread pudding was warm, comforting, and delicious. And the carrot cake was a huge slice, tasty with cream cheese frosting. Both were served with a scoop of ice cream. . . All in all, dinner at Two was a great evening for my family and I'm sure it'll be remembered as a highlight of their visit to Atlanta.
