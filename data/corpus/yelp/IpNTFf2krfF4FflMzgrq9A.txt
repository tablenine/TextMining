Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
The view is absolutely breathtaking! You drive up a little windy road not knowing that there would be a great sushi restaurant with an amazing view at the top. Yamashiro's is one of those great restaurants perfect for a date or just a night out with friends. After dinner be sure to walk across the street and check out the little Japanese type gardens they have for people who want to continue to enjoy the view. . . Our waiter was very attentive, there was never a glass unfilled and he made sure to keep the Junmai pear sake flowing for me. I definitely want to go back and explore more appetizer options but let me tell you, the Reclining Buddha and Darth Vader rolls were so good! . . The ambience and layout of the restaurant was great and I would've been happy to sit anywhere but if you happen to have a view of LA at night, the dining experience is that much better. So valet the car, order some sake and rolls and take in LA at its finest.
