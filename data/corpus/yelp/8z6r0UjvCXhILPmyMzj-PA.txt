I've noticed alot of reviews indicated a bit of dismay with the prices of the menu items at Real Food Daily. Many people express concern about the cost they pay for the food. I just wanted to briefly address this in my review, and remind people that at Real Food, they serve ORGANIC, Vegan food. Being in the restaurant business myself, and especially in these times, it has become increasingly difficult to obtain locally grown, organic products with out a cost. At Real Food Daily, they have managed to maintain their commitment to serving organic food. (I believe they stay in the range of 80-100%) If you notice when you grocery shop, organic food always costs more. But it is far healthier for you. I have always been impressed with the food I have eaten at Real Food, and do not mind paying a little extra for healthy food. (Even though I think you get a really good deal here anyway! The portions are great!!) I encourage people who are thinking about trying vegan food to go to Real Food Daily. It's great for beginners! Try the Nachos for sure!!!
