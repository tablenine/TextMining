Ok I love this place but seriously owners, JUST GET WAIT STAFF AND GET THE COSTUMERS THE HELL OUT OF THE RESTAURANT LINE....who with any sense would come with the idea that people should wait in line, then go to their table, then wait for their food, which is always missing an item......It would take nothing to have regulars servers take an order, bring you food, and handle the check....They are there already! I know a ton of people in the neighborhood who live this place but can't stand they silly way they handle the business. It makes no sense and this place could really be much more fun and peaceful if they JUST HAD NORMAL TABLE SERVICE.
