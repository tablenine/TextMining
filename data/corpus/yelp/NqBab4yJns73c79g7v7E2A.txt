LaFonda is great for quick cheap eats. I always get the fish tacos, which are my favorite fish tacos in atlanta. Their salsa is amazing, but you can prbably skip the beans and rice. the beans lack flavor and the rice has to be uncle ben's with yellow food coloring. Â I should tell you, I am a rice snob though, so maybe I am biased. The Mojitos are terrible. They use creme de menthe instead of freshly muddled mint leaves and rose's lime juice instead of fresh limes. Disgusting. The staff isn't particularly friendly either, but seriously . . . if all you want are some quick tacos, this is the perfect place.
