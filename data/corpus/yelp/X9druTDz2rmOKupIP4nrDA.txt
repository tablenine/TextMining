MAN MAN MAN...If only they had this place in the Bay area. But then again it's probably better that they don't or I would die from a heart attack within 10 years. This food is amazing; the mac and cheese, grits, waffles, etc. Everytime I come here I feel great. This location is a little fishy but there is this lady we call Big Momma that used to always say wassup to us and it was only in the pico location. . OOO LA LA is definitely the way to sum this place up!!
