Restaurant: Gibsons Bar &amp; Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Gibson's is as good as it gets. If you want to experience a Chicago steakhouse, Gibson's is the place to go. The portions are huge (especially the desserts that feed 10) and every cut is juicy, flavorful, and melts in your mouth. Seafood is delicious as well and flown in fresh daily (from Alaska mostly). It is always crowded so dinner is not quiet, but the atmosphere is fun. Absolutely worth every penny!
