Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
Pfffffffft.  These reviewers who love smoke daddy are just in love with the neighborhood.  The food sucks.  Period.  My g.f. lives in wicker park and unfortunately drags me out here alot, but no matter how many times I try it, I can never get used to how artificial the smoke flavor is.  Hello liquid smoke!  And the ribs are consistently just dried out twigs.  If it wasn't for the ridiculously stupid conversations I can always count on listening to while sitting outside, I would give it 1 star.
