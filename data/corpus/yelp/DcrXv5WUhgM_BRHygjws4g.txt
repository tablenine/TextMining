Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Shin Sen Gumi.. . Irra-shai mase!!!!. Arigatoo gozaimashita!!!!. . these quotes ring all over your head once you go there.  There's a new customer about every 10 minutes and there's also a customer leaving about every 10 minutes.  Once some one or some people walk in the door, you hear from every single waiter/waitress: Irra-shai mase!!!  and when there is someone or some people who stand up as a group, you hear from each and every staff member, including cooks: Arigatoo gozaimashita!!! A pretty strong and clear japanese accent.  I can tell because i speak japanese.. . Their food is goooood depending on what your appetite is craving for.  Spicy miso pretty much acts as kimchi or some spicy sauce for your soup/noodles.  I ordered corn and it was goood.  One of the friends i was eating with said the meat doesn't come with the noodles itself so i ordered and what came in everybody's bowl, even for the people who didn't order meat, was about 8 slices of meat.  I forgot whether it was pork, chicken, or beef.. . but all you need to know is that the most important thing is that:. IT"S GOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!. (not so good as to die for though.)
