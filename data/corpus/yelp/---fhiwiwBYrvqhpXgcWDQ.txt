Food's sooooo good and sooooo cheap. Servers are pretty much always attentive and the hosts are really friendly. The tables are really close together, so you better feel comfortable cozying up to your neighbors and listening to their conversations. You should also make a reservation, because there is almost always a wait. I come here at least once a week because its a nice neighborhood spot, and never breaks the bank.
