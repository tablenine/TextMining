Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Yeah, yeah. Shut up Tito haters. . . I love Tito's despite it not being really Mexican (I don't think anyone would say it's authentic), nor healthy, it's long lines, no accepting of credit cards, and small ass bathroom. It's just good though and it totally hits the spot. I love the tacos and the meat &amp; bean burrito. I don't dare try the tamales. Tamales fall into two categories: Authentic and Nasty. I don't think Tito's are authentic, so I rather not bother. The chips and salsa are quite pleasing and I can eat that forever. It gets a five in my book bc I just had it a few days ago and I swear I devoured it as if I'd hadn't eaten it days. I was sad when it was all gone too. . . So yeah, I gave it 5 stars. But do I recommend it? No. Stay the hell out. I could do without the long lines.
