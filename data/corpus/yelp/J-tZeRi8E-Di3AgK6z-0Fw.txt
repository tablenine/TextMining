Restaurant: Cafe 28
Category: Cuban
Brunch is most definitely my favorite meal. I think it's because I'm rebellious (err, at least in my own mind) and I'm obviously telling the world to piss off by drinking champagne at 10am and chowing down on eggs at 2 in the afternoon. Breakin' the rules, breakin' the rules, ohhh yeah. I'm no earth-shaker, I admit, but everyone's gotta have their own form of rebellion, right?. . So in our quest to find something else besides a Belgian waffle, we decided on Cafe 28, a place that's been on my radar for god-knows-how-long-and-am-ridiculous-for-not-tryin g-sooner. As many of you know, the place is pretty large with a bar area, three good-sized seating rooms, and a mostly covered outdoor space. Choosing to feel the breeze, we found a spot in the shade, and thus began our date with 28.. . I requested a mimosa, and it was perfect--heavy on the champagne, easy on the OJ. My brunch partner ordered the chilaquiles with steak which came out with diced tomatoes, chopped lettuce, and sour cream. He took a bite of steak and said he could eat way more of it than they gave him--success! And I went for the Cuban steak sandwich--a garlicky delight with lettuce and tomato on a French roll, served up with black beans and white rice. Filling, flavorful, and a steal for $10.95, especially because I could have taken the second half of my sandwich home with me...uhh, but I ate it all. Silly? Smart? It was the best decision at the time.... . We made it outta there for less than $30 bucks, which is fantastico to me for a delicious brunch with fab service and one strong mimosa. And considering my steak-hungry dining partner, I think we'll have to come back for dinner and check out the dinner-sized portions. Yum! Can't wait.
