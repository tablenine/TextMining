Restaurant: El Cid 2
Category: Mexican
The food here is reasonably priced and tasty. If you're going to El Cid, go for the fish tacos and a margarita. These are probably the best items on the menu, and they're what the place is best known for. Other items are okay, but nothing particularly special. The back patio is a great place to sit on a warm night. The inside of the restaurant, however, is tiny. It can be hard to have a conversation if they're blaring music. The servers are friendly and the service is quick, even on busy nights.
