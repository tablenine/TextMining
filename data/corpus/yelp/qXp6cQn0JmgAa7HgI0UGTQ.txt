Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
One of the best just got better- a few months ago, Ping Pong expanded into the space next door, formerly a Mexican restaurant. In the past, when they put a few tables out on the sidewalk in front of the place during summer, they would literally double their capacity. Anyway, this has been some of my favorite Asian food in the city. Their egg rolls are my favorite of all time, and the sesame chicken (or beef!) is world class. The mango chicken, curry beef, spicy shrimp and ping pong chicken are other favorites. The Pad Thai is good, but pales in comparison to other restaurants specializing in Thai food. . I've dined in and carried out from here numerous times, and have never been disappointed once. Carryout is really fast- I picked up a big order on New Year's Eve in just 15 minutes.. UPDATE 5/11/08: Picked up carryout here earlier in the week. Prices have risen by about a dollar for nearly everything on the menu. Portions aren't all that big, even when you dine in, but the portions we got for carryout were horrible... way too small, especially at higher prices. Will not be back for carryout unless I hear this is corrected. I have cheaper options closer by that don't skimp just because I've ordered takeout.
