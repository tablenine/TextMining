Meh.  . . The interior is chic, but nothing too unexpected.  They put three people at a two-top table outside, with the third chair blocking the walkway, so our third person was constantly in the way.  There were four-tops open, which made it especially odd.  The hostesses are clearly chosen for their looks, not their common sense.  Otherwise, the service was ok.  Beata was pretty good, everyone else could use a bit more experience/training.. . My shoarma was just a pile of meat, not a sandwich like it's supposed to be.  And it was lukewarm.  The rice pilaf was good, but it's impossible to mess that up.
