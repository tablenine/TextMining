Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
Ate here two nights ago. Gloria's Cafe is a festively decorated, homey little restaurant that makes you feel like you're visiting a relative's house for dinner (if was Mexican or Salvadoran, that is) . . My friends and I were served by Gloria herself! She was so friendly -- extremely helpful in explaining the dishes and providing recommendations. . . What we had:. * Sangria: SOOOO good!!!!!!! If I wasn't DD, I could have finished off a pitcher by myself (Probably not, but I wish!). We actually weren't planning on getting it, but decided to give it try at Gloria's strong recommendation... and the fact that every other table had a pitcher. Best sangria ever.. . * Pupusas: We had the Cheese &amp; Herb and the Pork &amp; Cheese. I didn't like the Pork &amp; Cheese as much as the Cheese &amp; Herb, which was really good. . . * For entrees, we had the House Special Beef Burrito, Beef Enchiladas Suizas and Chicken Enchiladas Suizas (this is in order of best to worst IMHO.) The burrito was definitely something I would order again. The beef enchilada was also very good. Great meat flavor in both! Can't really say the same for the chicken enchiladas though. The other flavors in the dish completely overpowered the chicken. . . I had a great time at Gloria's. Great service, Great food, and great prices! Would definitely come back.. . P.S. Free parking spaces are available in front of the restaurant.
