Not an AYCE place, but if you have a hard time making AYCE places worthwhile, have a hankering for kbbq and not feeling like you want to stuff yourself silly with a lot of low grade meat, this is a much better alternative. Three of us went (two guys and one girl) and we all left satisfied (defintiely not unbutton your pants full but happy full). We got the $60 combo and it was perfect for us as we got our kbbq fix at a decent price, with great service and quality and left happy and content.
