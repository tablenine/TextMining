Hassle free fun night out with the girls.  Yeah we did have a promoter friend (same one everyone else is yelping on..hmm, not sure) but no wait at the door, no cover, and free drink coupons inside.. . It was a gorgeous venue with the picture perfect patio, curvy leather hollywood couches, glamourous red/orangy lighting, and Romeo and Juliet (the Leo/Clare version) projecting in the background.  The dance room was slightly less fabulous in comparison, but the balconies overlooking the patio where great spots.  (Side note:  my friend has done a few shoots here, so fashion mags love the venue.). . The crowd admittedly had your typical hollywood douchey guys and plastic barbie girls, but luckily they stuck to their corner tables and superior lives :P  On the other hand, I met a lot of great girls and guys that night...the usual 20-30 something young professionals.  If anything I would say this is the best crowd and friendliest in hollywood so far.   mean, how oftern do you meet random groups (girls and guys) at the club and end up wanting to hang out afterward...so Midwest of me, right !!  . . Music mix was straight out of the late 90's/early 00's...lots of Jay-Z, Ludacris, DMX etc but totally no complaints here.  Usually I leave the club thinking if I hear another Kayne or Flo Rida song or house remix I might drive into a building, but the Djs at Deux did a great job of entertaining and switching it up.. . Good night.  Great people.  Amazing venue.  $25 (including my parking) for the entire night. = happy Hollywood night
