The broth is opaque with a buttery-like richness and strong umami flavor from hours of cooking down bone. The fatty pork slices are nice and tender. The soft boiled egg in the ramen is my favorite part of the experience, perfectly boiled every time. I also quite enjoy the small jar of pulvarized garlic that you can sparingly dump into your bowl should you choose. The hand made gyoza, shaped like little pillows filled with meat should be tried, though it may not be for everyone.. Minus 1 star goes to one hour+ Â wait, though I simply spend my time walking across the street to eat at the red bean bun place.
