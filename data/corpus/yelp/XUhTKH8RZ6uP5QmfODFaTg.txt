Restaurant: Wurstküche
Category: Hot Dogs
Did you know that a weiner wonderland exists in Downtown Los Angeles? It's called Wurstküche! (Pronounced "worst coochie" to many. Haha!) Wurstküche is a purveyor of flavorful, exotic grilled sausages, which are so delish that you will dream about them in your sleep! Try the rabbit and rattlesnake sausage with jalapeño peppers (my fav!), the Filipino marharlika, the duck &amp; bacon sausage with jalapeño peppers, or the alligator &amp; pork, smoked andouille sausage. If these sausages sound too exotic for your taste, the more traditional options are bratwurst, bockwurst, hot italian, chicken apple with spices, sun dried tomato with mozzarella and 12 savory others (veggie sausages included!). The crispy Belgian fries are a must try too (they are more incredible with buttermilk ranch sauce!) and the Houblan Chouffe is one of my favorite hoppy IPAs. . . Wurstküche is housed in a stark, modern industrial "warehouse" with concrete floors and exposed brick walls. The eating area features wood communal tables and benches and the ordering area is accented with red Blu Dot Real Good chairs and barstools. During my first visit to Wurstküche, I fell in love with these chairs and bought a set to go with my dining room table at home!. . The only downside is this restaurant is super trendy right now. It's consistently crowded (with a line that typically spans around the block), there's always a lengthy wait for the food, and it's difficult to find a place to sit. Nevertheless, the sausages are so good that "Ich könnte mich weniger sorgen!" (Translation: I could care less!). . Danke, Wurstküche!
