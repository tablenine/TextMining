The wait can be a little unbearable for some, I've heard people waiting for up to two hours just to get seated.  Their seating policy is very strict, don't even bother to ask to be seated if you're entire party is not there, because you won't.  But once you're inside it's pretty beautiful.. . I usually get the shrimp which is good around a 1/2 a pound i think.  I'd avoid the Crawfish, they're not terrible but they're small and not every substantial and consisting mostly of shell.  I absolutely love the fried catfish here, it's plentiful, has a near perfect batter perfectly fried and comes with a heap of fries.  Of which I got spicy and boy were they.  Oysters are pretty good, it's hard for me to distinguish from place to place.  Crab is also really good here.  And a surprise tonight was the Cajun hot wings which were great, better than any Buffalo Wild Wings or Wing Stop you'll visit.  Also try the gumbo, it's not for everyone but it's good!. . This place offers a decent tap and around 7 flat screens.  BC is always pro Lakers and Dodgers!  Gots to love it.. . Tip the servers nice, they'll super people at work and away.  Do it!  Or I'll get you.
