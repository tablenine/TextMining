If you like ice cream, GO HERE!!!! If you're lactose intolerant (which I am) or vegan (which I am not), even more reason to go, but honestly you would never know this stuff is vegan. They're creative here-they don't just use soy, they use cashew, coconut, rice, all sorts of things to create the most amazing ice cream I've ever had. I made an account for yelp JUST to write this review! (I'd been putting it off for a while but this place just made me want to tell the world how good it is!) . . The guy (owner?) running the place is SUPER nice and is very generous with samples (which, btw, they give you on real spoons-very eco friendly!) and he's very patient in explaining all of their offerings, and how they're conscious that vegans/lactose intolerant people ingest wayyy too much soy, which is why they have other bases for their ice creams.. . I ended up getting one scoop of the chocolate peanut brittle ice cream and a scoop of the cake batter soft serve, to go, and the container is even eco friendly, it's made from corn! The ice cream/soft serves are out of this world delicious-way better than any vegan or normal ice cream I've had! I've tried Stogo and the staff are rude and their product is just inferior to Lula's. . . If you love ice cream, GO TO LULA'S!!!!!!
