Very very good sushi. I am not exactly a sushi connoisseur, but I really liked this. The staff was super helpful and didn't rush us at all. . It's a BYOB, which cuts the bill in half pretty much, since I like my booze! . My favorite thing though is that they take your phone number and call you when your table is ready, because it is always packed.
