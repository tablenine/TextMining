Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
My first impression of Hamburger Mary's was a positive one. The interior is beautifully decorated. The place has a really nice vibe to it. We made our visit on a Friday night. The place was packed and everyone seemed to be really having a good time. Hamburger Mary's offers a nice selection of beers, and the menu looked like they offered a wide variety of Burgers. . The positive impression soon departed after we got our food. We started out with the Fritter appetizer. The fritters were dry, and pretty bland. They had the consistency of microwaved Fish Sticks. After mulling over all of my options for a entree, I decided to try the Black and Bleu Burger. The Burger was dry, and there was very little Bleu Cheese to be found. It tasted like they threw a frozen Hamburger patty on the Grill with no seasoning. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed with the food. Everything tasted processed. . The bottom line is: The atmosphere was wonderful, our server did a nice job, but they really need to improve on the grub. I have no problem paying $9.00 for a burger, but it has better be better than what I had at Hamburger Mary's.
