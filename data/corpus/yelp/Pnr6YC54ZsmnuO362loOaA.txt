Restaurant: Cooper 35 Asian Pub
Category: Bars
Food: Nothing to write home about. Tried a few dishes already, I'll just stick to the fried calamari just because it goes with beer. Feel free to try any dish though, there all so damn cheap.. . Drink: Cheap/stiff cocktails and bombs. This is where Cooper35 shines. Down a few cocktails with your friends and tab is still reasonable if not down right cheap. They are not stingy with Jagerbombs either, a party-sized cup of Red Bull and basically a double shot of Jagermeister. . Beer selection is low end and wine selection borders on non-existent (if I recall correctly it was house red or house white, lol). . . Service: Can be slow on weekends, seems understaffed at times. Average service. . . Crowd/Ambiance: Bunch of drunk young people. Better to sit outside (smoking allowed) during summer time. The tables inside never seem to be cleaned well resulting in a wooden table laced with stickiness along the cracks. Dark, loud place, good for groups of buzzed people, not for couples looking to lay low. Bar area is tiny so stick with table service.
