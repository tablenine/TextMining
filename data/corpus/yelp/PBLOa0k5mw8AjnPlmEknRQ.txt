Wow!  Our burgers were so good that we skipped dessert and shared the Truffle Burger. Loved the BYOB and easy-going service. I'll be back to try the rest of the menu.  . . I agree that the quantity of fries and onion rings left you wanting more, but the quality was outstanding. I would not suggest this place for a group larger than 4, as there are less than a dozen 2 person tables that they will move together.
