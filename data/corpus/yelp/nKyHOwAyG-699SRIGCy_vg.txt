I haven't been here for dinner but their lunch deals are huge and at a great price. Very tasty,  I haven't had a bad meal yet and i have been here for lunch about 9  times so far.  I usually get a 3 item combo which is only 10.95 (slighty higher for sashimi &amp; black cod which i always get) the combo comes with lot's of extra's like soup, salad, fruit, edaname.  YUMMY!   Get a frequent diner card and meal on them after 9 stamps....
