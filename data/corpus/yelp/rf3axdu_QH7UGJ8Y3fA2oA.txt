The place is interesting to say the least, had an old diner's feel to it, which I can appreciate from a designer standpoint, but on to more important matters: The Food.. . I ordered their chicken pot pie.  I would have to say it was the fanciest looking chicken pot pie I had ever seen.  Chicken was great and so were the veggies, and that green sauce on the plate definitely made it (I wonder what it was - pesto?)  However, the only part I didn't enjoy of the chicken pot pie was the crust.  It was so HARD (that's what she said - haha so juvenile).  I mean chicken pot pie crust is supposed to be soft and fluffy, but it was so hard that I couldn't actually cut through it.  I was able to snap off the top using my fingers, but I just couldn't bring myself to eat it; i was expecting it to be somewhat edible at least.. . Other than that, this place does get pretty busy, be prepared to wait a little bit.  Overall good experience, I wouldn't mind going back, but it's not one of the L.A. places I'm dying to come back to.
