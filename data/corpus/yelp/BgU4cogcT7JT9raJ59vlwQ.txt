"...I'm bringing it back to the Ol' School, cause I'm so cool...".  This Korean boy doesn't know much of the Jewish culture but good food from any walk of life I can appreciate...  whether it's late (late) night or at a respectable breakfast-eating hour, this deli has it all.  I can honestly say that even the egg-white omelette here tastes deelish.
