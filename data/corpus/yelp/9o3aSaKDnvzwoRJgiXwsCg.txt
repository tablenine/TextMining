You've heard the hype. You know the deal. Find them on twitter. Get there early(or late). Wait in line for a half hour. And get some of the tastiest food you've ever tried. . . I don't know if they just fill their food with crack(sugar) or what, but everything is well seasoned and has a distinct sweetness.. . For vegetarians, it's not bad. We convinced them to whip us up a tofu version of their blackjack quesadilla. It was freaking phenomenal. . . And if you're lucky enough to find them some place that has some outdoor seating, use it and chow down right away. Don't bring it home and let things get soggy!!
