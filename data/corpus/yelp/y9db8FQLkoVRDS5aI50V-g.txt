Good Food and a large menu.  Crawfish app was good.  The tails were small but the honey jalapeno dipping sauce was very good.  I had Shrimp and Grits.  Grits were excellent, shrimp were smaller and fried.  Son had kids burger w/ fries and ice cream sandwich.  Burger was huge.  Gumbo and Jambalaya were both tasty, but lots of sausage and needs shrimp.  Overall a nice quick dinner.
