Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Waffles? Om Nom Nom Nom!. Fried Chicken? Om Nom Nom Nom!. . Put them together on one plate drowning in butter, maple syrup, and some hot sauce (only on the chicken!), and my inner fat kid has officially reached nirvana. Thank you Roscoe and your delicious, rich, southern cooking. The rest of you can have your non-fat, gluten-free, organic granola. If you need me, I'll be hanging here clogging my arteries one scrumptious bite at a time!
