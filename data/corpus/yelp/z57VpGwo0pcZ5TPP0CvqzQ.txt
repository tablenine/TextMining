Nom, nom nom.. . Garlic chicken, nom nom.. . Fried plantains, nom nom.. . Buttery rice with Cuban black beans, nom nom. . . I went to Versailles for the first time after living in the neighborhood for a year now. Damn, where have I been? The food was excellent and, not having much experience with Cuban food, pretty unique to me.. . Tried their signature Garlic Chicken, which was deliciously hot. The skin was thin and slightly crispy, without a hint of fattiness. The chicken meat was moist and tender. And their light sauce is tangy and sufficiently garlicky, but not die-vampire garlicky. The only thing I'd do differently is get all dark meat, if it's possible, as the breast pieces were a bit thick. . . The service is quick. I think most meal items are around $10. Portions are pretty enormous too so you may be able to make two meals out of it. There's a small parking lot which can get crowded at times, but there's also street parking nearby. . . Don't sit near the front door, the constant gust of people walking in and out gets pretty distracting. . . 9 out of 10.
