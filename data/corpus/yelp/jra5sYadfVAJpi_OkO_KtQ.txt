Huge portions!! enough to eat for dinner~ Some teas and coffees are served in a french press. The french toast is quite delish!  A big downside is the LONG wait and parking.  There is always a line in front of this joint~!~ Get there when you are not so hungry so ull be hungry by the time you get seated~
