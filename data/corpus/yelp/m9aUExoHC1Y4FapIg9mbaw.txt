Walking around Midtown I thought this place was going to be similar to Noodles and Co. which I used to go-to weekly in my hometown. Being a self proclaimed noodle junkie, I had to give it a shot. . . Kudos's for a speedy and attentive service. Clearly this place has the lunch rush crowd in mind. The patio as also a nice touch during a nice day which you can just even people watch. . . The food itself for is cheap for the large portion you get. However, taste was rather bland like it was missing salt, and a bit oily. Might be the fact that I ordered the Thai Peanut Noodles thinking it would be similar taste to Pad Tai (it did look the same), but definitely fell short of the bar. . . Seeing how this place is close and most reviews are 3-4 stars, I'll have to make it a point to swing back and try another dish.
