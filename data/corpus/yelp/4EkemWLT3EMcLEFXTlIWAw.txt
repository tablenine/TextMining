She ordered the Roasted pheasant stuffed with goatcheese on a bed of gnocchi and spinach. I remember this because she said "i'm not sure if I like Spinach" and started eating just the spinach. Then she said "I'll try this... g'no-ch-eee?" and started eating just the gnochi. Then she was full and didn't touch the stuffed phesant and took it home. . . At one point in the conversation she said "my back hurts". I thought it was because she had big boobs but I asked "why does your back hurt". She answered "... because it always does". It was the boobs.
