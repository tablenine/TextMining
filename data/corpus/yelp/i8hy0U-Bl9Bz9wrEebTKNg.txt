My girlfriend and I loved this place. I had the Skirt Steak Special and she had the Griddled Veggie Platter- we both dee-stroyed our food. Had some fried ice cream for desert and with the $2 corkage fee for our wine our bill was about $38 for the two of us before tip. . . Friendly, polite service and they didn't chase us out once we finished our meal. We'll definitely be back again.
