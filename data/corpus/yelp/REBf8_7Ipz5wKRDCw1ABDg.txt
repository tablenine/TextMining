A+ for the bartender who was really helpful and friendly. Great decor and nice atmosphere with the pool table and separate, sitting areas (with different feel's to each. Went with some friends to hang out during the happy hour and everyone ordered different appetizers and such. The spinach dip/chips was great.. . Recommended for an early evening hang out. I'll have to try to go back a night other than early Sunday evening for a more thorough review.
