Love Culver City. I'm never disappointed with the restaurant choices.. . Now, to start off, one of the ONLY negative things I have to say about the place is that I absolutely abhore when you make a reservation and then don't get seated for 30+ minutes (in this case, closer to 40). Sure, I'll sit at the bar and get a pre-dinner cocktail (Try the Cha Cha Twist. It's a citrus-y gin-y delight), but I won't be happy about it! . . Other than that, I find it very hard to complain about this place. Portions were teensy, but not a shocker there. Had the delicious lamb spezzatino for dinner, but I was an even bigger fan of the pre-dinner olive tapenade that came with the bread than I was with my meal.. . The vibe is pretty trendy and casual and cozy.
