we went over this weekend, ordered Lamb dumpling, Porkbelly Ramen and Phat Rice.. . Overall the food was good, all three of them.  each one was full of bold and complex favor, and in the end I was "overwhelmed" with all the favor(if there is such a thing)  and had to drink tons of water, which was why I gave it a 3 star.  The menu was small with few items to choose from.. . will go again for sure.
