Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Let me start off by saying that this review is long, long overdue. I've been coming here for years and I am really on the fence on how to review Manna. My first instinct was to give a review of 4 stars out of sheer customer loyalty due to having so many happy memories here, but I thought twice and I'm taking the more honest route of rounding down to 3.5. . . Honestly, there are a ton a places that are way better. Manna's meat quality is pretty bad compared to a lot of other KBBQ joints, but I've also seen a lot worse. Don't even get me started on the service, but the last couple of times we've been, it's actually gotten nominally better. If anything sticks out here as being better than other places, it would have to be the salad. No other KBBQ joint I've been to has salad as tasty as Manna's. Their dressing has the perfect amount of tang and sweetness to compliment bbq'd meat-- it's wild how such an easily overlooked part of the meal really makes so much of an impression on me here.. . Manna's a great place to bring people who've never experienced KBBQ before because #1 it's cheap (but it's catching up to other AYCE prices now) and #2, it's great for them to have this place under their belt just for the experience of saying that they've been.. . Bring your crappiest clothes and don't bother to go to any social engagements after coming here, cuz you're gonna smell worse than a bonfire after you're through.
