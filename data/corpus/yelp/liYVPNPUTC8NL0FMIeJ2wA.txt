After hearing about this place, I finally had the chance to go when I went down to SoCal. I kept my expectations low and I didn't want to believe the hype. . . I hear the wait is long but I didn't have to wait that long. Maybe because we were running late and our friends were all there. Haha. . . There were 7 of us, 6 being boys with hungry appetites, so we ordered a lot. . . We started with the rice cakes (leen goh), the peanut noodles, beef noodles soup, garlic spinach, and pork chops.. . Then we ordered like at least 6 of the pork xiu long baos and 2 orders of the crab and pork. I was pretty impressed. The wrapping was what made it I think. It wasn't too thin so that the soup stayed inside and it wasn't too thick where it tasted like potstickers. The soup was more flavorful and rounded in the pork xiu long baos. The crab was good but we all preferred the signature pork. . . But the best thing about DTF was the red bean dumpling. You have to try them. They aren't too sweet but not bland. They are the perfect way to end a meal there.
