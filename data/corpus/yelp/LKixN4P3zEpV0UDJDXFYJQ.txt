....!Put your creative list completion skills to work and bring your carnivorous mindset..!. Another in a fairly lengthy list of Burger-centric restaurants in town. I like this place. The room is industrial yet comfortable. The service is solid. The beverage choices are plentiful and unpretentious. You are greeted with a clipboard and an extensive list of ingredients with which you build your own burger. Good buns! The shakes and malts are very tasty and I really like all of the sauces they offer, Red Onion Marmalade rocks! Â They may have the best sweet potato fries in the city!....My criticism is that the beef patties are not unique. That is to say they do not have a distinctive flavor that is provided by the grill. Despite that, this place is an artisan burger builders paradise!!
