Restaurant: Letizia&#39;s Natural Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Note to Letizia's newbies: when ordering a coffee drink, ask for a "normal" size (you know, the size that you were familiar with before the age of short/tall, grande, venti?); the barrista will correct you if you ask for anything other than small, medium, or large.  Seriously.. . Anyway, that doesn't really apply to me because I'm not a coffee drinker, but I love Letizia's for other reasons.  Namely, the baked goods.  Okay, I go in there for sandwiches too (they have a killer veggie sandwich on focaccia called the Grazer), but I scarf the sandwich pretty quickly so I can get to the main event: dessert.  Cookies?  Unreal.  Muffins?  I'm addicted.  Cupcakes?  Mmmm.  Now my mouth is watering.... . Oh, and one last thing... dogs can hang out on the patio and enjoy ice cream!
