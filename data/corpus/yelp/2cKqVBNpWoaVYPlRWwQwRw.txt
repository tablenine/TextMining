Went here for brunch - great place when the weather is nice, as there is plenty of outdoor and patio seating, as well as indoor seating.  The waiter was very friendly, but seemed overworked - mainly because he came by our table once or twice before we ordered, but he didn't make it back to check on us right after we got our food, which made asking for a little extra butter difficult.  The French toast was excellent and the coffee pretty good.  Much to my chagrin, on the way out I noticed the bloody mary bar - had the waiter pointed that out, I likely would have had at least one, if not more.  The bloody mary bar looked fantastic - it had tons of toppings, spices, celery, and tomato juice.   Overall, it was a nice brunch and I would recommend trying it.
