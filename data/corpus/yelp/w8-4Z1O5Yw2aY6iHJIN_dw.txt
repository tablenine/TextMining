Went last night for my third visit and absolutely loved it. Some highlights:.  - Tortellini en brodo - Wonderful pasta stuffed with a mixture of prosciutto, mortadella, veal, pork, and... who knows? These tortellini are so rich and flavorful it would be a crime to cover them in some sort of sauce. Instead, they float in an incredible capon broth. This is an extremely authentic rendition of one of the most comforting dishes of all time..  - Grilled whole orata - Grilled whole fish, stuffed with herbs, wrapped in radicchio. Â I wish I had the words of Jonathan Gold to describe this dish. I don't, so I'll just say that this was the single most delicious piece of fish I have ever eaten. Clean, simple, and intoxicating. I never knew it could be so good.
