If you are the type of person who, after a crazy night in Silverlake,  stumbles over  to the hot dog cart at 2am, but you aren't willing to do so at  2pm the next day,  you have to check out Wurstkuche!  Sure they serve beer and hot dogs, but this isn't  your ordinary hot dog stand.  The place of very original-like a posher (LA-ish) version of a San Francisco biker bar.  Oh and did I mention the beer? Awesome beer selection- (Chimay anyone? Plus, the workers were totally patient with me while I stared at all the crazy meats in their display and  asked a bunch of questions- I finally went with the "safe" chicken and turkey" rosemary dog with sweet peppers on top- OMG! soooo good.  Sit in the back on one of their long picnic benches and listen to some tunes. love it.
