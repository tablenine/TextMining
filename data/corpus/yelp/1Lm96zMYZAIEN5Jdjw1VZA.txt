Delicious fresh food, prepared exceptionally well keeps me coming back to Santorini often.  I love their grilled veggie place for lunch, its more filling than a salad but not heavy like pasta.  Sitting on their covered patio on a nice day is very enjoyable.  Servers are well trained and offer guests enough attention to feel valued but not too much where it feels forced.
