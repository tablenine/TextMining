You know when people hype things up sooo much, and then it comes times for Judgement day, and it's usually ehh.. or mehh.. or man, it wasn't thaaattt good.. Well, Langers! OMGEEEE, you did not do me dirty! Totally lived up to the HYPE! It's not even hype! It's just the best effin sammich I've ever had in my life! I'm gonna make this a monthly thing. I went on a Friday and there was no wait @ around 2 O'clock. I'm scarred to come try it on the weekends because I've heard horror stories about the line, but now that I've actually had that little 1st taste, nothings gonna stop me from coming back for more!
