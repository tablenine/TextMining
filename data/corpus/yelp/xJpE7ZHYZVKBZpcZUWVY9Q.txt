you know that axe commercial where, all of a sudden, a girl starts dancing in front of a man while chanting, "Bow-chica-bow-wow"?. . well that's what went on in my head when i saw my lunch special sashimi plate. AND!!!!!! I would've started dancing and chanting that porno music too if it weren't for the 2384203498 people that were there. . . if you look at the pictures, the sashimi lunch special is pretty much the same thing as the dinner sashimi special except without the tempura. Holy crap!! All of that for 13 bucks!?? Bow-chica-bow-wow~! haha.. The fish was very fresh. The cuts were very big and there was a huge variety of fish that was served on that plate. Along with the lunch special: miso soup, rice, tofu, seaweed something, and neverending green tea. Their green tea is good, but tastes a little powder-y which i don't like too much.. . What a ggggggrrrrreeeeeaaaaat(Tony the tiger....sorry that was lame) place to eat lunch. I'm going to try and eat here for lunch every week. . . baro. . p.s. when the old man host isn't there, a beautiful hostess replaces him. Beautiful.. . Bow-chica-bow-wow~!
