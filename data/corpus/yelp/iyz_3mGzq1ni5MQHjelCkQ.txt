Not the best nor the worst bowl of pho I've ever had.  I had the pho tai-- I have to say that the meat was very lean, which probably accounts for the beef flavor not being as prominent as I'm used to.  . . It's not Golden Deli or Westminster/OC pho, but it's good middle-of-the-road pho that's one of the few viable options in the area. . . On the plus side, we had the spring rolls with shrimp and beef (goi cuon)-- they were pretty good.  Very fresh and great flavor.. . I agree with the previous reviews regarding this place being a hipster scene.  Keep this in mind if you decide to give this place a try.  Friendly, fast service.  Clean. (Tony Bourdain once said a lil honest dirt never hurts, so maybe this can be a minus to some :p) Not so great parking.
