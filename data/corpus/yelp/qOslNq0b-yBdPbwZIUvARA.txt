Went to Milk for the first time yesterday. They seemed to have unusually sandwiches but I didn't try them. I think I'll have to try them the next time. When it comes to it I may not since I saw several things that I would like to try. A deal, a few seemed to know is that on Mondays kids get to make their own ice cream using any of the flavors for less. I had hopped to try their bread but they were already sold out when I went. I got the triple chocolate shake with it being a hot day which was very good. I tasted some of a strawberry sandwich thing someone else got also. Both were good and I would suggest both to anyone (I would probably suggest the shake first since I'm a chocolate lover.)
