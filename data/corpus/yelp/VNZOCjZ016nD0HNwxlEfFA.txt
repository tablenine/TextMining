This is a great place to get Tokyo style ramen. My dad used to take me when he worked next door at the Japanese American museum, and I used to be all about the chauhan (fried rice). They obviously have great ramen, that is why the place is always packed, but who doesn't love all the Japanese cartoon masks. It feels like a Japanese vintage store almost, with the Japanese surfboard, old movie posters, and ancient advertisements. A long time ago when it didn't always take half an hour to get a seat, I was casually waiting with some ladies, and I was leaning on the table where a television rested upon, and BOOM! down goes table, down goes table! Yeah, broke the television too, but hey, whatever, not my fault. Anyways they are open pretty late I think, so it is always a great choice in Little Tokyo or Downtown.
