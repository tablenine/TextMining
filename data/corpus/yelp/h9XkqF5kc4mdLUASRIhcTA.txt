Restaurant: Cafe 28

Although my favourite place for Huevos Rancheros is long gone (RIP HUE), I really enjoyed Cafe 28's version.  I added a side of some nicely spiced chorizo for a little bonus kick.  yumyum.  BF had a breakfast burrito and man was it big! There is no way I could have finished it, but he was hungry and ate it all plus most of a side order of potatoes.  Coffee is great and refilled constantly.  . I think the best part of this place is the interior.  I love the colours on the walls and they always have the best friggin artwork.  There is a huge abstract piece in the back room that I just could not stop staring at.  We had great service, from our waitress to the water guy to the guy who cleaned off the plates when we were done.  A great experience and for not all that much $$.
