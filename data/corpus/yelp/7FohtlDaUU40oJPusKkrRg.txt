"Fried fish cake with American cheese?!?  What sick person came up with that?!?"  That used to be my reaction when I heard rave reviews about Furaibo's Hanpen Cheese dish, but I have officially gone over to the dark side.  Some friends and I stopped by here after the West LA Obon for a late dinner and drinks.  We enjoyed several delicious dishes, including grilled salmon, chicken yakitori, fried rice, miso eggplant, and my beloved chicken hearts.  However, we couldn't help drooling when servers frequently walked by with platters of the Hanpen Cheese for other tables, so we decided to give it a try.  Heaven- after I tried that first hot, gooey bite, I described it as "a perfect, pillowy-soft grilled cheese sandwich".  You can't really taste the fish cake, just the crispy outside and the melted American cheese.  You can feel your cholesterol spiking, but you just want more!  The only reason I am keeping my review at 3 stars is because the wait and the service there are crazy.  We probably had about 5 different servers bringing us things and taking our orders, so we never knew if they were really going to bring something out or not.  As nice as they are, they need to reorganize a little.
