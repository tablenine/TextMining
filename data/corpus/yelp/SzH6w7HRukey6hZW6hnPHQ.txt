This is definately a beverly hills landmark.  Large hollywood a-list celebrity clientel, very high end restaurant.  The menu changes everyday.  I remember Wolf Gang Puck came out to our table to greet the friend we dined with (which I thought was pretty nifty).  You could see the kitchen from where you sit (ofcourse, there's a glass b/n you and the kitchen).  The food took FOREVER to be served, it felt like it took an HOUR for the food to come out.  I love how the server whipped the mashed potatoe in front of us, and he did it like a robot, flaw-less.. Great service, incredible wine list, and excellent food! Well worth it, if you can get a reservation!
