Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
probably one of the best in the area, food's always good, service's always good; probably the only bad thing about it is the line but it's worth waiting. . dude above who complaint about lack of options has no clue what he's talking about; authentic japanese ramen store offers only 1 kind of soup base and usually stop service once it's gone
