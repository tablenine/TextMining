Do you want to spoil yourself and host a glorious party in your stomach?!  Come here! haha.  Don't let the truck fool you. Eat dessert first!  :)Their wafles are to die for.  We had two kinds of wafel, a liege which is a dough based batter, chewy with a little bit of sugar crystals and a brusels wafel which is light and crispy.  A brusels wafel is the battered wafel that most of us are familiar with. Leige wafel...a true Belgian wafel is in the familiar square shape! Try their spekulous spread...it's delicious!  I wish I could come here every day for breakast or have breakfast for every meal!  OMG, I need to move...
