Dear Newport Tan Cang Lobster, . . You are one of the freshest, tastiest, lobster I've probably ever had.  When you arrived shortly onto the dining table, I could smell the garlicky steam come off your red shell.  You looked so succulent and made my mouth water when I saw you drenched in oil, green onions, spices, peppers, and garlic.  When I took my first bite into you, your meat was so succulent. (That's what she said.) . . Your spices complemented real well with the crab fried rice ($8) and yam vegetable ($12).  Both dishes were great but the vegetable was a bit more pricey than expected.. . You almost got me in trouble when I licked my fingers because it tasted so damn good...my man-friend even questioned if i liked the lobster more than him.  Oops. I was enjoying myself too much that I didn't even realize when my water was refilled and didn't say thank you. Double oopsies. . . They claimed you would be a size "small" being a little over 4 pounds but we scarfed all 5.75 pounds of  you real fast.  However, why you gotta be so extravagant and expensive at $15 per pound?   I would've given you five stars purely for your yumminess. Minus one star because your meatiness cost us a whopping $90. I might have to rethink just how much I like you. . . I will be back when I want to splurge again. Until then, I will be daydreaming your juicy, flavorful meat until we meet again.. . Sincerely,. . Lobster monster *nom nom nom*
