this place can be hit or miss..... i have had the best time here ever and also so-so-experiences.. . when it first opened, i loved this place....the table-side sake sommelier, the enthusiasm of the staff, the overall vibe.. . now, it seems like there are 14 year olds working at the host stand who couldn't care less, rushed dinner service, and the fod isnt as good as i remember it to be?. . the waitresses ARE super-hot, but thats prob bc they are all aspiring models (at least i hope thats why i saw a few Skeletors walking around).. . i dont know, but i probably won't go back. there are plenty of other great japanese joints in town.. . but, for people watching, this place is hot.. . it's also good for private events.. . i also like the upper smoking deck and the bar out there.. . xo-. andrea
