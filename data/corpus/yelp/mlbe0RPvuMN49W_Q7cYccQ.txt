We waited nearly 90 minutes for a table due to the Mother's Day rush but the food was well worth the wait. Our server was adorable and very helpful, and the food...my god the food. My husband and I split the smoked salmon scramble and the blueberry crunch pancakes, and the rest of our group loved the Huevos Enfrijolados and Sassy Eggs. Lots of vegetarian options and amazing juices have made me dub this a favorite place. We will be back.
