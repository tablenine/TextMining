Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
08.28.08: Alright alright all these reviews and well I'm gonna have to say I differ when it comes to their prime rib. It's okay, seriously..you don't believe me? Wanna take me? To prove me wrong you know you're gonna have to pay for my meal...ha ha... What makes this place awesome?. . Spinning Salad! Woo HOOO... Cream Corn and their Spinach. It was o so good. O and don't forget about their wine selection. We had great service and of course my broke ass only came because of the 2 for $99 deal. If you want the same deal too bad for you...Its over..LAGGER! haha... . So Would I come here for the prime rib again? Probably not. Was this my first time here? Nope, and my friends needs to stop coming here for prime rib. Maybe next time I'll just slap every person that states they love the prime rib here. I like everything else; maybe I should get the salmon or something different.. . I hate valet! I hate VALET! I HATE VALET! We waited approx 7-10mins when the freaking car was in front of us. WTH! . . I hate valet.. The end!
