We tracked the Kogi truck down in Abbot Kinney, via twitter.  the line wasn't all that long, but it moved really slowly.  but it was a nice afternoon, so who cared?  You don't really know what to expect, but it was two soft fried tortillas, spread with cabbage relish and beef or pork.  There was enough filling for the two tortillas, so that's good, but it's hard to imagine that it really tasted as good as a carne asada or a carnitas taco from a truck, or kalbi or spicy pork from a Korean diner.  The burrito was the best, I think, because it had some proper rice on the inside.  but still it was just ok.   The quesadilla was not good, the kimchi not crispy or hot, just really wilted cabbage.  I'm glad we tried it all, but wouldn't try to track the truck down again.
