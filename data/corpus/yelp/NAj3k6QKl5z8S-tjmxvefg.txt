Restaurant: Blu Jam Café
Category: American (New)
When I was introduced to BluJam last year, I wasn't prepared to meet the chef, Kamil. For those who know the best kept secret about BluJam isn't just that the food is fresh and healthy.  It's the personal greetings that you get by Kamil and his great staff, down to the busboys. You feel at home and comfortable in the surroundings that you end up meeting all the locals that come in everyday!!! . . When you look at the menu, you'll soon realize that the menu was designed for the health concious, very LA, and the food tastes great. I have never been disappointed with anything that I've eaten there. Most breakfast dishes include salad or fruit. My favorites are the migas, rancheros, eggwich and a breakfast pasta! Okay, anything with black forest ham.. . If you hang around long enough for lunch, check out their signature sandwiches like the chicken curry, YUM! Top it off with a chocolate monkey tea and don't forget their excellent soups and tres leches cake.. . AND if you're around on Friday nights, the menu changes according to what Kamil picks up fresh. Don't be surprised if you see the same people for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That's how great this place is.
