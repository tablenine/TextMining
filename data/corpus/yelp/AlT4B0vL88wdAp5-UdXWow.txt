OK, from 1990-1994, 1997-2005 my ass lived in the heart of 90034, and the original Versailles being in this neighborhood probably had more to do with my choice of neighborhood than anything else.  I have eaten somewhere in the neighborhood of 300-400 meals here, who knows maybe a lot more.  For the first few years of eating here CONSTANTLY I NEVER ate anything other than the roasted garlic chicken.  This is OVERWHELMINGLY DELICIOUS and simply invalidated the entire rest of the menu for me for a number of years.   I have had a few dry meals at Versailles out of like 400 or however many  times I have dined there and that is fine by me.  You want 100% predictability take your ass over to McDonald's on Overland and Venice.  Trust me, the quarter-pounder with cheese will taste exactly the same everytime over there.  When the chicken is succulent beyond your wildest dreams and the plaintains are melting in your mouth which 94% of the time is the case at Versailles, you will know real culinary joy.  Honestly, I far prefer the food at Versailles to the food in Havana there is far more emphasis on flavor.  The rest of the menu also rocks particularly the Calamari &amp; Scallops lunch special, the roasted pork, oxtail, arroz con pollo, and Colombian style steak.  One of the great joys in my life has been taking people to Versailles who have never been and hipping them to one of the greatest things going in the City of Angels.
