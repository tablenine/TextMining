Category: Restaurants
When I hear Lola's, I hear three words:. Godiva Chocolate Martini. . It may cost more than a PBR, but this make love to my mouth martini will have you cooing with the best of them. And seeing as how this is Lola's, you won't have to look too far around the room to spot a few mouth-watering objects of desire. . . Can you say I spy a hot guy? . . So can I.. . :)
