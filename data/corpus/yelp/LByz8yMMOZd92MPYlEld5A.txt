Their pastrami is awesome and filling. The service is usually good if you get one of the Langer clan, but they do seem to have a few waitresses that are really anxious for you to order, eat and get out. Doesn't fuzz me too much, because I save on the tip with them. :-) One star off, because they're way too pricey for the area, menu and atmosphere and there always seems to be a line, but once you sit down the wait is well worth it.
