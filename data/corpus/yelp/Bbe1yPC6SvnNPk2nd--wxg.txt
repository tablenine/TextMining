This place is GREAT for breakfast.  Their million dollar pancakes are the best.  I also love the fact that they have hash browns as I am not a fan of home fries.  You can ask for any variation of a menu item and the waitstaff really listen and get your order right.  Whether it's an english muffin toasted well or one of their awesome breakfast burritos with no cheese or sour cream - they get it right every time.  Also, food FLIES out of the kitchen.  I have now been there at least 8 times in the past 3 months and they pass with flying colors in one of the most important  aspects I judge a restaurant on - consistency.  I also like that they always broadcast Sirius in the restaurant.  I have never been here for lunch or dinner - so this  5 star review is strictly based on breakfast items.
