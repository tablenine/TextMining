Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
I visited old Uncle Julio's on a Monday, so I was seated immediately and had pretty good service. I'm a big Tex-Mex fan, so II really loved the food. I got a combo type platter of faijita meat, with the best being perhaps the jalapeno stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon.. . I wasn't completely crazy about the twist margarita/sangria, but I don't think I'm a huge fan of sangria in general. If you are looking for tex-mex, this is a decent one to try.
