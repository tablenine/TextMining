Okay, what do you want? Open 24 hours! Kasha-Knish with an optional slice of Cheddar or Swiss cheese...Excellent!..."I'm not a Jew (well, except for a part of me...Ha Ha)." Don't order this...the Cadillac Margarita was the worst cocktail I ever had in my whole entire life, it tasted like salty Pine-Sol, and was dark &amp; murky. The only saving grace, was the Grand Marnier on the side.
