I actually want to give this place 4.5 stars.. . I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place for weekend brunch/lunch on a perfect LA weather day.. . Just about everything here tastes great.  But my absolute favorites are the mac n cheese appetizer and the grilled cheese sandwich (on white!).. . I can't stress enough how good that mac n cheese is.... that gooey baked cheese on top, with the creamy mac n cheese on the bottom... with mushrooms.. and TRUFFLE OIL!!!!!. . my friend had the grilled ahi tuna sandwich, which was VERY good too... the tuna was very thick and flavorful.. . the only reason i cant give this place 5 stars is because its small, and its NOISY if you sit in the interior.  Sound just seems to echo like crazy... so if you come here for brunch, and you came hungover.... good luck with that.
