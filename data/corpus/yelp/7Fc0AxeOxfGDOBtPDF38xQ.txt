Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
The Manuel Special is as good as it gets. The pork was tender and well seasoned, the guacamole was fresh, the beans were creamy, and the rice was fluffy. I loved how my bf and I ate it for 2 and a half days. Good place, reasonable, and very close to our Silverlake pad.
