Langer's is one of my favorite lunch spots in LA.  I go here 3-4 times a month with my classmates at Loyola Law which is about a half mile away from Langer's.  We only need about an hour to drive to Langer's, park at the lot on 7th and Westlake, grab a bite, validate our parking and head back to school.  Even though we go during the lunch rush, we have never had to wait longer than a couple minutes for a table.  Even if we had to,  the food here is worth it.  My favorite is the #10 Pastrami on Rye with Swiss and Russian Dressing.  SO GOOD!  The pastrami here is seriously amazing.  Thick slices of tender, moist, flavorful meat on soft rye bread with the perfect touch of Russian dressing and cheese.  I was never a fan of coleslaw, but if you like it on your sandwich, go with the #19.  Try it!
