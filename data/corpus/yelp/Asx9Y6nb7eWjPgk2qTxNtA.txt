The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is because of the search for a table. I really wanted to just go relax and eat, but there's a whole dance you have to do to get a table. Other than that everything was amazing.. . I ordered the fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich on a french baguette.  My partner ordered the pressed chicken, brie and bacon sandwich.  My sandwich was awesome.  The mozzarella was so fresh and flavorful.  I am not normally a fan of fresh tomatoes but these were so red and yummy. The baguette was nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The pickle chips on the side were a nice treat.. . After we ate, we walked around the market side and saw lots of things I want to go back and buy like like premade vegetable potstickers and the zucchini fritters.  They even have a great selection of homemade salad dressings.. . On the way out we stopped at bakery and got a pumpkin cupcake and a raspberry filled vanilla cupcake.  SO GOOD!  Way better than Sprinkles and other cupcakes I have had in this city.. . I can't wait to go back and try something new.
