This place is ghetto with a capital G!  So we went here on a Friday for drinks with some friends.  Everything is all good, had some good beer, hanging out, when this ghetto ass dude comes up to me and asks me what twitter is?  I'm like what?  Did you just crawl out from under a rock?  So I oblige him and then immediately proceed to place my hand on my wallet because I know this dude is just aching to steal something.  Even funnier is his friend pull out a fiver and says he wants to grab a drink and then right before the bartender comes over he steps back and says, "wait man, don't know what I want.  If I'm goin' spend five dolla on a drink I'm gonna goin' get what I want."  I'm like...I need to leave.  This is getting about as bad as the last season of Charles In Charge.. . So enough with the rambling.  We get ready to pay the check when my friend notices that HER WALLET WAS STOLEN!!!  And those two dudes where no where in sight, in fact they had left their beers on the bar and walked straight out of the place!  So my friend is hysterical, and we tell the manager what happened and they call the cops.  It turns out that two of the servers knew those two guys were ghetto and didn't even ask them to leave!  Instead they just went up to people sitting at tables and told them to watch those fellers.  It was very convenient that they FORGOT to tell the women who were sitting at the bar with their purses hanging from their chairs - an easy target for thieves.  . . Anyway, to top it all off we had to go outside to talk to the cops and barely touched our drinks.  The bartender was such an ass that he didn't even comp us for the last two beers even though we had to leave to file a police report.  Un-fing-real.
