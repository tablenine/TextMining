FANTASTIC!  I used to live really close from downtown Culver City, so I'd always been in the area and would find all the new places and jump on it!  Now that it's been open for awhile, everyone's experienced the amazingness of this place, so reservations book crazy fast and it's a bit irritating, but what can you do.  Very flavorful food.  Delicious oysters.  Nice relaxed atmosphere and great wine list.
