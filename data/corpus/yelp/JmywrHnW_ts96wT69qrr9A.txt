We think today's trip to the "no named" hipster lo-key viet spot could have saved us some money, and time.   . . the set up? There is no sign to identify the restaurant and  it looks like a speed dating room because of the narrow set up of the dining area.  Needless to say there is no privacy to have a conversation-either you speak softly so that other parties can't hear you, even those who you're dining with, or you speak loud and clearly so that even your neighbor who is but 1.5 feet away from you is in the conversation as well.   . . The food?  The both of us ordered pho, of course; well the broth was a bit lacking in flavor and no matter how much hoisin sauce or sriracha hot sauce I put in-it didn't help.   It didn't taste authentic to me at all.   Perhaps it was missing the msg? haha.  We had an order of eggrolls too which was actually good, the 'fish sauce' sauce wasn't too salty, nor too sweet.   . . The service?  The waiter didn't touch base and asked if "everything was okay" or to fill up the water.  He just dropped off the check in middle of dinner and said 'thank you.'. . Over all? We'd rather go to a dirty vietnamese pho restaurant with a C rating.  We wouldn't come here again but are happy to finally know what the title-less restaurant finally was.  =)
