wolfang puck you did it again!. made me waste $ on your food.. . first spago, now this.... what a disappointment.. . the veal tongues was good.  the flavors were great and the texture of the veal was great.  i think the highlight of my meal. . . everything was salty.. my medium rare japanese wagyu filet was NOT medium rare. it was barely pink.  for $135 i had to send it back.. . the service was great.. after i sent it back, the chef brought out some braised short ribs while i waited for my new steak.  that was eh. but im not a fan of braised short ribs besides the korean kind.. . the japanese wagyu is really good. melts in your mouth.  (well the part thats not cooked so much.  but the top and bottom were practically burnt and very salty.  (the waiter suggested i add more salt to the already salty steak for "texture"). . the potato puree was a tad salty.. and the mushroom w shishito peppers were good but also tangy and kinda on the salty side.. . for dessert, the banana creme pie creme brulee was OK.  it was more like an pie but square than a creme brulee.  it was bland.  and the banana sorbet that came with it was quite tangy.  is banana tangy?. . the service is great.  did i already mention that?. the food so-so.
