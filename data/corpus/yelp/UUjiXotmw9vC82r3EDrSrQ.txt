Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I just ate here with my husband, son, and a visiting cousin + boyfriend.  We just moved to this neighborhood and this was our first dining experience on Culver Blvd.  Ugh.. let's just hope the other restaurants are a LOT better than this! . . First, they didn't give us our bread basket until I asked the server for one when he delivered our food (I noticed other diners had bread baskets).  Second, they kept messing up on our visiting cousin's bf's order... Third, when they delivered my dish (italian chopped salad), I found not one bug, but TWO bugs on my plate.  I gave the dish back and waited about 5-7 minutes for them to serve me another plate.  My 2nd plate came out withOUT the chicken that it was supposed to come with.  After all the issues with my lunch, they still charged me for my dish and did not offer anyTHING for my horrible dining experience. . . The servers were a bit rude, which would've been somewhat acceptable if the food was good... But, it was NOT... Food was pretty bland--I tried some of my husband's tri tip panini... Not good whatsoever... Cousin + bf didn't finish their food either.
