Dear frasca,. . I'm a little angry at you. You may have delicious bruschetta and pizzas, but what the hell is up with your $13 all-you-can-drink orange juice?. . Can a girl get a little Champagne before she goes into a sugar coma? . . Dang. I had 3 or 4 "mimosas" without even catching a buzz, asked for a stronger one and it came out exactly the same. Totally lame, frasca. Totally lame.
