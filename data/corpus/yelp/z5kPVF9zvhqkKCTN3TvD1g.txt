I adore Tia Pol.  Although it's true that it gets quite crowded later in the evening, if you can get in there before 7pm it's usually still quiet.  I have loved everything I've had here.  The first time I brought my Spanish boyfriend he was practically having orgasmic ecstasies on the floor and weeping from homesickness; in my book this this equals authentic.
