If you are around Midtown, had a long day &amp; famished, looking to eat something quick Â &amp; absolutely fresh, then look no further.. . . Its hard to go wrong with them, they are quite simpy outstanding! great ambience, friendly management &amp; the panini's are the best ever!!!. . For me, this is practically home as its @ my doorstep &amp; i should say that they take care of me real well....I think i went thru their entire menu &amp; my personal faves are the salmon &amp; the veggie!!! . . There is a 1hour free parking on their deck &amp; free browse all u can wifi!. . P.S: Dont miss the lemonade! :)
