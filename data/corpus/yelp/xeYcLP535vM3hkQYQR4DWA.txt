Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
This place is pretty pricey - my group went after dinner &amp; it was a great "chill" place to hang out as it suprisingly wasn't packed on a Saturday night.  We easily got a window table &amp; had a few varieties of champagne...around $25 for both flutes.  Yeah, not cheap.  . . This place is GREAT for people-watching (judging...it's okay admit it, you do it too).  There are ALL sorts of hot cougar types in the bar as well as your usual mix of tourists in shorts and a tank top (woo hoo, NOT me for once).  We shamelessly judged the ever-crowded sidewalks full of people.  . . The service was fine except for when we wanted our bill - suddenly, the ever-present server was missing for a while...strange.
