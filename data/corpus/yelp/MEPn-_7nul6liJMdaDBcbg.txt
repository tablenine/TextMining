Amazing food. Nice place to have dinner with friends if you get a nice table. They vary wildly from cozy and comfortable to way the hell in the back and smushed. . . But the food...oh the food! I always order the frutti di mare - even though it's not on the menu anymore. But ask for it and they'll whip it up for you. Seafood prepared in their garlic sauce and noodles.....I need to go back soon. I love the food!
