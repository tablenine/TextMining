I looove this place and its quirky seating areas (cozy nooks inside and outside) which reminds me of a college town setting.  The food (mostly salads; sandwiches; paninis, etc.) is always fresh and plentiful.  I particularly love the spinach salad, the brie and pear panini sandwich, the breakfast burrito, the onion rings (literally the best in LA)...  However, the reason I come, besides the fun and casual atmosphere, is for the baked goods - cakes, tarts, cupcakes (light and fluffy with cute pastel sprinkles), cookies galore.  I haven't had a bad item yet.  I also love the bountiful mimosas that always seem to call out to me, and the good cups of coffee (mmm).  I admit it can be a pain to come here sometimes - you have to stand in line, order at a cramped counter, grab your drinks and baked goods first and precariously find sitting and then wait for your hot food to be delivered (usually a super long wait)... but somehow I find that's part of Alcove's charm and I deal with it, between mouthfuls of yummy baked goods.  It's also a great place to just hang out with coffee and read - I've done it a few times and the staff doesn't bother you at all.
