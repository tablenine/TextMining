Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
If LA wasn't so full of plastic-injected Barbies and wannabe Ken dolls, I would move here just for Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles.  It's an odd combination to be eating fried chicken and waffles, but somehow it works.  . . This place  just keeps on packing in tourists, students, locals alike.  Stepping in is like entering the 70s - dimly lit with wood paneled walls, faux wood laminant tables, plastic chairs, and seating in close proximity to your neighbors -- it all adds to the collective chatter that hums throughout the room.  . . It's common to find lines extending out the door, but during the middle of the week and off-peak hours, you can get in fairly quickly and enjoy a robust meal served on plastic plates with matching plastic utensils.  You can eat like royalty over well-seasonsed buttermilk fried chicken, freshly made waffles, green beans, biscuits and gravy, orange juice and feel guiltless since it only sets you back less than $15/person.  . . I love how you can just come here, not be judged by other patrons who would be counting your calories as they exercise the LA diet, and simply enjoy great food.  Come here, don't turn your nose up, and just live a little.
