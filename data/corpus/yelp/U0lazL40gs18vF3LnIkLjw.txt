Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
I've been hearing great things about Pizzeria Mozza for awhile now and finally decided to try it.  I went trying not to expect too much and I have to say that I was definitely not disappointed! The hubby called in the morning and was able to get a 9pm reservation that evening. When you go, definitely skip the pricey valet and look for parking on the street. Not sure how crowded that area gets on the weekend, but on a weeknight, we found parking nearby pretty easily.. . The restaurant is pretty small but has a cozy feel to it.  The decor is nice and the atmosphere is casual - definitely not stuffy which is important! Now on to the food! We decided to skip the appetizers to leave plenty of room for our pizza and of course, dessert! We ordered the funghi misti pizza and the fennel sausage pizza.  They were both delicious! The crust is very important to me when it comes to pizza and their crust made me smile from ear to ear. It was chewy and crispy at the same time and had great flavor! The toppings were equally as tasty. The mushrooms were soft, juicy, and flavorful and the sausage tasted homemade. Oh they have great Italian wines and beer.  Don't worry if you don't know a lot about Italian wines. The server was more than happy to recommend a great wine to go with my pizza. We ended the night with the butterscotch budino.  It was a perfect way to end the meal.  It was creamy and not too sweet and the little rosemary cookies were fantastic!  I can't wait to go back!
