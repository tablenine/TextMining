Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
The cookie's alone will make you pass out! Just sweet enough and huge!Sooooooooo gooood I'm craving one right now JESUS! I work in the area so I am lucky enough to partake in their delightfully strong brewed coffee, and dine on their fantastic (reasonably priced) thick sandwiches!There is CRACK in their vinaigrette I tell you! CRACK! Attainably good looking villagers pile into GD , and can often be seen laughing at inside jokes with friends in cozy corners. The portions are ample but thankfully  not vomit inducing American portions. Everything tastes homemade and the staff is that scruffy village cute. It's been a month of consistent oral amazement at Grey Dog that reveals the nearby  Balthazar  for what it is: overpriced "french"bland hype. Come get your fix at GD.
