Im keeping this short and sweet. I LOVE Mastro's, I eat there about once or twice every other month. Not this location but the Ocean club in Â Newport beach. The food is never a miss. The meat is cooked the way I want it always!!!. The service is wonderful and drinks are stiff and I always leave here full , a tad tipsy and oh so happy. The one thing I dislike about this location, the top floor stuff way to many Mofo's in one spot, very cramp. The first floor seems more private and spacious, im keeping that in mind next time we do Rsvp's.
