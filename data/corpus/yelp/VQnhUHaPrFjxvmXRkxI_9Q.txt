Well, really 3 1/2 *s rounded up to 4.  Went for dine la restaurant week, along with so many others (see below).. Gotta tell you, I liked the bar menu better, as well as the whole bar dining experience.. On the plus side, there was seriously abundant food on offer for the dine la menu--very nice; the only standouts, though, were the charcuterie cold foie gras, the market veggies side dish and the lemon semifreddo.  The ribeye, which is really roast beef was nice but nothing more; the salad, uninspired apart from the hazelnuts and the roasted foie gras--well, just ok, dawg--Grace's is much better.. Also, while the larger dining room is nicely done (someone else called it minimalist and "sheik"), the bar/lounge area feels more intimate and user-friendly.. So, happy to have experienced the grown-up space and menu but it's back to the bar for me.
