Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
Duck Walk is a great place to have on what I like to call my "back pocket" list -- a list of places you can always count on on nights when you aren't feeling too adventurous but want something delicious.  . . Conveniently located on Belmont near the Red/Brown line stop, this place is super easy to get to from a lot of places in the city.  It's astonishingly cheap, also, and gives you huge portion sizes.  I love that it's BYOB, too.. . The best part about Duck Walk, though, is the food!  It does not have that greasy, "cheap Chinese or Thai" food taste that a lot of restaurants do.  Everything I have had there tastes delicious.  My favorite items are the Tom Yum Soup (a sweet and sour soup with vegetables and chicken in it) and the Pad See Eiw (wide noodles sauteed in soy sauce with broccli and choice of meat, I always go with the beef).  . . Their delivery service is great -- they always say it's going to take 45 minutes to arrive, but more often than not it shows up in 20.  I love fast, fresh delivery!
