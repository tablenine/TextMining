We love the ramen here. We hate waiting in line for it.  Even if you line up up before they open, you will be in a line of 20 people, at least.  The ramen is definitely worth waiting for though.  I love the ramen with chicken egg bowl and my husband orders the ramen with eel bowl.  The extra pork appetizer is worth trying as well.  Man this is making me hungry.  . . I have no idea why they haven't expanded because they could be making twice the bank.
