Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
I work in Glendale once a week. I make AT LEAST one trip to Porto's per week. It's. An. Addiction.. . FOOD: I have tried way too many items for my own good. I have narrowed down this list to the best of the best. You're welcome.. . The Drink -- White Choc Nonfat Latte (just the right amount of sweet). The Sweet -- Guava &amp; Cheese Roll (such an unlikely combo of flavors, but delish). The Sweeter -- Red Velvet Cupcake / Cake (yum.). The Snacky -- Potato Balls (fried meat and mash?? so simple, but SO GOOD). The Sandwiches (I am cheating and putting more than one because I just CANNOT decide. Sue me.) -- Cubano (specialty cuban pork sandwich); Turkey Croissant (self explanatory but yummy); Torta de Pollo (has goat cheese and a black bean spread - unique and good). . * My one complaint is that I have yet to find good vegetarian options. I have tried all the vegetarian sandwiches and have not been impressed. Any suggestions?. . PRICE: The food is extremely affordable. I think all the sandwiches are around $5. And the potato balls are under $1.. . RANDOMNESS:. - Lines are long, and sometimes don't move very fast. Use the express coffee line when available - you can order food there as well! (except when I am there, then none of you better be in MY express line!!). - There is a parking lot behind the restaurant, so don't get discouraged when there isn't any street parking.
