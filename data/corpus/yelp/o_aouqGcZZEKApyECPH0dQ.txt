Lobster rolls were good, nothing special though.... . Sweet potato tempura fries were sooooo good!  I had duck which was very flavorful and tender, basically what one would expect if ordering orange flavored duck.  Again...nothing special.. . My boyfriend had pork and this was wonderful!  It was melt in your mouth tender!  Normally I am not a fan of pork but after his dinner I think I am going to have to start changing my ways!  . . Didnt have dessert but the chocolate purse or box or sack...looked sinful!
