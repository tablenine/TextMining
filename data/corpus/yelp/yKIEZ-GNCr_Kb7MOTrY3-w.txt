Restaurant: Rose Angelis
Category: Italian
Rose angelis is a place that I found out about when they were featured on 190 north. It a house that has been turned into a fun and charming resturant. I like how you get to sit and eat in the different rooms of the "house".The one room of the house is fun becasue you get to sit and see the kitchen. . . The food is so good,fresh and unique I just want to eat everything.Being a veggie makes it no problem to find something to eat.There are quite a few options for veggies. We usually start out with the crazy salad that is topped with like 10 million veggies includng a blue potatoes! They pretty much just tast like dirt but they look cute. Then I will get some sort of pasta dish. My fav dish is a pasta with blue cheese sauce ,grapes,and walnuts. You may be tempted to get it minus grapes but DONT they actually go well with the blue cheesieness.. . The staff is really nice and they have great memory skills. Its really entertaining to hear them recite the specials. Each special could have 10-15 ingredients and they will remember all of them. Another thing I like there is when you order wine is comes in a small glass like it does in Italy.
