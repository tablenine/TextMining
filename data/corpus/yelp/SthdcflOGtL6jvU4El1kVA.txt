Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
A great place to get a giant burger and a stack of homemade seasoned fries. The drink specials are also very tasty. . . I can't get enough of the Ike and Tuna (a tuna steak on a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes) the Buffy the Hamburger Slayer (a burger marinated in red wine and topped with garlic aioli, and the chili (just plain fabulous). They also have great vegetarian entrees.
