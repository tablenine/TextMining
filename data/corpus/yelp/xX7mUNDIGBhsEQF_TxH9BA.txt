Hmmm... seems a bit like rating a McDonald's, but there you have it, Here I go: Like any McD's or loathesome fast-food entity you have got to keep it simple: Â If you order a cheeseburger medium-well and the server rolls her eyes- so what? (S)He's likely just envious at not being able to function at the inebriated level you are; Oh yeah, 'cause if you are here, you are likely deeply loaded, toasted, WASTED, looking to sober up on some sloppy, greasy plates of deep-fried goodness. . So on the quasi-bar-food scale I give it two stars. . The extra one arrives because I saw the band Franz Ferdinand carousing here- i don't entirely understand it, as Alex is supposed to be a true gourmand and food critic/writer... but hey, good looking, intelligent, really well-dressed rock stars? At a place where I can actually afford to send them drinks? What's there not to like? . Wait, I know, the fella who saw Rob Zombie at a booth here. How i envy you... . All in all, a fitting way to envy a night of revelry!
