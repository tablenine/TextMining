Not good, not bad, love the patio. The drinks were a little too fru-fru as were some of the rolls, but they have enough choices and the service is friendly enough that it's not a bad place and will likely hang in there given the location. The patio is a great one, especially since the times I've been inside it's been loud and dark, I prefer the light.
