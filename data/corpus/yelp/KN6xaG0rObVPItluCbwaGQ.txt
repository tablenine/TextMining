Since I was drunk while dining here last night, things tasted pretty damn good to me! Why the 3 stars? Cuz, it wasn't THAT good.. . I ordered the pasta arrabiata and had to ask for hot pepper flakes to make it spicy. I thought arrabiata IS already spicy? Mine came with chicken even though I didnt want the chicken. Ummm.. I guess at 3:30 am, the waitresses are a bit tired, I'll cut her some slack.. . oh! I just remembered- that bread was so damn good. It soaked up the 6 shots of kamikazes I consumed. . . We had a large group and I did not know who those random girls were. I guess they were just piggybacking onto the 2 semi- famous guys in our entourage. Whateves. . . I need some advil.
