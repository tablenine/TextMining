THANK GOD for amazing vegan food near LAX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. . I have to recommend the following: Santa Fe Chicken Burger, Sweet Potato Fries, Chicken Fingers, and yes, the Chocolate Chip Cookies.... ALL VEGAN and absolutely delicious. . . THANK YOU VEGGIE GRILL!!!!!! I just wish the service was a tiny bit better. Maybe it's because it was 20 minutes before closing? The servers were very grumpy.
