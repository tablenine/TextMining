Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
My Sis and I had reservations for a Saturday night, 6:45. The place was packed, but we got our table relatively quick.  The restaurant is very small and yes loud, but who cares.   . We ordered the Mozzarella with a pesto and the squash blossoms of course.  I've come to realize that I've never had real mozzarella before now.  And the bread that comes with it, just amazing.. For our entrees, we had the lamb stracotto and the fennel sausage pizza.  The lamb was fall off the bone deliciousness.  The pizza, great mostly because of the ridiculous crust.  I don't know if I would order it again only because I've had sausage and onion pizza just as great at other places.  So it just wasn't...special. . For dessert we had the strawberry gelato pie and the cioccolato.  Both equally great.. In the end, all our plates were clean, our bellies full, and our wallets empty.  . Oh yeah, the service...was okay.  She was nice enough but it seemed like every time we asked her a stupid question, she made us feel like we were asking a stupid question....you know what i mean?  Sorry we don't know the menu in and out, I supposed that that was her job.  But, oh well.  Our busboy was awesome though!!
