I give this place a C, Ive heard great things about this place but I have no clue why?!!? I went here last night after the observatory and we all were starving!! The service was horrid and took forever!!! The food is simple 123 food, and the bathrooms scare me!  I ordered the french dip which was mediocre , Ive had a lot better.  And my friends didn't seem to enthusiastic about their food either.  Our waters were hot and it was hard to get service. The surrounding area is nice! The hipster scene for sure. I wouldn't go back here I would probably try another cute hipster cafe down the street.
