I just ate there today for the first time and I absolutely LOVED it. We ordered the crab-stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, then the bone in filet  with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The steak was so incredibly tender...the most tender I've ever had. The staff is really attentive and friendly.  So delicious!!!! Lived up to the hype. =)
