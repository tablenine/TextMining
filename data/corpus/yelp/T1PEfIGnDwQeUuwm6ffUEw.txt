Not worth the wait. Especially after being on Man vs. Food, this place is packed. My girlfriend loves spicy food, and she can throw down a habenero like candy, so we decided to go try their Special #2. I, on the other hand, is a whimp when it comes to spicy food. We waited about 45 min for a table. And the food took another 10-15 min to arrive. Today wait time 1 hr. . . I got the miso base and it was like drinking salt water. I understand miso soup is usually on the salty side, but this was very salty. Now, with special #2, it was actually not as spicy as I thought. I mean, I was able to eat it without drowning my tongue in water. My girlfriend of course had no problem eating it. However, she did not finish the bowl. It was too much soup. That's the trick to finishing the ramen, it's not the spiciness that will get you, but the quantity. So if you're going to tackle special #2, make sure you can eat a lot.
