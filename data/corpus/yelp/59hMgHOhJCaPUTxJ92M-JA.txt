I just got back from Philippe's.   Damn they make a mean French Dip sandwich!   Actually I strayed a little bit from the typical French Dip and had my dip with pork and added blue cheese.   Throw in a side of macaroni salad and dabble some of that spicy hot mustard over the whole thing, and man have you got a kickass lunch!  . . Atmosphere's nothing to write home about.   Very large building, open with a long counter and about a dozen people waiting to take your order and make it on the spot.  Seating's adequate:  long wooden tables with chairs so that, if it gets crazy busy, you'll get very intimate with your neighbor.  Not sure why they put sawdust on the ground but ok whatever... if that's their kick.. . Now here's more food for thought:  They have a very very limited menu.  Basically, they just serve french dip variation(s).   So do you think that if the sandwiches were just so-so, they'd still be in business, as they have been since 1908?   I'm not sure what the naysayers are expecting, but Philippe definitely does French dip very very good.
