OK, you might not want to come here for the vegetarian sausages (which are standard, unexciting sausages), but come here for the fries. And, you MUST get them with white truffle oil. If you don't, you're making a serious mistake! The fries are so delicious with the oil. I'm coming back next time just to get the fries-- they are that good. . . Pain in da butt on trying to find this place. Yelp lists the address on 3rd Street, but it's actually on Traction Street.  Parking sucks-- bring quarters!
