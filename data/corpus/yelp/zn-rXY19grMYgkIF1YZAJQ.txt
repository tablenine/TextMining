Best reuben pastrami I put in my mouth. I only had a bite of my friend's but that was enough for me to be converted. The toasted bread (probably rye) was just wet with enough butter but crunchy. They must put magic juices into the sauerkraut. Huge fan of sauerkraut. . . I ordered the Matzo Ball soup. The ball was the size of a soft ball. I think the food is flavored well.. . The atmosphere is a little depressing. But I would go back for that reuben.
