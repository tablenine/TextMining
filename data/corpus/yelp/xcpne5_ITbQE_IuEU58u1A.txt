"Alcove again?". . We always end up coming here for our co-worker's birthdays. It's a tradition that never disappoints. The outdoor seating is a nice retreat from being couped up at work. I haven't been here on a weekend, but I imagine the patio area is also a great spot for brunch. One of my favorite things to get is the apple &amp; brie panini. Salads are great too!. . Tips: Plan to walk a few blocks from where you parked. It's always packed, so seating is limited -- not so great for big groups. On the other hand, individual orders relieve the chaos of a huge group bill. Pet friendly.
