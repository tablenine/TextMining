2 words. GARLIC CHICKEN!!!! QUE RICOOOOOOOOO!!!! This is one of the many dishes I miss in L.A...... oh how much I miss the garlic, onion, and citrus taste of this legendary roasted chicken!!! I'm more of a beef person but their chicken is EXCEPTIONAL!!! This huge piece of roasted chicken is swimming in this mouth-watering delicious garlic and lemon sauce, it's just undeniably good!!! Every time I go back to L.A. I make sure I come here. Versailles, I miss you so much!!! Wish you were closer to me!! Just remembering about you is making me hungry already!!
