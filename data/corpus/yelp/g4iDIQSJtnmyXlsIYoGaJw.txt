I don't know if it's because I've been loving this place since I was eight, or if it really is that good. It does bring back good memories as a child for me.. . Parking on this street scares the happiness out of me. But when people do drive me here, they seem calm and collected about it. Maybe the crowdedness just gets to me easily.. . The way this place is set up is confusing. I've never sure where the line is or where to pay. I've been coming here for years. But in the end, someone with a smile on their face always helps me and get everything I want.. . There's plenty of tables and places to sit. The other part of the store is just for drinks and hanging out. Sigh, fun.. . The prices are good too. Not too expensive, and the food is really good.. . Things to get for sure: the Cream Cheese Rolls. I think that's what it's called. They're to die for. I can eat five of them in like a minute. That's how good they are. Their Red Velvet Cupcakes are great too! My sister got a Tiramisu cake for her birthday and it was only about $20 and feed over twenty people.. . Cute place for lunch dates. Overall, a just great place. Fresh food and good prices. Got to love it.
