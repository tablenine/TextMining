Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
I went here for the first time this week and was thoroughly disappointed. Perhaps it was because I was expecting it to be phenomenal based on the other reviews; however, the food was not good. The meat quality was terrible and the bread was extremely dry, even with the au jus dip. Even given the price, I was disappointed. . . I would much rather prefer going to Houston's or other restaurants for a French dip sandwich. I would not go back to this restaurant again.
