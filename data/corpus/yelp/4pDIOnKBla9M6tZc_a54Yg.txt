Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
I've passed by Grey Dog's Coffee in the morning on my way to "work" and there is ALWAYS a line out the door.  Naturally I thought that meant that their coffee was good.  . . WRONG.  People do line up for Starbucks here, after all.  . . Their vanilla chai didn't come from a tea.  It didn't even come with some kind of a spice syrup.  Everything was premade, mixed with a bit of milk, and resteamed. I mean, it tasted all right, but ICK.  It was an expensive cup of chai, for what i got (about $4!  I'd rather buy a cupcake!).  . . Plus, their music was obnoxious, intrusive and WAY too loud so everyone else was shouting to be heard.  ICK.  . . Who was the moron who said that Wi-Fi was free?  There IS no Wi-Fi!! Or plugs!  Or anything that could remotely help your computer and it's internet needs!  . . Lastly, the thing that dropped this place to two stars, was that as I was sadly trying to conserve my laptop batteries, I noticed A BABY COCKROACH ON THE SEAT NEXT TO ME, just scuttling under the girl next to me's bag.  I tried to sweep it to the floor so I could end its miserable arthopod life with a crunch of my foot, but it merely crawled into a hole in the bench.  . . Horrified.  Never going back AGAIN.
