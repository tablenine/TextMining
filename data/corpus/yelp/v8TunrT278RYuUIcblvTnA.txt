Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
I give this Beverly Hills location a four star ONLY because its in comparison to Mastro's Ocean Club in Newport Beach.  The NB location has way better ambience if your looking for a "wow" effect or great first impression.  Food is 5 star at both locations.  The customized seafood appetizer tower is divine!!  I usually order the bone in filet, and being an asshole about the quality of most steakhouses, I can guarantee Mastro's knows exactly what theyre doing.  The best place for special occasions.. The first experience I had my co worker dropped over ten g's at the Beverly location, we had VIP room, allowed to smoke cigars in there after.. Excellcent service..
