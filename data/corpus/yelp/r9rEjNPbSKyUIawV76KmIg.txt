I went here last night with some friends, knowing nothing about this place, and had one of the best meals that I've had in a long time.  . . The food was uniformly excellent.  We got some of the homemade pickles, the croquettes, and the bacon-wrapped almonds for starters -- all were excellent.  . . I had the fried chicken and waffles for my entree, and I was very pleased with the tenderness and flavor of the chicken.  My only suggestion would be to improve the balsamic maple syrup that came with the waffle -- I found the flavor to be a little too strong and not sweet enough to complement the chicken and waffles.  (It's hard to improve on a classic, I know.). . I cannot rave enough about the pecan sundae that I had for dessert.  It was supremely satisfying and endlessly addicting.  I sampled some of the other desserts at our table, as well (the bread pudding and the coffee float) and found them all to be exceptional.. . The service was great and the staff all seemed very friendly and welcoming.  I really liked the decor as well -- it's a very warm and comforting atmosphere.. . I will definitely be returning to Buttermilk Channel.  Even though Carroll Gardens is a bit of a hike from Manhattan, we had such a positive experience that I won't hesitate to make the journey out there again!
