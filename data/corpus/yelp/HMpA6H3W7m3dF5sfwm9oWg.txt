From the outside, this neighborhood looks pretty quiet and there isn't that many people walking around, so I wasn't expecting this place to be poppin. However, to my surprise, once I got inside it was jam packed with people! The environment inside was pretty chill once you sit down with many people dressed up ready to go somewhere. They also had a DJ playing as well, so that totally added to the atmosphere. . . For beers, they have plenty of choices from different regions such as German and Belgium. As for the food, I like spicy food, so I decided to get the mango jalapeno hot dog w/ spicy peppers and sweet peppers. It was delicious! The bun was super soft and the sausage was nice and juicy. The double dipped fries were pretty good as well and it comes with two sauces to choose from. I got the chipotle sauce and the Thai peanut sauce, but I think the chipotle was probably my favorite. . . I've driven pass this place several times, not knowing such an awesome hot dog place was under my nose. I will definitely come back to try the other sausages! :)
