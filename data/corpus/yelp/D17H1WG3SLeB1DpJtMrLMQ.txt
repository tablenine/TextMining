Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
This place looks like it's been taking out of a story book. The colorful chairs and tables set up outside. The brick bakery covered in green ivy, this place is so cute. Me and a friend headed over to Alcove after my shift at work. I was hungry and she knew the place to get a great breakfast meal. . . I ordered the Americana panini, which you can choose from applewood smoked bacon, prosciutto di parma, chicken-apple sausage or grilled chicken. I went with the sausage for my panini and came with a side of potatoes. It was delicious, hot, and huge portions. My friend ordered the smoked salmon plate, which had your choice of bagel with smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes, bermuda onion and capers. It looked pretty good as well. . . The only downside to this place is the parking. We parked a block away and make sure to note the street parking signs. I definietly want to come back to try their other dishes.
