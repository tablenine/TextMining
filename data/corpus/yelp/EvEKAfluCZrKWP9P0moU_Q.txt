Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
All I can say is that if your going to wait in this insane line you better bring a huge appetite and some patience along with it. It is well chronicled how famous this place is due to the star power and longevity of this place but who can resist a grease filled dog in the early hours of the morning? I know that some people can love it or hate it but it's interesting to see how they put those emotions in a review.. . First off I would like to say that pinks does have an impressive menu with many different options. Even though they are situated with a small location I've never had trouble finding a seat with my friends. They even have valet parking if your too lazy to find a spot! My first order of business was to avoid everything expect the dogs. It was cool ordering a chili cheese dog, or an American dog. I will say this however that this isn't the most healthy of places so be prepared for the consequences after. Only at a place like this can you possible see a movie star and order "heart attack" food at the same time. My only gripe is I wish the lines were shorter and they had a call ahead type of deal. Outside of that, it's a must try at least once in your life kinda places.
