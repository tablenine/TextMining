Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's Bakery may be the reason that I finally take another trip to Southern California.. . My roommate has a friend visiting from SoCal this week here in New York, and when she arrived at our apartment, she came bearing gifts -- of the edible sort -- a fabulous box of the popular Porto cheese rolls. After dinner, we each had one, and I thought I was going to pass out from delight. Even after a 5 1/2 hour flight from California, these babies tasted incredibly fresh, with a subtly sweet cheesiness and lots and lots of happy layers. The richness of the pastry and that subtle sweetness is reminiscent of something decadent I once had when I was little, but at this moment I can't put my finger on it. All I know is -- they bring back very sweet memories. . . When I am near Burbank in the near future, I am definitely stopping by this place to pick up more cheese rolls and try all the other amazing things on Porto's pastry menu.
