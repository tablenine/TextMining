Restaurant: Eclipse Di Luna - Park Place
Category: Tapas Bars
We went here again on Sunday, and here's what we had:. . Empanada de Pato - It's a duck empanada.  It's tasty, fatty, duck goodness (very flavorful) in a pastry.  What's not to like?. . Esparrago - Delicious asparagus, in a lemon sauce with bits of cheese.  LOTS of bits of cheese, which made this a winner in my book.. . Gambas Al Ajillo - These shrimps are tasty, but be forewarned that they come with their heads still attached.  No, you don't have to eat the heads.. . Tomate Fresco - This was fresh mozzarella and tomatoes.  It was good.  I've had better fresh mozzarella, but there was nothing wrong with it.. . Queso Frito con Miel - These are the fried goat cheese balls that people have been raving about.  They are seriously good.  We ordered two plates of them.  :). . Also, the restaurant was very crowded during the second half of our meal (they have a big TV and it was Superbowl Sunday), but the service was still very fast.  And our server was polite despite the fact that we watched some girls at the bar back into her, make her drop the dishes she was carrying, and then (apparently) not even apologize.. . Overall, this is a really good place to have a fun dinner and try lots of tasty tapas dishes.  And mmmmmm, mojitos (you can order them by the pitcher).
