Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
I much prefer Pizzeria Mozza to its counterpart next door. The service and ambiance are much much better. You are also nicely tucked away around the corner from the neon lights of the neighboring gas stations. Reservations can be very difficult to get here, but once you're there they are always quick to seat you from my experience. I can't say I'm a big fan of how tightly they squeeze everyone in here though. The tables are so close together that you might as well take part in the conversation the people are having next to you. If you get stuck next to a loud group your intimate dinner can be very much ruined. That being said, the food is very good here. I've loved every appetizer I've ever had - the butternut squash bruschetta is amazing, as is the crisp goat cheese and the polenta. I loved their Prosciutto di Parma, rucola, tomato &amp; mozzarella pizza and thought the Coach farm goat cheese, leeks, scallions &amp; bacon was okay - but I'm also not really a fan of leeks and scallions, so thats my problem. The desserts are also all very good (albeit a bit small for the price). The parking situation here sucks too. There isn't really much parking in the area so you end up having to pay for valet. You would think for $8.50 their service would at least be good... nope, I have no idea where they park your car, but it takes about 20 minutes for them to bring it you.
