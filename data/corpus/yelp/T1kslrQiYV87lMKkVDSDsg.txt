I recently went here for my birthday dinner with my fiance and family. (I own a condo in the South Loop and am always trying to find great places within walking distance.)  Despite some of the negative reviews, every one of us enjoyed our meals.. . I had matzo ball soup and half of a corned beef sandwich (which were both excellent - I don't really know the difference between this and NYC-quality, but I would definitely get them again). My fiance had the "Moshe Cristo" which was HUGE and he had it again for lunch the next day, he liked it so much. Everyone else was satisfied with their meals. . . OH! And a special note: the pickles they serve aren't the whimpy, thin kind that I usually see at delis/diners.  These were sizeable and super tasty.. . For dessert, my dad had a Cherry Phosphate to remind him of his childhood and we split a piece of the giant 4-layer chocolate cake - all five of us had enough and we didn't even finish it!. . If you're in the area, I would recommend it.  It wasn't particularly crowded this Sunday at 5:30, but we tried going the week before and it was a 30-minute wait.  They don't take reservations, so you might need to be prepared to wait a bit.. . Stop on by!  The atmosphere was diner-ish without being overwhelming and our waitress was incredibly polite and really responsive.
