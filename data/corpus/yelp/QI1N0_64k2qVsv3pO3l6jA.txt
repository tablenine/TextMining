I came here with friends after doing a hike up to the Hollywood sign. The place looks like a hip sort of eatery where people go to see and be seen; I felt out of place there, seeing as how I just don't look that trendy (especially in cargo shorts, dusty walking shoes and a light sweat going, hahaha...!). . In any case, though, the food was great. I had a Chicken Satay salad, and though it was pricey ($14), the quality was very much worth the price. The portion was large, too. My friends ordered burgers with sweet potato fries and onion rings, which they seemed to enjoy a lot. The ambiance of the restaurant was pretty nice; we sat outside, not on the street side but off to the side of the restaurant, where we didn't get much noise from traffic. All in all, it was pretty great.. . My only complaints are: 1) I asked for a Diet Coke and I was given a can... I'm not a fan of getting a Coke can at a restaurant, I have to expect a fountain drink; and 2) parking is really difficult... but apparently that's standard for the area.
