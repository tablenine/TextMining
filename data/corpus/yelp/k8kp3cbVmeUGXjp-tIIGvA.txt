Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
MEH! meh!  the two thoughts that can only come to my mind when thinking about the prime rib... meh! add a shoulder shrug and an "it's aight"......    3 stars (for those prices it should be 4 star). . the lobster, a 1 star, smelled like it was from the sewer's of maine, with 5 tablespoons of salt thrown in for taste (i think this was just a bad night for lobster, it normally probably won't taste like what i got, my experience has to be an anomaly). . now, if you wanna talk about the baked potato, creamed corn/spinach, spinning salad, and meatballs in the waiting area we're talking 4 star maybe even 5.. . waitstaff.. 4 star, you get good service, all my waitresses no matter how goofily dressed, talked just enough and made sure we were well taken care of.. . overall, its about the prime rib, maybe its because im a steak eater, but honestly, i felt you can get prime rib of that quality anywhere (and for 15-20 bucks).  Believe me about the prime rib, i've been here like 10 times because for somereason, my roomate loves it (don't believe his tastebuds, they are stuck in gradeschool).
