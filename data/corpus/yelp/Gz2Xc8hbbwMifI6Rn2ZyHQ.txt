Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Daikokuya earns its B rating. Apparently everything from the curtain at the front of the restaurant to the restroom at the back either is or has once been covered in pork grease (I hope it's just pork grease).. . The wait is always heinous no matter the time of day or night, but it's worth it, because the ramen is fantastic. The broth is porky salty goodness, the noodles are just chewy enough, and the pork slices and egg are savory and delicious and both cooked just right to melt in your mouth. The pork is a belly cut that reminds me of German speck, and the egg is marinated and cooked so the yolk is still soft in the middle.. . Daikokuya is about the same price as Orochon, but their ramen is much much better. A must visit in Little Tokyo.
