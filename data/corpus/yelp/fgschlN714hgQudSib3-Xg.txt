Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
I absolutely LOVE this place!!!!  I'm typically a "meat and potatoes" type of girl but WOW, Veggie Grill could convert me to become vegetarian.   I've had the VG-Cheese Burger - best veggie burger I've ever had!  I've also had the Carne Asada sandwich, which was absolutely delicious.   As for sides, I've had the sweetheart fries and steamed kale.  The dressing that comes with the steamed kale is soooo good!  I highly recommend this place.  You will NOT be disappointed. :)
