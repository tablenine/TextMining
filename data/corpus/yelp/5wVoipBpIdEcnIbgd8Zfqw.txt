The set up is very NY. Love it. There's a bar, pastry area, a la carte cafe, market place Â with a small selection of their own sauces, etc, and the main dining area. . . Very loud, so skip it if you're looking for a quiet date night. . . Great for lunch time or evening. . . Expect a wait, but it's worth it.. . Highly recommend the Portabello fries. All of the entrees are fantastic, esp. the beef marinara and sausage pasta. . . Not a big fan of the Arugula pizza, (Blanco?).. . Great service, will have several people taking care of you at once.
