I've only been able to come back here once since my last review, and today was the second time since then.  . . I only ordered a half rack of ribs on their own, but when Stuart comes out with our plates, I find my generously large half rack sandwiched between Texas toast....and a side of potato salad ("with extra rub" from Stuart himself).  Wow.  For a moment I thought I was royalty. :)  That's service.  If you take a look at my last review, you'll see what I mean. . . The texas toast was not overbuttered, and had just the slightest hint of char in the flavor- I like it.  The ribs were good as usual- not over or undercooked.  I smell like smoke.  . . I'm actually going to take some out of town friends here tomorrow...hopefully the short rib will be available (wasn't available today)...I've been craving that rib.... . What a way to negate my morning 3 mile run....
