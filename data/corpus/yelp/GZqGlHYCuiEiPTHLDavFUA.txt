Category: Southern
OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!. . Every time I get a chance to go- I take anyone that is down some chicken and waffles.  I've gone at morning times where its pretty easy to get a table and AFTER the club hours when you are waiting in a line like you were for the clubs in Hollywood! . . If you think its weird to eat something salty (chicken) and then sweet (waffle) your dead wrong.  Its such a wonderful combination.  . . The service is quick and fast so you're in and out pretty quick. . . You should always bring cash too because if you are in a big group you can only put down two cards per transaction. . . They have the "economy" special tacked on the wall- I believe it was 6 pieces of 5.00? haha.  It was great. . . I always order the same thing and I've yet to try anything new because I love this so much its the Jeanne Jones Omelette.  The Omelette has so much cheesy and huge piece of chicken inside.  Then the waffle, with the butter on it melted.. their waffles are thin and really big and have this cinnamon tint.  Just melts in your mouth. . . I'm gonna dream about Roscoe's tonight.. I just know it!
