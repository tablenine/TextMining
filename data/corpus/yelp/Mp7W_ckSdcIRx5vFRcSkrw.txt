I made reservations for Valentine's Day the night before and it wasn't a problem.  I also didn't have to wait when I arrived.  We had 6:15 reservations and arrived early around 5:45.  . . We skipped the appetizer and were ravenous by the time we got our pizzas (because we were feeding off breadsticks), and having a small appetite, I thought two pizzas would be too much, but I ate 3/4 of it.  My bf ate the rest of mine and finished his.  And we both had burritos down the street afterward.. . The pizza is light, even it might have salami, bacon, and sausage (bf's pizza).  The sausage was well seasoned and it surprisingly wasn't meat overload or salty...so yummy!  I had the proscuitto and rucola pizza, and the ingredients and scent were amazingly fresh.  For dessert we had the caramel copetto - no wowser there, so I would definitely get an appetizer next time instead of dessert.  It takes 20 min for pizzas to cook, so at least appetizers can hold you over.  Plus, Melrose has so many dessert places to try (Sweet Lady Janes, Pinkberry, Scoops...).. . It's a very cute (and affordable) date place.
