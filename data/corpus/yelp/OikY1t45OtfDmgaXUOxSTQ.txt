Restaurant: Busy Bee Cafe
Category: Soul Food
Fried chicken smothered in gravy? Yes, please!. Mashed potatoes, broccoli casserole and sweet tea too? Don't mind if I do!. . Busy Bee is chock-full of Southern charm. If you're craving a seriously Southern soul food meal, look no further. Expect your server to dote on you with cornbread and beverage refills. . .
