Category: Burgers
This place is freaking delicious.  They had run out of a couple items on the menu (it was lateish on Friday night), so I got the burger w stilton and carmelized onions.  Juicy, delicious, YUMMMM!!  Seriously, it was one of the tastiest burgers I have ever eaten.  So good in fact, that hours later, I was regretting the fact that I had left a couple bites on the plate.  Stupid stupid stupid.. . The sides are good.  They were out of fries, so I had the potato salad, which I usually don't like bc it's often mayo laden.  This one was good.  So were the sweet potato chips that I tried.  Didn't get to try all the homemade condiments.. . It's BYOB and no corkage.  Liquor store down the street.  They serve Mexican coke, which I love.  And surprisingly, they have good coffee.  The desserts are prepackaged yumminess.  I had something w marshmallows in it...not sure what else bc it was devoured pretty quickly.  . . Did I mention that I was really hungry before this dinner?  . . Regardless, amazing burger....been thinking about eating another one ever since...can't wait to go back...  . . OH!  Almost forgot to mention the DJs!!  Fun house music setup in a little alcove.  Nice fun touch.  :)
