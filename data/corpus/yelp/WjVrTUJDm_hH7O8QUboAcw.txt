Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
BYOB and great, HUGE portions!. . I went here with a group of friends and everything was great! The menu is a little different than some standard Thai in the city (the spring rolls had cream cheeese and avocado in them), but delicious all the same. . . I tried a friend's pad thai after they proclaimed it the best they'd had and it was very very good. I really don't like to order pad thai at restaurants unless I know it's good. I like to be more adventurous, but I'll be getting that next time. . . We had the cucumber salad as well which was huge compared to others I've gotten for only $2.50. It was a great appetizer to share as were the spring rolls (though a little heavier than a traditional spring roll). . . My boyfriend ordered the pad prik noodles which were spicy and delicious with lots of veggies. I had the panang curry noodles which were very good, but didn't agree with me after eating almost the whole plate. It was basically just the protein (I had tofu which was nice and lightly fried), the curry sauce, some wilted basil and the crispy noodles. Not very healthy, I'll admit, but very good.. . The best part was that they had wine glasses, bottle openers and great service for a BYOB place. It's not the cheapest Thai, but for the amount you get and the service, I'll definitely be here again.
