"It will change your life" or so my friend claimed as we headed over to the Kogi BBQ Truck at UCLA. . . A bunch of my friends and I made the journey to UCLA to try out this new craze that I had heard much about. Upon arrival my initial impressions were... why the heck would they put the roach coach in a residential area where it is already impossible to find parking and liable to noise complaints by residents?! After 15 mins of fruitlessly trying to find a parking spot, we were able to find parking. Our 5 min walk to the roach coach seemed an eternity as our stomachs reminded us that it was time to feed. . . We got in line, which happened to take 45 minutes to get to the front. We were overjoyed by the time we placed our orders. Soooo hungry! 4 tacos for me. The others were a combination of tacos and burritos. ;) Anyways, I have to say I was disappointed. Â The beef was good, but it was way too salty. And for all the time we put in to get to the place and get our food... not worth it. But I do want to try the burrito, maybe that will change my mind. . . I would probably go to this place if I saw the truck parked near the USC campus, as they now go to, if there was little to no line. But who has the time to wait around that long for their food?. . So... did it change my life? Sadly, no...
