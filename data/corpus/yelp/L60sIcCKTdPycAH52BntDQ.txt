MMMMmmmmmm DEEP DISH. . . So everyone has been telling me that if I go to Chicago my trip would not be complete without a slice or two of deep dish pizza. So we heard this place was the best, and this one was literally across the street from our hotel! We ended up going twice! Once for pizza, and once to pick up dessert to go to eat in our hotel room! Their slices of cake are HUGE btw and if you actually think you will have room for dessert after you eat pizza here, then well....you must have really clogged arteries. Because their deep dish here is seriously deep dish. My brother who eats a ton had trouble eating two slices here, and I had to cut my second piece in half! We couldn't finish a small supreme deep dish to save our lives. So we brought it back to our room and ate it for breakfast the next morning! ha ha And it was almost as good then as it was when we got it!!. . So why only three stars? The pizza itself deserves 4 stars, but our service was well...almost nonexistent. We ordered a pitcher of beer and almost never got it, and nothing was comped on our bill. And our deep dish took SO SO LONG to come out of the oven. I think that our waiter forgot to put our order in, hence the long long wait for beer and the long long wait for our pizza. I know perfection takes time, and that pizza, with the mounds and mounds of cheese and sausage and peppers and onions and pepperoni was simply phenomenal! But our waiter giving us no beer even while we were waiting just sort of ruined the pizza waiting moment for us......hence the star lost....
