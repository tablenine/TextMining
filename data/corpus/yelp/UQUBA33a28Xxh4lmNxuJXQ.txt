My wife and I dropped in on a Friday night @ 7:00 pm in the summertime and we weren't able to be seated in the dining room which was fine since the back bar was a pretty happening place.. . We got a two top cowboy table near the bar and one of the bartenders ended up being our server. Â He was very attentive to us and he also made two excellent vodka martinis for which Lola's is well known. K thought it was great that he was so casual and "normal.". . Crowded and loud, the back bar was a a great mix of LA adults who like to come for the martinis.. . Appetizers came well-timed - an artichoke dish that missed for me and an excellent French onion soup for K. The dinner entrees were stellar. - K had lobster ravioli and I went for a chicken marsala that made me want to take cooking classes.. . Would love to go back with more friends.
