Went here for lunch on a sunday afternoon.  Walked in to see we basically seat ourselves.  Not even sure if they do table service, but the guy hands us a menu and we find a table.   We sit there for maybe ten minutes before someone comes round to take our order.  . . We were originally sitting at a bar stool at the little side/ back room.  However either the counter was too low or the chairs were too high because i couldn't fit my legs under the counter and personally i don't want to sit a foot away from my food especially when i'm eating a burger.   So the one table in that room left and we pounced on that table... long before our food ever came out.. . Skip ahead to the food.   I ordered the so-cal burger which in itself was pretty tasty.  I normally don't do onions but on this burger they were caramelized and quite tasty.  Wanted to try the sweet potato chips but they were out.  So onion rings and fries were the sides for today.   I mean over all everything was pretty good.   The burger had a good flavor BUT everything and i mean EVERYTHING was really  greasy.   The bun was all shiny like a bald guys head in the summer.  The onion rings dish was covered in a layer of grease at the bottom on the dish.   Also they give you ketchup and stuff but just a little spoon of it, it was necessary to ask for.  Also everything takes a long time to come out, more ketchup took like 4-5 mins!   Man who has time for that.... . In the end we just got up and went to the register to pay, waiting another 10 mins for the bill and another 5 for them to ring it up wasn't really sounding good.   So we pay and leave.. . Would i go back again?  maybe.  Not on my own... only if i was going with someone who really really wanted to.
