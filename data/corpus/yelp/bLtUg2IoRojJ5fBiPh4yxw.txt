Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Trendy LA restaurants aren't usually my scene. So what made me decide to lunch here?  Maybe it was the lure of Taste's famous mac &amp; cheese made with truffle oil and mushrooms.  Or maybe it was the fact that it's right down the street from my regular facial place.  Whatever the reason, I'm glad I kicked all expectations of pretentiousness out of my head, because this place is anything but.  . . Metered parking is ample during lunchtime on weekdays; in fact, we pulled up right in front of the valet stand, stared down Valet Dude, and parked right in front of him.  Muahahahah.  . . Service was a little slow and inattentive, especially since it wasn't all that busy when we were there.  However, our rare interactions with our waiter were pleasant.. . The mac &amp; cheese lived up to the hype! Since it was so heavy and creamy, I didn't think us two girls could finish it. Wrong, so very wrong. Not only that, I pretty much polished off my portobello sandwich and the accompanying salad in record time.  There's a lot going on in that sandwich: most of it good for the tastebuds  and bad for the waistline.  Way too many unnecessary hidden calories; the buttered bun was a bit much.  Thumbs down for that.  . . The overall experience was good.  Taste is a fine choice if you happen to be in the area!
