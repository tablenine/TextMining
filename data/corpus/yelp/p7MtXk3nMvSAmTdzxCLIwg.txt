Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Gastropubs
messy, thick, kinda bloody, surprisingly small but still pretty good. i was ready to give umami 5 stars (before i ate there). there was so much talk about the burgers, mainly by my guy "friend" (another story entirely). he went on and on and on and so finally i had a chance to rush through my first experience at umami. we both ordered the hatch chili burger prior to a film screening next door. so i didn't get to savor each and every bite, which was fine because it turned out that each and every bite wasn't really worth it. the fries seemed a bit old and the quantity (kinda laughable). order the pickle plate, definitely interesting and tasty.
