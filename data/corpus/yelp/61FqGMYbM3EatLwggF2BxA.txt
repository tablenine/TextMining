This place is so good! You cant tell really what it is unless someone tells you about it since it just has a white sign with no writing.. . The pho is super fresh and all their spring and egg rolls are so good.. The meat is good quality and its super clean.. . You know its imperative to have a clean Asian restaurant.. The prices are reasonable too!. Beware though, they only take cash.
