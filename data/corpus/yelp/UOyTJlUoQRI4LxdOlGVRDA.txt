My parents grew-up in Phili and I grew-up in Minneapolis most of my youth was spent listening to them lament on how much better the food was in phili than in Minneapolis.  When I moved down to Chicago 13 years ago I started getting food from Bari and was able to take my parents there as well as other ex phili people all who agree it as good as or better than the best  hoagie you'll find in Phili which claims to be the sandwich capitol.. . The bread is the best, real italian rolls not that soft mushy stuff they serve up at other places.
