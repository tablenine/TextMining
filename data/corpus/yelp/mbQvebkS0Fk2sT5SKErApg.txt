This place is awesome.  Full of energy.  Great place to go for a good time and traditional Japanese street food.  If you love fried food along with beer and sake this is the place for you.  The wings are fantastic, make sure to get them spicy!  Your going to have to wait to get a seat but trust me it is worth it.  To all the haters, this is by no means a fine dining experience, it is about having a great time drinking and eating, and isnt that what it is all about?
