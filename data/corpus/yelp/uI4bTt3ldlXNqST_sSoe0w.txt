So, here's the thing..... . Once a week I head out with my shopping lists and hit up this Whole Foods and Traders Joe's to fill my fridge and pantry with yummy eats. . . My beef with this Whole Foods is that the parking lot is ridiculous, with all the other stores in the area there is no shortage of docuhe bag drivers trying to selfishly steal spots from other patrons. . . For specialty produce and vegetarian items Whole Foods cant be beat, I love the selection of bulk dry goods like rice, oatmeal, and various flours is stunning, not to mention the condiment and spices section, I get a little weak in the knees when walking down the spice isle. True story. . . The premade section is pretty wonderful, my only beef is I cant get a few regional dishes I had come to love in LA, mainly the corn and arugula salad and the edamame hummus, this of course has led to me making them myself, but I'd be just as happy to pick them up premade. I love picking up grilled veggies and the chili schezuan style tofu. . . It can get a little crowded on the weekends so I try to shop during the week, in the evenings or early afternoon.
