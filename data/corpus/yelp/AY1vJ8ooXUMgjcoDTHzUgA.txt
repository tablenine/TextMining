Restaurant: Clarke&#39;s
Category: Diners
I want to love Clarke's and want it to be a regular stop on my diner circuit.  But I can't.  The place is filthy.  Flies zip around at my table.  The food is mediocre, if not crappy.   The service is pitiful.  There will be unnecessary shadow charges hanging around on your debit card long after the charge for your meal has cleared.  The last time I ate there I puked six times the next day (this may not be entirely due to Clarke's, but I don't believe Clarke's helped matters much).. . As for Clarke's after Dark, the bar attached to the restaurant, the last time I was there I sat unnoticed for 10 minutes before I decided to get up and leave and go somewhere else.. . I'm done with Clarke's for a good long while.
