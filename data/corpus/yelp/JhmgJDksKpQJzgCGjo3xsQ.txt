Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If you're a hot dogger/burger fan...This place will make a clown out of any burger joint! 5 guys, Z burger, any goddamn burger joint out there!. . And you never know who you'll find stuffing his face with a big fat half-smoked chilli dogg at 4am....I'm talking to you Jay Leno! Hehe! He's gotta feed that big belly of his someplace!. . Pinks is one of those landmark places to eat while in LA. I mean this place really has been here for god knows how long! They serve some ohh my god, this is soo soo good burgers and fries, and especially hot dogs! You'll find yourself coming back to this place in the middle of the night like you've been possessed just to find a reason to go down La Brea that late!. . For the longest time I actually use to have a ritual of ending my nights out at this place! It was like thurs-sund if you wanted to find me between 4-6am, chances are I'd be here in the parking lot chomping down a few fries and a famous pinks chilidog burger! A delicious burger with cheese, chilli, onion, 3 half smokes, lettuce, tomato, and those famously delicious fries they have! Don't forget their amazing fountain cherry cokes! Ooweeeh nothing like some late night calories to burn off while sleeping! Ofcourse if you have the metabolism of a hyenna on crack, like I do...You don't have to worry about counting calories!. . You can't go wrong wtih Pinks! Whether just a late night purlieu or just a late night munch, even a nice tasty breakfast or good delicious stomach hugging lunch....Be warned, depending on what time you go, the lines can get pretty pretty long here! So try the twilight hours to make sure you get fast fed! Pinks will have you smiling pink! 5 Stars night and day at Pinks Famous!
