Restaurant: Francesca&#39;s Forno
Category: Italian
We ate here for my birthday last month.  It was a busy Saturday night, and we were seated as soon as all of us arrived.  The service was OK, and I can say the same about the food.  My overall  opinion of the restaurant is good, and I'm sure if I go back I will order the dish I originally wanted.  The atmosphere was good, but I just thought they should'nt be playing Top 40 hits inside a Trattoria.  I will say that I enjoyed the Tiramisu and that my chicken dish was adequate.  I will give this place another try and maybe it will leave me with a better taste.
