Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
Moody's is a difficult place to rate. During the warm months, its 4 stars because it has a wonderful outdoor patio. In the cold months, its 3 stars because the inside is so dark (think Geja's) that its difficult to function and see. Seriously, I think you'll need 45-60 minutes in the inside for the rods and cones in your eyes to adapt.. . Good burgers and $10 sangria's.. . Small menu, so expect burgers, sandwiches and alcohol.
