We went when there was no line, got in real quick, snatched up a table, and then I went up to the bar to order our meal.... . I stood there for what seemed like an eternity while the fucking bartender served everyone else except me.  I even moved spots to get his attention, but he kept asking the people directly next to me what they wanted.  I tried to go to the end of the bar, to the corner of the bar, and to the middle of the bar, and had absolutely no luck.  I went to the registers and still nothing. What the fuck. . . It's not even like this place was that busy when we went, the dude was just ignoring me.  I hadn't said a word to him or anyone else and had been as calm as a summer day, so no, he wasn't mad at me for whatever reason you assholes are thinking.. . My friend actually came in from outside because I was taking so long and he ended up getting the attention of the bartender before I was able to and ordered all of our meals.  What the fuck. . . When the burgers finally arrived, they looked very impressive.  We were all very eager to dive in.  . . Admittedly, it was a good burger, definitely NOT the best I've had, and definitely NOT worth the hassle of ordering.  I still cringe when people suggest that we go eat here.  I can't even imagine what it's like during a really busy day if it was this difficult during a slow day.
