First thing you will notice is that there is no parking.  You pretty much have to valet it.  We made a reservation for 9 pm but we still weren't seated until almost 10 pm.  Not a good start.  Once the sushi started coming, it was pretty good.  Everyone really enjoyed the spicy tuna on crispy rice.  We also had a jumbo scallop with foie gras that was so good it should be illegal.  Also there was a creamy rock shrimp tempura that was awesome.  My personal favorite was a baked crab hand roll.  We had some normal stuff too like salmon and yellow tail and they were both good.  The sushi at this place is pretty good but I think what stands out is all the different kinds of sushi they have.  Everything looks really good and I didn't even get to try everything I wanted to.  If you are patient and willing to wait, then I would recommend this place.
