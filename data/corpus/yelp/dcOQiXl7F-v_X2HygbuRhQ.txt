I'm only rating on the fact that there valet was a sweetheart and gave me a ride home after I begged for help because some creeper wouldn't stop following me and grabbing me as I tried to find my bus. I'm only lacking a star because I'm sure the food is great, but I haven't eaten there yet. . . Thank god there are some nice people left in this world.
