Restaurant: Veerasway

Veerasway is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city!  I don't drink often because I don't usually like the taste, but I can't get enough of the Mango Lassi ... it is sweet and delicious, the perfect summer drink!  I love the complimentary crisps and dipping sauces that come at the beginning of the meal, and the samosas and lentils are also amazing.  My only complaint is that the size of the dishes are a little smaller than I'd like them to be for the price, but overall the dining experience and food are pretty spectacular.
