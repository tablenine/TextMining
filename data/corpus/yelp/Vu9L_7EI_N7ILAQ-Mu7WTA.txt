Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
can you say. . "O - VER - RATED". . dont get me wrong, it's pretty good for what it is. but it is nothign more than a gringo taco.. . this wont stop the herds of people from going to titos so let them be.  it's obvious they havent tried king taco or el taurino over in the hood.. . good:  not bad for a gringo taco, the tostada is refreshing. . bad: lines suck, salsa and jalpenos are shit.  they just put it into a blender and serve.. the jalapenos have stems and other shit that will help you in your daily fiber intake. . overall:  if you want real tacos, go to king taco or el taurino.. hell.. i HONESTLY prefer del taco... dont forget the secret sauce..
