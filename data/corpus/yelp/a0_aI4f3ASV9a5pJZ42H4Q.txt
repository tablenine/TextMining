Going to have to strongly disagree with the majority of the reviews.  I am familiar with the red light/green light Brazilian all you can eat BBQ places.  You know what you're getting into.  The salad bar is really impressive here and for that I give them an extra star.  Its a very well stocked salad bar with something for everybody.  I liked the hunks of cheese you could grab.  Let's not forget that this is a BBQ place so the rationale for the 2 stars is very simple - salty meat, way overcooked and extremely expensive.  At other Brazilian BBQ places i've been to there was always some rarer meat but it was hard if not almost impossible to find here.  I tried to work with the servers and find the most rare meat they had and it did not live up to my expectations.  The meat was very salty.  I would not come back here unless I wanted to eat at the salad bar.
