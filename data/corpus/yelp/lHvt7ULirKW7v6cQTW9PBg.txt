The best ramen joint in Los Angeles.  It is as if you stepped right into Japan.  The appetizer salad that comes with the combo ramen is absolutely perfect.  The only downside is that the wait is typically very long.  Sunday afternoon at 4:30 is probably the only time when the place is free of wait.  Remember, ramen is awesome when you have it every now and then.  Eat it everyday, and you'll give this place 2 stars.
