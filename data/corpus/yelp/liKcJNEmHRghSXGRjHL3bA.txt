Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
i was simultaneously anxious ad skeptical to try bottega, but I must admit I was pretty pleased. Not ecstatic, but extremely satisfied. The food is AMAZING. We didn't have anything that was even average as everything was fantastic from coffee and cocktails to breakfast, to pizza, to tea sandwiches. Granted, we went for a late brunch, so there was also no wait for a table and on a Sunday when metered parking is free.... but in such favorable conditions, things still could have gone wrong. But they didn't. We hit a slight snafu when our server was notably annoyed by another table and they neglected to serve us so he could vent to another staff member, but we successfully flagged down a younger, more handsome server to help us in our server's absence. All's well that ends well and luckily this was the case. Prices were on the high side of reasonable, but for the quality of food, I didn't blink an eye and would def go again. Brunch, anyone?
