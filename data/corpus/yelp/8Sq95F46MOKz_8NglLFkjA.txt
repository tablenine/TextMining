Takashi embodies everything I look for in a great dining experience.  The food, service, and atmosphere all surpass expectations.  Granted, my expectations, were pretty high because a good friend raved about Takashi and said it was one of the best dinners she had ever had. I think I had to second that.. It is in the cutest little house, but it has a totally modern vibe.  Points for uniqueness there.  . Our server was superb.  Absolutely superb.  She was so nice and really described dishes very clearly, which was necessary because the menu descriptions don't fully describe the dishes.  My BF thought she was a little to absent during the dinner, but I disagree completely.  Plus, she was really receptive and concerned about my BF's shellfish allergy.. The food was perfection--so flavorful and yet nice and subtle.  Every dish that came out we thought was better than the next and I would highlight recommend.  We did feel that our serve upsold a little bit because we didn't need as much food as we ordered, but it was worth it to try more dishes.  These dishes that I recommend are: the smoked salmon cold starter, the pork belly steamed buns, the Skate Wing, and a wagyu beef special.. We left so happy and it made by BF's birthday dinner really special--thanks Takashi!
