Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I was introduced to this restraunt by my good friend Nic.  Thanks for the recommendation!  My whole family thanks you.  Great Pizza.  I would recommend the Sausage.  If you want pasta, go for something al Bianca.  Make sure you bring cash, and give yourself at least an hour to wait in line.  I have had to wait 3 hours in the rain one evening.  Yes it was worth it, and yes, the food is that good.
