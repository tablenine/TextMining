Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Pillbug introduced me to this restaurant a year ago. it has the best dumplings around.  i never knew dumplings could taste so good.  the service is quick and consistent.  i've been here more times than i can count.  if you're looking for soups, the roast beef soup is my personal favorite.  just get there early, otherwise you'll be waiting in line for some time.  the extension around the corner has the same flavor, but i prefer the atmosphere of the original location.
