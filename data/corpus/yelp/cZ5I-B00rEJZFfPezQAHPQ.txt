The main thing that I really loved about this place was their salsa selections. I tried the pineapple, tomato, green tomato, and the habanero and they were all very tasty. I think that people go more for the drinks than the food because my tacos weren't anything to write home about. I tried the beef and the fried tilapia tacos...blah. You get your choice of 50 different kinds of margaritas which is a plus. Everything was pretty affordable I think. The waiter was extremely friendly. Sit on the patio if the weather is warm.
