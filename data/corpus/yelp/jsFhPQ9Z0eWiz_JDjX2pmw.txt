YUMMM AYCE for 16.99$. Five types of meat and my favorite is the Pork belly.. The egg dish is soooooo goood! i can eat 2 hotpots myself. The re is plenty of banchan(sp?) with kimchee, rice paper, salad, etc. . This place is great for birthday celebrations and will give you a bottle of champagne if you bring a cake. (POP CHAMPAGNE WHOAAAA) It gets crowded and loud at night even on weekdays. I went last night (: They have a call service button on the table which is helpful because it is hard to get the waiter's attn. Cant wait to come back next week (:
