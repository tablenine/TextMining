Moody's is perfect for a low-key, artery-clogging meal. This place is very dark, Viking-beer hall looking almost. . . Things I liked:. - Parking lot!. - They have a great blue cheese burger.. - The fried shrimp dinner is amazing. Lots of fried shrimpy goodness. I even ate the tails. They were crunchy and delicious. . - The dinner salad that comes with the fried shrimp dinner! Never have I seen so many cherry tomatoes on a salad. I am obsessed with tomatoes and probably ate about 15-20 of them. . - I spotted my absolute favorite Northwestern celebrity there. Think long dyed hair and kilts. I love him!!!. - Sooooooooooooo cheap. $9 fried shrimp dinner?!?! Yes. At Moody's you can!. . The not so good:. - Cash only. Boo! Take my plastic please?. - You will leave here smelling like grilled burgers. . - Supposedly you get free peanuts at your table? We didn't get any. :(. - French fries are so so.. - Iced tea is no good. No refills either. Don't get the pitcher. Yucky.. - JN ordered mushrooms on his burger. He did not get mushrooms. He was charged for them. Tsk tsk.
