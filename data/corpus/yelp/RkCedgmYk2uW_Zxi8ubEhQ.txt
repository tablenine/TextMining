Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
The regular $8 burrito can for sure feed 2  people (normal eaters)  The Manuel Special burrito is said to be almost 5 lbs... yikes!! The food is not all that rich in flavor though. This place is all about super size, so if you want the most out of your dollar, this joint hits the spot.
