i was driving through LA with Brian R. when I saw the tiny little sign for this place out of the corner of my eye. I recognized the name from O O's review and insisted we stop for lunch. what a lucky coincidence that i was HUNGRY!!! . . Brian and I shared the port and stilton burger and the pork burger. BOTH WERE SO GOOD. the size was perfect considering the richness of the meat and cheeses and i loved that the buns were not too bready. i thought the burger with blue cheese was going to be my fave but i ended up liking the pork burger more. i was so impressed with the combination of flavors and the juiciness of the meat. the fries: i'll probably skip them next time. they were a little mealy. and i didn't think the spoonful of ketchup was enough considering the mealiness. . . i can't wait to go back and try all the other burgers!
