i ate here last night and got stuffed. . . the food was great. we odered a few appetizers and got a ton of complimentary dishes since my bro's friends with the head chef. free food is good food no matter what. a bum could give me his pizza crust and im sure id still enjoy it.. . we got the calamari, i thought it was gonna be fried but it wasnt i believe it was in its ink, and it was very tasty, a lot of lemon in it.. . the chicken liver patte was real good with just a hint of that liver graininess.  got some peppers with tuna on it, that was ok nothing special... the tomatoes and mozarella was good,  the mussels drenched in olive oil were awesome, and the super creamy cauliflower appetizer was the shit. i didnt even try the salad we got, it looked too healthy and green to be dining out . . the margherita pizza, mushroom pizza were good nothing spectacular. there was one pizza we got with goat cheese which was a kick in the mouth, i could have just ate that and been happy.. . for dessert we got vanilla gelatti, some cappucino/espresso type dessert and a complimentary butterscotch something i cant rememeber. anyway, all desserts were real rich and fattening, just the way i like it.. . 4 stars for the food, service, and complimentary dishes of course. minus 1 star for the bartender with the handle-bar mustache looking like a late 70's pornstar.. . id recommend trying this place out if youre in the mood for gourmet type pizza.
