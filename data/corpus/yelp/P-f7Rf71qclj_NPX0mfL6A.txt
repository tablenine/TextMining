Mike and Pete are two of the friendliest guys in Atlanta. If you aren't a regular, you will feel like one by the time you leave. I found the Pub through my visits every other Tuesday with the Atlanta Photographer's Guild but now whenever I am up in Atlanta, I am always sure to stop in for a Mad Italian and a mojito. . A definite stop if you are in town!
