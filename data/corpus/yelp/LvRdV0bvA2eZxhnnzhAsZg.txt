Sooooo perfect.. . The grounds were beautiful. I know, grounds. I come from southern cal where grounds are the parking lot and the shrubs in front. . . The architecture was also stunning. Well appointed, correctly lit, good acoustics (Monday night and the restaurant was full but it was easy to talk). . . The service was unforgettable. The funny thing is I am usually horrible with names but because of the experience I remember them all.. . Kevin the bar tender that was on the spot bringing us drinks before we asked. Love the paddle shaped stir stick and the pretty bottle of simple syrup.. . June our waitress. Awesome. I realized very soon she understood the menu and how it paired like nothing I had ever heard a server explain. I ended up having her pick everything; the bread (baked in the restaurant earlier that day), the salad, the slow roasted Carolina rabbit with swiss chard stuffed pasta, the wine to go with the dinner, and the desert a 70% coca hard shell hiding a flour less chocolate cake with camel and just the right amount of salt to make it sweet and complex (also prepared in house that day). Â There is no way I could have picked a better meal, everything was way beyond expectation.. . I have a more detailed review here with pictures: . http://blog.proven3pl..... . . The only downsides to the night were my wife was not present (work trip) but she would have LOVED this place and esp the desert!
