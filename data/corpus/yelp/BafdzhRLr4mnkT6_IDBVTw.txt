Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
After having read some of the other reviews for Parker's on Ponce I was expecting a somewhat marginal meal, poor service, and ubiquitous attitude. Was I in for an enjoyable surprise. We had an excellent meal, incredible service, and a generous helping of hospitality from the entire staff. We shared the Sun-dried tomato and artichoke dip with grilled pita appetizer and we both had NY Strip Steaks, hers with Béarnaise Sauce, mine with Bleu Cheese. Both cooked perfectly though the tarragon in the Béarnaise Sauce was a little strong for my liking. We had the Black Truffle Mac &amp; Cheese and Cream Corn sides, both were very good but from the hype I half expected the Mac &amp; Cheese to be habit forming. It seemed they skimped on the Truffles but it was still very good. One of the things that impressed me and isn't typical much anymore was other wait staff completing service on tables that were not even their customers. . We sat in the front room and enjoyed watching the passers by save for the one sweaty heavy set fellow that probably draws the thought "Dude, Put on a shirt" from 10 out of 10 people. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and service, we plan to return soon!
