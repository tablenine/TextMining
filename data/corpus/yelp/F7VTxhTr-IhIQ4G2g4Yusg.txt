Restaurant: Rock Bottom Restaurant &amp; Brewery
Category: Restaurants
Tired after a long day at work downtown? No worries - Rock Bottom is here to save the day!. . Roll down to Rock Bottom Restaurant &amp; Brewery in the perpetual construction zone of Grand and State just across the street from the American Medical Association Building. Inside you'll find the best that chain restaurants have to offer with a sports bar area featuring booths, stools, and large TVs to catch the game and pass the hours by subtly.. . Not your style? Creep back to their pool room where pool tables galore will be there to suit your needs and TVs are abound to keep you entertained and able to follow your favorite team. Yes, Rock Bottom Brewery is a misnomer - it should be renamed Hell Yes Happy Hour!. . Let's say you don't really like any of those things and want something a bit more....sedative. So be it - you can creep out to the restaurant side of the bar and enjoy a quiet and intimate setting for lunch, happy hour, or dinner. . . Did I mention this place has a rooftop?! Truth be told, it's the dead of winter and we're slowly watching the deceleration of winter into the evolving and nascent spring but know that on summer days the rooftop can be opened and you can even host your own private party up in the sun. Be prepared to wear sunglasses since the mirrored American Medical Association building is sure to blind you!. . Now let's get to the brass tracks - Rock Bottom is also a brewery!! With their award winning flavors you're going to find the beer that suits your needs. Need a stout? No problem they have several home brews to choose from! Hankerin' for a pale ale? No problem - you want it they got it! The food menu will send you into a food coma and passes the An Unstoppable taste test.. . Next time you're looking for a happy hour hot spot, think Rock Bottom! You'll thank me later!
