Burgers and beers. That's it and that's all.. . Then there are those who come to FO to be seen. Hoochie mamas, their respective pimps, dudes who lounge around like they're too cool... ya'll need to get your swerve on somewhere else. It's not a club. People wanna eat some burgers up in here!. . The burger is consistently well made and hits all sorts of flavors (sweet, savory, meaty). I love the variety of beers including the seasonal selections -- it's always fun to try something different. Of course the sweet potato fries are a hit. That's my usual order, even though I tell myself I'm going to try something new. That burger is just too dang good to pass up!. . Tips: It gets crowded... really crowded.
