Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I've been waiting to try this place all my life (OK, since I heard of its fabled hot and spicy ramen where if you finish it in 30 minutes or less, they take your picture and post it on their wall of fame.) Everyone told me I was the shoe in for hot ramen eater of the year- so it is written so let it be told! . . 27 minutes. I conquered the Level 1- crazy spicy shio ramen! I am beaming with the same pride that was illuminating from my big wide Korean face as I hoisted the bowl to the camera to show off it's emptiness. Flash, bitches! Now gimme some magic markers so I can write some silly message on the bottom of my proud Polaroid!. My guy friends sat in amazement as they struggled with their paltry Level 5 ramens. Buffoons! . . I can't wait to go back and have another photo taken. Bring the capsicum!
