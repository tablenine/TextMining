Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
I am a big fan of Mario Batali. I was at Pizzeria Mozza the weekend it opened (...but alas, they ran out of pizza dough. However, the following week, I got in...), and enjoyed every minute of eating.. . Osteria Mozza is much more open and quiet than the pizzeria, and you can't go wrong with anything from the Mozzarella Bar (Thank you, Nancy!). The Octopus Antipasti was also grilled to perfection. . . And now you're asking "Good things so far, why only three stars?" And I would reply, "Because of the pasta tasting." But I have hope!. . There were some nice dishes--and wines--during the Pasta Tasting, but nothing to specifically Yelp about (and I was kinda uncomfortably full after the meal). So, I will be back to try the many other delicious-sounding plates which will hopefully add another star to this rating.. . (A closing note for Mr. Batali and Ms. Sliverton...Why no Carbonara? Import the recipe from Otto; ain't nothin' wrong there!)
