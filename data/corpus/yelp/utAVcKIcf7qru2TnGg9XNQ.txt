I ate here for my brother's birthday dinner and it was absolutely delicious and amazing. We had the pasta tasting menu and wine pairing (very pricey) but completely worth it. It was a great way to have a large variety of something Batali is known well for, his pasta! And they gave us pretty generous portions of wine too. The Waiters even obliged my mom and beautifully attached the oversized candles she brought with her to both his desert plates that came with the tasting. . . I can't wait to go back!
