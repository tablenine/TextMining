Also came here for restaurant week, and I came away with a so-so impression. The point of restaurant week is to make me want to go back and spend money on the regular menu, and for the quality of their sashimi alone I would be tempted to return. Their yellowtail was absolutely fantastic, and the tuna and salmon weren't shabby either!. . The sea bass entree was cooked oddly, however. Seemed overdone?. . Tiramisu was more dense than expected, but that's not a bad thing. I thought it was delicious. Tied for favorite part of the meal with that yellowtail :P~~~~. . I like the layout of the restaurant. Low-lit, but not *too* low. An intimate space, but not so close that I can overhear every word out of our neighbors' mouths.. . I lean towards wanting to try again. Next time, I'll stick to the sushi and sashimi. Yum.
