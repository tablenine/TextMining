Restaurant: Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse
Category: Latin American
This popular Colombian restaurant on Lincoln Avenue has the same menu as the one on Irving Park. The Lincoln location is a bit cozier, with some tables having bench seating while others have chairs. Many of the meals are combo platters with numerous items on large plates that hold a wide sampling of foods. My enormous dish included steak, rib tips, beans, rice, avocado, sweet plantain, and a few other things too. You really don't need appetizers with such generous portions, but they are good, notably the plantain topped with melted cheese. The lemonade was more like refreshing limeade, and desserts like coconut flan do not remain on the plate too long.
