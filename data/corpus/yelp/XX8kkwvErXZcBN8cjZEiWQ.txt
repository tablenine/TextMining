Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
I rarely venture to Lakeview for meals, but I have made a few special trips just for Joy's panang curry noodles. I haven't found another restaurant that makes this dish quite so amazing! The noodles are perfectly crispy and the flavor is delicious with a little bit of a kick. This is a great BYOB restaurant.
