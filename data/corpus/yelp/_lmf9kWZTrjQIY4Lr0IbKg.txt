Okay, this place has grown on me. We love the pho now. The broth seems to have gotten tastier and the spring rolls are delicious. . . The only negative is that the one time we tried to order delivery, they wouldn't do it, even though they advertise it on their takeout menu. If you don't want to do delivery, don't put it on your menu. It sets up expectations!
