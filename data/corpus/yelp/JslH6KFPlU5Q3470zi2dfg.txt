i dont really understand how. anyone can give this place anything but 5 stars. unless its because they have to wait like an hour. cos no one goes out early in l.a.  . . the food: fantastic!. try the following:. . 1. juicy pork dumplings (most can eat an order themselves along with sides). 2. shangai rice cakes wiht chicken (bomb as fk). 3. chicken dumplings. 4. sour and spicy soup (a large order is enough for four to five people). 5. hot tea . 6. green beans (one of my faves). 7. try the chili thats on the table with the ginger for hte dumplings along with soy sauce and vinegar. . by the way, the dumplings will be satanically hot when u get then. so puncture a hole on the top of it and let it breathe for a few seconds. b4 trying to take it down or u will burn, bad. . overall, beyond bomb. . there was a couple that had driven up from the O.C. . and i gave them a few pointers. they told me afters they loved it.. . o, i saw a neighboring table eating what looked like huge dumplings,. i asked them what they were eating to which they said it was the pork buns.  bomb !!!!!   . go now, but get there early, this shit gets packed quick and u will wait forever
