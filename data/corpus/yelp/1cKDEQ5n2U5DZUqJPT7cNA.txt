Restaurant: Highland Tap
Category: Steakhouses
Craving a soup and salad, I knew Highland Tap had a great French onion soup and delicious roasted beet and goat cheese salad. I was not disappointed. As my neighborhood bar and steak joint, I've had about 100 delicious meals here so it's about time I wrote a review. This place is serious about food, especially steak and prime rib. You don't find fusion food here, it's classic and straightforward like the ceasar salad, steak salad, prime rib, etc. The big secret is this place is awesome for lunch for there are no crowds.. If you're craving some red meat and a great cocktail, step into the dark cavern know as Highland Tap and enjoy some great food.
