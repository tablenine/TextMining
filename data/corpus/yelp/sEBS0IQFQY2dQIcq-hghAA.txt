YES, YES, YES!! Hands down, Langer's pastrami is totally a Meg Ryan moment!. . I really have nothing NEW to add to the 547 previous reviews before me.  Its just a no brainer to ORDER PASTRAMI when most if not all of those reviews rave about pastrami.  . . I got the #10 - pastrami, swiss cheese on rye this past Saturday afternoon.  My friends and I are already trying to coordinate our calendars again to get our asses down there for another go.  Yes, these sandwiches are THAT good and soo well worth the wait!  . . The #19 - pastrami, swiss cheese with coleslaw on rye looked mouthwatering delicious as well. How clever to pile on the coleslaw, lol, since it all goes down the same way anyway, right?. . Love that Langer's is accessible via the Red Line off the Westlake/McArthur Park Metro Stop. Can't wait to go again very very soon!  Maybe this next time, I'll order to go and just walk across the street to enjoy my sandwich at McArthur Park.  My friends swear up and down that it's safe.  Hmm, this surburbia bred girl will ponder that idea.
