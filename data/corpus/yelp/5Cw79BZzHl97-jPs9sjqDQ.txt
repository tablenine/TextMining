I took my good friend here because she had always told me about the porchetta in Tuscany, where she grew up.. . She had the porchetta plate and I had the beans and greens.. She said the pork was very good, but not as fatty as in Italy, but still very good.. My beans and greens were fabulous. Both were cooked to perfection with nice chunks of mild garlic and finished with lemon juice and olive oil. . . Such a cute lil' place and perfect for the roasted pork lover as well as the beans-n-green lover.
