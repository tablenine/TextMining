Pretty overrated and a poor value, but it is a good meal so I give it 3 stars. . . I got the shelled crab and garlic noodles to share.  That's about $60 right there just for me.  It was good...but waaaay oversalted and pretty oily.  I probably wouldn't go here again and I'm glad I wasn't paying.. . I also got a lavender mojito that was seriously to die for.  The service here is really good and the seating is nicely laid out for relaxing talk...some fine dining places are so packed and so loud- this wasn't like this, which was nice.
