Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
Manuel's Tavern is open till 2 am on weeknights!. . Have you ever been searching for a bar on a random Monday or Tuesday night where you want sit at, get drunk, and not feel like an alcoholic? The folk's at Manuel's won't judge you. Hell, the waitresses will probably join your party. Ten years down the line, you'll look at your photos from the nights here at Manuel's and remember how freeing it was before you had to pay the babysitter 50 dollars to have a good night out.. . The place is open with big wooden tables that can hold groups of ten. Even though the place is divided into smoking and non-smoking sections, the smell still seeps into your clothes. Nothing is really clean here, but you don't mind after a pint of beer and some fries (something about the laid back atmosphere makes me crave French fries, which aren't even that great).  . . The PARKING IS FREE in the huge lot next door if you are a Manuel's customer.  What I do on Friday nights in The Highlands (Virginia Highlands area of town) is start by having dinner here at Manuel's with some drinks and park for free, walk down the street to Dark Horse or Hand 'n Hand at midnight, and end the night back at Manuel's for one more pint and a bathroom break before the D.D. insists the night is over.
