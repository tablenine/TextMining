A good average Indian restaurant.  Everything was pretty good except the palak paneer (usually my favorite Indian dish but this one left something to be desired), and the Bertha was excellent.  . . I came with a friend and we got the dinner special for 2, which could have easily fed three.  Because we ordered so much food, we had to get some to go, and so we got to experience the real treat, which was watching the busboy pack the extra food into to-go boxes.  This kid was AMAZING!  I have never seen a human being transport food from a plate into a styrofoam with such speed and skill.  Honestly, I want to go back and film this dude and then put it on youtube.  The meal was memorable, because of this guy.
