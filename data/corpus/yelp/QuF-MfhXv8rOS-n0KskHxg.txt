Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Tasty!  Tasty!  Tasty!  Wow!  The lines were super long, but they always are.  Philippe's French Dips are the best -- ever!  You have your choice of meats:  chicken, pork, beef, or lamb.  All are tasty, but my favorite is the original beef.  It's no wonder the place has been around for almost 100 years!  Parking was a little challenging, but if you can take the subway Phillippe's is only 2 blocks from the Downtown Union Station.  They're CASH ONLY, so bring enough 'cause you may want to try everything!
