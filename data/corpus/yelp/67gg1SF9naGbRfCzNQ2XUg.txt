This place is like a Buca di Beppo (. http://www.bucadibeppo.... ) except slightly less obnoxious and slightly higher quality. This isn't saying much because I absolutely loathe Buca. From what I can tell, they try to boast about their "family size portions," blah blah blah. When my mom and I went here, it wasn't bad because I think we went at a weird time (3pm), so it wasn't horribly crowded and loud. I cannot imagine going here at a typical dinner hour though - I don't understand why there is such a huge crowd for this place. Granted, I don't think it's AWFUL, but it's certainly nothing special, either. Exceedingly mediocre. I make better marinara.
