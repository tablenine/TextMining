Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
The food here was great...just as I imagined.  Enjoyed every part about the experience from the food to the location.  The burrito was enough for 2.  We also had the chips and guacamole, which was also really good.  The chips were as fresh as they can get.   I plan on going back soon.   Go experience El Tepeyac!
