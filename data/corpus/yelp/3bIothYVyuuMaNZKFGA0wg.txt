casa vega is my after work go to place. it's always lively and open. i always get either the classic or cadillac margarita with patron...hits the spot. i love the kitschy decor and the friendly staff. the food and drinks aren't that special but it's just one of those neighborhood places you end up loving. stay away from the tostada...no good.
