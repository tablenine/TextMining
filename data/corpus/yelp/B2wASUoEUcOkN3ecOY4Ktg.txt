Restaurant: Uncle Bill&#39;s Pancake House
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Average breakfast place in busy Manhattan Beach. Sure, it's a desirable spot with the option to sit outside with the beautiful views of the beach while enjoying mediocre food. I say this if it's what your intentions are but if you are looking for just great breakfast without a lengthy wait, it may not be the place you want to go. There is always a long line. The omelettes are great and aside from the pancakes that came with the omelettes, I also tried the waffles, which were again average. I would think pancakes would be their specialty, thus the name, so I was curious to try it. I may not be the person you would want to ask for an honest opinion about pancakes because I really don't eat it that often and would care less for them, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. Sure, the pancakes were good and that's it.
