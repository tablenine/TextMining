I've been eating at Manny's for years (LONG before Obama), of course, and it is still my absolute favorite deli in the city. Yesterday I had my favorite piled-high corned beef sandwich and a bowl of matzo ball soup. I truly felt like I had joined the tribe! ;-) . . My companion had the roasted turkey leg and it was also super scrumptious. We both left stuffed and happy. Manny's is comfort food at its best. Quick, delicious, uncomplicated. Just like home. I don't go there as often as I'd like, because my diet would consist solely of corned beef. But it is truly a treat and a treasure.. . Beat the crowds and go mid-to-late afternoon. And bring cash -- they are old-school and it's cash only. Enjoy!
