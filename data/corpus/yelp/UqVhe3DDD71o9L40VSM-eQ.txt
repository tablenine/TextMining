meh. I've been here twice and stuck to pasta with meat items both times. There's nothing special about the sauce...it's bland. I imagine it'd taste a lot like the table cloth if you went to town on that before your meal came. . . The little private booths are not good for groups, even if you only have a few people. It's like being in a shed. Without the lawn mowers. However, if you do get stuck in the shed, take this little gem of information with you:  there's a button near the door that turns on a light just outside of the shed to get the waiter's attention. They don't tell you this, and the waiter's hardly come by if you don't flick on the light. So that's a little weird. . . Also, speaking of lights, there's hardly any in those booths. Which backs up my shed analogy quite nicely I think. . . Service was ok, once I figured out the unmarked call button. They seem to be pretty prompt with seating your pre-reserved party.  Portions are gigantic, which is good only if you enjoy the food. Leaving  with a container the size of a VCR full of bland pasta isn't really exciting.
