This is where those passed over by American Apparel ad directors went to get jobs. They're not happy about forgoing dreams of having images of their spandex-clad, splayed crotches grace the sides of major metro area buildings, so bigtime airs abound. . . Your order for mediocre food will be taken by a young woman busting a highly imaginative thigh-high tube socks/Daisy Dukes ensemble, or something along these lines.. . The waitstaff dart around the room treating it like a Parisian runway. Go here for a good laugh.
