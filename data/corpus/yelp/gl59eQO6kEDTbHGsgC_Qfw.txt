I absolutely love this place.  I remember when it opened (10 years ago?) and it has maintained its atmosphere and food.  Very fun artsy and quirky place - open late with a good jukebox.  The decor has been continually tweaked over the years and seats added but the atmosphere is still there.  My understanding from my first visit 10 years ago was the original decorations came out of someones garage.  I remember the scrabble letter table w/ a ladle sticking out of the top (now gone) and the psychedelic spinning table top (i believe still there).. . Some menu highlights are:  BBQ chicken pizza (the best!), fried calamari, and hummus.  Everything I have ever tried has been great.  No complaints!  The drink menu - coffee drinks, hot chocolate, etc; is also very tasty!
