Went here for the first time last night, since we tried two other Japanese restaurants which are closed on Mondays.... . Not much to complain about here, but nothing to write home about either.  A good place for Japanese small plates with decent traditional-ish Japanese ambience.  I thought the hamachi kama was great, as was the eggplant with pork.  The eggplant in miso sauce was good, but the eggplant was a little bitter, and the portion size was pretty small--just four one-inch squares of eggplant.  The sea bass and the sweet potato croquettes were just okay.  The croquettes were a bit heavier than I expected (more like American bread crumbs than panko-style), and a little too crispy.  The five dishes plus rice set us back $32+tip, which is awesome for two people--we were full but not stuffed.. . I knew this wasn't a sushi joint, but I was craving sushi and was hoping they would have a few basics on the menu...  or even grilled eel!  No such luck, but at least they were open on Monday night and have their own parking lot!
