Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If your opinions about a place become totally immoderate if you have to wait a long time in line, don't bother coming to Pink's. You'll probably hate it.. . That said, Pink's is good. It's definitely not great, though, and I'd rather get a dog from the guy in my neighborhood (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). Oh, and you'd have to have your head five feet up your ass to think that the onion rings are any good.. . At Pink's, you truly can get equal portions of protein, grains and roughage all in one convenient package. In my experience, though, it's unpleasant figuring out the logistics of eating a hot dog with so much junk stacked on top of it. Once you do, at least it tastes pretty good.. . I'll stop by Pink's if I'm in the area and the line is short, but I learned from my first visit that viewing it as a culinary destination is unwise. Furthermore, I think the length of the line is directly proportional to how far you go out of your way to visit Pink's.
