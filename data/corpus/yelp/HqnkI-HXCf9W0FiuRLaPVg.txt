The food is decent, nothing spectacular. The sign on your way in said Authentic Mexican food, but its not. I think that's why I felt a little deceived. However.... The food was good, the service was meh, but the place is awesome. I love the day of the dead theme, and the artwork is amazing. Definitely a one time try at least. My only other gripe is that this place is in the middle of nowhere, by an industrial park. Â Oh yea... one more disclaimer... They are not open on Mondays.
