Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Whenever my friends at UCLA asked me for a sushi recommendation, I always directed them to Hide. It is close and relatively affordable for a sushi restaurant, but what I like most is the Japanese management. I am tired of going to Korean or Chinese run Japanese restaurants. The people here, including the four chefs are Japanese and clearly well-trained. I'm speaking from the perspective of a guy who has had a Mexican sushi chef and Benihana chef before. For all other things, I don't mind who prepares my food, but for sushi, I still trust a Japanese person more. Everything on the sushi menu is pretty good, but I'd avoid getting the omakase. They just end up serving the things straight off the menu with no innovation. You're better off ordering the stuff you like rather than paying $10 for a Catalina Roll that they had left over from the other table that ordered it. *Note: Closed on Mondays and cash only. . . http://www.gildedpalat....
