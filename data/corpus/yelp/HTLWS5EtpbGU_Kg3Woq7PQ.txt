I was so, so full from my Berry Pancakes, but I could not stop eating my boyfriend's fries. They were so seasoned and delicious! The bus ride home was near unbearable!. . One star down for the inattentive waitress. A table, also 2 people, came in well AFTER us, ordered after us, got food about the same time, and left before us. I think, in the hour plus that we were there I had my water refilled once. Boo to you, girl with the curly hair.
