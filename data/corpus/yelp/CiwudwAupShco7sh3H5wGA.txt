Restaurant: Gilbert&#39;s Mediterranean Cafe
Category: Greek
I was Johnny-on-the-spot arriving at Gilbert's on a Sunday morning for an early brunch, right after the place opened at 10 am. In fact, they were still writing the specials on the board when I walked in. I got my choice of tables since there was NO ONE else in the place. But that quickly changed. By the time my guest and I left, the place was packed.. . The service was great, very attentive and helpful. The food was so so. They have an "all you can eat" brunch menu that kicks in if you order at least three items on their list of selections. I settled on just two things, so I saved a few bucks. The biscuit and gravy was okay -- not spectacular. The gravy was a bit lumpy and supposedly had gyro meat in it (they ARE a mediterranean place, right?) but it was not very noticeable and didn't seem to add much to the overall taste. Add a huge side of tasty, crispy bacon and I was sufficiently lubed up with cholesterol for the day. . . I would go back to try some of the other items on the menu. Not bad for under $10.
