When it comes to Sushi Gen, I know what it feels like to be a bird circling its prey.  For the past 6 years or so, I'd always try to make it a point to visit Sushi Gen, but for whatever reason I just wouldn't be able to go.  So when a business meeting warranted visiting downtown LA, I made a straight beeline to Sushi Gen for my long awaited sushi dinner.. . The lot parking is almost always full, but there is plenty of street parking around the corner if you don't mind walking a bit.  Luckily, we were able to snag a table for two at the sushi bar at 7:30pm in a mere 3 minutes.  All the stars must have been aligned because I think everyone else had waited at least 15 minutes.  The action behind the sushi bar is happening.  I counted at least 6 sushi chefs and a handful of other guys working the back of the sushi bar.. . I make it a habit of ordering omakase only at the better sushi establishments so I had no qualms putting our dining adventure in the trustworthy hands of our sushi chef.  Overall, very impressed with the fresh quality of the fish.  Kanpachi, mirugai, toro, and ebi were particularly delicious.  The shrimp head miso soup was robust and flavorful as well.  IMO the portions were actually quite generous and the sushi to rice ratio was just right.  We could have stopped at the end of the omakase, but the kanpachi and toro were just too good that we placed another order.. . This may not be the best sushi joint in LA, but Sushi Gen definitely ranks in the top 20.  And in this town, that's still saying quite a lot.
