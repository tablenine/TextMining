A little bird told me that the truck would be here today, so I trekked out of my cubicle at 12:30 sharp.  Already a line of 15 (this would mysteriously turn into 25 later) were waiting, and the hot sun didn't help.. . After the sweating and the ordering and the eating, here's the DL:. . 1. They charge tax!! 10%!!  Why hasn't anyone mentioned this??. 2. They are ridiculously, inefficiently, mindblowingly slow.. there weren't even that many people, but it still took me 50 min to get my grub; they've got five guys in a truck, throwing together the same meats on different sized tortillas.. you'd think by now they would have adopted Sir Ford's assembly line?. 3.  The tacos are SO tiny for $2.20, the Asian in me cried.  Don't be deceived by those Yelp macro photos!. . However, when I finally had my bite of the elusive Kogi taco.. I have to admit I guess it's worth $2 (but not the tax and time).  The kimchi/beef blend is perfect, balanced out with two corn tortillas - stick to the short ribs and spicy pork, as chicken was bleh.. . I'd totally get those tacos again, but only when they learn to ándale!. . ****Update*****. Blackjack Quesadilla is SO BOMBDIGGITYTASTIC I have bumped Kogi from 3 to 4 stars!  Yes folks, it's that good.  Please don't get the Tofu Taco, even if you're vegetarian, it is as tasteless as cardboard.  And if you're rollin' with your Benjamins, they won't break a $100 bill, so hope your friend can cover you!
