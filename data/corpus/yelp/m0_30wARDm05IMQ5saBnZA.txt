Fun but very very busy atmosphere.  Get a reservation.  Food is unique and really delicious.  My table seriously enjoyed the scallops plate and the stuffed duck breast dish.  The rocket salad is full of flavor.  Can't really taste the crab in the crab appetizer.  Overall, very good food with  great service.  The unisex bathrooms are a little dirty for my taste in a nice restaurant like this.
