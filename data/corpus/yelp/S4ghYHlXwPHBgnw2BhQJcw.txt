Restaurant: Straits
Category: Asian Fusion
It probably didn't help this place that I had eaten at Spice Market in the Midtown W the day before.. . Straits is trying to be an Asian fusion place with a "Malaysian" focus.  . It had the usual assortment of Chinese/Thai/Indian choices.. . The meals come on small plates and meant to be shared.  That meant that my friends and I got to taste a lot of the dishes and found them almost uniformly UNDERspiced.  . . Take the garlic Noodles....I would have run through about a hundred different spices before I would have guessed there was garlic in them..   . We were even warned by our waitress about a chicken dish being spice, but after assuring her several times we were ready for it... in essence "Bring it On!" and it was disappointing.. . If I come to a Thai/Asian restaurant and am warned a dish is hot, I'm ready for it to be somewhere in the vicinity of thermonuclear!. . As a bar, I think this place works better, they had a decent selection of wines, some interesting drinks, a lemongrass mojito that would play well as a night starter, for instance.. . I think overall If your looking for this kind of food, head 7 blocks north to Spice Market,  You're not saving enough money at Straits to trade down.
