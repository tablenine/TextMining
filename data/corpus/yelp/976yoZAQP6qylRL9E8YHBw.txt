Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
My boyfriend and I had brunch here a few weeks ago, and it was very tasty. They gave us free coffee during our 10 minute wait, and we had great service and very good food. Strawberry banana pancakes and the red chilaquiles. Tastiness indeed. . . Flo would have gotten four stars, maybe even five, had we not tried their dinner last night.. . We ordered the portabella enchiladas and the nachos with chicken. Now, we had delivery, and I'm sure the nachos were affected by that. But they still could have used more cheese. My boyfriends enchiladas were lame. All spicy, no flavor. Almost no cheese in those either, but still no flavor at all. My boyfriend said they were "crap in a box". A little harsh maybe, but we decided that Flo is a no-go for anything but brunch. . . Damn shame.
