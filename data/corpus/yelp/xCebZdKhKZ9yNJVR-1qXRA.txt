My friends and I went here for the "challenge" on a Saturday night.  The wait of half an hour wasn't too bad.  One friend ordered the number 7 (not spicy at all) and the other three of ordered the Special #2.  We also shared a fried rice as we heard it was good.. . Pros: The fried rice was good but a little mushy for our tastes.  The ramen is not extraordinary but not the worse either.  The 3 hardest parts of the Special #2 challenge are: 1) there are a lot of sliced jalapenos on the bottom of the bowl, 2) the soup is very hot (heat-wise) when it's brought out, 3) there is A LOT of broth.  That being said, one of my friends finished in 15 minutes.  I finished in 25 minutes.  One of my friends tried to slurp up the broth with a straw... not a good idea.. . Cons: We all made the wrong assumption that when you order the extra egg for the ramen, it would be dropped in to be soft-boiled.  It just ended up being a full hard boiled egg.
