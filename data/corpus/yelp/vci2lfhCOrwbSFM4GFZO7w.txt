Restaurant: Atlanta Fish Market Restaurant
Category: Seafood
Our hotel recommended the Atlanta Fish Market in Buckhead and it was good. I ordered the Peruvian Sea Bass "Hong Kong style" and it literally melted in my mouth it was so tender.  Funny part was that It came with "sticky rice".. When the sticky rice arrived, it was just sushi rice, not sticky rice. We asked the waiter and he said in his Georgia Drawl... "Its seems sticky to me".. The interior of the restaurant is very loud and crowded.  The selections of fresh seafood is truly impressive, they have all them main things you would find.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't have squid or octopus, but I got over it when I bit into the Sea Bass.  It is in  Buckhead so after dinner you can talk a walk north and find a club to hang out in.  Definitely recommend it.
