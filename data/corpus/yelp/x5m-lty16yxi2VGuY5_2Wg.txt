We have ordered from Portos a handful of times for company events. I particularly like their cheese rolls and their mini cheesecake tartlike pastries. I have tried their white and chocolate sheet cake and thought it was just ok. I stopped in yesterday to get a dozen cheese rolls for 7.40. What a great deal! It's always so pack up in herrrrrrr.
