Sorry folks, this place does not deserve anything over par.... . If one were to use one word to describe Sushi Gen's food, I think the word "standard" would be quite appropriate.  There really isn't anything wrong with their food.  Fish are pretty fresh, and everything is done right, but to all honesty their sushi feels like they came out of a factory rather than prepared by sushi chefs creating them with their hearts.. . You know those sushi for dummies menu with pictures for different types of sushi that has both Japanese and English names?  That's exactly like what Sushi Gen serves you, nothing less but nothing more either.
