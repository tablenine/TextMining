Restaurant: Adobo Grill

Friends have recommend Adobo Grill to me before, so I was quite excited to try it out for myself. The food was good, but ambiance was a little too loud for my tastes. I came with a group of three, and felt like I was yelling across the square table we were sitting at. . . The moving guacamole station is cool. The guac preparer asked us our spice tolerance and proceeded to mash up the avocado and mix it up in front of us. I thought the portion was quite generous. We also asked for a salsa sampler, which was not what I was expecting. The flavors were good, especially the chipotle one, but each salsa was a watery puree that slid off our tortilla chips. I prefer a fresh salsa that's chunky. For my main entree, I ordered the vegetarian plate. There were many flavors on this dish, but my favorite by far was the sweet corn tamalon stuffed with figs. Zucchini stuffed with goat cheese was also very tasty. There were also a couple slices of fresh mango, which was super refreshing after the heavier fare. I ordered a Sol to wash everything down with, one of my favorite Mexican beers.. . Our server was friendly and came around at just the right times. After all was said and done, our total bill came to around $30 per person, including tax and tip. Not bad, considering we received a boat load of food.
