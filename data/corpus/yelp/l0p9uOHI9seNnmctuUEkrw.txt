I CAN'T BELIEVE I've never reviewed the Pick Me Up. Just can't believe it. I have been here so many times, I thought it would be one of my first reviews. Or for that matter, that I would have been one of the first to review it a couple years ago. . . The Pick Me Up is a place friendly to tight jean-wearing hipsters, nocturnal goths, and regular people like me who are thankful to have a decent place to come to at (almost) all hours. Their menu is good sized and varied so that if you're vegan, veggie or carnivorous, you will have plenty to choose from. I've eaten a lot of things on the menu--the stir crazy after all with tofu, the gnocci, garlicious breast sandwich, cheese fries, hummus plate, falafel sandwich, all kinds of pancakes, apple pie, you name it. All of those choices have been good ones.. . A lot of the servers that were there when I first started coming are now gone and are definitely missed, but there are still some veterans which make coming in a pleasant, familiar experience. Last night, when my friends came in, we had a server who was super flustered with the Saturday night busies (it's open 24 hours on the weekends, 2:30am is a popular time) and when I asked him if he was new, he said no, he'd been there about a year. So why are you freaked out by the normal Saturday night volume? Take a xanax or something, dude.. . Haha anyway, I will continue to be a patron of Pick Me Up as long as they stay open til 3am on the weekdays and 24 hours on the weekends, serve good food, and stay cool. Which I'm sure they'll do.
