Restaurant: Green Zebra
Category: Vegetarian
For a more contemporary vegetarian place you can go to Green Zebra. But some feel that it is more high priced, and the portions are smaller than some feel they should be for the price, but it VERY fresh. It is definitely a place where the food is an art form, but it is not for everyone. It is located on 1460 W. Chicago, and their phone # is (312) 243-7100. They are open for dinner Tuesday through Sunday, and I think we spent about $30-40 per person.
