Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
The ultimate Thai and Sushi combo place that's super cute and reasonably priced!. . There are some more expensive items on the menu, but when my boyfriend and I order from here, we can typically get an appetizer (loves me those free rangoon coupons!), a Thai dish (I'm a fan of the Masumussan curry, this isn't my favorite place for noodles), and at least one great Sushi roll (try the Sunset- delicious!) all for $20!  It's a great place to split or share food with others.. . The delivery is always prompt and hot... and the restaurant itself is adorable, it's BYOB, and the servers are beyond nice.  . . On Friday or Saturday nights, this place can get very crowded, so be sure to call for a reservation. This is a perfect spot for that Thursday night date...The crowd runs a little hip for my taste on the weekends and you'll see many a girl in the tight-pants-slutty-top-drinking-too-much-yellow-ta il-chardonnay look.
