Restaurant: Elliott Street Deli &amp; Pub
Category: Delis
I had a delightful lunch at the Elliott Street Pub on Saturday on a warm day with the doors open. My friend and I were there with Peter (an owner) and Bonnie (tending bar) for nearly two hours. This is the kind of small, intimate, and friendly bar that everyone dreams about. It's also secluded and completely hidden in the Castleberry district. It's hands down the smallest bar and deli I have ever been to - or would ever want to go to.. I ordered a Mad Italian sandwich with ciabatta bread, pressed like a panini - it was one of the most flavorful sandwiches I've had in a long time. My friend was swooning and moaning over her sandwich as she rapidly devoured it with unabashed pleasure. I would have asked her to compare the sandwich's appeal and sensory stimulation with sex but I was too embarrassed. It was clearly a home run in terms of sandwich nirvana.
