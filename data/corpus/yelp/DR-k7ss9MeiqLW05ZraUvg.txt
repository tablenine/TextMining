After visiting Thailand, Thai food never taste the same again. I tried dozens of Thai restaurants in LA and San Diego in search of the perfect papaya salad, but only to be disappointed over and over again. I usually avoid places that are cash only since I never carry cash but one day I was lucky enough to. That was probably the best day of my life. The papaya salad here was even better than some of the places in Thailand. It was pure perfection. Becareful though because they don't skimp out on the chilis. The lady asked what level of spiciness I wanted from 1-10. I of course opted for 10 and she asked me if I was sure and told me that there are no refunds. When my order arrived, I took a bite and nearly flew out of my chair. It was damn spicy but I still finished it because it was THAT GOOD. I've always had many of their other dishes including the tom tum soup, curries, morning glory. Everything was good and tasted just like Thailand. I would recommend getting the morning glory as well. So good, it doens't even matter if you don't like eating your veggies, you'll like this dish because its THAT GOOD. check it out but don't forget your cash Â because you will need it. I also brought my Asian parents here and they loved it too, they thought it was very authenic. By the way, dishes here are super cheap.
