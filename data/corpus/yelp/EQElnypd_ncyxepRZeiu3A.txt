Awsome take on Korean food.. . AS you can see on this review board,  It is the hottest thing on L.A yelp scene.  If you don't go here, after reading all this review, then you are not a true yelper.  I think you are a communist  ( carried away..). . I'll update my review after I try everything on the menu ( give me a month)  but every thing so good here..  just try things alphabetically.. . Btw.... about the fatty pork belly.... you know that Bacon is made with pork belly right??  it is meant to have that layers of marbling to give that unique "i have to go to gym tomorrow, but for now,  I'm here to eat" flavor.   .  Don't expect to get a Lean prok belly,  It's like asking for fat brisket... when it comes to pork belly,   the better quality pork belly have better marbling.  ( i used to work in kbbq.  I tried all the meats and all diffrent grade possible. ) .   . Koreans call Pork belly  'Sam Gyup Sal."  It means means "three layered meat" because of it's distingtive layering.  . . go chow down some yum yum dishes and go to a yoga class, boxing class, surfing, dance studio tomorrow!  that's how we do it L.A!
