This is the place for serious sushi eaters.  Don't expect your sauce-glazed-tempura-baked-creamy-rolls on the menu here.  Instead enjoy the Sushi-Sashimi dinner plate, that's the best bargain.  Otherwise, ordering individual sushi will add up real quick.. . And of course, with any great popular restaurant, expect to WAIT.
