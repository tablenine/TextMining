Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The rave reviews for Din Tai Fung are well deserved and if it wasn't for the distance I'd be a regular here.  Of course, the famous pork dumplings were perfect and so fun to eat. (Careful: the soup inside the dumplings can be very hot.)  The appetizer called "appetizer" :) had shredded black mushrooms, bean sprouts and other ingredients making it SO delicious!  Never had anything quite like it.. . All in all, I give this special place an A+!
