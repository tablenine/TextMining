I don't get to brunch it up very often, mostly because I'm a hopeless vampire, the bf is very anti-breakfast food, and Asian food just tastes so much better than everything else. Dim sum is usually my meal of choice should I decide to wake up earlier than 12 noon on a weekend, but sometimes a good old omelette or pile of flapjacks could be a delectable treat. Once in a blue moon.. . Kristen G., aka brunch queen and I decided to hit up Square One a few weeks ago. She'd gone a few times and enjoyed it; I'd been wanting to try it out for awhile anyway. We went at a decent hour and managed to avoid the breakfast rush. I liked the feel of the place. It was airy and minimalist without being overly pretentious. We were not subjected to a lengthy wait-- managed to finish our cigarettes, at least, before we were shown to our table.. . Everything on the menu looked delicious. Breakfast served all day, as well as an extensive lunch menu with hot/cold sandwiches, salads, blah blah. Perusual cute brunch-y cafe selection. Kristen ordered some kind of egg-y sandwich thing with potatoes, while I opted for a veggie omelette with salad and a side of pork sausage. We both had coffee, and it was outstanding. No free refill for iced coffee though.. . Overall it was a very nice experience and the food was above average.
