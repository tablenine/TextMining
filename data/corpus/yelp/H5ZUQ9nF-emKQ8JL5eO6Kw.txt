I've only ever been here late at night, and it's kind of an odd experience (random black and white movies projected on the back wall, some strange [still fun] music) but after a drink or two I am really feelin it. The atmosphere can be kind of hipster-ish, so if you're really not into that.. it's not recommended. But if you're cool, you'll probably enjoy it :)
