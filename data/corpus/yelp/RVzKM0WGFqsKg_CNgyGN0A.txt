Roasters is a very good place to go to get some "down home cooking" and the times I have been there hasn't been a wait.  I usually end up with either the chicken fried steak or the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes.  The portions will vary.  Sometimes the chicken is large, other times its a little bigger than a chicken finger.  The wait staff there are always friendly.  If you go, be sure to try the cornbread.  They have the best that I have ever tasted!!!  Their chicken and rice soup is also very good.  I gave it 4 stars since their portions vary from meal to meal
