amazing how lively and packed with customers this landmark can be at 3:30am !!!. . gotta love the waitresses who tell you what you want to order and what you don't want to order ---- "you don't go to a deli and order that !!!" . . "oh, you don't ?" i reply, "OK sorry, i meant to order the pastrami on rye, and some matza ball soup too.". . sightings of KROQ's Rodney Bingenheimer hanging out there was always classic LA....
