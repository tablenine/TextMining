This place is fantastic! But don't go if you're not ordering the pancakes or the french toast! That's like going to a steak house and ordering fish, seriously. The pancakes are out of this world. Scotch on the rocks is my absolute favorite!. . Like everyone else says the portions are HUGE! Only order a single pancake, I'm telling you. I ordered a full stack once and I was eating it for an entire week. If you live in LA.. you have to try this place. Keep in mind their weird hours though. They're only open until 4:00!
