Let's talk quantity. Two of us each ordered a half-sandwich, mine with salad and his with soup. When we had gorged there was still so much meat left that I had it packed to take home where, out of curiosity,  I weighed it on my kitchen scale and I had half a pound of brisket. That was the leftovers from two half-sandwiches.  The meat was so tender we could have eaten it with a dessert spoon.. . And, this must be reported, a brisket sandwich comes with a pot of hot beef jus gravy to dunk every bite in. For that alone I would go back.
