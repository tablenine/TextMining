I've come back twice since my last review and i gotta say, i still love it just as much, if not more, than i did the first time. . The only thing that i don't like (hence the -1 star) is that they've been an hour+ late 2 times out of the 3 times i've been there. We were in line last night at 9:45 for their scheduled arrival at 10:30. But they didn't get there until 11:30, so we didn't get to order til almost 1. :/ Kind of annoying. Both of my friends actually passed out while we were waiting in line because they was so tired. (that, and they had one too many 40's.) hahaha. It was pretty funny. [see the picture. . http://www.yelp.com/bi....  ]. They ran out of lime wedges once so they were serving the tacos with orange wedges, haha. It was weird and definitely not as amazing, but still good. But lime is the way to go.. My best friend is obsesssssed with their sliders. She has dreams about them and it's basically all she ever wants to eat for the rest of her life, haha. I think my favorites are still the tacos, smothered in lime. *Tip: Since they serve the tacos in 2 tortillas each, i take one off because it can be overpowering sometimes. It might be a little messier, but it's 10x more delicious and worth it. I suggest it.. I had their chicken burrito the other day and it was abbbbsolutely delishhh. It actually might be tied with the deliciousness of the tacos, i haven't decided.. The service is still pretty quick and all the guys on the truck are super friendly. And i will still be waiting in line every time they're in my neighborhood. I can't resist.
