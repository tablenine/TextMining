Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's Porto's Porto's! Â When I first discovered this POTATO BALL HAVEN I frequented the establishment daily. I ran miles to taste the heavenly Ropa Vieja Sandwitch, or the VEGETARIAN sandwich uug hemm which I now eat, pastries and smoothies they have it all! Don't worry you gain it all back again inside. This place is a MUST GO if you are in the Burbank area! . One tip...if you are taking your sandwich to go you will not get the AMAZING plantain chips with the order. Dine in the restaurant and your sandwich comes with the chips! Just a TIPO!!!!
