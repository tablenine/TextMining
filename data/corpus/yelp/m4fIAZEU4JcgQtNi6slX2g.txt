Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
We love this pizza.  Of course, we hate the wait, the indifferent servers, the small spaces between tables, the "rogues gallery" of has-beens and never-weres that line the waiting area, the fact that nothing but the pizza is any good at all.   But we love the pizza!  Stick with the medium or smaller -- double up on mediums if you are a group.  The larger ones will get soggy in the middle two-thirds too fast.  The smaller medium thin crust will stay fresh and crisp much longer.  Best topping:  extra garlic, sausage and mushrooms .  This kind of pizza, unlike deep dish "pastry" type crusts, will not reheat well, but I have it eaten it cold the next morning and loved every bite.
