Let me make my review more clear, 4 star food, 1.5 star service.  I went there with a friend for brunch.  The food was excellent and we both were full for under $20 (before tip).  I can't believe how popular this place is though with the terrible service we had.  . . We asked our waiter for cream for our coffee, he then eventually returns 10 minutes later after taking a table's order that had come in after us, then taking our order.  It took almost 30 minutes for us to get our food, and they forgot to bring me my side order of fruit.  . . The omelette I ordered was amazing, it had bacon, tomatoes, and two kinds of cheese.  My friend's egg sandwich was also good.  The hashbrowns there have some kind of sweet onions in them and were also outstanding.. . It then took me three attempts to get our bill which took another 25 minutes and the side order was still on the check adding another 10 mintues to get that removed.  . . Because the food was so good and based on other people's reviews I think I'll go back.  I guess I was unlucky with the service.
