Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
MANNNA MANNA MANNNA........ Where do I begin? You're like an Ex-girlfriend I can't seem to forget. I've experienced you and I'm tryin' to forget you.... Though, now you've been around the block so much that everyone has an opinion about their experience with you so I guess I have to drop my 2 cents......... Whatever you might hear or read about this place you might get mixed reviews... But let me tell you the real deal about this establishment............ . 1. Location: K-Town (Olympic/Western ish)... It's around that area. . . 2. Price: Typical Korean BBQ all you can eat....... . 3. Venue: This is one of the main things I hate about this place. It isn't even a motherfuckin' restaurant. It's like a cafeteria...... you know... Kinda like when you're in elementary school and you have to bump elbows with the kid next to you who is puttin string cheese up his nose? No joke..... It's like an outdoor patio with a tarp over it.. . 4. People: The biggest thing you'll notice about this place is all the motherfuckin' foreigners and white people here..... *Rule of thumb*. The more Asians that go to a place means the more legit. However, if I ever wanted to know where all the white people were in K-Town. I would come here.... Seriously, every single time I'm here I'm always on one of the only groups of Asians in this place.......... It's like the Korean version of Ding Tai Fung. . . 5. Meat: It's your typical Korean BBQ shit. All you can eat meat...... The chicken isn't bad. IT's not bad....... . *Side dishes...... Not bad. . . 6. The Grills: These are super super crucial........ It' sooooo smoky. In the short matter of 50 mins you can be diagnosed with Black Lung.... No joke. . . *If you're fortunate to go cause it's your friends birthday. You're in for a real treat. I went for my home girl's going away party the last time and what's funny is that the waiter will come up behind you with a bottle of champagne and pretend as if he is gonna pour it all over you....... however, what he does is he essentially GOLDEN SHOWERS YOUR ASS with that champagne. he COMPLETELY SHAKES IT LIKE A SALT SHAKER and POURS IT ALL OVER THAT POOR INDIVIDUAL.............. Bring a change of clothes......... . . *If it's your first time eatin' in an ALL YOU CAN EAT KOREAN BBQ RESTAURANT (I HATE PEOPLE WHO ABBREVIATE. Don't be lazy yo..... It's not AYCE. It's ALL YOU CAN EAT MOTHERFUCKAS!!!!!! :) . . Learn some Korean from a non-Korean:. . "Hey you" = YOOOOOO GI YOOOO.......... . "Water" = MUUUURRRRR. . "Rice" = BAP. . "Older Korean waitress" = EMOOOOOOOOOOOO. . "BULGOGI" = PUUU GOGI......... In Korean, the B's sound like P's. Like BUSAN is pronounced "PUUUUSAN". . ****Be warned. If you're gonna say this shit and you look Asian they will assume you're Korean. If you can't speak Korean and can't reply back to what they are saying.... Don't say it. I get dirty looks all the time from Koreans who think I'm Korean but are disappointed when they find out I'm only Chinese.
