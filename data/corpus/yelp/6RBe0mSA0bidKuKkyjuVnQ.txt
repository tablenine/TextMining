Customizable has never been so cool! Beef burger? Maybe turkey? 1/3 lb up to 2/3 lb. Bun choices are great too: who doesn't love an English muffin? Then, there's the cheeses. Like 10 different types. Toppings are awesome, you kinda want to choose all 30 and taste them all. And the sauces too. . . The burger of the month now featured was a salmon burger with red curry sauce.. . My first visit, I went bunless, served atop field greens. Wow. I think this actually brought out the quality of the burger.. . Beer and wine selection is surprisingly good. . . The sweet potato fries were amazing... crispy little pieces, sliced thin, served with a (honey mustard?) aioli for dipping and sprinkled with sea salt.
