Category: Southern
good gravy, miss lady. . i haven't been here in a long time but only because i choose to live an extra year w/out life support.  last i've been, i remember getting the scoe's #2 - 1/4 Chix smothered with gravy &amp; onions, 2 Waffles, our own mix.  but once when i used to be a spring chicken (pun intended, *badumbump*) and didn't have a care in the world, i even went for the herb's special #4 - 1/2 Chix smothered with gravy &amp; onions, 2 waffles, our own mix. i had friends who tried the cornbread, and biscuits which are supposed to be good as well.  but every time i go i am unable to deter myself for the restaurant's namesake - the chicken and waffles. they're my favorite waffles in the universe. . . i have to say one thing though.  i've been to the ones on pico, gower, and lake and the food quality is all different.  actually, the waffles have been good at all locations, it's just the chicken.  either:. . lake - chicken is too dry. pico - it's almost dangerously undercooked, and my sis has reportedly gotten food poisoning at this one. . but gower (the original) - has been the most consistent.  although the last time i was there i felt severely nauseous the next day..............but that's what i get for going in the middle of the night, ordering fried chicken smothered in gravy that's been marinating all day in a pot that g0d knows who, or how many, have been stirring and breathing on.... . despite all the too-close-to-puking, it's still all worth it
