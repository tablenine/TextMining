I wish I could rave about this place but alas it just isn't amazing.  I want it to be so bad but the dishes are hit and miss I'm afraid.  Still...some of them are quite tasty if you like veggie meats.  The beef with broccoli and the orange flavored chicken are good...but beware of the wanton soup unless you like the taste of drinking straight soy sauce.  On average I tend to like the fried mock chicken dishes...they are a safe choice.  I have heard good things about the alternative type dishes like the squash....but upon tasting it I think it is just okay.  However I admit that the stuffed zucchini appetizer is amazing.  I know that doesn't sound like it would be ....but go ahead and try it and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  All and all this place is decent if you get lucky and order the right thing....beats Harmony at least.  Plus there are so many choices on the menu that I'm sure some things are really great.
