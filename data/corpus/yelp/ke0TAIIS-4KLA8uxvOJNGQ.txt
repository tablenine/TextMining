YUMMY - their fries in white truffle oil... Y.U.M! at first you might not get used to the taste, but oh am i dreaming about it the next day!! gonna try their different kinda sauces too, don't do ketchup please, you get that everywhere else!. . honestly, no matter what kind of meat it is for make the sausage, once you top with the chili pepper/onions, you can't really tell at all! i tried rattlesnake and rabbit, w/ spicy peppers, it taste no different than the austin blues! oh well, i'll try other kinds next time and see.... . . loved their selection of beers and was impressed by their decor... they even have live DJ to play music in the dim dining area! the atmosphere makes you wonder if you are actually at a club!. . liked this place and will definitely go back again.... 4 people we ended up spending like 100 bucks - and couple of them were still hungry!
