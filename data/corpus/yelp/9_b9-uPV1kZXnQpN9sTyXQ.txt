I'm with Bora K...bibimbap normally represents the cold leftover meal of last resort growing up in a Korean household.   Nothing to get very excited about.  Ummah... no chan-bap (cold rice) !!. . Enter Chego.  Rice bowls with fusion flavors from Chef Roy, fried egg, fresh ingredients, and high quality meats.  Ethnic drinks (my two faves being Bon Bon and Jarritos Mandarina both served here..are you KIDDING ME?) and original tasting desserts.  Friendly and attentive staff.  A lot of thought has been put into this place each step of the way.. . I sampled the pork belly kimchi rice, steak sandwich, gooey fries, asparagus, corn elote thingy, and a couple desserts (strawberry pistachio and chocolate).  All had great taste, a bit of kick, and while the pork was a bit heavy, the tofu, kimchi, and edamame evened out the dish.  There's plenty of other things I'm gonna try here in the near future.  Too many to name.   Chego = The Best
