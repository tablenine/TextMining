Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
DELISH! My girlfriend and friends went to Pinks while we were visiting in L.A. This place is crazy!!! The line wasn't too bad. We waited about 15 minutes in line to order. I have heard stories that you can wait over an hour in line and yes, people do wait! The line can wrap around the corner. That's how popular and good this Hot Dog Stand is. Many celebrities have eating here if that convinces you to try it. I actually ran into my friend that was from Sacramento as well, trying the pinks experience. . . The food is DELISH! There was so much to chose from. I went with the famous planet hollywood dog! It's top with mushrooms, onions, jalapenos, nacho cheese , and topped with bacon. In addition, I added sourkrout. I also ordered a side of fries with cheese for dipping. To wash it all down a strawberry soda. This place is so good but something you can not eat everyday.. . They have a small eating area and parking lot as well.The menu has a variety of crazy combos. It is a must try at least once while in L.A.
