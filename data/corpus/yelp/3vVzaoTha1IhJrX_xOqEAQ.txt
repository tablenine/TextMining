Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
i just ate here today for lunch for the first time in a very looooong time.. . and its just as remarkable as i had remembered it.. . i ordered the #1 Scoe's that came with 2 pieces of chicken (with the option of white or dark meat), 2 Waffles with butter and syrup, and a side of mac n cheese.  mmmmmmmmm! delish.  . . the skin on the chicken is why i personally love roscoes and the fact that you can eat chicken with yer waffles and vice versa.. . the prices are a little expensive but i didnt care cuz i didnt pay!  :). . oh, and it made me really stuffed the WHOLE DAY!  that hardlly ever happens!
