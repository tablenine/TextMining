Restaurant: Wakamono
Category: Sushi Bars
Unlike most restaurants, I started out pretty hot on Wakamono but the food gets worse and worse every time I eat there.  The rice seems to get more and more coarse and gummy and the fish seems to be decreasing in quality.  Maybe it's just because I've started eating at Coast &amp; South Coast and this place just seems lame in comparison.
