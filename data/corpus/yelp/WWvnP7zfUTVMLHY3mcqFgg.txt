I ate here for the first time with my sister and girlfriend a few weeks ago. My sister lives a few blocks away and we met her there for Sunday brunch. When we first arrived I thought it was somewhat unusual that patrons have to immediately stand and wait in a long line to place their order instead of being able to sit at a table and have a server take your order. This was the only downside to the whole experience there. . . OK, the bakery choices are awseome! The cakes and pastries looked and smelled divine!! They have a menu with a lot of variety. I ordered the brioche french toast and my girlfriend ordered an omelette and my sister ordered a sliced tomato and poached eggs with toast. Of course, we all ordered Mimosa's!! I also had a cafe mocha-they have a full menu of coffees.. . I can't say enough about how delicious the food tasted! The portions were big and we all had more than enough to share. One of the best places in LA to have breakfast/brunch without question. I would have given it five stars if I could have just sat down and started on my mimosas right away instead of having to wait in line.
