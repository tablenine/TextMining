We eat here often.  The portions are huge, so between two people we get an appetizer and share an entree and its still too much food.  The food is also very inexpensive.  The Spicy Korean Dumplings and Basil Chow Fun are my favorites.  The staff does a  good job and the place is clean.  It is also very big, with lots of seating, unlike the ChinaTown location.  I agree that the chairs are very uncomfortable and barely fit your butt...and thats coming from a size 1 person.  I recommend the Lychee Berry Tapioca Freeze.
