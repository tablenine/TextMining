Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I LOVE LOVE LOVE the creamed corn! It's simply amazing! I'm a corn lover, so what do you expect? I also like sweet flavors so put the two together and you have perfection! I got the Lawry's cut which was huge! It was bigger than my face lol.. Believe it or not, I almost ate the whole thing. I was so stuffed! I don't think I will be returning to Lawry's for a while because I can only eat so much prime rib. The service was on point and we had a funny and delightful server. For dessert, my friends and I had a few desserts but my favorite was the hot fudge sundae made table side. OMG...the fudge was soo good! It's the best I've ever had! I could eat the fudge all day!
