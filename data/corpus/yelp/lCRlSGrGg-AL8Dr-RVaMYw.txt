Usually I would avoid spots like this.... . but when you have out-of-town guests in tow whose tastes differ from your own, and you need to take a load off somewhere ... you might end up in a place like this.. . Four stars because I really love all their different beers.. The appetizers are real good.. The service has always been decent.. . And I was there for a private function earlier this month and I was wow'ed by the spread. All the finger foods were delish.. . So, yeah, as much as I hate to admit it - I like this place.
