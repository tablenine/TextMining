Call me prejudiced ("Prejudiced!") but I never expected to find a restaurant of this caliber in Atlanta. . . I went with 6 people and every one of us enjoyed our meals thoroughly. At least 3 of us are die-hard foodies who have eaten at restaurants all over the world and this food ranked with the best of them.  You might not find any new and interesting combinations but the dishes are well executed and bursting with flavor.  The off-menu special of steamed sea bass with ginger on a bed of bok choy exploded with ginger, and the fish was tender and fall-off-the-bone fresh.  The New Zealand lamb chops were cooked to perfection with subtle seasoning that did not overpower the taste of the lamb itself.   Other entrees included the seafood paella and the pad thai, both of which were very good.   Appetizers included calamari, dumplings and veggie spring rolls, all of which disappeared rapidly from the plates.  . . Other major pluses:. . ** Beautiful presentation.  Food on the plates is well presented and the place itself looks like it's dressed for a night on the town.  Very elegant and well designed.  . . ** Great and friendly service. . ** Complimentary valet parking!  Coming from L.A., this is a revelation. . . ** Good wine list with reasonable bottle prices.
