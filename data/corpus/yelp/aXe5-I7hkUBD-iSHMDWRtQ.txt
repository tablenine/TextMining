Really enjoyed Hub 51.. . Before I went I was obsessed with getting the beef jerky with homemade cheese sauce, and it did not disappoint.  . . We had 2 orders of Mac &amp; Cheese... it was delicious and I know this might sound girly, but I just loved the cute little cauldrons that the dish came in.. . Ahi Tuna Poke was SO good, I just would have like to have had maybe one more rice cracker to go with it.  Super fresh and perfect amount of flavor.. . I basically made a meal out of the appetizers b/c there were so many that I liked.  I have to go back and try more food.. . It was a packed Friday night but I did not feel rushed at all.. . I did feel like our waiter was a touch on the rude side, kind of like we were bother him when we asked for things, but maybe he was just really busy.. . Definitely a see and be seen kind of place, but I like that now and then.
