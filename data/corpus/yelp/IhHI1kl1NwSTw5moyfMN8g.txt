Oooh, Sura, I want to give you one more star since you are tasty, relatively cheap, byob and within walking distance from my home, BUT ... you are trying too hard!. . You have a lovely white decor and then rusted over table/chair lugs - yuck.  You have cool art available for my viewing, but then insist on showing pretentious video along with it.  Your servers start out friendly but then get progressivly more annoying, alternating between pushy and invisible.. . But I love your calamari and I will come back.
