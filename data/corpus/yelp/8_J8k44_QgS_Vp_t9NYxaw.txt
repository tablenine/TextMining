Restaurant: Bone Garden Cantina
Category: Mexican
I was excited to eat at Bone Garden after seeing an advertisement for it at one of the Vortex locations ... quickly found out that the two share ownership and couldn't wait to try a Mexican variant.. . Having been there for dinner twice, gotta say, the food's great.  Ordering à la carte is one of the best ways to go with this type of food ... I can order as many tamales as I want and with everything so cheap, I can try different items each time I come.. . The wait staff was attentive and I was very happy with the experience ... of course the attentiveness could've been that I was one of two people in the place and the waiters outnumbered us 3 to 1. :). . The drinks pack a punch ... had a margarita and my wife had their Punch ... wow.  Good stuff.. . Finally, try their chorizo -- it's wonderful.  I got some queso and chorizo and as cheap as everything is, the chorizo was the best stuff on the menu.
