Restaurant: Loca Luna
Category: Tapas Bars
I have had some really great experiences at Loca Luna and some really horrible ones.  I guess that means I would have to say that Loca Luna has become very inconsistent.. . Here's the good: It is a fun and lively place which handles groups very well.  The music and dancing are great.  The food can sometimes be good.  They have bottomless sangria on Sundays for $10.. . Here's the bad: I almost always encounter attitude from the hostess even when I am arriving promptly for a reservation.  And, even when I arrive promptly for my reservation, I usually have to wait 20 minutes or so (and when it is crowded, there is not a really great place to wait).  The food is wildly inconsistent.  Sometimes it has been fresh and hot and flavorful, other times it has been overcooked, a bit foul-tasting, and just "off".  The last time I was there, I could not eat the food - it was that bad.. . I am actually very sad to say that Loca Luna is not as good as it used to be - I really used to love it.  For a bar/club/entertainment outing, I do agree that it is still pretty fun.  The sangria is awfully good.  But, the food is just not very good.
