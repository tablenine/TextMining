waiting more than 30 minutes for tacos is really dumb.... i never had to wait more than 10/15 min... because i try to find times/locations to go when aren't going to be ridiculous... or i just don't stop for it when i see a long line. Â silly people... . anyway, DELICIOUS short rib tacos. i've tried like 4 korean bbq taco trucks and this one is my favorite for sure.. . not a fan of the kimchi quesedilla but then again not really a fan of kimchi or quesedillas
