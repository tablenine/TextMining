Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
The Apple Pan is like the definition of a solid solid four stars, going onto the fifth one.  I've been frequenting this place for over a decade now and not one thing has changed at all.  In fact, I suspect nothing's changed for the last five decades.  Burgers always the same.  Your soda consumed from a papery paper cone, resting in a metal cone-holder.  Your fries, delicious as ever.  Seating obviously is difficult, as there's only limited counter seating.  Still, I've been here with up to four people and we always find seats together in up to 20 minutes, usually much sooner.. . I hesitate to note that I've never had a slice of their apple pie.  Well, let's pray the next time I go, I don't feel like such a fattie after my meal and can order a slice, if only to update my review.
