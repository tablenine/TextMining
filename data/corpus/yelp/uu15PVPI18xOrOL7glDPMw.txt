Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
Despite its name, the real key here is its huge, delicious salads.  The Great American is my personal favorite, and their poppy seed and creamy garlic dressings are incredibly good (mixing them is even better).  Start with the Mediterranean bread (white is better than wheat) and then split a salad (small feeds at least two, large at least four).  If you're there with a bunch of people, then go for the pizza or a grinder.  Both are good, but not what you'll remember.  Cash only.
