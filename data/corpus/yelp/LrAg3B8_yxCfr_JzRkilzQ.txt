Is it just me or does this place smell like a petting zoo?. . I have my gripes about Baoguette.  Smell aside, they're very stingy.  Not only is there a $10 minimum on credit card charges, but they recently tried to charge me an extra $5 for delivery because I missed their "new" 10 block delivery radius by one block.  That's right, a $5 block. This was all after I'd placed and paid for my order on Seamlessweb, who made no mention of this whatsoever.. . That aside, the sandwiches do happen to be pretty good.  I know that everyone loves the Banh Mi, but I'm a bigger fan of the catfish and  BBQ chicken sandwiches.  I wish they were a little bigger, but they're good.. . Bad service and bad policies bring this down from a 4 to a 2 1/2.  Since they have no problem being stingy with me, I'll be stingy too.  Their 2 1/2 becomes a 2.  They'll get it.
