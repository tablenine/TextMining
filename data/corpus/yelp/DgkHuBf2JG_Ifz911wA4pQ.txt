Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
i really like taco bell. I really love del taco. In fact, del taco is way superior to taco bell because they use thinner shredded cheese. (but taco bell has the better chicken quesadilla) . . Tito's is like half way between a fake taco and an 'real' taco. It's like they tried to make the taco bell taco authentic by subbing in a real fried tortilla and 'real' shredded beef. It's like replicating a Guess bag. Ew and why. . . Frying a tortilla makes it unnaturally hard and I personally enjoy Taco Bell's flavorfull ground beef and the nice thin taco hardshell. Â . . Not to mention Tito's hard shells makes your jaws work. No bueno.
