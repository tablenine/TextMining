Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Flo's is great for brunch and dinner, never tried lunch.  First of all, the decor is vibrant and fun.  The food is solid and the atmosphere low key and real.  It's a down home, neighborhood joint.  If you come at their busiest time and have to wait, you can grab a mug of coffee and hang outside.  . . For breakfast, I like chorizo chilaquiles and Flo eggs.  Everyone loves the chocolate chip banana pancakes.  If I go with a group, we order stack to share.. . For dinner, I just had their special: grilled tuna tacos.  Three fish tacos on corn tortillas with avocado and creamy sauce, cabbage slaw on the side.  My friend had spinach mushroom enchilada.  We both had mojitos and guacamole to start.  . . The owner was behind the counter making drinks, chatting with regulars eating at the bar.  This reminds me of the Hilary's in Wicker Park back then.
