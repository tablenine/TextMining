Any hot dog for me has to meet the Top Dog test -- is it better than that stand in Berkeley? Wurstkuche did not, but it's the next best thing to it in this side of California. The Hot Link, which is what I always get at Top Dog, was a lot bigger and pricier than at TD, and most importantly, not half as juicy on the inside, crunchy on the outside and spicy in the same way. The sauerkraut -- a very important component of a dog for me -- was also good but for a dog, I thought it was overpriced. I guess we're paying for the decor and ambiance, which I admittedly liked. The converted loft-like space was airy and the communal seating added a nice touch, not to mention the extensive beer selection that I've yet to sample. I'll probably return to try the beers and another dog but I can't say it's my favorite dog place. The fries weren't great either. And I'm outraged it charges for relishes. . .
