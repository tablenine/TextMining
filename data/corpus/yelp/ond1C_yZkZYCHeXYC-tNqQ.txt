Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
3stars food. 4.5 stars ambiance. local hot spot that's a bit hidden. i went here for valentine's cuz i saw this restaurant in the movie Monster in Law. Â Somehow I think lots of actors and hollywood ppl go here since table next to us were producers and other the other was dougi howser and his date lol.. They have pretty average food though, but romantic since it's filled with candles
