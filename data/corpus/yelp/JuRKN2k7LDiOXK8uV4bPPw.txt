Tainted Meat? = Tainted Love. . . Sadly,I have to now agree with a few of the negative reviews here: . I have now gotten REALLY REALLY sick TWICE after eating here. . . I've been about 5 times total, the best sausage experience ever. I love this place, the ambiance, the food, the beer. . . BUT I GOTTA SAY, I got really really SICK the last two times here- and I'm talking out BOTH ends! Not so fun. . . I've had food poisening only once before from bad meat at another place, and that's what it was like. . . Maybe my stomach isn't used to exotic meats like duck and rattlesnake. Or maybe there's more to it- which would explain why several people say they've gotten sick. . . I feel horrid writing this review because I want to see them do well. . . BUT, the management could save themselves a few more negetive yelps by being EXTRA careful about meat preservation, food prep and storage  from here on out, especially in light of some recent reviews. . . Don't be the Worst Kutch in town!!!! I want to come back. Tell me your meat ain't taited!!!
