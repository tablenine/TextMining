Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's is one of my favorite discoveries in L.A. and I am always excited to introduce people to this wonderful bakery. Everything that I've had here is great! The prices are unbeatable and the service is always fast, even when the line is out the door at the Burbank location. . . Here are a few things that I always get and would recommend to everyone. - Potato Balls. - Spinach and Feta danish. - Cheese Rolls . - Parisian chocolate cake . - Mango Mousse. - Feta Sandwich. - Refugiado . . Bring lots of people so you can order a lot and try a little bit of everything!
