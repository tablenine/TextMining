Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
this place was a nightmare...... . we had to wear these ridiculous bibs and use our bare hands to eat everything! then we had to schlop up our food from parchment paper, and awful plastic bags!!!. . HORRIBLE!!! . .  i just felt disgusted.. . an the seafood NOT FRESH AT ALL!!  it was not even that cheap. go down the street to some chinese restaurant and u will receive table cloths ,service + FRESH live seafood for a reasonably affordable price. considering the dead seafood served here, this place is not cheap by any means.. this is the kind of seafare you would buy at a Vallereta during their half price frozen seafood from 6 months ago! yum! . .  We ordered medium, then mild then hot, and they all tasted the same.... i believe the best thing was the fish and chips...WHICH IS THE ONLY thing i would ever consider eating again here. actually...i would just go there and order it to go.. it's not oily at all and has a nice cornmeal covering... however... you don't really go to a place that touts the name "boiling CRAB" to eat french fries and fish fillets. . . This place reminded me of the 'Rusty Barnacle' from Sponge bob but this time it's not hilarious. . . .... i have no idea why people like this place..  i guess it's the novelty of looking like a slob/idiot/hick and the wonderful people watching ... oh! old ladies sucking the crap out of their fingers! young and old alike eating right off the table! ( which is never scrubbed in between costumers) YUCK...  oh my! genius?? or sheer insanity? . . * feels nauseous  * GAG
