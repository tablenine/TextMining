Ok, so it's basically a glorified Greek diner - the food is solid, the service is great, and the prices are reasonable.  What I love about this place is the clubby atmosphere - dark wood paneling, private booths etc.   This place has been here since long before I was born, and it still thrives.  It's the Chicago I remember from childhood in the 70's, with one very positive exception: we had a black waitress, which is not something you would have encountered in a downtown restaurant back in the day -- the good paying waiter jobs were strictly "whites only".  Enny-way, like I said, the food is solid -- although my girlfriend said the coffee was awful. That didn't bother her, though, because they didn't charge us for it.
