I wish they had one of these places in San Francisco. I love variety and at Furaibo, you can try lots of things before you get full. Be careful though because the dishes are either good or blah.... . GET:. - Cheese &amp; Fish Cake: yummy! and light. can't really taste the cheese. - Yakitori: good flavor, tender meat. - Hamachi Collarbone: goooood...soft tender meat, lightly fried on outside. - Chicken Hearts: pretty good. - Ginger Pork with Onions: too much soy sauce but okay. - Spicy Shirmp: tiny shrimps, okay sauce, not spicy. . PASS:. - Chicken Wings: nothing special even though it's their signature dish, but I liked the white pepper. - Chicken Skin: literally tastes just like skin, they need to marinate more. - Mushroom Salad: okay, bland. - Soft Shell Crab: pass, too breaded. . Service was a little spotty, but they try. Busy place with a rustic feel, loud environment so it's hard to talk.
