I love how this place has outdoor seating, eating great soupy food on a warm sunday morning (after a night of partying) is the best ever!  It was my first time here, I ordered miso 4.  I will definately try 2 next time.  I noticed the Special 1 and 2, then suddenly remembered this place was featured on Man vs. Food on the food network.  That was pretty cool.. . I enjoyed a great day of ramen with friends.  I can't ask much more than that.  Definately a good deal.
