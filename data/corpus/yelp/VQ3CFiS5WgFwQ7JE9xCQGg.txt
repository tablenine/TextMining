Restaurant: Stone Soup Kitchen
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
After picking up the lovely Farrah A at the airport, I knew we needed a good brunch spot without the typical crazy wait time. Yelp led us to Stone Soup, a place I had been itching to try.. . Parking was a relative breeze, with a decent amount of street parking in addition to a small lot. We were okay sitting on the patio despite the heat (Farrah is a Houstonian after all!) so we had our pick of tables. I scanned the menu and decided on something that shocked myself: oatmeal. Never before had I ordered oatmeal at a restaurant: it's a meal I usually reserve for camping trips or outings of that ilk (since, you know, I do those kind of things all the time). I don't know why I ordered the oatmeal, but I was very pleased. I will definitely be adding dried cranberries the next time I have oatmeal... say, in about 3 years or so. . . Service was pleasant and the entirety of brunch was simple and easy. I'd definitely return for a quick bite any day of the week, but I feel Stone Soup really shines when compared to the high-stress, long wait, overly executed Sunday morning experiences at its brunch brethren around town.
