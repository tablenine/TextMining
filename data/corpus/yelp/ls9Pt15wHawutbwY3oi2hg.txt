Ooey Gooey cookies are the BEST!!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely the best thing on the menu!. . I wasn't too fond of the ice cream sandwiches. The "cookie" is more like a wafer.. . I love the strawberry shortcake ice cream bars that are sold in the ice cream trucks and stores, so I thought a homemade one would be even better! Not at all...I would rather eat the one from the ice cream trucks. . . Tried the mini red velvet cupcake. Disappointing. It was dry with no flavor. . . Actually ate something off the food menu. Some kind of chicken panini that was served with a side of mixed green salad. The greens were mixed with a little bit of balsamic vinegar. It was ok, but not too appetizing. Probably won't eat the food here again.
