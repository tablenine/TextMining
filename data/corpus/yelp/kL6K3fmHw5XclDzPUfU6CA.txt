Restaurant: Toast Bakery Cafe
Category: American (New)
My biggest gripe with Toast is that they have no Alcohol, oh yeah and the bathrooms are dirty and smell. Go to a restaurant and look at the parking lot or the restroom and you'll have some indication of how they feel about their establishment.  . . A lazy Sunday afternoon spent tooling around LA leads us to Toast.   The setting is nice inside and out. The outdoor umbrella lunches could only be enhanced with some fermented grape juice or maybe barley and hops or even copious amount of mint in a refreshing Mojito.  The food was LA chic but my Caprese sandwich was just aight.  I like the baguette sandwich but it lacked flavor, i think I could have made a better one at home. . . Maybe I am revealing too much about myself but I wont go out of my way for Toast especially with such a shallow drink selection.
