Let me preface this by saying, I am my father's daughter. I am a total daddy's girl. I can barely get through a day without e-mailing, calling, or sending a carrier pidgeon his way.. . And he LOVES this place.. . Apparently, darling Baba has been going here for 25 years, and has brought me in since I was a wee one to enjoy the magic.. . And now, on to the good stuff.. . So first off, the lines are insane, they're always insane, but they don't move too slugishly, so don't trip. . . Second off, there's sawdust or something on the floor to prevent slipping. I love it.. . Third off, the food.. . (It's last on the list because you know I like to make you wait to get to the good stuff). . Out of the five different meats available (Turkey, Pork, Lamb, Beef, and  Ham), Baba goes with Pork, and I go with Beef (pictured) I got mine dipped and with bleu cheese, which was amazing.  The texture of the meat is phenomenal, you can tell they know what they're doing there.  And, I'm such a sucker for carbs and the bread manages to maintain its' shape, despite being doused in the amazing au jus sauce.  . . My sandwich, despite appearing small, packed a punch and was very heavy and really filling.  What really did me in was that hot mustard. Oh man, see, Im a girl that puts schiracha sauce on practically everything, and this mustard really sets it over the top. yum.. . So basically, I can find nothing at fault with Philippe's, and you thereby have my attention and approval.
