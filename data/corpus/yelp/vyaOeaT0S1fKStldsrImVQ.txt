Category: Pizza
I'm really digging on Jack's right now. I've been waiting to try the food on location before writing my review and finally got to last week. . . We've gone here many times for drinks with friends and the prices are of course the initial draw, but they keep you coming back with great service and punk rock friendly vibe. . . Some friends met up for adult trivia on Thursday night, which was awesome - definitely a trivia repeat, very well run and fun questions. Though there was a LOT of hip hop played over trivia, which is fine, but I was hoping for the usual rocking vibe.. . The pizza was fantastic. Bacon and spinach for me, just one slice. I could have gone for another half a slice, so Hubby D. let me have one of his nasty anchovies and mushroom pizza bones. We've gotten take out from Jack's before and it's always been good too, it makes it the mile or so home without turning soggy or anything. . . Looking forward to trying out their poker night on Wednesday soon!
