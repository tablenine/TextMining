i visited during the week around 1130am...the wait was short; about 10 mins for a seriously tattered booth. not a big deal, but with those fancy touch screen hand held order takers, you'd think they could afford to pretty the place up some. our server was friendly enough, but sooo soft spoken! maybe it's true that i'm losing my hearing in my old age, but in a restaurant so packed with people chit chatting away, i don't think i heard a thing she said; totally relied on my lunch companion to translate for me. i ordered the combo with a tuna sashimi bowl with sushi rice. this bowl was the star of the meal!! the fish was fresh and the rice was delish. perfect little serving size, too. the ramen itself, what i was looking forward to most, came shortly after the sashimi bowl. the broth wasn't piping hot...that was disappointing. i had to push my tuna to the side while i slurped up the soup before it got too cold. the pork was just ok, too! a little bit too fatty for me...the whole egg wasn't anything to rave about. it actually tasted nothing like an egg; sorta freaked me out. of course i built this place up in my head to be the be ramen messiah, so i was disappointed more than i should have been. while the broth was good, it was not as savory or nearly as flavorful as i yearned for it to be. it tasted rather watered down, in fact.. . thank goodness i didn't sit thru the hour + waits some people describe. i woulda been pi-hiiiisssed. i would come back here for that tuna bowl and their delightful little salad...and probably to try some of their other side dishes that i hear good things about...will pass on the ramen, though~!
