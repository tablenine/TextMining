Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Why does the upstairs level of this restaurant resemble a hospital?!?!?! Just kinda freaky.. . My dad is a Travel channel addict, and naturally living less than an hour from Philippe's, we had to make a special trip just to try it.. . We walked into a fully packed room with at least 100 people waiting in line on a Sunday night. Sunday night and this crowded? It had to be good. After waiting in line for about twenty minutes, we finally ordered a half-dipped sandwich each and some chips. Roughly $20 for our entire order.. . Because of the crowdedness of place, we were forced to find a seat upstairs. I can't deny this area looked like it came straight out of a horror movie. Despite the strange setting, the sandwiches were actually quite tasty. Nothing over-the-top "gotta come here every week" kind of food, but pretty alright for what it was.. . Overall, a good place to go if I ever find myself in Chinatown not wanting to eat Chinese food, or if I want to show a friend a historical restaurant in LA.
