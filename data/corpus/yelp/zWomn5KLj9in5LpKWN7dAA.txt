Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
YELP !. . SERIOUSLY..... U guys need to come up with a ZERO star some kind of way . I never even bothered to write about this spot because I get so mad when I think of all the people who obviously have wack azz tastebuds who always looked at me crazy when I said I have never eaten here before tell me that this is the spot for tacos.. . I stood in that long azz line about four years ago thinkin my tastebuds was about to get rocked...how about NOT.. . I whole heartly agree with my fellow yelper Craig "foot &amp; toe aficionado" R.'s review. Everything that I did not say in this review he said it for me.
