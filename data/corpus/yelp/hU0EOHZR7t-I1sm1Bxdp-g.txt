I'd give this place a 3.5.  Reminds me of the NY/NJ pizza places where you can grab a slice and go.  Not enough of these places here in Chicago. The slices are huge and the taste ok - sometimes they are a bit too salty.  But love the fact that if you want a slice you can go there and grab one or two.
