Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
Service - 6 stars!. . Popover - 5 stars!. . Kobe beef tar tar upon sea salt block - 5 stars!. . Surf and turf dumplings lobster and short rib - 5 stars!. . Dry aged Burger - 4 stars!. . Delmonico steak - 3 stars!. . Slice of prime - 3 stars!. . The King - 4 stars!. . This was all taken from the restaurant week lunch menu, many peeps have covered it well, so I will touch on the surprises...  . . Love the green tea and serving details like the cheese cloth wrapped lemon!. . The short rib dumplings I could eat until I burst!. . Unfortunately the big downer was the steak, by far the worst part of the meal, I don't know what else to say, other then had I paid full price for this I would have sent it back, but everything else was so stellar I just grinned and bared it, I will probably give david Burke's another chance, just because everything else hit me just right, but lets face it the meat is central to a steak house experience...  It was tough, dry, and too salty, I eat a lot of steak across america, and I hate to say it, I have had better at chain restaurants, lets hope I was a victim of a full lunch crowd during restaurant week.... . But I won't throw out the baby with the bathwater, Ill be back for another ride on the Primehouse train!
