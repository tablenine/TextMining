Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
The food here is VERY good. Their menu is simple: medium (10pcs), large (15pcs), and extra veggies. I like that, less thought can go into ordering (which you do when you write your name down). . . Also, be prepared for a LONG wait. Good thing there's a ce fiore and pinkberry nearby, plus a bunch of little stores to browse in. Just be sure to check every once in Â awhile or you may lose your spot!! The restaurant is like a small circular bar where every patron gets his or her own shabu shabu pot. The waiters are all in and out of the center of that bar.. . The meat is sliced fresh (there's a deli slicer in the middle of the restaurant with a worker constantly...slicing) and the broth is water. I know, it sounds...plain. But they have 2 sauces you can use ( ponzu and peanut or sesame?) which are both pretty good. I like to had all the little condiments in the ponzu: grated radish and garlic, green onions, and chili oil. Though the peanut/sesame sauce is good, it's a little overpowering, and I like the lightness of the ponzu. The service here is surprisingly good! Considering each person gets their own pot, the waitress is very attentive and always refills the broth and sauce promptly.. . Parking is ok, but driving around LA in general makes me nervous. But this place is worth it. . . Bonus: Awesome food and great service.. Boo-ness: A reDONKulous wait.
