This place reminds me of my absolute favorite pizza place in SF - pizzetta 211 - only a lot bigger like everything in Chicago. Â We had been searching for great pizza for the last two years and finally we found it.. . The pizzas were perfectly crispy and chewy. Slightly charred around the edges and topped with just the right amount of sauce. And then there is the divine spicy pepperoni - OMG! . . The only bummer is that they don't have a liquor license so don't forget to lug along your own bottle to wash down your pizza.
