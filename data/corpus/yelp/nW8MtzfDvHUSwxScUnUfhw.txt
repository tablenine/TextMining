This is a must-try for breakfast.... I was taken to Toast by a good friend who just raves on and on about their fruit dish. She was right on. The thing that struck me as different about this fruit dish is that it included papaya and mango. That's not so common, and was a welcome change. I ordered the Shikshuka breakfast dish which consisted of a mess of peppers, garlic and onions, topped with an egg. PERFECT! It really was right on, and the juice (orange) was so freshly squeezed, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to stop re-ordering it. I see a lot of reviews on here about bad service, and I do have to admit that the hostess needs to go find another job (apparently we weren't the first to have issues with her), but our server was sweet and efficient. If you're in the area, definitely come in and try this place out.
