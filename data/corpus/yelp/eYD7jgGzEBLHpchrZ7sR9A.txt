Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
This is one of most hyped about dumpling restaurants in Los Angeles. Everyone seems to know about this place. My friend, her boyfriend and I tried out this place.. . You can expect to wait at least 1 hour - 1 1/2 to get a table (even before the shop opened). All the dumplings are handmade and fresh. Note: the dumplings are known for their juiciness.  With a single bite,  a hot flood of juice will flow out. Just remember you have to eat the dumplings when they are hot. It doesn't taste good if you do take out.. . I love their crab dumplings the most. Check it out!!
