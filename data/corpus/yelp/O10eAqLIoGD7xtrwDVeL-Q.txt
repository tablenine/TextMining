I think those of you calling Tender Greens overpriced are not realizing the quality and integrity of their ingredients. First of all, $10 for a tuna/steak , mashed potatoes, and salad is not a lot at all, you'd pay more for that at a chain like Applebee's or something equally bad. Secondly, their ingredients are all local, something which few restaurants bother to do. They support local farmers, which is so important and should really factor into your choice of dining. I love that their portions aren't too big, and none of their food is greasy. Often when I walk out of restaurants I feel uncomfortably full and unhealthy, but at Tender Greens I usually get just the right amount to eat. The mashed potatoes are wonderful, the salads aren't swimming in dressing and really let you enjoy the greens and toppings, and the Oxnard vegetables, aside from being local, are always delicious and seasonal. As a vegetarian I have not tried their meats, but my boyfriend assures me that the beautifully coloured tuna would cost much more in any other restaurant. They also have great soups(a couple regulars and usually a soup of the day). During the summer they serve some wonderful gazpachos. The cafeteria-style service means no tip, thus saving you a few bucks, and it makes it a lot faster. Don't be disappointed if the line seems long, it goes quickly. I'm trying not to repeat other reviews too much, but I really felt the need to address the "overpriced" concern. $10 for a meal is less than you'll pay at pretty much any other sit-down restaurant with similar cuisine. In my opinion, for the taste, quality, and environmental friendliness of the place, Tender Greens is very affordable.
