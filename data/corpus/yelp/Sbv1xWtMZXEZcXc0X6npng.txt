best ramen in town by far!. i found this place by accident after a grueling couple hours of jury duty.. i love the taste of the broth and delicious "kurobuta" black pig chashu they put in the ramen. nothing hits the spot on a cold day/night with a bowl of ramen, cabbage salad and oolong cha. yum!. ive had ramen in japan and i think daikoku holds up to some places and even better!. i just wish they would open later...1am is good but what if you want to go after the bars? ramen is best served drunk!
