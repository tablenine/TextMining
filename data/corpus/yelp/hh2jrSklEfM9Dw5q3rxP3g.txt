Restaurant: Furaibo Restaurant
Category: Japanese
The interior reminds me a bit of Karuta Japanese Restaurant in Buena Park. The wait wasn't Â bad (5 minutes) for around 7pm on a Monday night.. I love this little Sawtelle strip!. . Ordered:. Salmon Rice Ball $1.50. Sea Bass Wasabi Mayo $6.95. Agedashi Tofu $3.95. Jane dinner box $13.75. . PROS: I loved the Agedashi Tofu. I've tried Agedashi tofu at other places and ususally they were a bit overcooked, or lacked what this place had--a balance. The inside was soft, like Korean Sootofuness, and the exterior a gentle crispness (not overly fried taste). . . The Sea Bass Wasabi Mayo dish was pretty delicious. It's actually not even Japanese. It reminds me more of Mexican food if anything. It seems the fish was a bit fatty however, therefore not enough "umph" to it (I hope this is making sense). The sauce was pretty tasty (I love Wasabi). However, this fish is the size of my crackberry phone--small. :0( . . The Jane Box is a pretty good deal. It is basically a bento box that includes: salad, rice, miso soup, stewed potato, pork cutlet, baby seasoned shrimp, and a choice of a main dish ranging from yakitori, fish, terriyaki steak, Japanese pike, and chicken. . . CONS: Salmon Rice ball was definitely not "Japanese" quality. The rice should be cohesive, yet still freshly fluffy. This rice triangle looked forced and unhappy. . . Nothing was super spectacular. The prices are low because most of the items are a la carte.. . ADVICE: Don't park in the vallet lot where Hurry Curry is. They will know you are going to this place and then you'll have to deal with that. Park in the neighborhood behind or across the street from the restaurant. (Oh and gawk at the amazing contemporary modern design of the house on the corner [in the neighborhood across the street]).
