Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
The best part about this Gino's location is that half of the first floor is actually a Gino's "cafe" - you can get pasta, salads, sandwiches, and personal deep dish pizzas all in a hurry. Â Great for lunch time when you can't wait an hour for a pizza to cook, although the personal deep dish is a lot of crust and could use more actual sauce and cheese.
