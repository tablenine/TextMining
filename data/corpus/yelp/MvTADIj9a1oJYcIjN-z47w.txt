I don't frequent this neighborhood anymore for a number of reasons, but when I did this was one of my haunts.. . Their beer selection is quite good, and their food is fantastic.  One should know beforehand that the portion of fries or tots that comes with any meal is HUGE... not to mention, the general size of whatever sandwich you've ordered.. . My favorite was always the black bean burger-- with bbq sauce on the side.  It's a messy thing, this sandwich, so the sauce on the side really helps.. . I also recommend their mixed drink specials-- and this from someone who NEVER orders mixed drinks.  Unless a gentleman orders them for me.  That being said, they're good and they're not too expensive.. . I wouldn't go here daily (HAHAHAHA) but I would definitely return again and again.
