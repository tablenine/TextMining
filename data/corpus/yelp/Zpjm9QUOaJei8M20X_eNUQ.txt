Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Apple Pan is another one of my favorite places in LA. I love hamburgers and Apple Pan has some of the best. . . The taste of the burgers isn't your typical made-to-order burger. If you're looking for that, go somewhere else. It's worth it to try the burger without changing anything about it. Don't worry, it's delicious!. . The fries are good too, just crispy enough, and there's plenty of ketchup to dip them in. . . Save room for a slice of the apple pie with a scoop of ice cream or a slice of banana cream pie. Both are excellent! . . The atmosphere in the place is pretty great too. When you walk in, it's like you're transported somewhere out of LA. . . Don't bring an attitude; sometimes the servers can be a little short. But hey, just shut up and enjoy the food. Also, don't come with a big group. There aren't any tables here, just the counter, and it can be difficult to seat even 4 people next to each other.. . The price may be a little high for just burgers but you're getting so much more than that. I always leave stuffed and on a high.
