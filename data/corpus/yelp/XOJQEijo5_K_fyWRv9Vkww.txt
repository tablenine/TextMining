This is a good place for post-hangover brunch with your partners in boozing. Â I really wanted to give the place 5 stars but I will never how get how disgustingly salty the egg on my egg burger was. That was the first time I had ordered an egg burger and was waiting to sink my teeth into it with baited breath until the egg tested my gag reflexes. I removed the egg and the burger was fine, but still!. . Love the Sunday brunch special where they give you a complimentary mimosa or orange juice with each order.
