Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Is any hot dog worth a 1.5 hour wait? . . I would say no. I mean, it's a hot dog. It was made and originally cooked in a factory somewhere else. Are the hot dogs good? Kinda yeah, in a sloppy, messy way. And to be fair, you can actually get a better hot dog in other places. You may be able to make a better hot dog at home, if you were able to find a hot dog with a casing like restaurants buy. . . I actually like the chili burger with bacon better than the hot dogs, but am not waiting an hour and half for any hot dog or burger. But no, Pink's is not bad, for a hot dog. I wrote a review of Tito's Tacos, another local landmark in Culver City explaining extreme opinions regarding beloved local landmarks and they hype locals perpetrate, causing the bad reviews. Expectations, people It's about expectations. Also, cost and wait affect reviews.
