I love it that you can control the firmness (of course as firm as possible), the amount of oil and richness (I think it translates to salt). I ordered normal on both oil and richness and it had plenty of flavor.  The noodles are thinner and has a nice firm texture but I prefer those at Asa better which has a more chewy feel (or in Chinese it 'springs off your teeth'). . . Basic ramen is 6.95 and comes with one piece of chasu. The sets are good value since they only cost 7.25 and you get a takana fried rice or chicken rice bowl or rice balls.  I had the fried rice and it was very good.  Not oily and the pickled veggie definitely adds depth and flavor. . . The egg is a 75c option. However it is hardboiled and not much flavor. Asa and Shin Mama really kick their bud here.. . I can give it a 5 star if it is a little cheaper or they include more topings. Overall a nice place for ramen.  The service is very friendly.
