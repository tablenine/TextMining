Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Mexican
My favorite cuisine is Mexican and therefore had to let others know what I thought of Rosa Mexicano.  The ambiance was good...well more than good!  However, I did not feel that the drink was worth the price.  The Guac really was the hit of the evening for me and my friends.. I will go back there again, but of course there is always room for improvement.  . I do recommend this place to those who love Mexican food and for those who haven't tried Mexican...it is about time you did!
