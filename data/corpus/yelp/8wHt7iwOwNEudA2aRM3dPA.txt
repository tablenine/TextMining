Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
Slow service, unfriendly non-service staff, suspiciously over-friendly waiters. . The decor is a treat, but not worth the overcharge of food. Surprisingly limited menu.. Let me set this straight: I LOVE GARLIC. But alas, I do not love the food here. . Why?. BAD, DRY, STINKY CRAB. (i.e. NOT FRESH) For such a limited menu, i'm surprised that they would not be able to have good ingredients. . WHAT KIND OF GARLIC RESTAURANT HAS NO GARLIC BREAD? THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN EASY!!! . sorry, i don't think having fried garlic in oil to dip hard rolls in counts or is anywhere as good as garlic bread. . My mojito sucked. It looked cheap, tasted like bottom shelf, and was poorly mixed. . A Plus!: My tiny filet mignon was cooked to perfection ^__^. If you must come here, however, get someone else to pay for you. :)
