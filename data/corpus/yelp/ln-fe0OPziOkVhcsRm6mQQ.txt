on most occasions, i have had to wait about 30 minutes to an hour to get a seat. Â However, the first time I was introduced to Daikokuya (thank you zaki)... it was about midnight on a weekend and I didn't have to stand in line at all =). . Mmm... get the combo with unagi over rice.. what a deal!!!! for the price, ambiance.. and hopefully, good company.
