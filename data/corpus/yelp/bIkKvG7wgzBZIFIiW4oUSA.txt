There's what might be called an "awful experience loop." It's the length of time between an awful experience and its repetition. My AEL for Roscoe's is ten years. That's how long it took me to fully forget how nasty this place is. Fortunately, this means I am not due for another visit to Roscoe's until 2018, by which time it'll probably be closed due to the total collapse of society. Bye Roscoe's!
