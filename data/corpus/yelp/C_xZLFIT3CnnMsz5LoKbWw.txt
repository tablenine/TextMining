Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
My girlfriend suggested this place when we both had serious munchies for something resembling empanadas, and even after we checked out Yelp and the website, we were completely floored when we actually got to Porto's.. . What I was under the impression was a greasy hole in the wall Cuban bakery was a slick, GIGANTIC, modern looking bakery/eatery that was the size of an entire food court. Oh, also the FOUR LINES THAT WERE ALMOST OUT THE DOOR.. . No worries though, the line moved surprisingly fast, at least if you weren't ordering cakes, it seemed (we weren't).. . Their appetizers are good enough for an entire trip and meal on their own: the potato balls and meat pies are the best, one being rich and homey, the other being light and flaky. At less than a dollar a pop I can gorge pretty easily. . . Unfortunately the chicken empanadas were disappointing, the dough too dense and crumbly, and the stuffing too sparse and dry.. . We also got two sandwiches, the Cuban and the Steak Torta. Both fantastic, though they do seem to have a good way with beef. I look forward to trying the Bistec next time, except I really just wanna come back for potato balls and meat pies.
