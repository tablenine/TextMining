My best dining experience thus far in Chicago after over a year of living here.  Food was amazing and more than enough.  . . Service couldn't have been better.  When making my reservation over the phone, they asked if it was for a special occassion, and I told them it was for my girlfriend and my 1 year anniversary.  After our meal, we declined ordering dessert, but they brought us a complimentary cake (which was amazing) with a "Happy Anniversary" chocolate thingie on it.  Very descriptive, I know.. . If you need a special occasion restaurant, GO HERE!!
