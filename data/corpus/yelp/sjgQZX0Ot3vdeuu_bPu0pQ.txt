Big star gets a 5 Star! This place is so good. Chicago yelpers are really bitching that you can't get a booth for 2 on a sat night when they don't take reservations (this isn't chipotle) Why do 2 people need a booth!!!!!! The food is amazing and so are the drinks!!! Go wait 2 hrs it's worth it and you can drink while you wait. The chips and Guac are refreshing. The porkbelly tacos and the fish tostada were my favorite, the queso I could die for and as for the drinks I love the Root Beer &amp; whiskey! get over yourself Chicago.
