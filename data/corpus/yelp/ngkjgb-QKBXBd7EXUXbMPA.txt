Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
This is the standard by which all other non-jewish-deli pastrami is measured.. . Not to mention the chili cheese fries.. . Summertime evenings on the patio with friends or family are the stuff that memories are made of.. . Cash ONLY, hit the ATM on the way.. . Go there, eat pickles, get fat and smile!
