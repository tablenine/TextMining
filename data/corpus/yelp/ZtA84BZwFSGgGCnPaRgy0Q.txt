I don't consider this good or authentic Cuban fare by any means (). . . I live in the area and sometimes when I am in a clutch I carry out the Famoso Pollo Versailles or Versailles Famous Garlic Chicken which is their famous house speciality - JUICY ROASTED HALF CHICKEN MARINATED IN A DELICIOUS GARLIC SAUCE GARNISHED WITH SLICED WHITE ONIONS. I ditch the beans and order double rice cause the beans don't have any full good flavor like down at El Rincon. It also comes with water bread and fried plantains. If you carry it out get your plantains in a separate box unless you want them smothered in citrus garlic sauce. The plantains do not have as much flavor or caramelization as I would like them to have.. . I have also had their cuban sandwhich and its so-so. . . They have plenty of parking and large staff to accommodate the busy rush during lunch and dinner hours.
