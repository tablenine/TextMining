Been past this joint many times, seen the lines, but finally tried it.  12:50pm during lunch.  Wait was about 20 minutes as we were about 5th in the role call. . Got  myself a Large Lunch set.  Guys will need a LARGE.  Menu is very simple, udon, veggies, 2 pieces of tofu and the size of beef you want.  . The beef itself has some fat to it but it is very good! YUMMY.  Next is the sauce.  I dont know what sauce they make, but its delicious.  Make sure to add tons of scallion to your food.  service sucks but amazingly, your so entrenched in the food that you dont even have time to talk with the people you came with.  ahahahaa.  Anyways, medium size is less than 10 bucks and large is about $13.  a great price since i've paid for $15 to $20 for other shabu shabu joints.  If you can fight the wait and the meter parking, its a great spot for lunch!
