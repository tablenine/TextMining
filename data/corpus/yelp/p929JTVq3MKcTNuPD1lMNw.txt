This is a review of the main dining room, not the casual front room, although they do share some parts of the menu.. . I really cannot say enough good things about this place. I've been here five or six times and its absolutely wonderful. I've done both the tasting menu and alacarte, and I've come to the conclusion that you simply cannot go wrong with anything you choose. . . Perfect service, perfect food and a decor that is altogether upscale and sophisticated without intimidation. I also dare to say it's a good value as well, if a $500 meal can ever be considered as such... but you truly are getting a transcendent experience for your money. . . Not quite the caliber of Daniel, but just as satisfying in enough other ways to make this a top 10 for NYC.
