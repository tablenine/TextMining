Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
This place was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. I'm not sure when it originally aired, but we happened to catch it flipping through channels, as it's not a show we regularly watch. . . For what this place is, it's OUTSTANDING. Much better than any standard taqueria I've ever been to. . . There isn't a lot to say about the place. It's just a little neighborhood taco join that happens to have really, really good food. We tried the two dishes that were featured on the show. . . The Cemita is a sandwich that consists of avocado spread, one of a few choices of meat, oaxacan cheese, stewed chipotle peppers and a semi-crunchy sesame bread. We chose the Carne Enchilada for our meat, which is marinated pork chop. This was really tasty with a little salt or one of the three sauces they have on the table. It's hard to articulate why it works so well--it's just a really nice balance of textures and flavors. . . We also had the Taco Arabes, which is spit-roasted pork and onions wrapped in a tortilla. This is probably not for everyone--the meat can be a little fatty, and it has a very strong onion flavor. . . If this place were closer to our neighborhood, it would probably quickly become a weekly staple. In any case, we'll be making the short trek for a return visit soon. Maybe tonight.
