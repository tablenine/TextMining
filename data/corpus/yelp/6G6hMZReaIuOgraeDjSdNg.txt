I've had the same meal both times I've been here - the Rib-eye.  The first time, I swear it was one of the best steaks I've ever had... the second visit told me that my first trip was enhanced by my "munchy" mood.  I think my sober visit would lend a bit more credence to such a review.  . . The steak was decent... I probably would have preferred even a bit more char on the outside, but they got the mid-rare correct.  Perhaps a little too seasoned, but it wasn't extraordinarily out there.  The mashed potatoes were solid, but nothing special.  Our party's LaLa regulars suggested the "Lomo LaLa's" (filet mignon in a cream sauce) to a few people.  I didn't try it, but the there wasn't a consensus... some liked it and some didn't. I don't think I'd try it because I prefer my filets minimal (salt and pepper, with some olive oil).   . . What I can vouch for (on both trips) is the bread with olive oil dip... you can't really mess this up too much, but I can't get enough.  If you can brave the wait on a weekend evening, check out LaLa's.  Make sure to get a seat in the outdoor patio area.
