I never thought I would love something called STUFFED POTATO BALLS but man oh man, these are tasty. And everything else I've tried here is also delish, including their desserts. Their tuna croissant sandwich is great, and love those plaintain chips. And it's all so reasonably priced! . EXTRA SECRET TIP: If you're eating there just before closing time, they give away that day's unsold bread for FREE!
