Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
i had the pleasure of getting invited to magic castle last night and i really had a great time here...a little cheesy, but i love magic tricks so it was a blast...the performer at the end of the night, david cassidy, was such a hoot with his neurosis/magic/balloon creations...totally wish i could've watched more shows though! if i ever get a chance to go again, i'll definitely try to hit up as many shows as possible. . minus 1 star for the crap food...like someone said before, 3 star food at 5 star prices...definitely felt like i wasted $$$ on a poorly prepared swordfish dish that was drenched in creamy nothingness paired with bland mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies that i could've done myself at home, but to make up for the chef's ineptitude in the kitchen, you do get tickets to the big magic show at the end of the night, so it evens out i suppose. . also FYI: for men, jacket and tie ARE absolutely required (if you don't have one, they'll give you a jacket and tie...someone in our party had to do this), cover charge of $20/person, $8 valet
