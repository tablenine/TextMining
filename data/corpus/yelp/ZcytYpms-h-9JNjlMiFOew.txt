Open all night long Friday and Saturday? Perfecto. . . Satisfying diner-ish food, as well as some more original culinary creations. Oh and the drinks? Well, if you really need a "pick me up" then you are guaranteed to find something to keep your eyes wide open for several hours. For extreme needs, get a zombie drink...or two. . . Oh and their cheesecake is ridiculously good.
