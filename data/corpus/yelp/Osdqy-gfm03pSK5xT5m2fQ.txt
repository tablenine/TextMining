Ahem.. . I'm very white and enjoy my sentiments of sushi-elitism just as much as my other fellow white-ians on this site do, and I can safely say that my recent trek to Sushi Gen - after, of course, having been coming here all my life before any of you/since the dawn of time/I MADE &amp; INVENTED SUSHI - was one of utmost astounding wonderment.. . I called the owner up (which is me by the way) and demanded he know of my impending presence.. . His exact words:  "yes".. . I hopped in my G5 as fast as I could - I live in Tokyo, Japan, [in the heart of Pyongyang] mind you - instructed my pilot to set a course for Downtown, Los Angeles and off we were into the sunset to this most sought-after of Sushi joints.. . I landed the G5 in the enormous parking structure considerately provided for all and showed the valet my security credentials. Jose (the valet) and I shared a laugh as we caught up on old times - on account of our not seeing each other for such a temporal allotment of nothingness.. . My 5 girlfriends and I- the 5 of them completely OK and already complacent with the fact I bone all of them simultaneously - walk up to Sushi Gen's entrance, shoving everyone away to their deaths in our path. We all authoritatively take our seats and foresightedly demand our meal be free on the grounds of it being too delicious for any normal, serf human to fathom.. . My 5 GF's and I then commenced having sex on the sushi bar while the owner regaled us with stories from the old country  (about how samurai used secret progressions to attain the meaning of life). I then acceded into God-status and took many, many lives that day.. . Oh yeah... the sushi was good.
