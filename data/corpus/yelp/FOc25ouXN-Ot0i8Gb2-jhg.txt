I have an irrational hatred of this place.  After going there for the first time last night, it's becoming quite clear that my boyfriend now finds their silky, delicious, perfectly-spiced pork belly more beautiful, seductive, and swoon-worthy than anything else in the world.  And I'm JEALOUS. HEY JERK IF YOU LOVE IT SO MUCH WHY DON'T YOU JUST MARRY IT AND HAVE ITS BABIES WHATEVER GO SLEEP ON THE COUCH. . Oops, sorry.. . The food here was great, and the pork belly ramen was an absolute standout.  Top quality local ingredients, prepared perfectly.   Chicken and mushroom dumplings were also very good, and the mushrooms in particular were delicious.. . We got a bit of a chilly vibe from the service, but this may have been because they were pretty busy.  The only thing I can really complain about, other than the fact that it's driving a wedge in my relationship, is that it's not easy to get to without a car (unless you're one of the lucky ones who live nearby.)  I get the feeling that when the craving for a warm bowl of noodles and broth hits in the dead of winter, we're going to be bundling up in lots of layers and braving the trek back to Urban Belly.
