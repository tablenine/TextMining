I have to comment -- what a creepy, dark, weird-looking little joint!  I was actually kind of nervous just going there for pickup.. . BUT, the rolls are AMAZING!  This is great sushi; the best I've had in the Noble Square neighborhood so far.  I had the spider roll today and I'm pretty sure it was the best one I've ever had... they also have some EXTREMELY inventive and elaborate-sounding rolls on their menu.  I can't wait to try more!. . I probably would have given this place five stars, actually, because I liked the sushi just that much, but I was really turned off by the customer service I received over the telephone.  I am pretty sure I was put on hold more than five different times in the process of placing my very short and simple order.  How annoying during the workday, and how rude!. . Prices aren't low, but people here seem to be commenting on half-price deals, so just go then!  They also have adorable packaging for their carryout (which I would recommend because of the icky vibe of the restaurant itself); I know that's just a tangential anecdote, but I do think it makes the dining experience more enjoyable.. . FYI, Sushi X also has a Lincoln Park location.
