Slow service some really good  food. Some not really good food. Pool tables!. . I want to like this place. I went there for lunch today and walked out an hour and fifteen minutes later. Yikes!!!. . The pot stickers are the best thing on the menu. Nice and crispy on the outside with a tasty meat filling. I had the burger today. It was disgusting. I have never seen so much grease in my life with the exception being when I am actually frying something such as tots. The bottom bun was completely soaked with grease. I had to take it off and use a knife and fork. My stomach feels like it is coated in lead. . . I have had the hummus salad on more than one occasion here. Next time I go that's what I will get again. It is huge and really delicious. . . I read so much about these "garlic fries". I pictured fries with  a seasoned garlic coating. Ummm...no. These are reguar nothing to write home about fries with a big pile of raw (yes I said raw) garlic dumped on them. I ate some as I love garlic - but come on. These are ridiculous. My mouth smells like a swamp monster lives in it right now. . . This is a pretty nifty place excepting the slow service. Not a big fan of their home brews. I get red wine when I go here which is reasonably priced. This is the only place in midtown (I don't count twisted taco as that is just a frat party dressed up with tacos) with pool tables. Call before you go there to play pool as they have lots of private parties upstairs. . . So - go enjoy! Just make sure you have plenty of time if you are eating!
