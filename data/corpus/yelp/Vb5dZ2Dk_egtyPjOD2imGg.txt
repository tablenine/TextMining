This review is strictly for the bar, I haven't eaten at the restaurant. We went to this place to grab some drinks and an appetizer before meeting up with several others for dinner at a different restaurant and we were staying at the Westin so we thought we'd try it out. . The ambiance was nice and relaxing and the view was fantastic. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I were with my fiance and not my boss. . . To drink I had a "Georgia Peach" NOT the Martini but it was a blended beverage and it was like peach smoothie with alcohol...absolutely yummy! . . For an appetizer we had the House made potato chips which had blue cheese and bacon on them...again YUMMY! That in itself could have been a meal and my boss and I only could finish about half of the plate because it was HUGE! Probably a 4-6 person appetizer! But all in all we had GREAT food and GREAT drinks and a good time!
