Question -  I have been debating with my friend whether we ate clams or Oysters...  Does anybody know which one it is?  They came 2 per order.  It was in a large rough shell and was grilled or broiled.. . Anyhow... the food here is very good.  There were a lot of items to pick from and were not very expensive.  Four of us ate for about $80.  There was a wait but was worth it.
