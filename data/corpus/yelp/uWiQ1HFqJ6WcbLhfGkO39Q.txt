Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
In the summer, I love this place - the leafy beer garden, and great burgers with cheap beer. Inside, however, it's too smoky with the grills, and pretty dark. . . Save it for a summer place. The inside is just too depressing and dark with a stinky, stale-beer bar smell. And the food is awful. And you have to be very, very quiet when dining inside.
