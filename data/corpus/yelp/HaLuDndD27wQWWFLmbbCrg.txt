Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I have to say that I am biased.  Everyone has their favorite taco joint... and I'll bet that between your friends, nobody can agree on who's is better.. . That's what Tito's Taco is like.  I love it... it's on the top of my list.  But it's also because I've been coming here since I was 8.  . . I remember ordering a few Chili con Carne's and some taco's and going to the Culver City Drive-In.  Those were the days.. . So what's good there?  It's all good... and I love the way they take their orders at the front window or inside.... . The place looks the same as I recall as a kid... nothing has change, even down to the chips out of a huge Rubbermaid trash can.  The food is fresh and very simple... but it just tastes so good.  . . They changed their guacamole recipe... which made me kinda' sad.  I liked their water down version they used to have... but alas, gotta change with the sign of the times.. . Go early... otherwise expect to wait in line.  And tip the staff there... they deserve it since they work their asses off.
