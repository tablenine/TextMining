It was my second time here and I finally got to try the much raved about french toast. I would normally go for the straight forward brioche french toast, but I was told to the popular thing to do is to order the one "stuffed" with blackberry jam, vanilla yogurt and topped with bananas and strawberries. I followed the recommendation and was glad I did so. . . The integrity of the bread itself was not lost with all the extra ingredients, but rather it was enhanced. It was more like two slices sandwiched together, with the spread of yogurt and jam in between. The slices are thick enough that you can get a real sense for the superb quality of the bread. Portions are not too large either. I can imagine the plain fresh toast is outstanding, but I am glad I tried this version. . . They also serve large salads, sandwiches, other breakfast combos that includes amazing looking pancakes, and solid coffee and tea selections. They play 90's music, which serves as an interesting teleportation device for the mind while you are enjoying your very satisfying meal.
