The good: Food is pretty tasty.. The bad: Service needs a whole lotta work.... In short:  If you don't care about not getting your table at the time requested, having to track down your server to take your order or waiting for such long stretches that you'd rather skip the apps and skip dessert, then you will be ok here.  . It's cute and a great location, but the service (or lack thereof) is enough to outshine the food.  Too bad.
