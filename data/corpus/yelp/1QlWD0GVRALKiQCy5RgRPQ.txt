Simply the best coffee on the strip in Andersonville.  And the pastries are truely the best.  If you can get in there early enough to get a blueberry scone......you'll thank me !!. And they serve breakfast all day long.  Yes they have an awesome patio at the side as well as comfy-casual indoor dining.. The food is rich and flavorful and reminds me of home.  . The wait staff always take good care of me when I slip in there before closing with friends to get a slice of bundt cake (yes bundt cake).. Or better yet....Carrot cake.  Yum.
