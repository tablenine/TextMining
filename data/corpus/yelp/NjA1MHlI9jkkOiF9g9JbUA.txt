Probly the fanciest Brazilian BBQ shindig I have ever been to and probly will ever go to.  All the food here is amazing, from the salad bar to the orally orgasmic bacon-wrapped filet mignon.  Sadly, the didn't have any feijoada but everything else pretty much makes up for it.  I'll also have to add this place makes the BEST pao de quiejo i have ever had.  They make it fresh from scratch for lunch and dinner time.  Service is amazing as well.  You honestly get treated as if you're the king or queen of Brazil.  But you also get charged like royalty as well, so don't forget the wallet.  Despite the fact that it's missing a few things, the experience alone is unforgettable.
