Restaurant: Opart Thai House Restaurant
Category: Thai
Adorable Thai place in Lincoln Square neighborhood.  Really great food at good prices. . . I I love the Tiger Cry beef, the pad Thai, and the yellow curry is delicious.  I love the wood carvings on the walls.  I love that it is BYOB.    . . Again, there are a million and two Thai places in the city, but this one has good food, good prices, and a nice (not dirty or cheap looking) atmosphere.  A must-eat for Chicago cheap eats!
