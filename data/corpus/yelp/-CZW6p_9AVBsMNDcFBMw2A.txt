Can this place be any more cool! The peanut butter french toast thing was totally BOMB! I felt like i was on cloud 9 eating it, even though i was on a "diet" this thing is the one that kills it hahaha.. . We also ordered their eggs benedit which i love as well cuz i love anything that's an eggs benedit. We also got the strawberry pancakes which was super duper huge, sharing with four people and there was still 1/4 of it left! This place is yum, plus the waiters/servers were yum too hahah they were super cute!
