Restaurant: Crawfish Shack Seafood
Category: Seafood
The food is absolutely delicious!!!!!   The fried shrimp taste fresh off the boat.  The crawfish were good - a little spicy for my tastes but my fiance ate 3 lbs of them.  . . The reason I didn't give them 5 stars??? They are pretty slow.. and their hours suck .  They close at either 7 or 8!! Too early for dinner.. And dont think of showing up right before they close.  They turned the open sign off in front of us and said they were closed.
