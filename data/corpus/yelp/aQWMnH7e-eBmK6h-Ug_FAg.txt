Some friends of mine and I went here because I read a couple of reviews that I liked.  I, also, enjoyed eating here.  I found the food to be tastey...not the best I have had, but, still good.  (FYI...the garlic bread is really good! Thanks, Roman T. for suggesting it!) I think it is a bit overpriced.  Something to think about for those of you on a budget...
