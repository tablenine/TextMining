I went to Flo this past weekend with a group of girlfriends to celebrate a special occasion and the food was amazing! We started with a round of drinks with some of us ordering a mimosa and the rest with bloody mary's. I'm not a fan of bloody mary's, but I did try a sip which I thought the flavors were good together. The mimosa was pretty good, but then again, how can you really mess it up? One of the diners did order a mango banana smoothie which I wish I would have gotten because it was so good - very smooth and creamy. . . There was so many choices on the menu that it took us awhile to decide what to get just bc everything looked so good! We finally decided to all order a savory dish and an order of blueberry pancakes to share for the table. I ordered the Smoked Hash with smoked turkey, squash, potatoes, onion, zucchini, and bell peppers, 2 perfectly poached eggs on top with a side of fruit, and toast. WOW! I was impressed. The spices one the hash was perfectly blended and absolutely delicious. Normally I'm not a huge pancake fan because i think they are overly sweet and way too dense. However, I would definitely recommend and order the blueberry pancakes again!!! The pancakes were light and fluffy and not overly sweet. The blueberries just added a touch of sweetness and tartness at the same time. The pancakes also came with almond butter which was to die for! I've never had almond butter before and now I'm hooked. . . The only negative thing is the long wait. Perhaps it was because we had 6 people in our party, but the food did make up for the wait. ;)
