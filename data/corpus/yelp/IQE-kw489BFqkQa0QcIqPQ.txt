Hi all!  . . I want to share my omakase experience with ya (and to make you jealous of the dinner I had last night).   . . We received two pieces of sushi for each order.  We ended up paying about $100 per head.  Here is a list of what we got and the order it was presented:. . 1.  otoro (super fatty toro - almost too fatty, no effort needed to eat because it just melts in my mouth). 2.  kampachi (one of my favorites - just enough chewy texture). 3.  tai with yuzu and light soy sauce ponzu (loved the yuzu and ponzu combination, came with partial skin). 4.  aji with grated ginger, onions and ponzu (tasted more like snapper than mackerel - ginger and ponzu works). 5.  mirugai (one of my all time favorites, but just ok here - probably the least fresh of everything I had that night). 6.  anago (usually would never order cooked stuff, but part of omakase, not smelly or fishy, sauce was not overly sweet). 7.  uni (very fresh and clean, not muddy and salty). 8.  ama ebi (very good, funny how entire row had it at same time). 9.  ama ebi head in miso soup (soup was not salty, good use of white miso, shrimp head added a deeper flavor not found in regular miso). 10. engawa for me (engawa better as sashimi, but still very good). 11. negi-otoro maki (otoro maki was so good - I could eat 50 of them). 12.  hamachi belly for me (so buttery, the color was very pure). . Worth every dollar, including the $2.50 parking fee for the lot.
