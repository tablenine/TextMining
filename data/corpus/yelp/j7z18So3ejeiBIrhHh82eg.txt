Dropped on over here the other day for dinner. Now my opinion might be a little skewed cause I did have Nobu the night before.. . This place is pretty authentic and the service is ridiculously fast for what they serve. Very chill spot with basic decorations. As far as food goes, my favorite of the night would probably be the miso nasu (miso paste on eggplant). It was pretty awesome, as I am a fan of eggplants. Go eggplants!. . Their yakitori was alright, but it wasn't charcoal grilled which was a bummer. The buta kakuni was pretty tasty and full of flavor. All in all, it was a good restaurant, but it didn't blow my mind. I'd come back though.
