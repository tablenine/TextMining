Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
$5 for 3 tacos. That's a great deal. The hot salsas are good, but for me on the medium side of hotness. I'll be contrarian and suggest people to liberally pour the salsas over your tacos. You won't regret it. Â The other toppings are great -- the white magic sauce, sliced cabbage and radish. You can't lose and it's fun to build your own fish/shrimp taco to your particular tastes.
