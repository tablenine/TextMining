ultra tender chicken with fatty melt-in-your-mouth skin still attached. slightly sweet red pepper hot sauce and a light dash of soy sauce just to lilt the inherent sweetness of the chicken, combo with some ginger to bring that complexity up. over a bed of succulent steamed rice that's been infused with chicken broth. incredible! if i was chicken doomed to death, i wouldn't mind dieing for this cause! too bad it's the only thing on the menu worth repeating. the pizza is interesting at best and the other pastas are insignificant compared to the hainan chicken.. . i repeat, their hainan chicken is filthy awesome, just enough to compensate for the i-finished-my-taxes wait for a table, ultra shitty street parking, and freezing outdoor seats. but just barely. i call for take out unless i need a plate of chickeny goodness then and there. . . if you show up for take out without calling in first and don't feel like answering the freezing outside/crowded inside dilemma, tip heavy for faster service. they'll literally take someone else's chicken and box it up for you.
