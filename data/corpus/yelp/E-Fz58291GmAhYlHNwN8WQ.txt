Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
This is my favorite steak restaurant in LA. Their filet it delicious! and everything else I've ordered have been really good. Â I usually take friends and family here from out of town to enjoy the nice meal, but we usually start off with the Mastros Cosmo. It comes with dry ice, which makes the glass freeze up so you end up with a really cold cosmo that tastes amazing. Tip: One shaker will serve two glasses, and try to get seating upstairs.
