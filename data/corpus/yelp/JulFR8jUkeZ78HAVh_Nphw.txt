I broke my rule -- I've only been here once.  But all I have to say is:. . - Bone-in Ribeye . - Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese . - Steamed asparagus with bearnaise. - Cheesecake with fresh berries / whipped cream. . And then, take the rest of the FRESH whipped cream with you.  Think of something creative.  You'll thank me later.  . . Oh, and be ready to spend at least $200+ for two.
