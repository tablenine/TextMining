A friend of mine and I were watching Man VS Food on the Travel Channel and we saw Adam do the Orochon Challenge.  We just looked at each other and said "We're going there!"  On our very first trip there, we went all balls in and had the special #2.  . . We didn't do the challenge because 1) it's a really stinking huge bowl and 2) I can never eat anything under 30 minutes.  I'm indeed a slow eater.  The special #2 was beyond the spiciest thing I've EVER EATEN!  We were there for an hour and it looked like we barely touched our food.  We kept joking about how our lips felt fat and we kept wiping our noses because it got all runny.  Our saying of that day was "it burn so good!". . I've went back there whenever I'm in Little Tokyo (it became a requirement to go there).  I've then found my niche with the Special #1 (still spicy but less jalepenos...I hate the stuff), no bean srpouts and extra noodles :). . There are levels of spiciness starting from not spicy at all to the special #2 that can make your nose bleed (and from what I'm told, it had happened before).. . I say go and give the challenge a try!  Adam is still the last one to brave the special #2.
