My favorite spot in all of New York. . . The pizza is simply phenomenal. I stick to the margherita... it's so good, it doesn't need to be dressed up in a zillion toppings. The tomato sauce is fresh and just a tiny bit sweet, the cheese is always fresh, the dough is light - everything is perfection. . They have a sinfully delicious Nutella dessert as well, and a great wine list.
