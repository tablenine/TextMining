entree - had the tuna with soba noodle salad, how exotic does that sound?! the tuna was cooked PERFECTLY and soba noodle salad was plentiful and delicious. might be one of the best meal i've ever had!. think my bf had the fillet mignon, don't remember, i was too overwhelmed by my tuna dish. :). . desert - rose souffle, i think. we just gulped it down! so good.. . service - our waiter was very knowledgeable about pairing wine with my dish.. . ambiance - we sat out side at the balcony. such a lovely area.. . overall - 5 stars.  a great night at a beautiful city.
