Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
Yamashiro is a nice, romantic restaurant that you should try.  It has stunning views of Hollywood and LA.  Try to get a seat close to the window so you can both enjoy your food and view at the same time.  The interior of the restaurant is nice too.  The food was pretty good.
