Restaurant: Fritti
Category: Italian
Awesome place. Great pizza. Fresh, inventive ingredients. Really nice, decent priced wine list. Great for a romantic date night. . . I'm an "I could eat pizza every day" sort of person. Â I could totally eat Fritti every day, if only! . . I highly recommend it - food, location, and service are all stellar. Since it is rather small, I might make sure you have a reservation.
