Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
I loved this place. It was as if someone was throwing a party with Greek food in a Koreatown warehouse. The atmosphere was fun and loud, with live music and everyone having a good time. It was nothing like I expected, from the from free valet parking to the walk through the warehouse to the Greek market. I would describe the place as Mediterranean ghetto-fabulous, with a "farmer's market" flair and plastic picnic-style dinnerware. There are no formalities--if you're looking for a five star restaurant, this ain't it. If you dig good food and a good time with friends, this may be your spot.. . We had the gyros sandwich as well as the shrimp Santorini, which was grilled shrimp in a boullabaise, served with a small baguette. The food was tasty and satisfying. The service was excellent and fast. I will definitely come again, probably on Thursday night for their family-style dinner.. . Perhaps my favirite part was that if you wanted something more to eat (like some baklava for dessert), you could just walk to the market, buy it, and bring it to your table.
