Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
The pork Hollenbeck is good. Id recommend that to first timers but I always get the Machaca Hollenbeck. Another great dish they serve is their Huevos Rancheros, the chilies and onions are great. Also I recently got for the first time the Mechaca Tostada. I was expecting something light, not really. Still alot of food. Manuel gave me a shot of tiquila once, a big shot.
