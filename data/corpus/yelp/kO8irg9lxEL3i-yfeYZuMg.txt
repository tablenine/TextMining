Best draught list in Little 5 by far!  In fact, only the Brick Store has a better overall draught/bottle list in Atlanta.  You must try the salt and vinegar popcorn...words can't express how amazing that stuff is.  The burger was tasty and I had 3 friends that gave the fish 'n chips a thumbs up.  I can see this quickly becoming an Atlanta favorite.  Solid, but I need to have a few more trips before I give that crucial 4th star!
