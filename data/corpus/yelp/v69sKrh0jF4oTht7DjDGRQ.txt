Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
To quote myself from the Santa Monica location. Father's Office is the benchmark of Los Angeles gastropubs, bar none. This holds true for the Culver City location and then some. Obviously the Santa Monica location is amazing seeing that it is the birthplace of FO, but they outgrew that location. FO Culver City is so much larger but dont expect that finding a seat is that much easier. . . Side note...on the "additional tips on the business" section who chose that they have waiter service? Have they ever been to FO? No waiter service is a HALMARK of their reputation! Come on!
