Every time I have put food from here into my mouth I feel like a million bucks. I feel so happy after I leave this place. . . Pulled Pork sandwich: outrageously good.. Meat Loaf sandwich: huge hunks of meat. . Cupcakes: Malted milk ball. Best!. Durbin sandwich: the pear is a fruity touch to this turkey sandwich. . Veggie chili: droooollll.. Grilled cheese sandwich: lots of different kinds of cheese, hits the spot on a cold Chicago day.. . They put all the sandwiches on what seems like a really simple bread, but it doesn't take anything away from the tasty contents, and the bread is so soft!. . Every server I have had here is delightful. The place is homey and comforting.
