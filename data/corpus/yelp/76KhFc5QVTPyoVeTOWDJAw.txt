After our first choice was closed, we went to the Yard House on Saturday.. . Lobster and crab artichoke dip ($11.85)- okay. No particular seafood or artichoke taste. But served with some nice pita and chips. I did like this little interlude towards unhealthy city. Ah, fattening appetizers.. . Bloody Mary- dear god, this was the worst Bloody I've ever had. It was way, way bitter. I drank it anyway but could have used more than the one olive in it. Where's the celery? Not worth the $8.95.. . I ordered the jambablaya ($16.95) which was oily as hell and not every spicy. Though admittedly, I picked out the charred bits of red pepper in it. I also ate all the sausage, shrimp and crawfish in it. I didn't eat that much of the pasta though it was good. You could also get it served with rice. I could have sworn it said there was chicken in it but maybe not. It was fine. -- edit, it's apparently chicken sausage. . Elise loved her pepper crusted gorgonzola burger ($11.85) and her beer. Maybe I should have kept it simple at the Yard House though I'm really intrigued by their mac and cheese and fried chicken. I was also looking at some chicken garlic noodles Â dish but then remembered where I was. . . It was nice to sit on the patio for our early lunch and our server was cool. They validate and everyone was pretty nice. I have to say though the restrooms are super dark. Not a great place for the kids running around in there.. . I've been to this location one other time and yeah, it's good for fried food and beer.
