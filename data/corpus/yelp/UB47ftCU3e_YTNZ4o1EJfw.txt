yes, yes, yes!  . . Talk about dessert orgasm. . . Oh man.   The banana dulce de leche flavor is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good.  . . We also tried a coffee ice cream sandwich -  the macaroon was excellent.  . . The blue velvet, I give it a thumbs up for creativity (who says velvet cake HAS to be red?)  and it wasn't bad, but wasn't the best.  I think it was unanimous for us, that the banana dulce de leche won our tastebuds over everything else.
