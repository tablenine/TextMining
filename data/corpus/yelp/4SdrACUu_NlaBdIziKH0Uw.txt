I've tried Feed a couple of times, and always had a decent meal. The BBQ chicken sandwich is good, mac and cheese is not as good as you'd expect, and the collerd greans are YUM. I was never blown away by it, but something about this place appeals to me (perhaps the nice people or the eclectic atmosphere), so I've persevered. Â And last weekend, I was rewarded for my efforts. I had the great fortune to finally order....wait for it....the pulled pork sandwich. It pretty much rocked my world. Crazy good. Now that I know what to order, I'll be back much more frequently.. . Oh, and diner (or diner's dinner companion) beware...the cheese grits should really be called garlic grits. They're really good. I'm just sayin'...you may end up sleeping alone.
