I love this place! I've been here so many times and whether its a quick solo lunch at the bar or a 3 AM table for me and my 6 Â best (drunk) friends, they are always accommodating and fast. The food is really pretty good too, and for a diner, they have TONS of vegetarian options. The decor is quirky ,50's diner-esque with pinstriping on the walls and sortof a "drive in" feel to it. The one less star is for the prices, which are a little high in my opinion.
