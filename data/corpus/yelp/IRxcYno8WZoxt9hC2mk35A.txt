I have nothing but great things to say about this place! Sushi-Gen is always packed so reservation is recommended. It's not that expensive. I love sashimi and rolls here, the cut is generous and the fish is fresh and tender. Great place for traditional and authentic Japanese cuisine.. I recommend the sashimi deluxe plate, the UNI is amazing, spicy tuna roll, unagi and salmon.. A MUST for any sashimi - sushi fanatic.
