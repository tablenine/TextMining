Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
What the hell was I thinking when I gave this place a 3-star review?  Yes, there's a wait that's sometimes up to 90 minutes (in my experience - who knows, it could be longer), but it's not "just a hot dog" like some claim.  No, this is greasy bad-for-you goodness on a bun.  Unless you get one of the healthier options...but c'mon, you don't stand in line that long for your health.. . With inventive creations using various condiments, they're sure to have an option to please anybody.  Who else puts nacho cheese and guacamole on a spicy hot dog?  Come with a group of friends, and you'll be surprised how many options you end up coming out with.. . "But I can make this at home!"  Yes, yes you could.  And it'd cost you a lot more money and time to make all the various toppings, and even then I'd bet it wouldn't taste nearly as good as Pink's does.  Go out, buy a pack of premium-quality spicy Polish dogs, some good buns, make guacamole, fry up bacon, make the nacho cheese, grill your onions, and slice your jalapenos - a lot of work for one hot dog, right?. . Their chili fries are the best I've ever had, and I've tried many.  Prices are well worth it, and the line is avoidable if you go at the right times.  Though I wouldn't treat myself to this too often (for fear of my heart giving out), it's definitely a favorite stop.
