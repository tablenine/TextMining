The food is delicious! I ordered the 'matrimonio', a plate with fried plantains, delicious yuca, and roasted potatoes with a big hunk of steak and perfectly flavored chicken breast.  The plate was humongous and I couldnt finish my meal. . . Prices were reasonable and its BYOB.  Also our server was hilarious, I'm not sure of his name.  A must try!
