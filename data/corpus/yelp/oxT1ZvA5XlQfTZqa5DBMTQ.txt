Restaurant: The Highlander
Category: Dive Bars
I think it's true what they say about The Highlander, you can get a contact-drunk from just walking in this place. Probably about the best place you can go to satisfy a group needing different things from a bar. You've got the nice and attentive but smart ass and tattoo laden staff, an awesome menu (try the loaded potato skins but ask them to make it tots instead, YUM!), pool tables, air hockey, golden tee, that bowling game and those wonderful bar-top video machines. Love it here.
