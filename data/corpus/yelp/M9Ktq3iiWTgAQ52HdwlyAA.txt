I've only been to Crustacean for lunch, but it's super yummy! I really like the tiger prawns and garlic noodles - the only this is it doesn't come with any veggies so I like to order a side of veggies to share. I've also heard that they have amazing tofu and the Buddha delight dish is great. It is a bit over priced, but the service was great - friendly wait staff and our meal came fast. Parking can be tough in Beverly Hills, if you don't want to valet, try parking in the free 2 hour public parking lot near by.
