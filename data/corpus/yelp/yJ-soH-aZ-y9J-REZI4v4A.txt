Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
Tank Noodle pho sho! . So luckily I recently befriended some pho lovers. They took me to Tank this weekend and I can see what all the fuss is about. You know it's good when your the only table who doesn't speak fluent Vietnamese.  I had the # 43. Imaging ramin noodles but a million times better. The broth opens your sinuses so make sure you take a minute to breathe it in.  The pieces of beef were so delicious! I also tried a bite of one of their sandwiches. Using my pho broth as a dip of course. The sandwiches are really fresh and the bbq pork that was on it was amazing. Trying to think if my friends played a trick on me because I'm already itching to go back!
