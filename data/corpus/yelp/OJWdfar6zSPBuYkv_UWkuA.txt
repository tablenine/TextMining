This place is worth the wait. It's not your average brunch food. It's lovingly prepared and innovative. This morning I had the strawberry rhubarb brioche french toast. It was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, very satisfying. I think their coffee could use an upgrade. Not sure what beans they're using but it had that stale diner coffee flavor. Despite that, I want to go back and get an omelet.
