The pulled pork sandwich is so good here. This is not the bbq some (like me) might be used to where its basically pork dripped in bbq sauce. This is more of the Carolina style with the vinegar and slaw. The meat is so tender and while I still Â find myself reaching for the bbq sauce, it really truly doesn't need it. (And is still good the next day w/out any sauce!) The fries are nothing special, but the side of slaw is decent, and the plantains are ok. It's really about the pork!
