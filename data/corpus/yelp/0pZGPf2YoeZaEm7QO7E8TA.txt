Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
1st thing to know: shin sen gumi does have sets on sunday. we went on there anniversary when they were offering $3.00 ramen , therefore we were not able to order sets.. 2nd thing to know: NO DESSERTS ON SUNDAYS. 3rd thing... the way you order is confusing. There is no explanation listed anywhere, so don't even try looking.. Just mark it off in each column and remember what row # you are on the list.. Don't get what i'm saying? You'll understand once you see it. . . Gyozas had a strange aftertaste but the filling was still good... . Fried rice was VERY flavorful - and I am a Chinese chick who hates fried rice. . . The ramen itself was quite good. You can order how you want the noodles: soft, al dente, hard. Who the hell would want hard noodles? But anyway. You can also regulate the amount of oil in the broth, how spicy you want it etc. My friends ordered spicy but it wasn't spicy at all, just red. . The broth is still robust though, and I did manage to kill the entire bowl.. . ITADAKIMASU!!!
