Try the ADOBADA ($11).  Maybe cause I'm Asian I want to claim everything has an Asian kick in it, but this dish DOES.  It was delicious.  Eat it while its hot, cause when it gets cold the meat is less tender.. . My friend enjoyed the green corn tamale.  I thought it was kind of dry but it did have a really good sweet flavor. . . Service is SUPER slow, especially when Gloria's children son is not around to manage the computer. Gloria is very friendly and kind though.  Family owned (yay). . Oh and I learned that a pitcher of Sangria for two little ladies is not a good idea.
