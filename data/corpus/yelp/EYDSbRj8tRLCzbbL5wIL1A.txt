Great seafood in Buckhead.  A little bit noisy but the atmosphere was fantastic with the giant fish outside and the great decor inside.  The crabcake as an appetizer was really tasty and filled with crab meat while the bread served during the meal was outta this world.  I don't remember exactly what type of fish i had but it was very tasty especially with the what it came with, which i believe was some asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes.  Very tasty.  Melt in your mouth tasty.  However, not as good as the oceanaire in terms of tastiness but still up there.  For dessert, i believe there was a specail chocolate cake that was really good.  It seems that all of the buckhead group restaurants have great desserts.  Just seems to be the norm.  Great hip spot for anybody wanting some real god seafood.
