(Line for Kogi) .      ------------------.     /_Kogi Truck_\. @__o______o_  iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii(me=sucker)iiiiiiiii (line of people)iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii. . All tacos $2. Burritos $5. Kogi Dog, Kim chi quesadilla, Sliders $5. . What drew me to this insane line:  Hype...Curiosity...a chance to Yelp it..Hunger.. . Ordered:  Kogi Korean rib taco, chicken taco, tofu taco, kogi dog, rib burrito.. . Verdict:  =T portions run small, I agree with other yelpers after the 2nd or 3rd taco everything pretty much tastes the same.  I think what makes it different from any other taco truck is the Kim chi included in allllllllllll of whats on the menu.  You're better off buying kim chi at your local HK store and hitting up a regular taco truck...No Lines!
