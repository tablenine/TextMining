I've been here more times than I can remember.  Still solid. . . Sukiyaki Udon- Back when this was still a 'special winter menu' item, it was priced at $10.99.  A bit steep, but worth every penny- thinly sliced, tasty beef sukiyaki in a soothing broth with udon noodles.  Talk about comfort food.  But now it's made itself a part of the updated menu, and is priced at ~$13 dollars.  That just a bit too steep..... . Tonkotu Ramen- We've always ended up ordering this when we're here, and though we suspect that the pork bone soup has been diluted a bit the last few times, we still crave it.  It's that good.  . . Takoyaki- Fried balls of potato with octopus inside.  We ALWAYS order this when we go.  Total staple in our book.  . . Fatty Tuna Tataki- Not mind blowing- but good.  Pricey.  . . Assorted Kushiyaki (sea salt flavored)- Always a crowd/party pleaser.. . Sausages- Gah...these juicy guys literally "pop" when you bite into them...releasing their fatty goodness onto my tongue and on into my already clogged arteries..... . Uh oh...drooling on the keyboard...time to sign off before I kill my comp.
