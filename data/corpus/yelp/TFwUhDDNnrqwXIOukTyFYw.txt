3 hour wait.. . Do not, I repeat - DO NOT - wear heels.. . Dress warmly and comfortably, as if you were getting ready to stand in line during the depression era. Because that's how may begin to feel: depressed.. . It's surrounded by a cult following of people who ooh and ahh at the deliciousness, the uniqueness, the "best-taco-in-my-life" experience that was just oh-so-worth-it.. . Here's a thought: Go with someone who you want to talk to. Maybe you're trying to land a business deal or have a serious conversastion with someone. This is the perfect way to break down their defenses with desperation, hunger, and a 3-hour lockdown into conversation with you.. . Or go with someone who's character and endurance you are trying to test. Do they ooh and ahh at how "amaaaazing" the tacos were? Does their reaction sound fake? Do they blister at the long wait? Do they cut in line? Bribe the cooks for more than their permitted portion?. . The Koji truck is a tool to test the character of your friends. Use responsibly.
