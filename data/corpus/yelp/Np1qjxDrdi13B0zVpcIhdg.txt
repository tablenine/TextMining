Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Ummm... NO. . . I am all for Korean BBQ, and I really wanted to like Manna, but I have a problem with sitting down at a table that already has a substantial array of food dishes laid out for god knows how long... especially on a particularly warm evening. Outdoors on the patio. Ew. . . I was here for the birthday celebration of a close friend... and if it weren't for how much I heart her, I would have hopped back in the car and ventured down Olympic to find a nearby Del Taco.. . Admittedly, I was starving and did eventually succumb to eating some of the "beef" that was in a bowl, raw, three inches from my face... (gross... why is it so close to me? It smells.)... I had to close my eyes and allow 20 minutes for it to properly char before putting it in my mouth... Sorry, I'm just not into really fatty, thin meat. . . As for the other items on the table - no thanks. I could feel an itch in the back of my throat just LOOKING at it... It was seriously sitting there BEFORE we got there and it was warm outside.
