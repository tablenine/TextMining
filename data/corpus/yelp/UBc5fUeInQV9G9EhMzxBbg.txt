This is truly the best burger in town. You have to order it the way it comes. Period. No changes..... and it's totally worth it! Also, they have an amazing beer selection, although I don't drink. The only reason I gave it four stars is because both locations are a bit far if you live in Hollywood.... but it's definitely worth the drive!
