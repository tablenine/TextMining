Damn you, Ford's. You really only deserve a 2. I shouldn't be giving you that 3, because this is about the overall experience, which was good but not as good as it should have been for all the hype and the interior design of the place. I wanted you to be great, and that was simply not the case. . . I do love the bread, and the menu has some things on it that you don't see many places (ie: beef cheeks). All five of the people I was there with liked their dinner enough, although no one was raving about just how everyone else HAD to try theirs. The service was just as everyone else has described - friendly enough but MIA when it matters and lacking on the check-backs. . . Fords is definitely a nice change of pace for Culver City - it has a much classier feel to it than, say, Ugo or Honey's Kettle. But for the money, I'd have been much happier pretty much anywhere else. But what can I say, I'm a sucker for perfectly cooked scallops, and served over a very buttery dollop of bulgar wheat, they really did push me over the edge for that third star up there.
