Restaurant: Soul Vegetarian 2
Category: Vegetarian
The guys at Soul Vegetarian make me want to be a better cook. Seriously. Every dish that I have tried made me my jaw drop....metaphorically, because it would be kinda weird having food fall out of my mouth. That is to say, the food is phenomenal. Vegan friendly food that is plentiful, tasty and reasonably priced. The service is pretty good and the desert menu is great. . . The parking sucks as you have to park on the street, but you forget about it as soon as that mac n cheese hits your inner lip.
