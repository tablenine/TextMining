Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
Not a fan. Go to the Melrose up the street. Better service, better quality food, and just a better looking diner overall. I don't know what's wrong with Stellas, the wait staff isn't very attentive either. I'll give a star for Gus, who seems like he really cares, but otherwise, nothing stands out here. Sub par menu, sub par service. Just go a block up the street to the Melrose, it's like night and day.
