Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Awesome place near Olvera St. !! Along with your sandwich(es), there are several tempting sides to choose from, including, but not limited to...  coleslaw, macaroni salad, potato salad, chili... oh yum.. and did I mention dessert? They've got it covered (think Boysenberry, Lemon Meringue, Custard Pies, Ice cream, Baked Apples...mm!!)  I love a beef french dip, double dipped  w/ swiss along with a glass of lemonade. Finish it off with a slice of cheesecake. *rubs tummy*  . . . I love the decor. You'll feel like you've stepped back in time.  Near the back of the restaurant there is a little railroad museum. Check it out after lunch :) . . **edit  10/06: Wow this place gets around. Last month, I was hiking in Muir Woods of all places, and I see this guy walking around with a Philippe's Original French Dip T-shirt. Nice.
