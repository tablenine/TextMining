Had an oh-so yummy Chicago dog, and husband had an equally yummy charburger.  We didn't go there after midnight, so we didn't experience any of the rudeness that this place seems to be famous for.  . . I did find a hair on my hotdog bun though, and it kinda grossed me out.    But the rest of the dog was delicious.
