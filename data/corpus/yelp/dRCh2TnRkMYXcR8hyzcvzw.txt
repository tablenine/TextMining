I've been here twice and probably ordered all their small dishes and most of the entrees already. I think there were some real hits on the menu but there were some misses too. Each time, I walked away full but feeling a little underwhelmed by the food. . . Highlights for me were the Salchicha (3 ways), Albondigas, BBQ Squid, and Bacon wrapped dates. My favorite entree was a steak they had as a special. It was a monstrous filet mignon topped with gorgonzola wrapped with bacon. Â  . . I'm not much of a wine drinker but they have a full bar with cool drinks available. Also, I really like the location....it's stumbling distance from the Brickstore.
