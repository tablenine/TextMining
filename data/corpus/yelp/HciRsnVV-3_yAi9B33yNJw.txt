Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
What can I say?. A lot...and I will, so shut the hell up and listen to my typing!. My appetite is enormous. I'm 6ft. 195 pounds of pure muscle. with a perfectly round pot belly. I wear shirts two sizes too small to accentuate it. You can punch me in the pot belly. Wait, what the hell was I talking about? Sorry. I just watched Pulp Fiction on DVD this morning for breakfast. Back to the review: Roscoe's is an amazing place. It isn't hyped up. You get good chicken and great waffles. I would get my smoke on with whatever girl called me first. And then we'd cruise over and never have to wait for a table. Let's just say I've helped the owner with some deals over the years.. I sit down. Make sure the hot sauce is present.. Drink a big ass glass of kool-aid.. Then devour the entire plate.. For desert I enjoy getting a nice back massage. after sharing a bubble bath with what's her name.. This place gives me that certain energy.. Mmmmmm. Damn. It's time to hit that place up again!
