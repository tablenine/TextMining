You're from the OC, you drove two hours, and you had to wait.  Blah, blah, blah.  Save your whining for someone who cares.  Don't leave the SGV gene pool behind and knock the food.  DTF dumplings really are good, and they really are some of the best around.  However, like all things in life, try to be sensible.  Don't go out of your way and expect perfection.  You are in SGV; save your service rants for a demographic that cares.  Service can be cranky, and the wait can be atrocious.  You just need to work around all of it; get used to the way DTF works.  Think about it: don't come in large parties, don't come at busy times, don't wait outside w/o filling out your order sheet, don't ask for ice water or forks, etc.  My typical order is pork XLB and the fried nian gao (like a glutinous rice-cake and veggie stir fry).  I also try to get a sauteed vegetable dish, and the veggie options change, depending on the season.  I come here every time I come home from SF; i get pretty serious DTF withdrawal.
