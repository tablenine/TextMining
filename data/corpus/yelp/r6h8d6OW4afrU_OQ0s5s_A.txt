Restaurant: Trader Vic&#39;s
Category: Hawaiian
The decorations are fun . . . the menu lists rum barrels (or alcohol soup as we like to call it), there are dames of flame . . .there are tons of elements that could make trader vic's awesome, but it is still a hotel bar wearing an exotic cape. The staff is blah, the music is barely audible and awful. With a lot of people to just take the place over, it could be awesome . Â . but something has got to be done about the music. It is just wierd. Wierd. be careful, the chi chis could send you into a diabetic coma.
