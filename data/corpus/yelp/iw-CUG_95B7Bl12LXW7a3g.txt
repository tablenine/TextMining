I'm not really a big burger fan but I love that I don't have to have a cow burger in order to fit in with the rest of my lunch crew...I usually go for the buffalo because animals that were once nearly wiped off the face of the . earth tastes so much better (kidding) and also it's leaner than even CHICKEN...i mean when does that happen?!  I also love the fact that I have so many side choices...not just 1,000 ways to do a potato.  I struggled between fried plantains and sweet potato fries but since I ate fried plantains for dinner the night before, I went for the latter.  Now, the Vortex has this reputation that you better mind your bar etiquette or the wait staff might just stab you in the neck with their pens so I was a little hesitant to tell our waitress that I had ordered sweet potato fries instead of regular fries...but I did tell her and she quickly resolved the issue, even calling me "sweety" when she brought me out a bowl of hot crispy sweet potato fries - the BEST I'd EVER had!  And we were in and out in about an hour with our group of like 9 or 10 so we still made it back before the bosses got suspicious...SOLID.
