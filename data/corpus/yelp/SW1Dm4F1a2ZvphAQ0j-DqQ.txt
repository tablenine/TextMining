Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Came here on a weekend right after I ate at Gyu Kaku. Wasn't hungry but Apple Pan was bookmarked for months and had to try it since I was in the 'hood.. . Was lucky enough to get a table as soon as I got in and street parking right outside. Like everyone already said, old fashioned counters and seats. The server was super nice and our food came out very quickly. . . Ordered the Hickory Burger and Banana Cream pie. The burger was smaller than expected but that little thing had a lot of flavor. Loved the smokiness and the hickory sauce. The burger was decent but definitely not the best burger I've eaten. . . The banana cream pie was good, whipped cream was good. The bananas were starting to brown and the custard was sweet and thick. The crust was pretty thin and not as good as I expected. Still a decent cream pie, but definitely had better (The House of Pies!).. . Oh, and cash only. Realized this after I saw their cash registers. Didn't have cash on me so my friend spotted me. THANKS friend! lol
