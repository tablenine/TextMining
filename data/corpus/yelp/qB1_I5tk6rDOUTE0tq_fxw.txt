Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Anyone who likes prime rib will love this place.  If your from SF, you'll find it comparable to House of Prime Rib, maybe not quite as good (sorry Karin), but still really good.  My girlfriend took me here recently for my bday dinner.  This time I tried the surf and turf.  The lobster was good, but prime rib is what they do best here.  In fact, their menu is not very extensive: prime rib, fish is just about all they do.  For sides, can't beat the cream corn and mashed potatoes are great as well.  Even they're birthday cake (strawberry) is moist and delicious.  The horse radish is a little weak but the au jus rules.  oh, and don't forget the meatballs if you are really hungry while waiting for your table to be ready.. . The staff is very helpful and courteous, although I don't understand why the carvers wear the gold medallions....did they make meat carving an Olympic event?
