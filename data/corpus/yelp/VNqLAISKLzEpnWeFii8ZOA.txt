A spartan industrial place that relies on its food to sell itself.. . and for one meal we had there it succeeded. . . The seating appears to be an afterthought, a bar along the front window, and several shop sized tables that tend to force you to share your meal with the other customers.. . Its a bakery, so the meals are limited to sandwiches, pastries, and desserts. Â And it's a true bakery so much of its business will be loaves walking out the door.. . In all this is a positive addition to the ever growing midtown culinary scene.
