Restaurant: Belly Shack
Category: Latin American
casual with a little bit of fancy.... i think that's how best to describe the food (but not so much the ambiance) of belly shack.  as far as ambiance, i'd go for "industrial" and "sleek".   and most items are served in fast food baskets.. this is definitely fusion at its best without too much con-fusion.  simple flavors made complex by adding some asian flavor to asian ingredients (and vice versa).  my grilled tofu/brown rice was softly seasoned with black beans and a sweet marinade and sandwiched between (2) crispy plantain slices.  i loved how i could make out all of the tastes and textures - nothing was too overpowering.  i agree with some other yelpers though, grab a fork and knife - this got messy.   one word of caution though is that the plantain slices will fill your belly fast.  i couldn't even finish my beloved tostones (huge pieces and perfectly toasted).  the ice cream sounds WAY more exciting on paper (though fellow diner-friends really raved about their bacon topped ice cream!).  i'd head to DQ instead.. . one thing that was confusing... there is pic of a hot dog on the site but it's not offered at the restaurant?  does their menu change?
