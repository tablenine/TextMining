I don't know...I just don't get this place.  . . Pork belly is the best thing I ate here and that doesn't make sense for what is supposed to be a phenominal sushi place.  I liked the bombs, didn't love them.  Some of them had a fishy, un-fresh taste that skeeves me out.  . . Prices are pretty high if you want a decent-sized meal.  . . Pluses, aside from the pork belly, are the great decor/ambiance and service.  The food is really lacking crisp freshness and innovation, though, and for me, that's what a restaurant is supposed to be all about.  I'd much rather spend a few extra dollars for some delicious Omakase at Gari in Manhattan. Or head down the block to Fiore for unbelievably delious and inexpensive Italian food.
