ill give ya an update.  went there w/ my lil cuz jenni on a wednesday afternoon (like noon-noon).  surprised there was like 4 patrons there. thought itd be hella packed.  (it did get more busy tho at about 1pm)... anyway, jenni and i both got the toffeecoffee milkshake, we split a ooeygooey chocolate cookie (is that what it is called? it definietly aint ooey nor gooey, but it was SUPER RICH AND dense. GOOD stuff.) while waiting for our Pulled Pork Sandwich (Medianoche), which was pretty darn pork-tastee, and NOT dripping w/ greeeeeese all over my arms like last time..., then they brought out our  chocolate croissant bread pudding a-la-mode.  it was warm, was NOT GOOD at all, rubbery.  . . conclusion: come in the afternoons for a meal here, anything after 4-5 stuff gets old sittin out.  this is why good bakeries usually close @ 3-4 (unless they are replenishing stuff all day, which i really doubt milk does)
