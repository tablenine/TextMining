Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Manna....AYCE Korean BBQ......the meat is whatevers.....the service is whatevers......BUT......Manna is great for big groups.  Try to make reservations though especially on the weekends.. . Don't bother taking a shower before you go.  You come out stinking pretty badly.  Girls....make sure to tie your hair up if possible.....
