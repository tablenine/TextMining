My husband declared his challah french toast the best he had every had.  It arrived looking absolutely beautiful with its cascade of berries and dusting of powdered sugar.  He had asked for the whiskey maple syrup as a substitute for the plain syrup.  It was very tasty and I kept sneaking bites off of his plate.  . . My meatloaf sandwich was good as well, but I never knew meatloaf could be sliced so thin.  I would have appreciated a slightly more filling serving.  . . The prices were surprisingly low for such a charming restaurant. However, the seating was uncomfortable.  The two-person tables are just folding tray tables covered with a tablecloth.  There was no comfortable place to place our legs under the table.
