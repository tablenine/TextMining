Ask me what L.A's main food staple is!  Is it hotdogs?  Is there L.A. pizza?  Maybe there's a Hollywood Carne Asada burritto out there somewhere, but if you ask me, it's California Rolls!. . It's the only food item that even incorporates a locale into its name, as opposed to the ubiquitous LA street taco?  In n Out is just one chain.  So I digress.... . Well I was in the middle of a good review until my co-worker came in and asked me for stuff, so I've gotta keep this short and say, the sashimi, tuna and salmon pieces were great.  I love to order handrolls, and their's did not let me down.. . See you later kids.
