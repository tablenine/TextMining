Way over-hyped.  We live in the neighborhood, so were excited to be able to walk over.  We'd been hearing so much buzz we decided to meet some friends there at 5:30 pm on a Saturday to beat the crowd.. . I ordered iced tea and was told they were out.  My partner ordered a Diet Coke and was told they were out.  No explanation, no apologies, no suggestion of another beverage.  How could a restaurant be out of something at 5:30 on a Saturday?. . When I ordered my burger, I asked for it to be prepared medium and was told they cook them medium rare.  Period.  That was my only choice.  I asked what was on the truffle burger and was told meat, cheese, truffle oil, and bread.  I ordered the truffle burger, and it was tasty, but at $11 for just the burger, I expected a bit more.  The four onion rings I got for an extra $3 were better than the eight french fries my partner got (also for an extra $3).  At the end of the evening, everyone shrugged and came to the same conclusion:  it was good, but.... . While the food was okay, the overall dining experience was infuriating and disappointing.  I really wanted to like this place, but I won't be back.  There are plenty of burger joints in this town.
