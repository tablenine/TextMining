The other 500+ yelpers pretty much reviewed every aspect of this joint.  I think I'll sum it up into two words: the shiznit.. . Dude.  Duuuuuude.  So much deliciousness is to be had.  It was funny that I wasn't even hungry when I came here.  I only planned to meet some friends for drinks.  But once I entered.... all the sights and smells seduced me.  . . I had the duck bacon and jalapeno sausage with grilled onions and sweet peppers.  I shared groot with my partner in crime and we both had Aspall ciders to wash it all down.  I think this is the first time my boyfriend has experienced multiple foodgasms.  I also shared similar moments.  It was surprising we didn't  smoke a couple of ciggies after all that savory satisfaction.. . I thought the tasting sensations would be over.  But for whatever reason, we found some room for dessert.  We each had the ice cream sandwich consisting of toasted apple pie ice cream inbetween two oatmeal raisin cookies.  It's crazy, but I think their sandwich was better than coolhaus.  The cookies were super moist and chewy and the apple pie ice cream just personified summer.. . I shall return!
