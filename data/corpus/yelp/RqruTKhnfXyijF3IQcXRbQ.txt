Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
My friend took me there one day and honestly, I didn't like it much my first time.  Place wasn't that clean (although relatively to other places in Chinatown, it was decent.  Com'on, don't give me crap about me saying that stuff about Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.  You all know it.  JK) and food looked so plain that I pretended that I was eating and pretty much went home and fixed myself a sandwich.  And I didn't like the smell either.. . But damn, for some odd reason, I kept thinking about it and the next time I went...HOLY COW!  What was I thinking before?  It's one of the best noodle soup I have ever had (I am actually salivating as I am writing this).  And it's freaking cheap, too!. . Don't forget to try roasted pork with rice.  That was good, too.
