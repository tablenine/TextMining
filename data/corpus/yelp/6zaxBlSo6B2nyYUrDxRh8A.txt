Whoever said food can't make you happy (my therapist) was so incredibly  wrong!  I just polished off some veggie tacos and chips w/ guacamole.  Being from Texas, I realize I have to lower my Mexpectations for Chicago.  ( get it?  Mexican+expectations...)  Okay, I know... anyway, it could be the mediocre house white wine I had before my meal, but the tacos were fantastic!  3 filling tacos+ 1 side of your choice (in my case, garlic spinach) for 8 bucks isn't half bad.  I realize I am also paying for the ambiance which is incredibly cozy.  The chips were a bit thicker than I like, but were still good.  The guacamole was different but delicious.  I will be back again and again.  Check it out-great find!  I can't wait to try out their brunch!
