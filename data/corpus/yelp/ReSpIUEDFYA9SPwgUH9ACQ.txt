On a lazy Saturday afternoon I walked here from a blessed friends house.  Designer and Creater of Stalyon Clothing line.  . . He said it was a place he hasn't been yet, but has been having some good reviews.  So we walked in, ordered at the counter, grabbed a number, and sat ourselves.  The Shanghai salad tasted Thai inspired....hmmm?  yeah.  But it was good.  His sandwhich was yummy and the desserts looked amazing!  Especially all the different frozen treats..not sure if it was gelato or icecream.. . The atmosphere was clean, minimalist, and cold.  The outside seating was awesome....traffic noise and no plant life.  The bathroom is unisex and he was gone FOREVER waiting in line.  . . It was cute...nothing TOO special though.
