Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
OK, I must not have drunk the Fat Matt's Kool Aid as I don't fully understand the appeal. The ribs were falling off the bone, yes, so I agree with many of the reviewers who say they are tender, but to my palate, they were so greasy- blech. . . Also, I was not a fan of the plain squishy white Wonder-type bread that was served with the meals. To me, it just doesn't enhance the flavors of the meat or sides etc. its only redeeming feature is that it does serve as a good mop for the admittedly delicious sauce! . . Give me crisp but tender/ buttery/ decadent garlic toast any day over the plain white bread and especially give me sliced boneless meat or pulled pork etc vs. the difficult and messy to eat greasy ribs at Fat Matts...
