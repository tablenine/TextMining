Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
Fat Matt's has a reputation for having the best ribs in Atlanta.  I would say it's a tie between Fat Matt's and Maddy's but Maddy's is in Decatur so I guess technically, you could say Fat Matt's has the best ribs in Atlanta.  This place deserves it's reputation.
