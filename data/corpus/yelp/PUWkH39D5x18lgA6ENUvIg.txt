After a long day at the Red Bull Soapbox Races we found this place. It was incredible! We loved the space, friendly service, open kitchen, and quality ingredients. It was refreshing to have a nice meal without any pretentious snobs serving it or sitting near you.. . My Penne Gamber was delicious. The shrimps were generous and the sauce was perfect.. . My husband had the Trenne'. He loved the braised prime rib eye.. . For dessert we took home mini lemon tarts and berry tarts. The filling was subtly sweet. Everything was delicious and the presentation very rewarding. Including, the hot maitre d' in his nice suit!
