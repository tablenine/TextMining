I have found my French Toast heaven in LA. I LOVE French Toast and Comme Ca...oh wow, oh wow, oh wow.. . If you love French Toast as much as I do, look no further than the third item down on the breakfast/brunch menu...Pain Perdu...creme brulee French Toast with caramely burnt sugar crystalized over custard, thick slices of bread dusted with powdered sugar and a drizzle of maple syrup. Mmmmmm....so goooood it melts in your mouth. Its dessert for breakfast.. . With breakfast this good, I can't wait to come back and enjoy lunch and dinner. The only drawback is the dining room does get a bit loud.. . Thanks, Ms. Denita.
