Restaurant: FOX Sports Grill
Category: Sports Bars
A friend and I went to Fox Sports Grill after watching SATC2 at Atlantic Station. She had a gift certificate so we settled on eating there after the movie.. . I wasn't impressed. This is supposed to be a nice sports bar, but the seats were in bad news of reupholstering. I'm not sure how you have leather seats that are torn up and expect for people to take your business seriously. It's the little things to me.. . Moving on to the food and drinks. I ordered a bowl of chill and a salad. My lettuce was limp and my chili tasted like it just came from a can.. . Our server, God bless his heart, was a sweet as he could be. However, either he was new or waiting is just not for him. We had to remind him that we ordered an appetizer after we noticed that he probably wasn't going to bring it, after we were almost done with our meals.. . Overall, "meh!"
