I wasn't sure to go with three or four stars, but decided to round up because I appreciate all the effort that has gone into making a good restaurant experience. We've been there four or five times with different people, and the general agreement by all is that the food is pretty good but short of outstanding. Why keep going then, especially with better, similar food around the corner at Colori? There's a lot going for Bottega outside of the food and I'll make a short list. First, it's a beautiful space, period. Many reviewers have raved about it, so I'll move on. The service is attentive: they're not short on staff in the front or the back of the house, that's for sure. Another plus is that the menu is diverse enough for anyone to find something they like, which can be important when going out with larger groups of people. There is no corkage, which is always a good thing. They're trying hard to provide you with a good restaurant experience. I've been places that don't seem to give a shit if you're happy or not, so the effort is important. Finally, prices, outside of Osso Buco, are incredibly reasonable, and not at all what one might expect looking at all that shiny white marble. . . Virbila of the LA Times recently gave it one and a half stars, which doesn't sound as if she fell in love with it. It doesn't seem her review has diminished business at all, and she neglected to mention the lack of corkage. Walking by on the way to Seven Grand I always see a packed house, which means they must be doing something right.
