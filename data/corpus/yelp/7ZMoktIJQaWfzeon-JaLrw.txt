We've been here several times and have always experienced warm and friendly service.  I even biked there once on my pink cruiser bike from downtown-ha! Don't judge me- I bought it on impulse on craigslist.  . . We went again this weekend and had the following:. . The crispy tofu dish w/ brown rice (with cole slaw salad (no dressing- just the way I like it) - this tofu is sooo yummy. I wish I knew how to make it.  My girls (ages 4 and 5) shared it and they ate everything! . . The sautéed eggplant w/ brown rice and bok choy instead of cole slaw - this is one of my favorite dishes.  The eggplant is addictive (it's sweet) but it's nice to share so you don't get eggplant overload. . . The shrimp (grilled?)- was incredibly yummy.. . The grilled salmon on black rice was a little dry- we'll stick to the cod curry next time.. . For appetizers we had the crab/avocado fresh roll which is good but not a must try- I'm not a fan of the aioli.. . For dessert (we were there celebrating) we had: the fried banana (wooowza I don't even like dessert and this was sooo good), the bread pudding w/ homemade ice cream, and the chocolate ice cream.  . . Everything was very good and satisfying...
