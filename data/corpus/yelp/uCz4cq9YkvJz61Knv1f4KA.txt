Sorry to beat a dead horse here, but the Hainan chicken rice...that shit be bangin'.  For me, what really makes it are the dipping sauces that they give you; the finely chopped ginger and the creamy chili paste mix to form some sort of otherworldly ambrosial liquid CRACK.  Luckily for us, they give you free refills on the sauces, so don't be shy on asking for another sweet, sweet fix.. . Another dish that justly deserves my lavish praise is their baked halibut with cream sauce, because I am a huuuge creamy cheesy junkie.  For cream sauce fiends like me, Savoy's version is miles better all those other Hong Kong style cafes out there due to the extra richness and cheesiness of the cream sauce.  I'm borderline lactose intolerant, but the devil himself can't keep me away from Savoy.. . As a side note, be prepared to park pretty far away unless you're just really lucky (no parking lot, only street parking), and be prepared to wait...
