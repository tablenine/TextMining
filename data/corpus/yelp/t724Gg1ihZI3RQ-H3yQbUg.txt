Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
When we decided on Buckhead Diner for our monthly dinner club spot I had several enthusiastic responses.  Some had been there and were excited to go back and others had heard about it and couldn't wait to try it out.  We were there on a Wednesday night so it wasn't super busy, but there was a decent dinner crowd.  The atmosphere is fun, "diner" style but with whit linen table cloths.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  Dinner was amazing and we really enjoyed the 1/2 price bottles of wine.  The only negative was from a friend of mine who does not eat red meat and dubs herself as "picky."  She felt that there were a lot of meat options, but not much else for a diner like herself.  But, she had the Mahi Mahi (as did most of us) and really enjoyed it.  . . Speaking of the mahi mahi, it was perfect.  Perfectly cooked fish on Parmesan cheese grits served on a tostada w/ guacamole and a mole sauce.  Yum!
