Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Hide has fantastic sushi.  I really enjoy that they have a tradition of serving consistently fresh fish and if you're sitting at the bar, they serve the sushi in the appropriate order.  Honestly, I enjoy it better than most sushi places in LA.  But something is off... I don't think it'll ever be my favorite restaurant despite how good the food is, and I think I figured it out.  . . This place could be the McSorley's of sushi.  McSorley's is one of the old school Irish pub institutions of NYC.  Tons of people want to drink there... but if you're not drinking, they will let you know that you're WEAK and throw you out so that the next guy can come in and pay down money for drink.  That's just the way it is, and they can get away with it. . . Hide won't throw you out... but they won't go out of their way to make the place comfortable for you to want to stay unless you're eating non stop.  It's the little things.  The sushi bar is jammed tight.  When I was seated... I was seated in some guy's lap.  It was awkward, because I came in with a girl.  For beer, they offer Asahi or Suntory, but they don't have the big bottles.  What!?  Really?   Oh yeah... and if you ask for a bottle of sake, the only have small bottles of sake... Do you people know that you're supposed to be a Japanese restaurant?  I get it... If I'm there, I should be doing more eating than drinking... and I'll pay more ordering little bottles instead of the big ones... I get it.. . I gave it 4 stars because it tastes so good, but it should really be 3 1/2 stars b/c of these quirks.  I think it's a little obnoxious, but they do it because they can get away with it.  And they can get away with it because the food is so good.
