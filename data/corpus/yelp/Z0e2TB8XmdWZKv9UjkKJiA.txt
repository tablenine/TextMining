Can I just say how awesome this place is for vegetarians? It sucks to go to so many nice restaurants around the city and only have a couple options. Here there's an entirely separate menu, with lots of yummy stuff to choose from. We particularly loved the sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes and the delicata squash tart. My bf is veg, but I'm actually pescatarian, and I really enjoyed the scallops. Like, I'm still dreaming about them and my mouth is watering as I type this. Mmmmm.. . We went on a Friday night at 8, so we expected it to be crowded... They told us it'd be a 1-1.5 hour wait, so we went down the street to Abilene, had some cheap beers, played some Connect Four and Battleship. Since we were busy with the games, the time flew by and within an hour Buttermilk had given us a call and we were seated. . . I'd definitely like to go back here and try more dishes. I'm sure they're delish.
