Having been here twice - I stand by my solid 3* rating. The food is above average - fresh and delicious pasta, nice pizzas, but nothing to *wow* about. And this is not a cheap place to hit. The decor reminds me of an italian pottery barn. Rustic, yet trendy. Do not come here if you expect to have a quiet dinner with a girlfriend to catch up on the latest gossip. This place can get LOUD. As for the service, I thought our server (coincidentally the same waitress both times) was great. Just the right amount of checking back to see if we needed anything. What I appreciated was her recommendations on what to try - depending on which chef was at the helm. She steered us correctly to the gnocci. Like pillowy clouds. mmmmmm.
