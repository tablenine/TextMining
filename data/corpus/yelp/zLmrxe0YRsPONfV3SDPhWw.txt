I mean to date I haven't had sausages greater than Wurstkuche.  They are exotic sausages: duck, alligator, buffalo, rabbit, rattle snack.. you name it! They also have vegetarian sausages available. Choose your own toppings: sauerkraut, onions, jalapenos, peppers.. . . Located in downtown Los Angeles - surprisingly, easy parking. This hidden gastropub has an awesome beer selection. You walk in and think it's a small dine-in or take out place. However, as you walk down the hallway towards the bathroom, you will start to hear loud conversations and laughters in the back. Around the corner - many seating areas and a long stretched bar area. It's got the vibe like Father's Office, gastropub burger joint (located in Santa Monica and Culver City). It is a little pricey; price for 2 including fries, beer and tip, approx. $50. . . Definitely a place I would visit when I'm in the area. I would also go out of my way (I live in OC so approx. 30 mile-drive) to come here if I'm ever craving sausages. haha
