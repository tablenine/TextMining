pretty good japanese tapas place.. . i let my friend order since she had a 'go to list' from her resident japanese expert.  we ordered like 5 dishes.  the memorable ones:. . this batter fish pastry with cheese whiz inside served with a light ponzuish type sauce - super yummy. . the chicken wings - small but perfectly fried and what the heck did they do to this, dump MSG on it?  super good. . another chicken dish - this was kind of like an orange chicken type of dish very good as well.. . the forgetables - halibut, meh no real flavor to this one, the eggplant was OK, and I think we had one more.. . Overall stick w/ the chicken but im sure theres other things that are yummy here.  definitely would come back
