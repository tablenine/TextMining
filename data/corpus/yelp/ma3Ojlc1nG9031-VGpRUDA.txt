Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
No Thai Elvis last night, but pretty happy to get some decent Thai food in LA.  The westside seems to have the worst Thai food ever.  . . It's a decorated cafeteria - you're there to hang with your friends and eat some food - it's not going to be a knock your socks off authentic experience, but decent.   There was a lady singing different songs in lieu of Elvis - but mostly ignored by the crowd. . . We were in a group of 6 and only had to wait 20 minutes to get seated.  We had glass noodles salad (spicy &amp; good), chicken red curry (creamy &amp; delicious), tom yum soup with shrimp (nice decent sized shrimp with straw mushrooms), pad thai (just okay), pineapple fried rice (okay - not enough curry &amp; onion flavor).  But the best dish was the steamed fish with lime sauce.  Yum!  The lime sauce was the perfect mix of sweet, tangy, salty, and spicy to put on top of the steamed fish - I was super happy. . . Valet parking in the back for $2.50 this time.
