It's so not gourmet, but every now and then over the past 15 years I just need to go have some brown rice, that awesome carrot dressing, and the soy burger dinner platter (comes with the above). Occasionally I go nuts and get the hijiki burger dinner. I used to get a slice of cheese on the soy burger--whoa. Tonight might be one of those Dojo nights. Hearty, healthy, filling, cheap. I wasn't sad to see the other Dojo location go because it was really nasty, but this one is OK looks-wise for a dive, "health food" (ish), counterculture restaurant (they grow their own bean sprouts in planters out front, c'mon!).
