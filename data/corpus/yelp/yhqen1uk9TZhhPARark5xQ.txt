I usually don't write a review if it's not for 5 stars or 1 but this time I had to give it 4 stars.  This place is FANTASTIC and I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the stupid waiter who tried to talk my friend and I out of ordering a most wonderful eggplant caponata.  He said that unless we're authentic Itanlians that we would not like it.  He also said that he's an honest waiter and that's why he was trying to talk us out of buying it.  Lame!. . My friend and I didn't eat in the restaurant so I can't say anything about that, but the bar area pretty much sucked.  They never really even paid attention to us and no one knew about the food.  The people who sell the pre-made stuff are AWESOME!  They were so friendly and nice and knew everything about the food.  LOVE LOVE LOVE them!  If I was rating them alone, it would have been 5 stars, for sure!. . Definitely have the eggplant caponata!  It's delicious!  I loved the portobello fries too.  My friend thought it was alright but I couldn't get enough.  ^_^  We also had the meatballs and mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese we had cold because we got it from the pre-made area and the waitress wouldn't heat it up for us.  It's how they do.  So just know that all the pre-made stuff is mostly for taking to go because they're all cold.  But the mac and cheese was still great.  Ke ke.  . . Presentation is key and everything in this place is decorated so nicely.  It's simple but fantastical.  I love the bathroom.  Gold on white is beautiful.  Who knew?  Not I.
