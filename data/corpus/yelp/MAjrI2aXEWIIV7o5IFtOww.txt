Was at Toro again lats night, delicious as always. Just wanted to offer a few recent things of note / insider tips.. . 1. There's a new special roll - Watchamacallit, delicious. One of my new favorites.. . 2. Mitch has started taking Tuesdays off (he deserves it), he said he will probably go back to working Tuesdays when the weather starts to warm up but for now don't expect to see him on Tuesdays. Don't worry, the food is still just as delicious and the other chefs can fill in adequately but if you want to see the star of the show, he's not working Tuesdays for now.. . 3. Business has already started to ramp up after the typical restaurant slow season that is Jan/Feb. Friday and Saturday of this weekend they stopped adding names to the list before 8pm and they seat till 10. 1 of the waitresses mentioned most people put their names down starting around 6 because that's when they start to get busy and Mitch told me business is starting to pick back up so I don't expect this trend to get any better. Just keep this in mind, go early or go on off days (read: not Fri/Sat).
