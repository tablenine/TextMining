Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
I have been to Roy's before, but I just went for the first time in Chicago. This really is so good that I can't believe it's a chain restaurant! I had the duck when I was there the other night and i've been craving it ever since! The fixed menu for $35 (???) looked like quite a deal as well so I'll have to try that next time!
