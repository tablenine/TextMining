I've only been after the bar, so that is the disclaimer.  . . Aside from that, I have to say the experience is completely insane and totally entertaining.  First of all, the line is long and full of drunken folks.  Second of all, if you are lucky someone will order a chocolate milkshake, and you will get quite the show.  Finally, the hot dogs themselves (the actual dogs) are so tasty.  I have only gotten the charred dog with mustard, but it is all I could ask for.  My friends have tried to get the dog Chicago-style, with all the goodies, but those are just too complicated.  I haven't seen anyone order one and be completely satisfied, or even mostly satisfied.  Apparently, they have a really good veggie burger, too, but I was too distracted with my own item to give it a try.  Hands down best hot dog I've had in Chicago... ever.
