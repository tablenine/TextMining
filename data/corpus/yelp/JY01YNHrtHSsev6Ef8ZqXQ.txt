Great diner for a late night bite, especially if you're downtown, Silverlake or Los Feliz. Lots of memories here over the past two years. Good selection of appetizers, burgers, and kind of kitsch Asian and Mexican fare. I really love their mac daddy 'n' cheese balls, the breakfast enchiladas, the Tower of Babel (a vegetarian club sandwich, huge, I'd get someone to share), and the Strawberry Beret (a huge waffle with powdered sugar, whipped cream and strawberries). The tofu "huevos rancheros" are pretty good too, but you really have to be in the mood for soft tofu. The milkshakes are really, really yummy but they only have 3 or 4 flavors (Cafe 50's is much better in terms of variety). I'm partial to the half-banana, half chocolate milkshake I always get. I don't think the noodle soups are particularly great though. If I wanted Asian food, I'd much rather hit up the late night soon tofu houses in K-Town.. . The place has a hipster/punk rock vibe where the service wears black t-shirts with provocative sayings and fishnet stockings, unlike other late night spots in L.A. like Canter's or Mel's on Sunset (more traditional diners or delis). It really sets the place apart. I think the food is much better here, but over-priced for a diner. If I just want eggs and a side of toast at 3 a.m. in the morning, I'd much rather be at Canter's, or better yet, Izzy's Deli in Santa Monica.
