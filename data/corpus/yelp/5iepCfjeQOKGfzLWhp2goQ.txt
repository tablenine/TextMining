I look across at my two girlfriends and both of their eyes lit up when they took their first bite because it is just that good.  Yes, the burgers and sweet potato fries are pretty excellent.  The bad part was the burgers are as is so you can't take anything out if you are allergic.  . . I don't like the concept of having to wait for tables on your own.  . . Came here on a Saturday night at around 730pm and it was SOOOO CROWDED.  We did find parking pretty easily so that was a plus.  Waited about 10 minutes to get in like a nightclub line and then about 30 minutes to get a table.  A few friends had to wait and pretty much stare at people eat until they finished so they had a place to reserve for us.. . Maybe on a weekday or earlier time I'd be happier here.  Other than that, I really liked the burger and fries.  Cute soda pop bottles too.  . . TIP: Just stand and wait or be aggressive to grab a table.
