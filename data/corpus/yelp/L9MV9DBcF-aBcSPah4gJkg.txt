One of my friends has a brunch addiction to Watershed. I'd been really wanting to try this for a while, so was excited to lunch here this week!  . . The space is beautiful - classic contemporary with lots of bluegreen tones, and supercool photography place mats.  We were there at an off time, around 2 p.m., so it wasn't very busy. But I can just envision the space filled with happy diners prepping their palates for the new Southern cuisine here. . . Their mantra is 'organic,' which comes through in the honest tastes and preparation of the food. I had the crazy sounding okra pancakes - just as the waiter described, these taste nothing like fried okra, but are pieces of okra embedded in cornmeal. Pretty good, but next time I'll go all out Southern and dip 'em in ranch dressing.. . Also on the menu is the 'collection of Southern cheeses,' which I'd be interested to try (never really thought about US regional cheese. . . ) and the hot vegetable plate.. . I'll be back for that fried chicken and brunch!
