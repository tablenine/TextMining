Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's is good but doesn't live up to the hype. The line gets insane, which would be fine if the hotdogs were supermega amazing but they're not. One thing that is amazing is the huge variety. It's like the mall of hotdogs. I don't so much like eating there, either. It's so bright, like office lighting bright. You sit on those ugly, white plastic chairs we all had when we lived in the hood and were broke. Skip the line and go to Carney's or get a hotdog from a street vendor.
