Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
We ordered a cemita milanesa, a cemita carne asada, a taco arabe, and a jamaica drink. The taco arabe and cemita milanesa were brought out to us first. The taco arabe is a must-have. It's not big so we finished that in a few bites. . . The cemita milanesa was ok - it reminded me of a cubano, but it was missing the papalo herb that we were really looking forward to trying (see the youtube video on . http://cemitaspuebla.com. ). . . When the woman who brought us our food came around, we told her we were still missing the carne asada. 10 minutes after we finished our milanesa they still hadn't brought us the carne asada, so I went up to the register to ask them - they had obviously forgotten it. Less than a minute after I sat down the woman brought us the cemita carne asada. Not as good as the milanesa, and I think they chop up the meat into pieces too small (like chopped onions).. . Overall I think it's good to try if you've never had it before, but the location's not the easiest to get to (we had to take two buses to get there - a little more than 30 minutes), so we don't see ourselves going back for it.
