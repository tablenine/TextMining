Hey, I had a good time here!  The special of the day, Seared Albacore Nicoise, was tasty and my Pinot worked out alright.  Fine, fine, fine I'll dish some funny out.... . So I met a friend here for dinner/drinks.  A normal person with half a brain could probably tell that we were not on a date but the hostess tried to seat us in "the pews" as we called it, side by side.  We opted out.. . Almost forgot!  Prior to this, the hostess asked if I had reservations which appeared to be a robotic response.  I look around and saw 10 or 12 empty tables.  I was tempted to call a timeout and bench the girl for attempting a delay of game foul.. . After we got our table and settled in, the server hounded my friend 3 or 4 times for another drink.  Her glass was still half full.. . Service was either aggressive or non-existent.  I'm pretty sure tripping your server is acceptable in this situation.. . So I agree, they need some work here, however the design of the place and the food I have had was good. Oh yeah the prices suck and I tipped accordingly. ;-)
