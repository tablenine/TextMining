Restaurant: Across the Street
Category: Mexican
David is not a huge fan of Mexican food but wanted to eat something different today.  I suggested we go back to Across the Street since we haven't been here for dinner and I was craving on drinking some white sangria (definitely the best place to get em!).  We were quickly seated outside on the patio and it was beautiful.  Nice park view and a great patio to relax!. . Our waitress was awesome and she was not only fun to talk to but had really great suggestions on what to order on the menu.  We started off with this corn on the cob topped with cheese.  It was way better that I expected it to be...simple yet flavorful!  I ordered the sweet potato enchiladas and David got the veggie fajitas.  I enjoyed the sweet potatoes...it was light and I did not feel overly full.  David loved the fajitas...it has a medley of corn, sweet potatoes, spinach, plantains, tomatoes and red peppers.  Of course I had to try it myself and I loved it.. . At the end of our meal, we had the chance to meet Allie, who is one of the owners of Across the Street.  She was soooo sweet and nice and she even told us about their bi-monthly t-dance on the patio!  Being the good gay boys we are...we are definitely going to check that out!  We definitely need to have a happy hour here with all the yelpers...good times!
