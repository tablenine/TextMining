Other than a few items on the menu (for example, the guacamole), the food's really not that great. Â The service is even worse. But seriously?! That's not why anyone really goes to Zocalo, is it? No! It's the knock-me-on-my-ass margaritas. The rumor is that instead of ice, they freeze the mix, thereby making room for more tequila. Brilliant! Whatever it is, they're positively delicious. And strong. They're so good, you'll want to order a second. But be warned: a mere two of these babies have been known to make a grown man (and pro drinker) wobbly on his feet. . . My one complaint with the margaritas is, well, don't you dare order a mixed strawberry/lime combo. While they have both flavors, they do NOT like to mix them. I'm just sayin'.... . So, in addition to the margaritas, Zocalo is a great Midtown scene, especially when the weather is even remotely nice. The decor is simple but effective: lots of woven baskets hanging from the ceiling and rustic iron sculptures abound. When the place is bustling, the atmosphere is festive. Feels almost like being on a (quick) Mexican vacation. Then again, maybe that's those margaritas talking again.
