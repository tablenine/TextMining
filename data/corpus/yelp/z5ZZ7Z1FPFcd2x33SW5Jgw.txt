Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
Sushi Gen is hands down my #1 sushi bar in California. The prices are worth the fresh &amp; extremely high quality fish. Their uni, toro, yellow tail belly, engawa sashimi, Japanese or Spanish mackerel, are among my favorites. We usually eat at the bar omikase and never leave unsatisfied. Without alcohol, omikase can cost about $100 to $120 depending on how big of an appetite you've got but you can get away for less than $40-$50 a person ordering from the sushi menu. You can expect to pay less if you order the combos from the regular menu. Great food and service!
