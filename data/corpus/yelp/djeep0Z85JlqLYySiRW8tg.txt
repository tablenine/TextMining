this is the definition of hype...  seriously why wait in line for up to 2 hours for food.  can anyone really taste the difference here from chicken to pork?  all the meat seems to be just covered with just one sauce.  i am only giving them 3 stars because they were able to create the hype and image behind the product but the food is eh.  you should try it to get over the novelty but seriously that is all it is. there are now numerous copy cats waiting and i hope one comes out with much better food.
