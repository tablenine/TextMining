I have lived in Lincoln Square for years and spent many an afternoon playing football at Winnemac Park or enjoying a Guinness at Gio's.  Ever Saturday afternoon  I would walk past this place to find a mass of folks waiting to get in.  Now I hate the idea of the word Brunch.  I think it is a buzz word invented by women to sleep in and not feel guilty eating traditionally fatty food on Sunday after hanging out and drink the night before.  So I would just judge the freezing cold patrons as hordy tordy yupsters and keep walking.. . When I finally took my mom here, though (on a weekday)I realized to things: I was right about the people and this place is Fantastic (just kidding about the patrons. Everyone was nice.)   From the excellent service to the Chef who checked up on us as we waited for our check this is a warm, not-to-flashy spot that's better for you and 3 friends than you and 3 children.  The Sassy Eggs are incredible.  I'm not a sweet-loving man but I sampled some of my mom's blueberry pancakes which were also quite tasty.. . As far as the coffee goes, I can't tell the difference unless it's absolute filth and the coffee was good enough to me.  Service came with a smile and the price didn't make me cry.  Next time I'll be getting the Frazzled eggs and will keep you posted.  If you are willing to wait awhile this is a great weekend spot.  If not, go on a weekday.
