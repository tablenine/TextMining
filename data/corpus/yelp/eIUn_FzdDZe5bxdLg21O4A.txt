This place is one of our most favorite places to eat at . Every time we make our dinner reservations here we still wait about 15 min., but we don't mind because when we walk to the lounge for drinks, it feels as if we're walking on water. . . We need to start changing up on what we order, but we can't help it! We always end up ordering the same thing and that's the lobster garlic noodle and Chilean sea bass. You can't go wrong with these two plates and it's really nice when the girlfriend doesn't eat so much.
