I love the Los Nopales skirt steak special. I've had so much skirt steak in the past that it no longer wows me. But this dish is different. The steak sits in a flavorful broth, the steak is sooo tender (I think I ordered it "medium"), and the cactus salad on top is a great texture/flavor complement. My friend had the enchiladas (which, sorry to say, aren't very exciting in general), but she apparently loved them (and she rarely loves anything). Overall, it's a yummy, inexpensive place that's BYOB and has great service.
