Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
This place is great... walk in and see a statue of Elvis - there's even an Asian Elvis impersonator doing karaoke. The food? Fantastic. I can't say anything less. Went with a Thai friend of mine and of course, let her order that way I'd be sure to get the best tasting foods. Oh yum! I'm not sure of everything we ate but it was mighty tasty. . . I hear it's open until 2AM... we were there until midnight. First trip to Hollywood too.
