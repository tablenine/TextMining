I've only had breakfast foods here, so no idea how the regular food is. The milkshakes are good, as are the hashbrowns.. . The corn flake (or maybe it was frosted flakes) french toast is, umm, odd.  Not bad, but not amazing either.  The black bean cakes are fine, but what I really come here for is the corn cakes with a red pepper sauce--I love them! (I do wish the red pepper sauce was hotter, but there's tabasco on the table, so...). . It's very crowded on the weekends though, so if you're looking for brunch and don't want to wait for ages, go early or later. 1:30 on and you're fine, early is also okay, but 11 on it's a zoo.
