So...yes, I'm a fan. Any time I'm consuming several pounds of meat in one sitting, I'm generally a fan. But, I've got a few things to get off of my artery-clogged chest first. . . Uh...have the 500 of you that have reviewed this spot never been to Brazilian BBQ before? Because let me tell you this, it comes just about as good and for about a Jackson less. Also, what's up with the meat bombardment as soon as I turn my li'l thing to green? Whoa...slow it down there fellas. I feel like I'm the middle of a "Night at the Roxbury" sketch. I like my meat at a nice an steady pace, not all wham bam thank you ma'am. And you can quote me on that. ;). . But, with that said, there was some pretty great meat here. And no shortage of it either. The gaucho dudes were on it with the meat as soon as you turn your sign to green...the waiters on the other hand? Hello? How many times can you pass us by? Coffee please? Please? Pretty please?. . This is blasphemy coming from a carnivore like me, but the tres leches dessert was one of my favorite parts of the meal...okay, and the ribeye. Mmmmmm..... . I guess what I'm trying to say is....yeah, it was delicious, but knowing I can get a similar experience with quality meats at Agora in Irvine for $20 less...well, I probably won't be back to Fogo.
