I have only actually eaten here once, but I live across the street so I have had take-out from here more times than I can count for brunch and lunch.. . Their eggs benedict is delicious - and holds up well enough on the trip across the street that it is still really enjoyable and the yolks are gooey.. . Lunch-wise, they have a short rib sandwich that is out. of. this. world.  I cannot say enough good things about this sandwich.  You are transported out of yuppie-ville into a Texas BBQ joint with this sandwich.  BBQ lovers, you really should try this.. . I still haven't been able to bring myself to try their dinner - just a little too expensive for me, even given the across-the-street convenience.. . Oh, everyone here is really nice too - they let me use their in-house phone when I left mine in a taxi.
