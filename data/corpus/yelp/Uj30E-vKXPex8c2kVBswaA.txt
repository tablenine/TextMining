Cozy and Cute place to be.. The food is great and huge. country breakfast:. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ,  black tiger shrimp salad:. http://www.yelp.com/bi....  . The bowl for the soup or salad is really HUGE too.. No room for dessert after dishes.... . If you are lucky, you would get a tasting peach iced tea or lemon-aid in a long waiting line. I was lucky today lol... . The parking is horrible.. . $3.50 for the valet parking.
