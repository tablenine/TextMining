Our apartment finder group gave us a coupon to this place, so we tried it out.. . Their major gimmick is that there are a huge number of add-ons you can stick on your burger-- a couple of different meats, a few buns, your usualt selection of cheese plus brie, and then a lot of different sauces and other things. Actually, I found the construction process kind of over-whelming. Inevitably, I think I like DMK's "we're the experts, we'll tell you what combos work" style better than this. I mean, how much does it benefit me to have julienned carrots as one of my options when I can't fathom what kind of burger works well with julienned carrots? Having so many chooses isn't that useful when I can't use them.. . Also, our service was painfully slow. We were monitoring all the tables around us as they got their food, trying to remember if they'd ordered before and after us, looking up hopefully whenever someone walks out of the kitchen with a tray... It was getting to the point when we would have to inevitably assume they'd forgotten our order and complain when the food finally arrived.. . Honestly, I don't think I'll go back to this place. Ok, well, you could twist my arm, and I'd go with you, but I'll definitely let you know that I like other places better.
