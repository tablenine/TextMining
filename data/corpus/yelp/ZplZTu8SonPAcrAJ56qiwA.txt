Dear sweet little baby Jesus,. Thank you, wonderful infant savior, for bringing me to Loca Luna's bathroom on St Patty's Day.  . Amen. . After too many Guinness, Irish Car Bombs, Jaeger bombs and Jaeger shots at a nearby tavern, we headed to Loca Luna.  I grabbed a Cape Cod---Always enjoy one more before you break the seal---and pee-pee danced to the ladies room.  I marveled at the sheer amount of liquid I had been holding and surmised that I may be part camel (only when drinking).  Afterwards I hit the floor and awed the Latino ladies with my patented white girl moves.  . . The music was good...I think....wait, is that dos campanas clanking or the sides of my brain alternately pumping against my skull due to catastrophic dehydration?  . . WHY are you "Shhh"-ing me??---He does TOO look like Ricky Martin!  . . No I do NOT keep bumping my ass into the guy behind me!!  Are you saying my ass is big??. . And then a voice from afar said "Vortex tater tots....naked women video game."  Shortly thereafter I had a mouth full of tots and an eye full of boobies
