I like good steak. My 1st time in Chicago, my buddies told me to hit up Gibson's. Great atmosphere. Gibson's reminds me of the old school Steak Houses you see in gangster movies. Our waiter was great, he knew everything about the steaks, and gave us interesting stories about the area. The best thing about Gibson's was when our waiter brought out the cuts of meat for our table to choose. I ordered the bone in New York Steak with lots of garlic. The meat comes out perfect. It was crisp on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside. I could have used my butter knife to cut it. I definitely would recommend Gibson's for anyone looking for a fantastic steak.
