RUN AND HIDE.. . my first visit and frankly expected better from the group that "allegedly" owns this place.  luckily, i read the reviews here on yelp prior to my visit and knew i was in for a long night.. . the slaughtered pig screen saver on the bar computer is always a welcoming and hunger provoking scheme employed by many fine eateries.  what is mgmt thinking ?  the beer list is very short.  wine list looked more than adequate.. . we had some various cheese plates for appetizers.  warm bread and butter arrived 20 minutes or so after we were seated and after appetizers.  go figure.. . the beef jerky was worthless.  a $5 bag from Bass Pros Shops blows it away. the tomato salad was good.. . only two entrees were ordered out of our party of six.  the grouper and the ny strip steak.  thats a sign of a scary menu - i guess.. . the grouper was excellent although the portions were small.. . i'm sorry.  when i order a ny strip steak i expect to get a piece of meat.  especially for $20 or so bucks.  what you get is 4 or so thinly sliced pieces of meat.  not a steak knife to be found anywhere.  . . service was very slow and they seem to be in no rush to remove finished plates despite the ample service walking around.. . the only redeemable aspect of the dinner were the deserts.  the table ordered a variety and the were all very good with the exception of the beignets.  they were no better that dunkin donut holes.. . if your a die hard frenchy, maybe it's worth a try.   otherwise, don't bother.
