Mmmmmmm-mmmmmmmmm!!!!!!. . I LOVE IT!!!. . Then again, I love healthy food and this definitely tickles my fancy.  I should try something other than the Chinese Chicken Salad but I can't tear myself away from it's light (for sure not over drenched and oily) and refreshing taste.  I feel good when I eat it and the setting makes everything better.  Come here on a sunny day and enjoy the outdoor by sitting in the patio with the sun shining on you and earth's food right on your plate.  . . I promise to try something else.
