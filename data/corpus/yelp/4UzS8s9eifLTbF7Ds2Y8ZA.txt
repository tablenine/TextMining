The food is ok.  After you finish your meal you will feel satisfied but not overwhelmed by amazing food.  I've eaten here several times.........just so you know there is always a bunch of people outside waiting for a table.......but the wait list moves pretty quickly.......oh yeah, parking is a bit of a pain too, I usually spend 15 minutes or so hunting for a spot.........any how.........food is ok not exceptional.  It is a bit pricy for what you get.  I've always ordered breakfast so I really can't comment on salads or sandwiches but they look good when I see them pass by.  I would recommend this place but not highly recommend.
