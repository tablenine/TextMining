This place rocks.  Both the food and the hot waiters are completely drool-worthy.  The drinks are also fabulous though, as other have mentioned, the wait is not.  If your dining group is bigger than 6, you may consider dining elsewhere given that you'll likely get stuck in the backroom which is windowless &amp; kindof ghetto.. . Definitely a place worthy of repeat visits even if it means braving Sunset strip traffic.
