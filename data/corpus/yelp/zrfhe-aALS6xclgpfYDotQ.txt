Oh, how I want to love this place but the nice patio and Piedmont park location can't make up for poor quality and skimpy burritos. My Pug baby Brutus and I were out for a walk and mommy wanted a burrito so we stopped by Willy's to get what turned out to be the nastiest and skimpiest burrito of all time. I mean they skimped on the rice, the beans, the meat, even skimped on the stale chips, $.80 cents extra for watered-down guac, $0.50 cents extra for canned olives. How does a $8.50 burrito end up looking and tasting like a hot dog?!? Just horrible!
