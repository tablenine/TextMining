Drool..... . This place is so ridiculous = so damn good.. When I'm in L.A. this is another pit stop for the hard to find Japanese ramen! I wish there was something like this in Texas! :(. . As most of you know, this is something that's very difficult to recreate at home....so be patient and wait if there is a line! Â It's so worth it!. With that saying....I need to make another trip to LA!
