Sure, the food is good, but I bet that it was probably better before it became so famous. The first time I went there I had a turkey burger with mushrooms and it was delicious. I also liked the ambience. The second time I went there, I had a burger with blue cheese which was very very gross. There was entirely too much blue cheese on the burger and it made me want to gag. But, that could just be my mistake for ordering something with blue cheese. Just be aware that not everything is as good as they say it is.
