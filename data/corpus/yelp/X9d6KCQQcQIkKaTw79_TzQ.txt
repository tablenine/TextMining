Restaurant: Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Food:  Lobster, beef, vegetables, clams just about everything here was good. . Service:  not bad. . Parking:  just park on the street.  Its not worth it to park in that chaos. . Came here around 6:30... no wait... then after sitting for 10 mins the place got packed
