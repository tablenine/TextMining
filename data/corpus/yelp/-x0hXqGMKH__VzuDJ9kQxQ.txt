All in all, the atmosphere was pretty good, the food (at least what we ordered) was pretty good, but the main draw is the great selection of bottled beers.. . This would normally be a 3-star review, except for my Restaurant-Beer-Find-of-the-Friggin-Century.  They had bottles of 2006 J.W. Lees Harvest Ale, aged in Lagavulin casks.  I haven't had Lagavulin J.W. Lees in about 4 years, and had almost completely forgotten about it and how amazing it is until I saw it on the menu.  Yes, it's $15.  And yes, the bottle is only 9.3 oz.  But at 13.5% alcohol, it's the equivalent of to 4-5 oz. glasses of wine.  Except even more delicious and orgasmic.  Big bonus points for serving it not too cold, but not room temperature.. . Four days later and I can still taste it.  Yum.
