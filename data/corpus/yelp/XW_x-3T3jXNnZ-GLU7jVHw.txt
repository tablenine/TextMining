Came here with a friend on a weeknight. Between the 2 of us, we ordered the Buffalo Wings (medium), Sirloin Burger w/ fries and Grilled Chicken Salad. The french fries were a perfect match to the juicy burger. Nice and crunchy but not overfried.  For the salad, we complimented the grilled chicken w/  cheddar cheese, roasted peppers, sun dried tomato, pumpkin seeds and portobello mushroom and topping it with balasmic vinegarette. It was tasty and fresh.  The buffalo wings were good but we both agreed that we should have went for the 'hot.' The medium was okay but it definitely needed more of a kick.. . Service was average. Although we didn't require too much attention since my friend and I were enjoying our meal while chatting away. Food was good and prices are reasonable.
