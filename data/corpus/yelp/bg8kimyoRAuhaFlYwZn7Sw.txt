When I say that Buddha Bar was "average," please don't take that to mean that average to me is a 30 foot Buddha, ambient techno, and a faux Buddhist monastery.  In those respects, Buddha Bar is a triumphant display of set design that certainly succeeds at creating a distinctive atmosphere that makes you think you're anywhere but the Meat Packing District.. . The average part was, well, everything else.  The service was pretty normal -- no better than in a random Italian joint on your block.  And the food was good-but-not-remarkable, and certainly not remarkable for $30 per plate.  I had the duck.  It tasted like a very nicely cooked duck.. . I recommend Buddha Bar for people who want an "experience" dinner at a concept restaurant.  It succeeds in the way Disneyland succeeds in making you think a pirate is going to pour rum on you.  You have fun.  You gasp at the pirate.  But you never actually think it's the real deal.
