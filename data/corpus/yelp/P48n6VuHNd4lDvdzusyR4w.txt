Love this place, but can only come so often as we need to go out and work hard to earn more money to afford it!  So far (three visits) everything has been delicious, especially LOVE the Caprese Salad--hmmn, that mozzarella! with the amazing homemade pesto--wow!  Tricolor salad is delish--great dressing--anchovies and parmesan-perfect, with a bite.  Be sure and order the 'garlic' bread as well--it's yummy!. The best thing is the service--really wonderful staff, not pretentious and very knowledgeable.  The bartender (with the longish hair) is great--he'll pick really good wines for you-he knows his stuff.  Bad things--tables are too close together and the noise level is high--and it's always very crowded.  Not deal breakers.  All in all, a really nice place to come for an excellent meal.  Thanks!
