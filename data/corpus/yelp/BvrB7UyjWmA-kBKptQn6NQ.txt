Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
Did somebody say Taco Cabana?. What? Taco Cabana? Okay!. . This is not an uncommon let's-leave-the-bar conversation. This colorful (it's so bright!) Mexican restaurant is conveniently open all hours of the day and night. While I try to avoid the late-night munchies in general, this is a good place to go if you want some cheesy, greasy, grub at 4am. The tacos are popular, but I recommend the nachos. The food arrives quickly in comparison to diners. While it might burst your belt, it won't empty your wallet. Nachos are also a great way to persuade people to leave the bar. . . "Ready to go home?". "No way!". "Taco Cabana?". . Done.
