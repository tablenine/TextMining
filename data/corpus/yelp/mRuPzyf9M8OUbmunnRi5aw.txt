Oh how I love love love cheap, delicious, L.A. eats! And oh how proud I am to live in a city with such an establishment as Philippe's!. . My order was simple - roast beef sandwich with jack cheese [Was the cheese necessary? Probably not, but it was still delicious] and a side of cole slaw. The sandwich was so light and tasty that my fianc√© and I considered ordering seconds. The cole slaw is probably the best I've ever had - it was so pure, both in flavor and ingredients. Dinner for 2 was around $15 - drinks included.. . Parking's ample. Seating's ample. Sawdust on the floor is ample. We'll be back Philippe's, again and again and again. And we promise to one day buy one of those cute bobbleheads!
