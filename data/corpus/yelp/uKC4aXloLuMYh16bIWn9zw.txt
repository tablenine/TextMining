Category: Specialty Food
It was an RR destinations &amp;amp; hate to say it but therefore it was a CC destination.. . Food Network brainwashes me. What can I say?. . Every place like this is sickening cool. I say sickeningly out of jealousy really. I would do anything to own a place like this.. . There are gourmet sauces, candies, cookies, wine, and other delish goodies. There are random glass jars filled with pretty things (don't you love how specific I am?). There's a little cafe and freshly made food area (which is what RR had). Unfortunately, we had already eaten brunch. Off to the corner is a little bakery area with baked goods pretty &amp;amp; cute &amp;amp; classy behind the glass. Be sure to check out their catering binder in the back. It is food pron to the max. . . It's the perfect place to make your own picnic basket to bring to Hollywood Bowl or even order a premade one.. . We got several sweets to take with us. A vanilla cupcake, coconut cupcake, ginger cookie, and a bouchon (to compare to the real thing). It was packaged in a cute white box with a simple but designed logo. . . In terms of taste, I have to admit. It was very LA. It was all looks &amp;amp; no substance. They all looked hot, but tasted average.
