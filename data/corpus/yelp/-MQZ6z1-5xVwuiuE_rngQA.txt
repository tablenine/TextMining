Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Hands down my favorite breakfast spot in the South Bay.. . The food is always hot, good, and made to order.. . My recommendation, come in a group no more than two. Â Otherwise, you can wait forever... for-EH-ver.. . "The best breakfast places are in the beachside towns, and you know it's a good place if they close after lunch. A great breakfast place is closed before dinner. Uncle Bill's is a great place. In the script for 'Reservoir Dogs,' the first scene takes place there. We didn't shoot there, though; it was small inside. But that's where the script said they were." taken from the article: Flix and the city (an interview with Quentin Tarantino).
