Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
You have know the difference between mexican food and tex-mex.  Uncle Julios is tex-mex at its best.  The prices have crept up over the years, but we've gotten consistent quality in food and service, so I'm not letting that take away from my rating.  Just be aware, if you're going to be swilling the the margaritas with dinner, you're in for a big tab!  . . There is always a wait for a table at dinner, and often for lunch--but I don't mind having a drink and complimentary chips and salsa (THE BEST ANYWHERE) while I wait.  I'd have to say the fact that there is always a wait is a testament to how good this place is.  . . If you're familiar with the neighborhood, you know dozens of restaurants have come and gone over the years, while Uncle Julios has been around over 15 years...that says something, too.
