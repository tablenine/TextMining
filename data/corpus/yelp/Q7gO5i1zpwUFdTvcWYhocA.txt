1/2 slab ribs with a side of sweet potato fries and french fries. yum. i usually like some green on my plate but this is the exception. . . the thing is i hate sweet potato with a passion. especially when my mom would make it with marshmallows to appeal to my childish love for sweet things. that just brought confused muddled sweetness to my pallet. yuck.. . so smoke daddy fries 'em and whatever else they add just makes for a yum side dish. and their fries are super good so how could i not get them.. . dine in only though. i ordered that same combo to go and the sweet potato fries were damp and droopy.
