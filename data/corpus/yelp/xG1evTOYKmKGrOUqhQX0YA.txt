Now this is comfort food at its best. What a great little cafe tucked away in an unsuspecting strip mall...would've normally blown right by this place, but the reviews on Yelp were too compelling...we decided to give it a try.. . We stuck to the Mexican cuisine both times we went. I'm lactose intolerant, so the pupusas will have to wait for a time I remember my Lactaid pills. We are looking forward to trying them for the first time. We did do the green corn tamales...really good! My hubby did enchiladas both times, once regular style and once suiza style. I did the fajitas the first time, and then the house burrito (vegetarian!) the second time (no cheese/sour cream). While the burrito looked huge, it's actually fairly easy to down (maybe the lack of cheese makes it lighter). . It's just really good, no nonsense, straightforward Mexican food, which brought us back to our college days in Arizona at ASU...where Mexican food was a staple in our diets, at least 3-4 times a week.. We get served chips/salsa upon arrival. The salsa is not my fav...a bit too spicy and too watery - hard to scoop up anything on the chip. I've done the sangria both times (very fruity and floral), and my hubby did the michelada. They make really really good ones...tons of lime.. This will be a definite repeat for us...a great unpretentious place to pig out and decompress on a Friday after a tough week. Just make sure you don't have an outing afterwards - you WILL stuff yourself.
