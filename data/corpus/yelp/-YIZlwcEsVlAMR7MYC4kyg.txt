Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
This place made me fat when i lived in L.A. (along with a couple of other choice restaurants... Versailles, Natalee Thai, or Bay City Deli anyone?!), so that's gotta mean something!. . LOVE the tacos.  Fresh and crunchy taco shell, tasty seasoned shredded beef, and cool lettuce.  LOVE the salsa.  Could be more thick, but "if it doesn't get all the place...".  LOVE the chips.  The tostadas are okay.  Skip the burritos, though.. . I always make a stop here whenever I'm in so-cal.
