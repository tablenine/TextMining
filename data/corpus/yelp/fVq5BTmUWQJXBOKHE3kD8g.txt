Terrible!! There are so many other great hot dog places in the city. The fries were barely cooked and had no flavor at all. The hot dog came out of crock pot! Are you kidding me?? It also had no flavor! I got it with everything! The service was the worst. The kids behind the counter were were clueless. The one adult probably had hepatitis. I love dive hot dog stands. I can stomach them all but this was the most overrated place ever! Total waste of time and money!
