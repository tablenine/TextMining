Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I went here once at night. My girlfriend told me last time they went it was late and the line was shorter, but it was still a 2 hour wait.  I said screw it and we went ahead and went to inn n out. Good call.. . On my flight out, we were checking out of our hotel and headed over to the airport.  We went ahead and decided to drive by pink's to see how long the line was.  Luckily the line wasnt wrapped all the way around the building. It was about 11 am on a Sunday.  The wait ended up being around 15-20 min.. Not sure if the wait was worth it.. . The hot dogs were pretty standard I thought.  I ordered a walk of fame. The weiner was pretty thin and, and I didn't think anything special. . So I waited this long for that? I think people are crazy. The only thing the place has going for it is that it is just topped with a bunch of random crap. There is a big variety of toppings.. That's one of the reasons why it takes so long I think. Its not like they are grilling them fresh, or boiling the dogs right then.. . I wouldn't go back and wait in line for this, but hey, I'm not from LA - what do I know?
