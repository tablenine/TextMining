This has become my spot that I take everyone to! The chimichurri is SO good!! The Suprema Napolitana is delicious and overall everything is very reasonably priced. The patio seating is dimly lit and pretty packed. Can get a little loud with the usual large groups of people that go there. Most of the time I never find street (metered) parking and have to valet which is to be expected in that area. . . Overall amazing food, decent service even when busy, and cheap for the amount of food you get!
