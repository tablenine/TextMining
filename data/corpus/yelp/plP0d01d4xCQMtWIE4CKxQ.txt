I like this place.  The beer, food, and service are all good.  . . One time I ordered a dish that I didn't like at all- deep fried salmon.  It just didn't work for me.  But one other time I had a Monte Cristo sandwich that was just amazing decadent goodness.. . The rooftop beer garden is a nice touch.  I went up there to kill some time once.
