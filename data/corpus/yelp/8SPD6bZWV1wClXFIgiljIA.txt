Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
Best place in Los Angeles to get pastrami (I think it rivals great NYC pastrami anyday.).  Probably the best part about Langer's apart from their heavenly fatty pastrami is that the decor hasn't changed since the late 60s-early 70s.  The harvest colors design scheme is gonna make a come-back, I swear...mark my words.  . . It's totally worth the trip and come on, guys...it's not that scary of a place.
