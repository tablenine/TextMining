Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Finally got to try this place and it was everything I expected it to be.  Chicken &amp; Waffles.  Interesting combo.  Or shall I say heart attack on a plate?  I probably had the worst heart burn of my life after eating the chicken smothered in gravy with waffles smothered in butter and syrup, but wow - it was tasty.
