The Carne Asada Sandwich keeps me guessing and raving:. . The pseudo meat tastes as good as the realy thing. The best part is that the vegan version is juicier and oh so tender.. . I was so impressed that I insisted eating here a second time. I acutally want some now.. . Cheater Secret: Order the Kid's Meal Chicken tenders if you want Sweet Potato fries. You get the same amount of fries but for a few bucks more you got an extra snack, drink and dessert.. . hehe.
