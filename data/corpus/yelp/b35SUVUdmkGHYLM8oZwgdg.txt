The food is here is 'a-bit-more-interesting' diner food, which is pretty good and fresh (especially the mac-n-cheese balls!).  The service is sort of rude and rushed, but at least it's pretty quick.  The atmosphere can be a little too hipster, and they're always packed, but the wait is never too long.
