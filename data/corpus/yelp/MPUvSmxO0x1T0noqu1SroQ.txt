Watched this on Man vs. Food... drove from SD all the way here &amp; was pretty disappointed. This place is pretty overrated.. . It took like half an hour to get 3 sandwiches. Lines were crazy long &amp; slow.. . Lemonade is good.. Pickles were excellent with the almost flavorless sandwich.. Chile was okay.. tasted like taco filling though.. . I felt like the sandwiches were overpriced for their quality &amp; size. Like seriously, its just a toasted wheat roll with steamed pork/turkey/beef. Very bland except for the small amount of dip sauce in the sandwich.. . The mustard made me cry. Literally... For some reason I was hoping for a honey mustard taste or something. That stuff was horrendous. It was just wasabi packaged in a different color &amp; container. It wasn't traditionally spicy. It felt like it just went up my nose &amp; burned my nostrils, not my tongue. . . How do you people slather that crap onto your sandwiches?!
