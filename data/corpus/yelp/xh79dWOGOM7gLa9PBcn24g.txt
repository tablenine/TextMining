What's the hype all about?. . I've eaten here about 12 times since 1999, and every time I walk out full but wholly unimpressed, and as such, I can't give this place more than 3 stars.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not advising you to stay away, just to not expect anything special.. . The good: the sushi and sashimi is pretty decent.  The prices are fair.. . The bad: fugly decor, horrible ambiance in the general area (tiny shopping center with tiny parking spots) and a parking attendant that hates life, hates his family and hates you!. . Go to Fisherman's Village just north of here (much larger center).  There are several sushi places in this center that are far better than Sushi Gen and you're less likely to get mugged/stabbed/spit on in the sketchy parking lot of the beloved (??) Sushi Gen.
