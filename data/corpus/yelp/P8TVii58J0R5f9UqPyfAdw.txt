One of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles.  The design of this place is so damn nice: high ceilings, marble, gold, simple.  . . The food is pretty good.  For dinner, some good vegetarian options would be the portobello fries, eggplant parmesan, and most of their side dishes.  I always get the Bianco pizza (vegetarian), it's especially good when they top it with a lot of arugula.. . I've also been here for brunch and had their farmer's market breakfast.  So gooood.  The poached eggs were made perfectly and the vegetables were well seasoned.  . . The prices are reasonable, but it's best if you go with a group so that you can order multiple dishes and sample everything.
