I am going to make this review short and sweet. . I love it here, great menu. Sometimes there is a wait but there is a reason for it...darn good food.. . I love how they are open 24 hours - there is a bomb selection at Fred's they have everything from breakfast to teriyaki burgers to a spaghetti dish. They serve pretty quick too considering it is usually packed there. . Only once did we have this really rude short blonde haired waitress. Half our party paid with debit cards the other half paid with cash. She thought it would be cute to avoid our table like the plague so she did not have to bring us our cash change. One guy in our party had to track her down on the other side of the restaurant and tell her that was not her tip after we didn't see her for 15 - 20 minutes. We needed our rightful change back. Her tip was split up on 2 debit cards. She looked so pissed. But I haven't seen here there in like 2 years, so it is all good ;)
