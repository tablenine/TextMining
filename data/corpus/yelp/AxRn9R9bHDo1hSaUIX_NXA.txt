Restaurant: Casa Vega
Category: Mexican
Casa Vega is overrated. It's too trendy and it's a meat market. The food is not that bad, though. I like how fresh their seafood is. Great chips and salsa. Wonderful margaritas. Decor is nice and dim. Good for girls night out, bad for beer goggles, lol.. . I give it three stars cuz I like that they have valet and i like their food and it is a lively scene, if that's what you're looking for.
