I think there is a serious correlation between the amount of food you get and how late at night you come. For example, I've come here at 6 PM, right after dropping my friends off at Emory, and I thought the portions were on the small size (I got the triple stack of chocolate chip pancakes) given the price. . . However, in the middle of pulling an all nighter over finals week, I came here at2 in the morning and ordered the same exact thing. OMG. I SWEAR the pancakes were spilling over the plate they were served on. at least 50 percent bigger than the pancakes I had gotten a few weeks. back. . . It actually follows one of my dining rules really well, the less crowded a restaurant is, the better the food will be. . . Now for the pancakes themselves, Its pretty hard to mess up pancakes. The pancakes here are always cooked evenly. Theyre soft and moist. But i do feel that the batter itself is too heavy, and pancakes could use more chocolate. If your ordering chocolate chip pancakes, you SHOULDN'T need to use syrup as well. It should be sweet enough without the syrup. . . The omlets here are actually pretty good. I'm surprised no one has mentioned that before. Compared to the other diners around me, namely city cafe, and the broadway diner, this place blows it out of the water. . . However, if you can make it to IHOP while they have their unlimited pancake deal going on, just go there instead. The quality is about the same.
