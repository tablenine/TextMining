Category: Pizza
THIS PLACE IS AWWWEESSSOME and im usually not enthusiastic so that says a lot. The mediteranean bread and salad dressing rocked my world. Though the pot pie is the main stay here i think the med bread is better. next time i go im just getting that and the salad cuz it was that good. Chi pizza and oven grinder deserves 5 stars just for the food but the atmosphere which is warm and cozy and the historical location make it a hands down top of the line 5 star
