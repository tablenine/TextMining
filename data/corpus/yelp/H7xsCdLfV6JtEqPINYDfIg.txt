i still buy my deoderant and dish detergent at Target, but i like Whole Foods for the FOOD.  They have an enormous selection of the finest cheeses, meats, and vegetables.  The prices are high for sure, but sometimes I'm worth it.  It's easy to blow a lot of cash here on impulse items like a $5 bag of potato chips, but if you stick to your shopping list and buy mostly ther staples you will come out okay.. . The pizza bar is amazing.
