Whoa!  The portions were gigantic!  . . We showed up at about 8:30 on Sunday morning and the place was already packed.  We got a nice little table outside.  . . The bf and I ordered the french-pressed coffee.  It was really good!  For breakfast, my son ordered the peanut butter french toast and I ordered the Creme de la Creme french toast (graham cracker crusted with cream cheese).  It tasted like cheese cake!!  My bf, not having the sweet tooth that my son and I have, ordered a scrambled egg dish with turkey sausage.  It was really good.  We all had to take to-go boxes home with us though because of the huge portions.. . The service was good, not great.  The price was way too much for breakfast, I thought.  We paid a little less than $50 including tip.  Yikes.
