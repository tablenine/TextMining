Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Discovered Kitch'n about 6-7 years ago when I lived in Roscoe Village. It's a really awesome place, filled with charm.. .  The first thing you'll notice walking through the beaded curtain draped across the front door are the board games adorning the tables and shelves. This is the only place I can think of where you can order a mimosa while playing Yahtzee.. .  Their food is great with their signature being Green Eggs &amp; Ham, a literal translation of the childhood classic. My favorite, however, has to be their Chilaquiles. Delicious eggs, tortilla chips, cheese and spices are fried up and served with applewood smoked bacon, tangy salsa and thick, buttery Greek toast. Easily the best dish for that morning after. . .  They get real busy for the weekend brunch crowd but well worth it. Go retro, Kitch'n is a real blast from the past.
