Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
If you're fan of The Exorcist, you'll love this place. Let me explain. The guacamole is the consistency of young Reagan's spew. The salsa, you can pretty much drink it up with a straw. Salsa, as far as I know, is meant to be eaten, not drank. That is some repugnant shit! . . Shredded yellow cheese on a taco? Yeah, maybe if I were ordering at Del Taco/Taco Bell. . . I love the "herd mentality" of this place. People assume that since it's packed it must be good. It reminded me of the stupid people that stand in front of El Cholo when they have their sweet tamales up for grabs. They don't get, that ass still tastes like ass. . . Oh, and the tacos are cheap too! Uh, yeah, and they're also cheap at any taco truck in L.A. That's not a valid argument.. . There's nothing redeeming about Tito's.
