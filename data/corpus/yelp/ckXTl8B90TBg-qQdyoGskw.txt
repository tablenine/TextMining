Restaurant: Souper Jenny
Category: Caterers
When lunch time rolled around today, I was in the mood for soup: really, really, good soup.  So based on countless recommendations and all the glowing reviews on this fine site, I headed over to Souper Jenny.  Alas, I did not get to try Souper Jenny's famous soup, nor will I *ever* return there to try it again.  Why is this ?  . . I got into line and was ready to order, only to find out that they only accept cash.  I don't carry cash, ever. Yes, I am hungry. No, I am not willing to go to an ATM...and now I'm pissed off.   . . A restaurant (or any other establishment) that does not accept debit or credit cards shows me they care less about their customer's convenience and loyalty than they do about their bottom line.  Yes, the card processors charge the company a percentage of the total, but the 3-5% of the total really isn't that much, and can be easily absorbed into their cost structure.  Considering the amount of additional business can increase substantially (both in terms of average order size and number of orders), this cost is well worth bearing.  . . Souper Jenny, when I took time out of my day (and went considerably out of my way), only to be turned away because you are unwilling to accept my preferred method of payment,  that just shows me shows me that Souper Jenny is really just a super b...h.
