Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I really like this place. Not only because of its literal next door proximity to my work, but I've had some good experiences here. The bread is great. The wines are great (they also own Vinium Populi - the tech-y wine tasting lounge expansion.) and the food is pretty good. I like that it's not too pungent so the flavoring is just right for my palate. For me, restaurants offer a complete experience of the senses. So for example, the outdoor cafe experience at any Italian restaurant is a cultural thing that I really enjoy, like you get at Ugo. I also love that you can see the open kitchen in the middle of restaurant. It adds to the inviting open feel of the whole place.
