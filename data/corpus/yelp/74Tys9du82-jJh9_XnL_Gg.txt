I ate at the Bar Room because i couldn't get a reservation in the main dining room but the food was really good!. The portions are tiny tiny! But its perfect because you can try more different dishes (if you have the money hahah apps were like 13 to 20 bucks? and half entrees were in the 20's to 30's i think).... So between me and my mom, we tried the Twin Oysters (in a champagne jelly with caviar), Poached egg in a Jar (with huge chunks of lobster and haricot verts), Scallops (sorta Thai style), Swordfish (with Eggplant "caviar"(??)) and the Duck confit. All the apps were delish! My swordfish was awesome... very moist and the eggplant complimented the fish so well! My moms duck was like ok. Im not really usually a duck person anyways... it was like breaded and had a sweet-ish taste. . For dessert we had the cheese plate and this Berry thing. The berries were baked in a tin foil bag with vanilla bean and pepper and orange peel! And topped with pistachio ice cream! It was sour and sweet all at the same time and was so good! Very refreshing!. . However, the place was FREEZING... yeah it was 95 degrees today but there was no need for the AC to be cranked up THAT HIGH!!! jeeze, it just made me feel colder coming in from the humid hotness! And also... awkward but kinda awesome at the same time.... unisex bathrooms? Uhmmm... i was freightened at first, but... i guess you have to get used to it. And excellent service btw.... . I saw the menu for the main dining room and would LOVE to try it. There was a bigger more interesting selection!
