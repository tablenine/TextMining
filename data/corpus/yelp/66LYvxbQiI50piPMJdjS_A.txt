I will never ever order a fillet again!  The bone-in rib eye at Mastro's is amazing!   Wow. Soooo good.  I also ordered the delicious lobster mashed potatoes which served as my lunch for the next three days.  The portions are huge!!  It took 4 years for me to try Mastro's but I've already made my next reservation because its just THAT good!!
