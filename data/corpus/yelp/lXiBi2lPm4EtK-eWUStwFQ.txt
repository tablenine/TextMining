Impromptu dinner at Fritti this past Friday before catching the premiere of the newest round of Scandal at Dad's Garage. . . Dimly lit, tables tightly placed, it is a cozy, lively nook on the corner of Elizabeth &amp; North Highland. Fritti was packed &amp; the atmosphere exuded a really awesome energy. . . My husband and I opted to split the rounds..... Round one: Sashimi Tuna... 5 stars. I'm in love. . Round two: Caesar Salad... pretty standard. 2.5 stars. Round three: Calzone alla Napoletana, pizza form... Delicious. 4.5 stars.. . Service was above average. Timing was right on key, which I always appreciate. . . Check Fritti out for a solidly consistent affordable Inman Park hot spot. You really can't go wrong.
