Today was a very special day for me.  I got together with three of my favorite previous roommates in life...Danny (college roommate), Erin (roommate in Atlanta), and Leslie (friends since high school and now lives with David and I to start a new life in Atlanta).  It was so good to have everyone together and it showed me how much I've grown up and how fortunate to have these people still be in my life!  . . It's been awhile since I have been to Fritti and thought it would be a great place to get together.  I usually enjoy eating here in the Spring and Summer season to enjoy the patio space, but in the Winter they really seal it up to keep the cold out!  My favorites here are the calamari, Cesar salad, and I like to keep it simple with the pizzas...love the Sorrentina.  We also ordered the Arcaini which is fried risotto and Italian sausage...yum!  Beware...the pizzas are huge, but anything else...the serving can be a bit smaller than you would like!  Just ask Leslie when she ordered the Tuna.  Anyways, the service was great and we were seated and out  the door in a good amount of time!. . If you are looking for something different, try going to Fritti for brunch!  They have breakfast pizzas with eggs, that are to die for!  Plus they offer a couple of sandwiches, which I wish they would keep on the menu for dinner!
