Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
*SIGH* I need to stop expecting so much from restaurants. I just end up getting so disappointed.. . A couple of weeks ago, I was DYING for paella and Cobras &amp; Matadors popped up when I Yelped it but when we came here, they were CLOSED. So yesterday after the movies, we decided to come here. We came around 6:20 PM and it was only half full. When we asked the hostess to seat us, they were hesitant b/c they apparently had a lot of reservations within the next hour or so. They told us that they could seat us but we'd have to move in the middle of our meal. (Ummm.... ok??) . . We also had to ASK for a server to come take our orders. (I'm really not a fan of that. If you see people seated in your area, aren't you supposed to take their orders instead of ignoring them?) But the service improved once we put in our orders. . . Cobras &amp; Matadors is also a BYOB!!! If you get wine from the store next door, there's no corkage fee (but according to the bf who popped over to grab a bottle, the bottles tend to be on the pricier side.) . . We ordered the Pork &amp; Veal Meatballs, Paella, and Mussels. The meatballs w/ cilantro sauce was delicious but the other sauce wasn't as delicious. The mussels were perfectly seasoned and very flavorful (don't drink the liquids.. it's not soup/broth.. you'll get a very salty mouthful). The paella was VERY disappointing. It was too liquidy and the rice definitely was not cooked all the way. It was still a bit CRUNCHY. I'm kind of shocked that they would bring out an undercooked dish. . . Overall, it was a decent experience. I definitely need to find a place that serves better paella.
