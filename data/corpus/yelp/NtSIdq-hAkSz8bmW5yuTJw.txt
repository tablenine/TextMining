Toast is tasty. It's always packed, but when I went the wait wasn't longer than 5 minutes. I got a 1/2 sandwich/soup combo with a tuna sandwich and chicken tortilla soup. Though I made a huge mistake getting soup in 95 degree weather (sitting outside, mind you), the chicken tortilla soup is very tasty! Creamy &amp; crispy goodness. The tuna sandwich is actually pretty healthy- packed with sprouts, cucumbers, tomatoes- and easy on the mayo. The side I picked was sweet potato fries &amp; did I make the right decision- sooo yummy! I want to try their fruit cup next time- it's not your normal crappy fruit cup- this one has blackberries, mangos, strawberries, all the tastiest fruits and it's packed!!! . . The menu is a variety of pseudo-American foods- salad, sandwiches, wraps, soup, &amp; the likes, with a very good breakfast selection. Parking is a bitch so if you don't get lucky with finding street parking, I'd just go valet (about $5.50, if I remember correctly). . . I saw Ron Artest when I went. He's lost the mohawk but looks like he's enjoying LA! Wooohoo Lakers!!!
