I really love this place, 98% of the time. If you can go early, or late, the noise and the crowds aren't so bad and you can actually enjoy your meal &amp; wine in peace and quiet. However, sometimes you can't escape the noise. I went Tuesday evening with the bf and although the majority of the restaurant was empty, we ended up being sat next to a gaggle of obnoxious girls who wouldn't shut the fuck up about "the regulators at work." I think I counted "the regulators" in the context of their conversation about 20 times in 5 minutes. Why was I counting? Because I couldn't even hear myself think and the girl's voice was so grating it was the only way I could distract myself long enough from turning around and smacking her. Or buying her dessert so she would stop talking.. . As soon as that table left, our server approached us and asked if we were ok. The bf said we were much better now that the offending table was gone, and she replied that the whole restaurant was. Haha. . Anyway, as far as food goes , I always get the shrimp and grits, and Chad always gets the pork tenderloin. Both really excellent dishes. We started with the fried green tomato fries this time, and holy shit. They're excellent. You have to get them! They taste like Christmas! All piny and sweet with a little kick and delicious crunch to them. Chad also had the beef carpaccio, which I took a bite of, and wow. Really, really, really good. I have yet to have a bad meal at this place. And really, if you don't order an expensive bottle of wine here, the prices are extremely reasonable.. . Definitely go if you haven't been and are wanting southern comfort food. You won't be disappointed.
