Very artistic presentation and you are going to pay every penny for it. This place used to not be so hot 2 years ago when I had 1st gone there, but has maintained the level of quality. I think it is one of the top 3 spots in Chicago for fresh sushi. However, always ask if it is frozen or fresh and expect to pay significantly more for unfrozen sushi. Appetizers could use some reinvention, but beyond that excellent.
