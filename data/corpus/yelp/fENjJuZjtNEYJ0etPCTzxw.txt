I really can't think of much wrong with this place. Except the server shouldn't have recommended a boring tuna roll when there were at least 20 more exciting things on the menu. And forgetting which coffee is decaf and which is regular and not making the effort to remedy the problem isn't 5 star service.. . The food was good. I'm glad I went out on a limb and tried the black roe with a quail egg. Yep, a raw quail egg. On top of some raw fish eggs. It was interesting but it was a one time thing, you know what I'm saying?Vegan Chicago, this is a cry for help. A whisper for help, more like.. . So....yeah, just try a quail egg on something because life is short. The octopus roll is good also. I thought the seaweed salad was great but someone else thought it was fishy tasting. Isn't it weird how for some people seaweed can taste more fishy than fish?
