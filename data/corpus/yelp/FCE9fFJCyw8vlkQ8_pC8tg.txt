My favorite sushi place.  Period.  The best things here are definitely the monkfish liver, the uni (if you are adventurous enough to eat the inside of a sea urchin) and the hot scallop dish... dammit, I always forget what they call it.  Too bad, more for me.  It's cheap, freakin wonderful, and I WILL fight you for a spot at the bar.  Also, the whole block it's on has some really cool little shops while you wait, which is pretty much guaranteed.
