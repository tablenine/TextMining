Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
"Have you been to Din Tai Fung?" Asked Jenny N. . . "Of course! It's a Taiwanese tradition! :)" . . So apparently a bridesmaid weekend isn't complete without a visit to the famous DTF especially when Jenny comes to visit from Boston! . . Now normally, I just stick with the regular XLB but since there was a infrequent visiting group (and b/c I wasn't the only one ordering), we went with a variety:. . 1. regular XLB. 2. crab and pork dumplings. 3. vegetarian dumplings . 4. fish dumplings. 5. shrimp and pork dumplings. 6. small soup XLB (weekend only) . 7. seasonal sauteed vegetables (four seasons long beans) . 8. red bean paste dessert dumplings. 9. Eight treasure sweet rice. . In the end, the only the regular XLB and the eight treasure sweet rice (now note that usually this dessert dish is only available for large Chinese set meal parties). . . Also note that there's a Yogurtland in the adjacent shopping strip within walking distance (hint, hint)!
