Awesome service! The little Japanese ladies who helped us were really sweet.. . FYI they will sub in different veggies for your tempura if you want. I'm not a fan of bell peppers, so next time I'd sub it for more asparagus (which I'd never had tempura-ed and was great).. . The Unagi was very nice. And the miso soup had nice fresh seaweed and tofu. I think it was fresher than you usually see at other places. Or maybe made from scratch? I'm not sure. Either way it was unusually good.. . Cash only, so that's a bummer.. . It's pretty small, and was packed on a Thursday at 2. But the atmosphere was pretty nice.. . They have a nifty ceiling.
