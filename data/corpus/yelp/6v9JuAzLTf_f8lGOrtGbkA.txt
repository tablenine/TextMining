Went here for the $10 all-you-can-eat tapas, and it was a fun night! The tapas were good, not great, but hey, it's $10, and they keep tossing plates on your table so you leave completely beyond full. The margaritas were good! I hear the sangria is good, too. If you plan to do the Monday $10 tapas thing, go late - the place is impossibly crowded until like 9:00. It's a fun way to spend an evening in the Highlands.
