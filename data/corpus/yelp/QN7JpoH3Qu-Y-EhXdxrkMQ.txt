I should've read more reviews before I came here, I scanned the first 5 and that was it. I've never been here before so here's the skinny for any other newbies that are too lazy to read through the 300+ reviews.... . 1. Seating is a U shaped counter. No tables. Just wait for a spot and sit down.. 2. Menu has like 5 sandwiches, Â 5 desserts, and that's about it. . 3. Cash only.. 4. Very fast and minimal here. Everything is disposable and burgers come out in 5 min.. . The food here is pretty good and I liked the simplicity of everything. I didn't try the desserts but they looked really good. Not sure if the food is enough to bring me back and I'm worried that with the limited seating, waiting could be an issue.
