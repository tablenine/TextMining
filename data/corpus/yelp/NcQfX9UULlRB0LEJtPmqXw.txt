Personally I don't like the mixture of fried chicken and waffles, but the two separate is amazing~! Get the fried chicken (get WHITE MEAT!) with gravy on the side! Delicious! Service is surprising for this type of environment...definitely recommend if you're from out of town.. . Food: 4. Service: 4. Environment: 3. Price: 3
