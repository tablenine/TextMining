Went for an evening with a friend just to hang out. The first thing I noticed was that the resaurant was scarcely populated and no one was eating! Hmmmm, I thought, well maybe they are just ordering drinks. Then a table received their food, well except one person who sat and watched everyone else for a good ten minutes before her food came out.  My friend and I ordered and 30 minutes later the waitress came back to let me know that they didn't have what I ordered, and that took 30 minutes! Maybe they were looking for it?!?! So after some arm twisting, they substituted my meat with another meat. When it came out, It was undercooked! And it had sides that I didn't order. So the waitress took the order and apologized that I a had received someone else's order and she whisked it away to the back! PS. I am tired of spending my money for horrible service. The manager wanted to discuss why we wanted to pay only for our drinks???? Oh, and the lamb chops were very bland. If they want to survive as a restaurant, they have to do much better than this. I would NEVER recommend this place and my friend has had this very same experience..... 3 times!!!! Thanks but, no thanks!
