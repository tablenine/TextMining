Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's Tacos is a place that really grows on you. The first time I had it I remember thinking what is all the hype around this place. But then after awhile, both my fianc√© and I started craving those little crunchy beef tacos, the super fresh salsa (you have to mix in the minced jalapenos) and the bit sweeter than normal Pepsi. I always get the same thing two tacos that come with complimentary chips and salsa. I have tried the other items on the menu (burrito, rice, beans and tamales) and none of them are very good. Overall, great beef crunchy tacos at a fair price.
