Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Okay, if I were giving this place a rating based SOLELY on their burger quality, this would be a 5-star review. BUT, I have some qualms about other qualities of this restaurant.. . Burger Quality: 5/5. I can honestly say this is the best, tastiest, most flavorful burger I have ever had. I sampled the Umami, SoCal, and Hatch burgers. All 3 were amazing, but Umami was without a doubt my favorite. This is THE burger that I would crave if I were ever in the mood. Side note: Onion rings were great - you could definitely taste the malt liquor in the batter. . . Portion Size: 4/5. One burger was the perfect portion size for me. My brother on the other hand, who apparently has a limitless stomach, needed 2 burgers, fries, and onion rings to fill him up. The burger was so good though that I literally devoured it in 3-4 bites. . . Price: 4/5. Normally, my idea of a higher-priced burger corresponds with a bigger burger. Not the case at Umami. Each burger was $9, and trust me, it is SMALL for a $9 burger. If you're looking for a big burger to fill you up, you're better off getting 9 burgers off the dollar menu at McD's. If you want something DELICIOUS that'll get your taste buds firing (and you have some extra fluff in your wallet), this is a good place to go. I'm still not quite used to the LA mentality of paying more for less (food). . . Other comments: Staff is very friendly. Relaxed and chill atmosphere. Restaurant is relatively small and cozy. Crowd consisted of both young and old. Valet parking is $2.50.
