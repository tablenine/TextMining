I got the filet mignon and it was actually a bit bitter from being burnt or the grill wasn't clean :( it was only medium rare for crying out loud!  The red cup cake was really good though it had cream cheese topping ... Which is why i'm giving it a 2 star instead of one.  Maybe I should only get dessert here next time to be safe.
