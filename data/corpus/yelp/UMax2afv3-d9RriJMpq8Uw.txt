I thoroughly enjoyed my first dinner at Panahar. Had been there for lunch, which was tasty in a run of the mill Indian buffet kind of way. I think the dinner was more impressive. First the service is terrific, although I would agree with previous comments that mentioned the owner (Mirza?), is very eager to recommend a dish (some may say overbearing, but I was fine with it). They might ought to just bring you a menu as a reference guide as he calls out numbers. However, I'm just as happy to be told what's good than to try to pick it for myself. If you are particularly set on something, you'll have to be a little forceful. The other fantastic thing is the no corkage fee. They didn't have a table when we arrived and we were promptly sent out to the liquor store across Buford Highway. Capital idea. . . So the ordering process was quite a process. It is very clear that the owner is passionate about making sure you'll get something he thinks you like. He was fine with being told "no that's not what I want", and he'd rattle off another number. Also the "special" (not on the menu?) lamb with mango curry he recommended was awesome. He recommended the lentil soup, which we both started with - he kept saying it was light, it's probably anything but light - it's a bowl of pureed lentils and spices, but it was delicious! I also had the Garbanzos and Eggplant. The food was all delicious, and with appetizers, entrees and naan, our total was $28.. . Oh - and the owner said they're closed Mondays, and on Friday or Saturday at dinner, you should make reservations.
