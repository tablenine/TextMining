Restaurant: Bonnie&#39;s Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
Bonnie's is priced reasonably and the meals are awesome, but don't go here expecting to order a wide variety of dishes.  This is a burger and fries kind of spot, and the menu keeps it simple.. . That said, this is THE SPOT for flame-grilled burgers in the Slope.  Yes, there is a Five Guys Burgers two avenues and a couple of blocks away, but if you ask me, a burger should get its flavor from flame charring, not just a pound of toppings.  The only thing I'd change is maybe to make the bun a little smaller.  Even so, even the bun is very tasty -- they toast it on the same grill as where they cook the burgers.. . To be fair, I have a strong prejudice against griddled burgers, but even taking that into account, Bonnie's burgers just plain rock, from the chili spice dusting they put on the burger before throwing on the flames, to the fact that the "all the way" burger here includes red onions and jalapeno peppers.. . The staples at Bonnie's are what keep me coming back, and they are:. . 1.) The burgers - duh. 2.) Amazingly high quality salad. 3.) The fries - MAN OH MAN are they good. 4.) Incredible looking (and tasting from what I hear) buffalo wings*. . Besides the lovingly-prepared food, they stock a good but limited variety of microbrewery beers and the desert menu is fluid -- it's always best to ask what they have.  The staff is all engaged in keeping the dining experience laid back and hospitable.  If you ask for suggestions, I think they give honest answers.. . *Disclaimer - I don't eat chicken (long story), but I have recommended the buffalo wings to friends and family, and they've always been well-received.
