Stopped in the other night while @ the new library and again, great friendly service with good food.  It was early and quite enough on a rainy night.  We wanted a window table but the only ones available were for a party of 4.  They usually prefer you to sit in tables based on your group size- makes sense but the 2 seaters were either occupied or nonfunctional due to rain leaking in.  . Service was top notch, very friendly, quick, suggestive and attentive.. Food was good but not great.  We had the pineapple fish curry and it lacked flavor.  All I tasted was turmeric and coconut milk.  Fish was perfectly cooked.  The kale was tasty and I can't remember anything else we ordered.  They were out of all the desserts we wanted :-( so we skipped the sweets.
