This place was pretty gross.  The food came out in like 20 seconds and the meat was like jerky.  Maybe the problem is just with the type of food I ordered and not with the place itself-- maybe I am the problem!  But with these reviews, I expected something a bit more exciting.  This was like some kind of lousy foreign cafeteria.  Not impressed.
