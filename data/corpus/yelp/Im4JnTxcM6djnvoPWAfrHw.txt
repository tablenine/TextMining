Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
Pardon my french...the sushi here is F-in awesome! Katsu-Ya is right on. Each piece that enters my mouth, I yearn for more. . . Must have = Spicy Tuna over Fried Crispy Rice. All of their 'Special' items are amazing and Sashimi always tastes fresh. . . Make reservations if you can. This place gets PACKED during the weekends. The restaurant opens at 5PM on a Saturday, and there were already five parties waiting in the front door including my company. . . Parking = must hand your keys to the attendant/valet folks even if you see an available spot in front of the restaurant. Odd. . . If you're celeb-watching, this is a go-to place. Last few times I've been here, I've spotted a star. No A-listers, but good enough. . . Will come back again, again, and again...
