I was introduced to this place when my cousin decided to have her birthday here. We sat outside the "dining room" area because they DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS for dinner. I was shocked but could kind of see why. Either way this is definately a place to check out if you're looking for a cool dinner spot in DTLA. Very hip and classy without the pricetag. Entrees average about $12 and up. I wouldn't say its a good date place because its pretty noisy inside. Oh and the waiters are easy on the eyes too for both you guys and girls (but more for the girls *wink wink*). Full Bar too!. . My Fav: Portabella fries (super meaty and delish, a must have!), Mussle &amp; clams
