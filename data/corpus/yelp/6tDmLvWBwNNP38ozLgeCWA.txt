I checked TAP out on a first date.  The place is brand new and located on the very busy Peachtree Street across from Shout.  It was very crowed when I got there but the wait for a table was very short.. . The drinks were great, the people were friendly and the outdoor seating is definitely a plus.  The interior is very modern.. . I walked to the location so I'm not sure how easy parking would be.  I'll probably check it out again.  It'd be fun with a group of friends.. . UPDATE: 3/14/08. . So, I did go back and check out Tap.  Not so great this time.  It actually dropped the stars down to 2 for me.  I got so sick.  I'll spare you the details but, I'm definitely sticking to just drinks at this place from now on.
