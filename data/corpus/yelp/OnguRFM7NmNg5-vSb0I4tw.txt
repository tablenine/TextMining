On my way back up to SF I stopped off in L.A. and visited Culver City. I happened upon this cool looking crowded lunch spot, where there were a lot of people sitting on the patio. Hmmm, menu looked good. Hmm, smelled good too. So we ordered. And boy, was it DEEEE-Licious! We had the grilled chicken and mashed potatoes with a side of grilled brussel sprouts. It was part healthy, part comfort food and 100% amazing simple food with a high end palate.  It was so tasty and lip smacking good, I'm still thinking about it. Great music, really good quality tasty healthy morsels, a good crowd, and nice casual low key ambiance.  Loved the patio too. I wish they had more locations, but think they will very soon.
