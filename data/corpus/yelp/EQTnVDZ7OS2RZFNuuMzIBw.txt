Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Yes, yelpers--yes.  . . Umami is the cutest, tastiest burger find in Los Angeles.  After seeing this place not only on the Food Channel but the Travel Channel, I had to put this on my food trip list.  I wanted to know for sure if that original umami burger they sell is worth all the hype.  We get to Umami, which is easy to find, and found a table inside.  There's outside seating as well, but it was pretty chilly.. . First off, they have valet, and as ridiculous as that may sound to some of you, try finding a parking space on the street yourself!  It's worth the $2.50. We valet parked, got our table and didn't take any time to order.  It only took 15 minutes to get our burger and I was happily surprised. . . The burger is the right portion size and served on this nice burger bun.  That cheese twill and the onion relish with the mushrooms and whatever else goes in it was HEAVEN in my mouth.  The contrasting textures and the serious umami flavor was awesome.  I can't say that this burger is mind-blowing, but it's damn good.  My husband is one who doesn't take to a burger easy, and when he finished picking the small bits of meat that fell on his plate he said to me "it's not often that I find a burger that I like, honey.  I like this.  A lot."  With those killer sweet potato fries that we shared, our lunch was complete.  It was the best burger meal I've had anywhere, including the Burger Bar in Vegas.. . Love it, and I will definitely eat here over and over again when I come back into town.  This is a beautiful thing, but not beautiful enough to NOT eat.  :)
