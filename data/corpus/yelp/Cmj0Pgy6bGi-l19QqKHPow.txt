seriously i think all the people giving it 5 stars must have been at continental next door or getting their fix from the Humboldt  pharmacists before going here.   The food is chicken for god's sake and okay at best, the pulled pork is edible and the sides are decent.  The restaurant looks dumpy in an intentional way and is better than maybe reheated chicken, oh wait thats what  they do here.   I mean if someone from the South heck even Southside ate here they would not give it 5 stars.
