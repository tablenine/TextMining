The place is like a brunch factory.  Gigantic space, people everywhere.  The food was average at best.  Sure, there are items with a Southern twist, like the crawfish cakes with corn muffin that i ordered.  The idea is good, but the execution is , meh.  the cakes were small and dry and overcooked.  We also tried the crunchy french toast.  Again, sounds tasty, but the ultimate product was basically toast coated with corn meal and then deep fried.  First few bites were good, but then it got to be really greasy.  but the coffee was acceptable, and the waiter was really nice, despite it being super busy on a Sunday morning.  overall, it was ok.  but with so many great brunch places to go in Chicago, why bother going back?
