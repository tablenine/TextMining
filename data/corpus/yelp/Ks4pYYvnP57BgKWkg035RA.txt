Love this place, I have never gotten something I didn't like...beware of the cupcakes though, defnitely too much and too rich to try to finish by yourself all in one sitting.   The oatmeal/dried cherry cookies are amazing!  . . I especially like to go in the summer since they have a good sized porch perfect for chatting or catching up on some reading.  Watch out for the little birds that will land on your table and slowly creep closer and closer to your food when they think you're not looking.  They're harmless, but they're hungry!. . My only gripe about the place is the fact that they don't appear to have mugs for coffee/espresso.  I often sit and finish my drink while I'm there and hate to waste a paper cup in the process.  They didn't used to have napkins (people steal so many!), but now they do.  So, please, take 1 at a time so they stick around, my frosting covered hands will thank you!
