I have not yet able to try any deserts.. =(. But i've tried the lunchwiches... They are very mouth watering and healthy. . The place is clean and the servers are very friendly.. Overall the food is good and the atmosphere is very welcoming. . Next time I will visit the dessert side of this restaurant for sure!
