Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Better than the Counter.  Still not close to Father's Office.. . Ordered:. . Umami Burger. Hatch Burger. Fries. Onion Rings. . Came out to about $30 with tax &amp; tip.. . The burgers are tasty.. . Don't get the fries.  They are under seasoned and just taste like a plain potato.  The signature sauces are horrible.  The garlic aioli tastes like they put some garlic in some mayo and didn't do anything else.  And regular ketchup would be better than the Umami ketchup.. . The onion rings are tasty.  I like the batter and you has a nice taste of the malt liquor.. . The umami burger was my favorite.  My wife liked the hatch burger because of the heat.  The hatch burger was a little too cheesy gooey for me.  Which in my opinion can mask a weak burger.  So it wasn't bad tasting but didn't make an impression on me.. . I like the portion sizes.  Small, so you don't get too full so you can try other stuff.. . Still no where near a Father's Office burger and sweet potato fries.
