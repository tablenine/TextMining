Restaurant: Ping Pong
Category: Chinese
I have lived in this restaurant's vicinity for years (both north and south of it) and i have never been here.  but the place is always PACKED no matter what day of the week.  especially during the summer when i jog with the dog i am always jealous of the people drinking and eating outside this place!. ANYHOO, i finally tried it on a Saturday night.  I see why people go ape $hit over this place.  the food is very good and it is BYOB.  can't beat that.  there are a LOT of selections on the menu - i could hardly decide what I wanted, they all looked good.  the food was fresh and our meals had a lot of meat without a lot of filler.  the only complaint i have is that my chicken kung pao, which was just the perfect amount of spicy, could have had more vegetables.  The corkage fee, as we saw on our receipt, was $1.98 (99 cents per person? whatever.  good deal).  Also they give you the most amazing chocolate fortune cookies drizzled with white chocolate at the end.. last complaint - server never asked if we were OK or if we wanted dessert.  he just put the check down.  boo!  as a former server,. you ALWAYS try to upsell (without being obnoxious, of course).  all in all i love ping pong and will be back soon!!
