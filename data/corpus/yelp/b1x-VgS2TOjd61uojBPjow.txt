This place gets crazy good marks from the Reader, and it's very cheap.  People talk about their housemade chips, which I thought were just ok.  The salsas, however, are absolutely delicious.  They serve a green one with a significant cilantro hit and an orange one that's slightly spicier and downright awesome.  I put both on my tilapia tacos ($5.50 for 3!), which were SO good.  The fish is grilled perfectly and served with a slice of avacado and pico de gallo, double wrapped in corn tortillas.  Oh, and the guacamole is chunky and near perfect (a little more heat would be nice).
