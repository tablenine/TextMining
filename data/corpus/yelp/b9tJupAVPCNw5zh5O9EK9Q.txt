Category: Sports Bars
This place is nothing, if not consistent. The concept of a higher end sports bar serving a varied menu really works here.. . The service is good and never "in your face" to rush you, at least that's been my experience. Their salads, soups and sandwiches are staples of, well, consistency.. . Their dinner specials rival any of the mid-range chains such as Fleming's. I'm surprised they haven't opened other locations.
