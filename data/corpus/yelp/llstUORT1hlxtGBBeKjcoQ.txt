my home. this place is the best. great vegetarian and vegan options. things that rule the most : HUMMUS PLATE, VEGAN FRENCH TOAST, CHEESE FRIES AND OR VEGAN CHILI FRIES.. . their sandwiches are not that great. and their vegan mac and cheese is weird and bad.. . the enviornment is incredible and i adore the staff
