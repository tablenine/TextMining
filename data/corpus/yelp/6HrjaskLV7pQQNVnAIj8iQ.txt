Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
As a neighborhood pub, Ford's hits all the right notes: a worn walnut bar with comfortable stools, reasonably priced beer, and a soundtrack that favors pre-iPod collegiate staples. Draining pints of IPA, while listening to Widespread Panic and snacking on deviled eggs with cured meats and cheeses, you could easily be in North Carolina, New Hampshire, Colorado, or downtown Culver City. It's the kind of familiar escape where you can effortlessly pass an afternoon.. . But as a dinner destination, Ford's doesn't work as well. Mind you it's good, it's just not great. Some of the specials can be spotty, the cocktails are generally underwhelming, and the check always ends up feeling more substantial than the meal itself.
