Black Raspberry Ice freeze....Try it...Amazing.   Vietnamese Egg Rolls, delicious.  Szechuan Beef on rice, ginormous and delicious.  Portions here are huge, definitely can share with a friend or plan on taking copious amounts home.  This is now going to be another popular destination for me on the weekends.  It's relatively cheap as well, so it won't hurt the wallet and you'll leave stuffed.
