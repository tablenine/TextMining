Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
The menu is enormous.  You're sure to find something you'll like.  I had the Teriyaki Chicken, and it was good.. . The restaurant is a little cheesy, but that can be forgiven as long as you're not one of those people who is all about "authentic" little bistros in plywood shacks somewhere.. . I don't have anything particularly negative to say about the Cheesecake Factory, but there was a bit of a sticker shock when we got our bill.  Were those martinis really worth $10 a pop?  Um, no.. . For  two entrees, two drinks, two slices of cheesecake and a tip, I walked out $80 lighter.  That seems disproportionate.  If the prices were more reasonable, I could notch this baby to 4 stars, easy.. . I consider this a nice place to take your out-of-town visitors or a worthy stop just for the desserts.
