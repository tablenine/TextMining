The Chicken Tikka Massala is my top choice. Not overly spicy, but does have a little kick. Naan can be addictive. Good Saffron rice. I also dig the samosas. . . Walking in and ordering: Head straight for the register. Menus are next to it. Specials are on a tv screen above. Place your order and grab an insane amount of styrofoam and plasticware to the left of counter. Have a seat and wait for your name to be mispronounced over the loudspeaker, and pick your food up from counter.
