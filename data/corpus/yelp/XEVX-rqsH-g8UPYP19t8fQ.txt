Restaurant: The Iberian Pig
Category: Spanish
I have been burnt out on tapas since the Great Tapas Invasion of '07 (see my review of Eclipse di Luna for more information) but the reviews of this place had piqued my interest for long enough. Last night I decided it was time to give the Iberian Pig a chance to seduce my stomach.. . Sangria - Since the untimely closing of Solstice Cafe, I've been looking for a new favorite sangria in town, and I think I might have found it.. . Mussels - This was the day's special. The mussels were fat and flavorful, and arrived sitting in an aromatic broth.. . Manchego Mac &amp; Cheese - What the bloody hell do they put in this? Crack cocaine?! Go getcha some. Actually, don't-- more for me.. . Eggplant Fries - I was a little skeptical because eggplants are like sponges and just absorb the oil they're cooked in. Impressive, these were crispy and flavorful but not greasy. And the spicy aioli-- well played.. . BBQ Octopus - I had high hopes but was not too enthralled by this. The potatoes and assorted vegetables on the plate were better than the octopus.. . Copa Catalan - Ridiculously good custard. Lord have mercy.. . Churros Â - I didn't think I'd actually eaten churros since my high school Spanish class; suffice to say, it had been a while and I wasn't sure if I even liked them to begin with, but they were calling to me. Once again I was impressed by how something could be perfectly fried, yet airy and spongy on the inside, and not the least bit greasy. Plus, that dipping chocolate-- thick, rich, and just a little spicy. Don't forget to wipe off your seat when you're done. . . This little piggy ate way too much!
