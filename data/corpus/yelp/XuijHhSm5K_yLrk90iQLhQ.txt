The half priced rolls before 6:00 on the weekends keep me coming back to Tank.  And that specialty roll with the strawberries ... damn that thing is good.. . It gets really crowded on Saturday and Sundays at 1:30 when they open, so if you want to go for the half priced rolls go for a very late lunch/very early dinner at say 3:00 or 4:00.  That's what I like to do.. . The fish is delish, presentation impeccable, the service is hmmmm a little on the slow side but friendly.  It's on my list of sushi regulars.
