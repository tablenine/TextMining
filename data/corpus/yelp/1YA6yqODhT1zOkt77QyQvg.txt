Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
Roy 's Hawaiian Fusion Cuisine blends fresh local ingredients with European sauces and bold Asian spices. The staff and service always great. My only suggestion would be to add a few new dessert selections. The Hawaiian martini (pineapple infused with vanilla vodka) great but it 's too strong.
