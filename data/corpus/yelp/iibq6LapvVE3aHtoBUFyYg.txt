A fellow yelper had her 21st birthday here and we had a blast.  The crowd that night was very un-LA ish in that everyone was super friendly and just seemed like they wanted to have a great time with the whole crowd which I really appreciated.  CONSTANTLY people would ask if you wanted or needed a drink and if you said no, they'd go up to the bar and get you a water.  It was very strange, it almost felt like one giant party amongst friends despite the fact that everyone was strangers.  It really lifted the mood and I would love to go back.  Very strange and extensive menu, but theres something for everyone.
