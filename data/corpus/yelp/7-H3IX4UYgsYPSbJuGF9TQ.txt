Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
The French dips that made this place famous are well-known for a reason. I like to order different sandwiches every time I've been there just to try 'em all out. Can't say I disliked any of them. I do rate this place a little bit lower than everyone else because while the sandwiches were good, I didn't feel it was as amazing as everyone else raves. Good food, good price, long lines but it gives you a chance to chat with random people who are usually in a good mood when they've got a French dip to chow down on.
