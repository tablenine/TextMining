Went with a group of girls (6) and we were all very satisfied. Good food and pretty affordable, especially when it's all you can EAT...can't beat that!! It's best to go with a group of people due to the fact that there are A LOT of food.. I wouldn't recommend going anywhere afterwards, you leave smelling like what you just ate. Other then that, this place Rocks!!
