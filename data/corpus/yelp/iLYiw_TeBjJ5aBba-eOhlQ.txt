Does Feed really need another 5 star review?  Don't know, but I can't abide giving any less.  Recently went to Feed for my boyfriend's birthday, cause it's our fave.  While we were eating, there was one table of police finishing a meal.  As we ate, I kid you not, at least four more squad cars showed up.  Some of the officers had stars on their sleeves.  When brass is chowing down a table over, you know the place has legs.  Outside, it looked like the place was being raided, there were so many cars outside.. . Even when it's crazy, the staff has always been sweet and helpful.  When you don't feel like regular chicken, try the barbeque sandwiches or burger.  Really great.  Also love the beet salad and corn pudding.  Banana pudding is worth the hype.
