Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I been here a couple of times on different occasions. One good thing about this restaurant is that the quality is consistent. Their salads, prime ribs and desserts taste pretty good all the time. The meat is cooked the way you want it. After going here many times, it starts to get a bit dull and bland. For the first timers, it is an excellent place.. . Remember guys: always get prime rib cooked medium rare!
