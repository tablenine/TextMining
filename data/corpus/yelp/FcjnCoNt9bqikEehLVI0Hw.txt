Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
YUMMMMM!!!!! love this place--i'm hungry just reading the reviews! i have been vegetarian for over 10 years, but my boyfriend is a total carnivore and he love this place as much as i do. he is always a bit hesitant going to vegetarian restaurants with me, but the first time we went to veggie grill he said that it was really good--and not just really good for vegetarian food. the santa fe chickn, bayou chickn, v-burger and indonesian tempeh burger are all delicious. we also love the sweetheart fries (of course), and their veggie chili is really yummy too.
