Restaurant: The Modern
Category: French
If you don't go-- you are missing out. So far-- the best restaurant I have been to in New York. . The modern is very classy yet casual. I went with 4 other friends so I got to try a out a lot of dishes. The sous chef, Eric, was a previous alumni of my college so we got tour of their BEAUTIFUL kitchen and some extra dishes on the table. . So their menu has a one two three-- Its meant to be kind of a three course meal but I only ordered from one and three. I got the Wild Mushroom Soup and Grilled Veal Flank Steak. The soup made my eyes pop out! An unexpected taste! Probably top three soups I have tasted in my life! I must say you must get it too! The Veal was also wonderful! It was veal and bokchoy covered in a bunch of foam! I was like uh.. i don't want foam all over my food but it was like a sauce! It was tasty and definitely added punch to the veal. For Desert, I tried the Buttermilk Â Panna Cotta-- each ingredient in that plate was to die for. I would definately get it again. And I also tried Hazelnut Dacquoise which was also SOO good if you love hazelnut. I tried many other dishes, but I will refrain from writing an essay. But -- the modern will definitely expect me back again.
