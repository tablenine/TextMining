Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Been here a couple times now. Overall a great place with good food! . My sister lives in Burbank and visits this establishment often. . . Everything I've tried from the bakery side thus far is good stuff. From the deli/cafe side, I've had a few items: . . -cubano sandwich. Excellent. My only wish was for more of it! . -plantain chips that pretty much comes with everything here. They're okay. Kinda fun to munch on, but nothing spectacular for me. . -"pork sandwich". The one with the garlic spread. Pretty good! Mine was a tad dry though. . -tortilla soup. interesting. tasted like a liquefied tamale. not a bad thing. . -potato balls. love these things! seasoned ground beef encapsulated by a deep fried mashed potato shell. How can you go wrong with this combination?. . Edit: Â almost forgot to mention... parking in this area is horrible and finding a table at Porto's is a nightmare.
