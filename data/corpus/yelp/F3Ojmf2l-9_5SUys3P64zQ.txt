Restaurant: Fred 62
Category: Diners
Ok, so once you battle all the hipsters for parking and actually get a seat inside (or outside, depending on the time of day) Fred 62 is good eats.. . I have been here a handfull of times, and have yet to be disappointed.  My two favorite things are the Hippie Sandwich, and the White Trash Tuna Sandwich.  I have to say, I think Fred's makes the best diner style tuna sandwich I have ever had.  . . The food isn't the only fun thing at Fred's (if you couldn't tell by the names of the items on the menu).  First, you get to read the play on words shirts that the staff gets to wear!  Second, since Fred's is right in the heart of Los Feliz, you get to hipster watch.  And not just any old hipsters, but celebrity hipsters as well!  (Its a running joke between me and my boyfriend.). . So when I'm hungry, and I'm on that end of town and can't think of anywhere else to go, I always go to Freds.
