Screw IHOP or Denny's...this is THE place to go to after a night of drinks and dancing with friends. I don't care if it's a hipster hotspot...I will gladly elbow my way through the sea of American Apparel and handlebar mustaches to get my grub on. . . My chili cheeseburger was so amazing that I just wanted to make out with it slowly and savor every bite. The mac daddy and cheese balls are also fantastic. It's pricier than the average diner but completely justifiable as an occasional treat. . . The menu was overwhelming, but in a deliciously good way, and I can't wait to go back and sample more plates. Watch out, bossa nova waffle sundae, I'm coming for you!
