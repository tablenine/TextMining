This place was really good! I'm a little skeptical when I go to other restaurants and I see that they have greens and macaroni and cheese probably because I think mine is the best, lol. It was really good, the barbecued chicken was great. The meat was falling off the bone just how I like it, the sauce had a slight tanginess to it rather than th thick, overly sweet sauce that most people use from the bottle. The greens were really good,seasoned well. I wish the bowl was bigger they were so good! The macaroni and cheese was just ok to me. It was really yellow for some reason. The cheese was very thick and and saucey. Kind of like they used the box macaroni and cheese rather than making the homemade cheese sauce but hey...I'm really hard to please when it comes to macaroni and cheese. Overall the place has pretty good food. The atmosphere isn't much to look at but I don't go there for atmosphere so that's fine! I do think its a little weird how they only accept cash...who does that?
