Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I gotta say, this restaurant was, in my opinion, one of the rarest restaurants where they sell such absolute splendid french toasts! Three years ago, my mother was trying to find a spot to open up a new restaurnt and we heard about this famous restaurant. When we came to try it out, the food was absolutely splendid, expecially the french toast. To tell you the truth, despite that my mother always had the dream to open up her own restaurant before i was even born, this restaurant is one of my mother's inspirations to open up her new restaurant, CiCi's Cafe. So I would like to say thank Griddle Cafe, for giving my mother the inspiration and motivation to open up a new restaurant and I hope that you continue living on in sucess. :)
