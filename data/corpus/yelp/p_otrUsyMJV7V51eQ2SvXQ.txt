That brie burger OH GOD!  You have to eat it medium rare it's the BEST.  The sides were gross though and that's why I give this a three.  I had their "slaw" which was just vegetables with like a splash of oil passed off as dressing.  Flavorless and boring. The tator tots my friend had were good, but they were like the Jewel brand I buy.  Not very inventive or awesome dudes!  Too bad you can't get their sandwiches al a carte because the stuff it comes with isn't worth it at all.
