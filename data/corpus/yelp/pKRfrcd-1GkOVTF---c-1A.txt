I highly recomend the #17!  haha, it is really good, nice spicy meat.  Great little place, have no idea if it is "authentic", just know that it tastes really good.  This also is coming from a person that was never really enamored with pho.  I liked it...it just wasn't always on the top of my list.  After my first visit to pho cafe however, this changed.  The service is nice, cool mod atmosphere.  You can tell they use good ingredients as well.  Great place for a quick bite since they bring your food out really quick.  To top it all off, dirt cheap.  Just make sure you have cash since they don't take cards.. . Oh, kinda hard to find, just look for the bridge on sunset over silver lake blvd.
