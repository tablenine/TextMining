What a fabulous experience!  Though I have never graced the Los Feliz location, apparently it is much better--although I would argue that its probably cheaper to go to the grove location.  Since its BYO you can bring anything (including two buck chuck!) or grace the wine shop next store for an OK selection of $20+ priced bottles.  Since there is no corkage fee, this is a great BYO wine location.  The tapas were really yummy, the honey goat cheese with grapes was my fav and the flat bread with figs and goat cheese was a close second, tapas range from 7-20+ and of course portions are small, so for dinner you need at least three per person.  . . It was a bit strange that they dont have wine glasses but rather little juice cups, which probably dont airate the wine properly.  . . Seating can be an issue, and at this location there is no alcohol allowed at the outdoor seats.  On a Sunday night at 10pm we had to wait about 20mins, so I imagine its impossible during prime meal times/ on weekends.  . . Valet for $5 or drive around endlessly for a metered spot.  . . I will def. be returning to this spot!
