I went two weekends ago.  My girlfriend and I were thinking about ghettoing it out and going to the Brazilian BBQ place inside the farmer's market near The Grove, but she was dressed too nice, so we had to go bling and go Fogo.  . . Fogo does not disappoint.  One must overcome all temptations over the salad bar/appetizer bar and hold out for the meat.  The meat's awesome.  I always regret wasting my previous stomach space with a piece of the sausage, which always disappoints.  Next time I go, I'm gonna get just beef varieties.
