I can't tell you how many times I have been here. And it's always the same. Great. The frinkin cinnamon rolls will throw you into a diabetic coma there so good. I had two eggs sunny side up and hash browns. The ham was a little dry though. But what more can you ask for? The eggs benedict were very good also. Tree bucks for a glass of O.J. is standard issue. So I think like the Cubs. They are consistently hitting um out of the park.
