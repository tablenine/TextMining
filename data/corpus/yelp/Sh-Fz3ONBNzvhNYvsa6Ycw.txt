Restaurant: Crustacean
Category: Vietnamese
Items tried during the last visit: . . - Grilled Beef Satays . - Grilled Chicken Satays . - Dumpling Trio . - Crab Cake Salad . - Crispy Shrimp Mousse . - Wild Salmon (main dish) . . The positives: . . - Cool fish tank to walk on. . - A little bit of Beverly Hills scene if you are into that.. . The not so great items: . . - Service, considering the price range, I expect better service, . - We ordered the garlic noodle and they completely forgot about it. . - I was offered a refill on the diet coke and the server never came back with it. . - Long wait time. We waited at least 25 to 30 min just to be able to place the order in. The server was running around serving other tables. . - Valet parking (ok, not really the restaurant's fault), these guys expect you to tip them w/o question. I don't mind paying the $8 parking and tip, but at least be courteous. The parking attendant took my $10 bill and just stood there, didn't even offer to make change. . . - Food . - Crab cakes, relatively small and flavorless. I like the crab cakes from Roy's much better. . - Satays, the ones from an authentic Thai restaurant taste so much better, favorable and the price / portion ratio would be better as Crustacean only gave us little bits. . - The salmon was ok, but nothing to really write home about. For example, the miso salmon from the Cheesecake factory is much more favorable.
