Its all been said, however i'll sum up why 4-stars is perfect:. . 5-Stars Because : if you can get a seat, the food is organic, delicious and unique. . . 3-Stars Because: You will have to wait for a while because this place is small and people eat slow in the mornings.. . So on average your experience will be 4-Stars.
