Restaurant: Fiddlehead Cafe
Category: American (New)
A lack of willingness to drive a great distance coupled with a general disdain for lines led us to Fiddlehead Cafe last Sunday morning. The overall atmosphere is nice enough, but I HATE the cafeteria style seating where you're seated close enough to the people beside you that you feel almost obligated to be inclusive of them in your conversation. Trust me, they're listening anyway. . . I'm a huge fan of brunch and there were some nice options, but nothing special that can't be found at the myriad of other restaurants dotting Lincoln Ave. My french toast was stuffed with Nutella (YUM!) and a few small pieces of banana. It was super sweet, but pretty darn tasty. Throw in some more bananas and i'd be a bigger fan. My friend had the truffled eggs. Eh - they were ok. Nothing spectacular, a little runny on the eggs (they're supposed to be soft not runny), and very little seasoning. The concept is great, but the execution was a little lacking. . . I'd go back to try there lunch or dinner menu, but for brunch, there are much better options.
