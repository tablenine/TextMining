So I finally ended up here - I live nearby. My pulled pork was perfect, my rib meat was slightly dry (I asked for them dry, not wet). I used some sauce to moisten up the ribs and all was good. The mac n' cheese was terrific. I especially loved the baked beans. Nicer than your average BBQ restaurant. A winner.
