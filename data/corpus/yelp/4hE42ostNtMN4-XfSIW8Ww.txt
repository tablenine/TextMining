Holy crap, 66 (67) reviews of this place. Whenever my friends and I have a "What's the best burger in LA" discussion, this is alway my favorite place. Still, half the people I mention it to, even native Los Angelenos, go "Huh?". . It's over by the Westside Pavilion (yikes) and is dee-freaking-lishous. It's counter-service only, so it's not the kind of place you want to take a date to impress 'em, unless you're lucky enough to be going out with someone who would be impressed by this place.. . You sort of wait and hover around, and there's an unspoken "Wait your turn" attitude that is conveyed to other standers by nods and glances. In all the times I've been, I've never seen a fight over a chair break out. Which is saying something, because this place is tiny.. . Once you sit down, you're treated to the super-brief laminated menu and a gruff counterman asks what you'll have to drink. . . "Uh, Coke and a Root Beer?". . WHAMMO! Two paper snowcone cups in fancy little red ... holder things are put down in front of you, along with cans of your beverage. You order, they bring your fries (get 'em) and sometimes they'll draw a little smiley face in ketchup on the spare plate they bring you. Sometimes not.. . The burgers come wrapped and hot off the grill (you can actually watch 'em being made) and they taste soooo good. You'll be in and out of here so fast with a belly full of grub that I bet the drive time to get there takes you longer than the meal did.. . Oh yes, they also have pie. However, it's a crime to pay for pie here. Take it around the corner to Canter's if you've got a pie jones going on once you've had your hot beef injection.
