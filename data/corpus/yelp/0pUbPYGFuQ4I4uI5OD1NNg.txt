Ok. I've had it. So much hating on one of my favorite restaurants....and I honestly don't know why.. . First of all, the staff has always been very accommodating. Especially when I'm anxious. And hungry. (Anxiously hungry?) And arrive a half an hour before our reservation. Sometimes we have to wait a few minutes, but usually we've been seated immediately. . . Seasonal menu (entrees range from $10-20).  The menu is fairly limited with maybe 6-8 selections, plus a few specials...if you want more "variety" go to the Cheesecake Factory.. . So many wines to choose from!  Flights average around $14 for 4 selections.  They even have a 'build your own flight' option.  Monday's are $10 flights!. . Ok and that's just dinner..... . I love their brunch.  Coffee, mimosa's, hashbrowns, eggs in a crock, brunch pizza, eggs benedict (cooked perfectly)...I am a fan of it all.. . Parking isn't fun in this hood, but who drives anymore?  Seriously, take the damn train, or bus.  Last time I checked, it's still socially acceptable to take public transportation.  Or....if you must, they do offer valet.. . Which leads me to my final point: have you seen how adorable the chef is????    Someday I will profess my love to him (after a flight or two).
