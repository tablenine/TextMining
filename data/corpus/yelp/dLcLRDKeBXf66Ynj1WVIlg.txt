First let me say:  I'm a southern food snob.  It's probably the one thing I have the right to judge.  We arrived at 8:30 and were seated promptly.  . . I really like the atmosphere.  It's simple, romantic, and laid back.  People were there in everything from shorts to work clothes.  I dig that kind of vibe.  We also got a very friendly waitress named Buffy.  No lie.  I looked at my date and said I bet she made that up.. . We started off with drinks.  I decided to go with a ginger drink that was fantastic.  It's the first one on the menu and well worth the order.   I had a second ginger drink of a different kind a little later.  I'd stick with these if I went.  We had wine at Krog bar before.. . The appetizers we got were the pimento cheese deviled eggs and the Ahi Tuna.  They were both pretty good.  I've never seen pimento cheese on deviled eggs before.   We decided to split the pork tenderloin for dinner.. . The pork was excellent!  We got it medium.  I've honestly never been asked how I like my pork cooked.  I'd give it a 7.5 on a scale of 10.. . The staff was extremely friendly and definitely helped one another.  It definitely has the feel of family working together.  This is always nice to see.  We skipped dessert, but now I'm wishing I had tried it.  . . I'll definitely go back.  Great atmosphere for a date.  Very casual but still upscale.  That's my kind of scene.
