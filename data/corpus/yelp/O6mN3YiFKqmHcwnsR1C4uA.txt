Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's is yippy-yi-yo yummy.  I was staying nearby when visiting recently and decided it would be worth the wait in line to see just how good the baked goods are.  Well, I was duly impressed with both the quality of the food and even more surprisingly, the service.  We tried all the usual suspects, and then some.  Try everything that looks good, but like all bakery products eat the food fresh; after one day it's old.... . From a business point of view I was impressed with how brisk and efficient their operation is.  I'd go back anytime I'm visiting L.A.. . Oh yeah, one more thing, Porto's encourages photography so bring your digicam and snap away!
