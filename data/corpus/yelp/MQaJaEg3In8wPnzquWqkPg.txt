the burger was probably one of the best i have had...EVER. small, NOT very good for a group...but the food was awesome and the drinks were tasty and the fireplaces made a nice addition.. . will be back again with a small group!. . it is pretty stinky - with the open kitchen...non-smoking, but sometimes i would rather smell like cigarettes than fried foodz!
