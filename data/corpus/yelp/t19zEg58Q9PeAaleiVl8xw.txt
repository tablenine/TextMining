Sports bar or upscale restaurant, that is the question at hand.  . . Very nice inside layout and decor, but with the 8+ flat screens playing sports games, and Beck and MGMT playing in the background, it's hard to tell where I am.. . I don't know if I have high service expectations or just bad luck, but once again, I was stuck with a very overwhelmed waitress.  She had three 4-top tables and one 15 top. We waited a while for our drink orders to be taken, but after she found her groove, she was attentive. . . I was really happy to see a Rose' wine on the menu.  If you like a nice fruity, summer wine, order the Zoe. It's $7 a glass/$28 for the bottle. We then had the popcorn shrimp (yum), the pizza (eh, okay), and finished off with the cookie skillet (amazing). We were more than full.. . The 15 top table  saw us ogling their cotton candy, served in a mini grocery cart. They let us try a little and it was just like the being at the Boone County Fair!  It comes with Garrett's cheese and Carmel corn in the basket. . . The prices are reasonable, so I'd definitely go back again.
