whatever. yea, they were MEDIOCRE, not extremely juicy dumplings (except of course the shao-loang-baos, which are suppose to be filled w/ juice... but uh... i need a magnifying glass to pick one up.), nothing great. they are just cute to look at. and i am not one for cute over GRUB.  this is a daintly lil dumpling house for dainty lil people.  i do have to say their chix ginger soup is YUMMY.  5$/cup?  and the baby little dumplings are wat 7$/order for 10 (i can down 40 of those things they are so little). . anyway, so not worth the hype... but i guess apperances make all the difference here....
