went during opening week around 10:45pm and the place was busy. we luckily got 2 stools and grabbed a drink while we waited for a booth to open up.  the margaritas are excellent and the sodas are tasty too.  tried almost everything on the menu since there were 4 of us.  the absolute winner of the night were the pork belly tacos.  tried the goat, fish, and al pastor tacos as well.  they were all good but the prok belly definitely blew the rest out of the water. dulce de leche milkshake is SO good and very sweet. basically the perfect dessert after a nice taco treat.. . the one thing we didn't really absolutely love was the queso fundido.  there was nothing special about it and i would prefer to fill my stomach with more pork belly than melted cheese.  their tortillas are excellent and hand made. once that walk up window opens up it's gonna get crazy over there.  i definitely feel like you should go there for the drinks and have THE best food to snack on, but for an actual meal it's probably pushing it since there are only about 5 booths. 4 people (3 hungry guys included) and our bill came out to $51!  love it. will be back and recommend to others.
