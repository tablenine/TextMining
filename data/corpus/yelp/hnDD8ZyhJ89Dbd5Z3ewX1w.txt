I was hesitant on reviewing this place just because I have yet to try the other "great" ramen places such as Daikokuya and Santouka, but I decided to write the review anyway because in my mind, this place is just sweat-inducingly good.. . I am a purveyor of spicy foods...I always ask for extra hot sauce at take-out or delivery places and buy sriracha by the bucket-loads, so you couldn't have imagined how ecstatic I was upon finding this gem in the heart of Little Tokyo.  There are about ten different levels of spiciness you can choose from, and I believe two or three soup bases (miso, shio, etc.).  And there are many different condiments and toppings that you can add to your basic bowl of ramen to jazz it up for extra $.  . . My go-to ramen:  spicy shio ramen (I forget where it falls under their makeshift scoville scale) with a pat of butter and three slices of chashu (melt-in-your-mouth-sliced pork).  . . And yes, you read that right: butter.  It adds a rich creaminess to the broth and renders it absolutely amazing.. . I'm refraining from giving this place 5-stars just because I haven't been to the legendary ramen joints (yet).  But, I have been to several other ramen joints, such as Ramen-Ya, Kinchan, Chabuya, and Asahi Ramen (so you know I'm no newbie when it comes to ramen).
