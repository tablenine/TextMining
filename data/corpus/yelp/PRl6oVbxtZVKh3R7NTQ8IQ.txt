An LA "must" but not the best sushi place in town. The atmosphere is fun but loud...not the greatest place to go if you want to have a good conversation. The food is good but expensive....I would pay the same amount for better sushi someplace else. But all in all it's a fun place to go with a bunch of friends. In fact, I prefer to go for some drinks before hitting the bar instead of dinner. Atmosphere is fun but definitely slightly overrated.
