Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
I just love it here. I love the wine, the food, the ambiance. This might be my favorite restaurant in Los Angeles. This and Crustaceans top my list. . . I celebrated my birthday here last year and the food was very good, the wine was nice and bold and the service was superb.. . I almost forgot to mention that it's a bit pricey but definitely worth it.
