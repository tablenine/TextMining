Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Asian Fusion
Joy Yee's Noodle is great and the best Pan-Asian restaurant in Chicago. This location is very large with a lot of seating (uncomfortable seats). Â . . Hands down their Bubble Tea is the best!!! They have the biggest selection of fruits that you can choose from and mix together. Their menu is one of the biggest I've ever seen at a restaurant. There is so much to choose from it takes you 10-15 minutes just to decide what you want. The food is great and the dishes they serve them in are extremely creative. Also, its BYOB!. . The one thing that lacks here is the service. Most of the waiters/waitresses can barely speak english so if you ask them something they'll get very confused and chances are make a mistake. . . For the BEST bubble tea and great Pan-Asian food, go to Joy Yee's!
