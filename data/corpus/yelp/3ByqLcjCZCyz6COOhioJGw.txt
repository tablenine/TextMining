I've never been too fond of shabu shabu but this one is pretty good. I dont know what makes it better than other ones, its just raw meat you throw into a boiling pot. The only crappy thing is waiting for a table. Its at least an hour wait everytime for me. Thats pretty stupid if you ask me. The food doesn't outweigh the wait time for me.
