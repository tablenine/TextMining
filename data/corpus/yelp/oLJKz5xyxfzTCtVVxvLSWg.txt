Restaurant: Six Feet Under
Category: Seafood
Six Feet Under is a real solid place. In good weather the roof top deck is a great place to hang out. I like the bar area inside as well. . . I have tried a few different entrees and have enjoyed them all. My favorite is the shrimp and scallops in parchment paper. So flavorful. All entrees come with your choice of two side dishes. The asparagus is always good - nice and firm. . . The beer selection is good and while the service can be spotty at time, I always enjoy SFU. Â Prices are good for the quality and portions. If you haven't been here, give it a try next time.
