Let me tell you a story, a story about why I hate this establishment. The food is nothing really to speak of. The only thing remotely OK on the menu is the mac n' cheese. But, it's only OK. The prices for the sub-par eating-out food makes this place resemble Disneyland. The staff wear really stupid shirts that say things like "Jesus is our dishwasher." Hardy har har you unimaginative so and so! The wait you normally have to endure makes this place all the more unbearable. Basically, unless for some reason you think the food here is to die for you are wasting your time. You really might as well go to Denny's (which I would prefer). . . Here's where this story gets even better, so the day I decided to never come back here guess what I saw? I SAW A HUGE ROACH CRAWLIN' ALL UP ON THEIR WALL. Oh, the horror! The humanity! In disgust my table, and one more walked out after informing a waiter what was up. So really I, personally have no reason to return to this over-priced crap trap.
