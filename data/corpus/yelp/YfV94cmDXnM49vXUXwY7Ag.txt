Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
The food actually wasn't that good for the price. I by no means mind paying good money for good food, but this didn't line up quite like I thought it would.. . Sure, it's all organic, but the flavor and the quality of the food my entire party ordered was mediocre - no different than something we could have ordered at a much more mundane, family style restaurant. More like a casual-food restaurant for the rich than a restaurant that serves high-quality interesting, innovative dishes. Beyond that, the waiter kept trying to sell us on a wine that a) isn't very good in the first place and b) didn't go with our food OR with what anyone said they like in a wine. Perhaps the chef needs to spend a little more time reviewing pairing and pallet preferences with the wait staff?. . It appears that what you're really paying for here is the atmosphere, which I would give 5 stars. But really, what good are surroundings when the food is like food you've had so many times before, with nothing different or new, at such high prices? . . This place isn't worth it. At least their "deli" next door is good. Go there instead. It's better, more interesting food for your dollar.
