Was in the mood for some martinis so a couple of friends and I came here last night around 9:45. We found an empty table in the bar area as soon as we got there luckily. I ordered the "what a pear" martini which was just okay, nothing special. My friend ordered a chocolate martini which was okay. My other friend has been wanting to try a dirty martini so she ordered one. It tasted like ocean water in a martini glass with olives! Dirty martinis are def. not for us! . . It was a mixed crowed and there was a live dj which was nice. Only downfall was the air quality inside. It was really stuffy inside the place which made it unpleasant so we left after 30 minutes. Also, the music was so loud we couldn't even hear each other talk. . . Next time I want to come here for their happy hour.
