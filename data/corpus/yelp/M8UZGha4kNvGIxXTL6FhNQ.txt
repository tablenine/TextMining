so my brother and I went here one night because we wanted to eat at place that played live music . . first off we went at night so its already hard to see then when we drove up it looked like an abandon warehouse we pulled up for the valet and at this point i was sure the valet driver would be either Freddie or Jason but lucky it wasn't . . once we got inside the music was going, the waiters and waitresses were running around people were yelling and laughing so i figured this was going to be my new spot . . BUT all the noise got old QUICK we were seated at this tiny table and yet i still couldn't hear what my brother was saying so we had to yell the whole time which makes it difficult to have a private conversation also considering that all the seating is VERY close together . . the menu was one sheet of paper with not that many options and when the waitress came over it was a series of yelling back and forth to get my order down . . the food was good and the atmosphere was kinda cool i guess we will have to go on a more chill night so it wont be such a hassle
