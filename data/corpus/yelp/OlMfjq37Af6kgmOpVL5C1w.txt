Not that I am really adding anything new to the 100+ reviews out there, but ended up wandering down to Joy Yee's while visiting my sister who was working near the Chicago area.  The food is average, but the best part is that no matter what type of Asian fare you are in the mood for, they have it all.  "Jack of all trades, master of none" applies here.   My sister and I had some trouble picking out what to eat because of the variety -- the question of "well, what are you in the mood for - korean, vietnamese, japanese, chinese, thai" didn't work out too well.  lol.. . . The tapioca and fruit drinks are texas sized and pretty good.  The place was pretty busy both times I went there, but the turnaround is pretty quick.  Definitely worth a return visit.
