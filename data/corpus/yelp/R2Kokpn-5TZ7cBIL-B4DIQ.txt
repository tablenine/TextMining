Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
I will forever have a soft spot for Square One for these reasons: A) Their staff is always beautiful AND nice. Crush time! They're remarkably chipper even when the line out the door is overwhelming. B) Everything they serve has a farm fresh feel. They support local sources for ingredients, and you can taste the difference. C) They have a very ballsy, ever changing dessert menu. I once had a gray-colored sesame ice cream here. Can't exactly do that at The Alcove. D) Best granola in town. Second best eggs benedict in town (see: Clementine).. . Things I tend to overlook are: A) Prices are fairly high. In my mind, the "sweet spot" for breakfast is to keep things at around $10 or less. Most of Square One's menu items hit just above that. B) Service is usually really attentive when you arrive, and starts to vanish near the end of your meal. C) There is a huge wait on weekends, though they manage the list well.. . Favorite menu items are: A) granola B) steel cut oatmeal C) smoked salmon eggs benedict D) french toast with warm fruit topping E) ham sandwich F) dessert of the day. The sandwiches are all pretty good. The eggy dishes are okay. The sausages are kinda greasy. The cookies are so-so.
