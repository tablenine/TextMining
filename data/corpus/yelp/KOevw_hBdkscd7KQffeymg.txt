Holy Moses, quickest table service ever.  Less than 10 minutes after ordering, our 3 orders appeared on our table, piping hot.  The plantains were good, not great as some of them were slightly dry.  . . We went there for lunch so it wasnt very crowded and there was plenty of parking out front.. . Lots of wait staff on hand to make sure my raspberry ice tea never went dry.
