Very good food.  Not very good service.  . Highlights: the guacamole, tilapia tacos, carne asada. . Not so much: tamales.  . BYOB is nice.  . One thing that really irritated me was that because we were in a large group-- about 10 people-- they did not allow us to order tacos for our main courses.  They gave us some excuse that sounded like BS to me.  Forbid me to order tacos in a Mexican restaurant!?  For that alone, I cannot return.
