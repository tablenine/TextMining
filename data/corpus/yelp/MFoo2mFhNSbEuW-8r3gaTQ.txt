Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
I dream of the Walden sandwich from Bourgeois Pig.  Honey walnut curry chicken  - just slightly sweet and oh-so-delicious, served on foccacia bread with tomatoes, lettuce, onions and alfalfa sprouts.  Or the Old Man and the Sea, or the Egg &amp; I.  Just great sandwiches on fresh breads, and big enough to split (I can never eat more than half).. . I was craving the Walden this past weekend and debated having one delivered, but the true greatness of the Pig lies inside the cafe itself.  It's just a comfy place to be when you need to get out of your apartment for a bit and yet relax somewhere that feels cozy.  Sit outside on the sun-soaked patio, or curl up next to the fireplace upstairs.  Grab a paper or a book from the shelves and kill some time on a lazy afternoon.  The Bourgeois Pig is that type of place.  . . Although be warned that it can get noisy - this place always seems to be busy.
