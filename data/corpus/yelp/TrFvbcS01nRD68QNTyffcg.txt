Restaurant: Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s Red Hot Stand
Category: Fast Food
What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said.. . If you have never been there, you have to go at least once.  Gene &amp; Jude's brings hot dogs to a new level.. . I have been going there since I was a kid.  Not once have I ever put ketchup on one either.  I asked my dad once and he told me not to ever mention that again, especially not at Gene &amp; Jude's.. . The best would be when I got stuck going to driving school after getting a ticket and I would always pick Triton College so I could stop by and pick up a few hot dogs.
