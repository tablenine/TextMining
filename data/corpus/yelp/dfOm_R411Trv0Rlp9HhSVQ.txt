Excellent breakfast spot. I'm a creature of habit and always get the Spanish omelet. It's perfectly cooked, not a spot of brown anywhere. Everything tastes fresh. Fortunately my wife is more adventurous and I've tried a lot of stuff on the menu thanks to her. My other favorite -- the sweet potato pancakes are amazing and come with actual maple syrup.. . Looking at the other reviews, I've had a lot of cups of coffee there and always thought it was great -- strong and tasty. There is one thing they struggle with, though, and it's their breakfast potatoes. They're almost always tough and cold. Everything else is so good it makes up for it, though.
