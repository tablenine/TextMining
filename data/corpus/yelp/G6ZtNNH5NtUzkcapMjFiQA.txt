LaLa's... I found this place a couple of years back and it has never let me down except once and it was my own fault [see warning at end of post].  The steak with champinones and the steak with ajo are amazing.  . . The parsley (I think that's what it is?) oil with bread that you get first is delicious.  My boyfriend and I always practically drink it out of its cute little dish!. . Sides- The salad is always good and the mashed potatoes are TO DIE FOR!  The menu says you can only get 1 side but I always ask for halfers of mashed potatoes and salad and it's usually no problem.  [except for that one weird time where the waiter said he wasn't supposed to but he would anyway, what a douche and no I've been here enough to know you are not giving me special treatment). . WARNING: DO NOT get the chorizo-rice plate.  I was not very hungry when we went for family dinner last time so I thought this would be good.  It was soo ugly! And it tasted disgusting.  Brown mush with flecks of feta. yuuuuck
