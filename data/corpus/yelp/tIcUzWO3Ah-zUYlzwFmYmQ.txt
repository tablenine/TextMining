Needed an authentic place for out-of-town business guests with sophisticated palates including a wine snob.  Food was impeccably presented, the service was outstanding and the wine service was impressive.  My second visit there; however this visit was even more memorable than the first!  The squid ink pasta with sashimi-grade uni was devine.  The 'secondi' selections of rabbit and guinea hen were exceptional.  Wines selected with thoughtful assistance went perfectly with the food.  Definitely a place I would return for special occasion.
