Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Ambiance here is very cool - love the crazy chandelier.  Came for dinner with my ladyfriends on a Friday night, and it was busy but not too crowded.  . . The menu is enormous, and you pick whatever toppings you want on sandwiches/salads.  My salad was pretty good, but not much better than one I could make at home.  I definitely prefer going to a restaurant and ordering one of their creations, not my own.  Jerry's is probably great for all you picky eaters and sandwich lovers, not for me.
