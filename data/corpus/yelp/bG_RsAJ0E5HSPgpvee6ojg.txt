Restaurant: 123 Burger Shot Beer

Yeah yeah yeah you've heard all about the $1 burgers .......the $2 shots.......the watered down $3 beers.......I know all about your recession romance with this place every time your around Midtown....don't feel ashamed we've all been here. . . Somehow though they don't get enough credit for the $5 wings and fried ravioli that's also on the menu. I will destroy a box of Garlic Honey wings with their special BBQ sauce on the side any day of the week . Plus the lightly battered and fried ravioli are good enough to order on their own. . . Even though those little burger sliders are so little and cute and only one insy weensy $1 you WILL rack up a bill here if your not careful..... Addition is Real People.
