Restaurant: The Mermaid Inn
Category: Seafood
The Mermaid Inn is a sweet little restaurant in the East Village with a nice patio and back dining area.   Come for the happy hour, from 5 - 7 pm and receive the famous lobster roll for $6.00 less than the regular price.  Included is a side of nicely seasoned fries and a drink.. . Service was cordial and prompt and the complimentary choco pudding at the end of ones meal was a nice touch.
