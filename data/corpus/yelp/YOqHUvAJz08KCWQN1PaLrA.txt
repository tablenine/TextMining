The crab with noodles is extremely oily but tasty.  The food and desserts are great in general, but I think you're mainly going for the environment and the fact that its a hot spot.. . If you make reservations you'll be fine. . . I mean its a good place, but its one of those places that I've been to a couple times and don't really have the need or craving to go back.  So i definitely recommend trying it out, but don't expect to be wowed
