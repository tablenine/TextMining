Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Yummmmmmmmmmm.......... this place makes my mouth wata.... . This place is definitely better than Aijsen. Actually, come to think of it....I think it's even better than the ramen I had in Japan!. . I usually come here during lunch especially when it's nice and cold outside.  I love my noodles EXTRA EXTRA soft so this place definitely knows how to cook my noodles right.  If you are a first timer, I would totally recommend the S set for lunch.   The spam musubi is not all that great so I would pass on that one.  . . So why 4 stars instead of 5?. . They kind of cheap out on the meat the last couple of times I was there. It literally had 3 thinly sliced pork in a big bowl of noodles.  Plus, the bowl of mince chicken and egg with rice  (S set)  is not the same as before. They use to give you a lot, but now it's only 3/4 of a bowl full.  I guess that's what happens when times are tough.
