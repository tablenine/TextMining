Ok..my first "official" LA restaurant review!? Yippie! Can't believe it's taken me so long since i'm a bonified LA girl now. I've been here for 8 months and have eaten out in more places than most locals who have lived here all their lives?  . Well this place is a winner in my book! So it's only fitting that it's my first review here.  OMG the Mac n Cheese needs to be on the menu as a side dish somewhere?  I got it when i ordered the Pork Chop and holy crap it was the best mac n cheese ive had in a long time. It's absolutely perfect! Perfect portion, perfect cheesiness...but be warned everyone at your table will want to try it because they will see that spaced out, glazed over look in your eyes and that devilish grin across your face like you know you're eating something sooo good but also sooo bad for you. It's divine...truly the best kept secret at Taste.  . I've had dinner there once but had brunch several times and it's always great!  Bellinis are yummy and the yogurt parfait, although uninspired as that may sound - don't underestimate it.  The yogurt is very tasty and the granola (although probably not that healthy) is really good and the berries they mix it with are juicy and sweet.  I also love the Breakfast panini and the Southwest Scramble.  They know how to do potatoes too! NOT greasy and just the right amount of seasoning. Delish!!!  Service is always good here. Nice hostesses and attentive waiters although they seem a bit overworked on Sundays.  Good crowd, laid back and not too "sceney" for a Sunday morning in west hollywood.  I've never had a problem with parking either but i do think i brought the Parking Karma with me from San Fran!  Right on!. Taste will rock your tastebuds!
