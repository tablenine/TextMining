We went to Feast for brunch for my birthday yesterday, and I really enjoyed it.  We didn't have to wait because they took a reservation for my party (6 adults, 1 baby), and the staff was very good about accommodating a one-year-old in terms of location of table and quick service.. . I am not a big breakfast-food-for-breakfast person...  I love breakfast food as a snack later in the day, but it doesn't generally satiate my lumberjack-like appetite.  Well, I am happy to say that I actually had food left over from my meal at Feast.  I had the breakfast burrito (which came with a very fresh salsa and really good potatoes) and I also had the oatmeal pancakes with apple compote and honey butter.  YUM!  I can't say which I liked better...  both were perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  . . I definitely would come back to Feast for brunch.
