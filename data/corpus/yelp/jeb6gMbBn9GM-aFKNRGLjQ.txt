We loved this place!!. . We were staying at the Sheraton &amp; took a stroll to see what we could find. The bakery &amp; little market intrigued us and when we realized it was a restaraunt we decided to try it.. . Prices are totally reasonable &amp; the food &amp; service couldn't be better. My fave was the garlic spinach. The fact that the spinach was so fresh &amp; not wilted down was amazing. Yummm.... . Can't wait to go again!!!
