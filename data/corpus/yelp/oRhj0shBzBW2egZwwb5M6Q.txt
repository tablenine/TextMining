agggh I loved this place so much. Sometimes I find myself waxing nostalgic about their chicken teriyaki. It's probably my favorite chicken teriyaki ever. And their maki! So good! I loved the dragon roll. I loved every roll we tried. I especially loved the seasonal roll we had over the summer, which was wrapped in cucumber and just. So. Refreshing.. . mmmm, Kamehachi. And it's in such a cute area, too.
