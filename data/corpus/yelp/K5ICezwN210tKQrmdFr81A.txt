I was here last Saturday after I was at the micro brew festival, man do I miss this place. The food was great, the service was excellent, and I got really smashed. It sucked to see UCLA loss to Memphis, but oh well.  I use to live down the street from Barney's a year ago and would come quite often. I would probably estimated I spent a good fortune at this bar.  If you live in the area or walking by you should stop by and check this place out. Great during the day to watch any sporting event, and a cool place to hang out at night. The best part is they don't charge a lame cover on the weekends.
