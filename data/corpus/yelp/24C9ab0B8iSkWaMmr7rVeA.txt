Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
I usually hear people talk about Manuel's as a good place to drink. While this may be true, I would like to address another side of this tavern.  Brunch.  You wouldn't know from the outside, but this is really a pretty good brunch spot and here is why:. . 1.  Food has magical properties that makes hangovers disappear.. 2.  Nice mix of breakfast and lunch foods.. 3.  Huge cups for rehydration (see #1). 4.  Always have Creative Loafings to read.. 5.  Servers are usually very nice and atmosphere is relaxed and not rushed.
