Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
I don't know if everybody just has deep pockets but seriously? If it was a couple bucks cheaper then it might be a little more worth it but its a little too pricey for what you get. . . When I looked at the menu I thought seriously?? You want to sell me 2 slices of plain jane bread and MAYBE 2 slices of plain jane cheese for $5!? Get outta here! . . As far as food... again.. seriously... how can you make a bad grilled cheese? it was good but it was nothing mind blowing. I could have made myself 10+ grilled cheese sandwiches at home for what I spent on 1 grilled cheese sandwich at this truck.
