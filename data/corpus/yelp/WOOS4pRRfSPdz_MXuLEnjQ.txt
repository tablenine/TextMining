We went to Spring last Thursday for the Chef's week menu. As difficult as it was to stick with the set menu (and not order the ten million other things that sounded delicious) we did it and it was worth it! First, they sent us a butternut squash amuse bouche that was SO delicious I was afraid the rest of the meal would not live up. Next, we ordered a couple of oysters before the tasting menu: great presentation and fresh taste. The coconut and shrimp dumpling soup (which our server informed us was one of chef's signatures) had all kinds of great flavors and a nice bit of spice in the dumplings. Our server suggested a riesling to pair with it, we were apprehensive but he brought it out anyway and it was a perfect pairing. The tuna and gnocchi second course was spot on and pretty inventive. The one thing I can't stopping thinking about was the dessert. The beignets were to die for! I would go back for those alone.. . All in all, the food and service were fantastic. Easily one of the best meals I've had in Chicago!
