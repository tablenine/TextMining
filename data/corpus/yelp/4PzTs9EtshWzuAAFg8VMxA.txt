Forget this nonsense!. . If you have been out all night partying and ingested large amounts of alcohol, then this place could be a choice if you are maddening hungry and need something. The only saving grace is that it is open 24-7. Other than that, I would hit waffle house. At least you can see what the cooks are doing. This Taco Cabana should only be visited at your own risk.. . The last time I was there and thankfully did not become sick from this experience; I saw a rat in the outdoor patio area. It sent off alarm bells. I am not saying that I saw these rodents in the kitchen but it made me think twice. The place is not terribly clean and the salsa bar area always looks like a hideous mess. Not sure why they don't bother cleaning the joint better. It's not all that cleaner outdoors either.. . I got a couple of beef tacos and they were not all that great. The flavor was lacking and I had to pour excessive amounts of salsa to get any kind of flavor. The chips were also that way too. My advice, go somewhere else if you have a late night fix!
