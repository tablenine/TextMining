The whole reason that anyone really gets into a relationship, I believe, is to get to that point in life where you can quietly read the paper over brunch with someone near and dear to you....this is usually the place where I can get it done. Since the menu is really more breakfast + lunch rather than "brunch," it doesn't get crowded until about noon. Go for the specials...usually contains something involving catfish, eggs, english muffins...occassionally, even pulled pork. Avoid the breakfast burrito. It beckons, then disappoints. . . I also like this place because they use an old edition of one of my Professor's textbooks as a menu cover. When I told him about it, I think he actually started to like my research more. They get an extra star for that.
