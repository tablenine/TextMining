Restaurant: Crust

Crust is not your average Chicago pizza joint.  There has been many times I've taken out of towners here with the warning, "they don't do deep dish..."  Instead they serve creative pizzas with organic ingredients that, while definitely more expensive than your average Chitown joint, can be a special treat.  I grew up in L.A. so I'm used to a different type of pie, but my Minnesota bred hubby digs it as well.  My favorite pizza isn't on their online menu and forget it's name, but it's the one with the fried egg and peas on it.  Random, yes, but totally awesome.  . . Another thing I enjoy about Crust is the drinks.  Again, more expensive than I usually go for, but the cocktails are pretty great.  Last night my Yelper pal Caroline and I stopped by for a drink for my birthday.  Even though they were closing, were still seated out on the patio where we could enjoy the warm evening.  Caroline had a raspberry flavored beer and I had an acai mojito.  Our server was a great guy and we had a relaxing evening.  . . Overall, while Crust is pricey, it's a good place to grab a tasty and unique food.
