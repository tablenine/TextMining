Restaurant: Wurstküche
Category: Hot Dogs
This establishment has slowly become my go-to place. When you're hungry at night, what more can you crave than beer and sausage? After my trip from Germany, I traveled far and wide for good sausage, earning the nickname as "sausage queen."  In LA, this was a much more difficult task than I had imagined. I liked going to the stand and def. not pink's but when wurstkuche opened up, I got really excited. an actual gourmet sausage place! It really brought back memories of my trips up to rosamunde's in SF except... Wurstkuche is in my hood AND they serve beer so I don't have to go bring it from somewhere else. PLUS, their belgian fries with truffle oil is a must have. Everything here goes so well together. Every person I bring here ends up bringing more people here. sausage is viral!!!
