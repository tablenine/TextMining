I'm sorry, I can't rate pinks on their line, their hamburgers, their burritos, their spicy polish whatevers, all I've ever had the 50 or so times I've been there are their chili cheese dogs with mustard and onions and their chili cheese fries with onions. God Damn I love them. Are they gourmet? Do I care? They are messy, they are made with probably garbage ingredients, god knows what's in the chili, and give me more please until I explode (BTW maybe they are made with only the finest ingredients - how the hell would I know...and why would I care? ;) ) . . This is Pinks and I love them
