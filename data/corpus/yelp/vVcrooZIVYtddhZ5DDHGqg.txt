Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
My favorite restaurant and the best steak ever! We try and get our Mastro's fixing at least once a month.  . . You must start with the blue point oysters. They offer a atomic horseradish that will clear any sinus problem you may have. If you have a big party try the seafood tower. The tower usually comes with large shrimps, crab claws, lobster tails and oysters.  They charge per person, which is $80, but you can order say a 2 person order for 4 people to share. . . You can't go wrong with the Rib eye or Prime Rib both cooked to rare plus(+).  The Prime Rib is usually sold out if you have a late evening reservation. The 2 person Porterhouse is good if you have them slice the meat into strips before bringing it to your table.  The steak sizes are usually large, so don't be scared to split a steak with your fellow meat lover.. . My favorite sides are the Mac n Cheese, sauteed mushrooms shoestring fries and onions rings.. . I can confidently say that Mastro's is the best steakhouse ever and I have tried almost all the best steakhouses in LA.. . PS- The secret to their steak is that they use a Jaccard meat tenderizer before cooking and adding a coat of white truffle oil after.
