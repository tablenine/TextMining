YUM YUM YUM! food was superbo! service is whatever, but i don't give a shit about service since i grew up eating @ chinese restaurants where service was non-existent. so any service @ all is wonderful. Â . . but anyway, back to C &amp; M. small quarters... very close together seating. If you're on a date, you'll be all up in their personal space... YAY!!! (time to get touchy feely). . Its a really great place to go and experience!
