I dined on Sunday for the Tapas Special. My first taste was the special Mojito. I've never had a Mojito that tasted like that... and not in a good way. It looked like they used dried mint... Ordered the grilled asparagus, the ceviche (mahi with ginger and jalepeno in lime), and the short ribs. Ceviche was middle of the road - not a home run, but good. The asparagus was great. The accompanying sauce was great with the taste of the asparagus and the taste of the grill. The short ribs came with some kind of sweet rum sauce. When I tasted the ribs with it, I actually almost spit it out. HORRIBLE. The server said its a hit. Maybe past patrons were drunk or had not taste buds. To finish my experience, my server let me sit for 10 minutes with no drink and no water waiting for my bill. Not impressed. Will not revisit.
