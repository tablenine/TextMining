I came here to eat with a couple of girlfriends, one who is Thai. She was so very impressed with the authenticity of the food, as was I. We ordered quite a few dishes, and they were prepared very well, and served similarly to the way they would be served in Thailand (or so I was told). Even the Thai iced-tea had a distinctly better taste to it than most that I have had. Our servers were very friendly and even gave us directions to some of the best Thai dessert houses which were just down the road. The only thing I regret is that we were not there when the Thai Elvis performed, and our valet parking attendant left an alcohol-like smell in our car. Small details :)
