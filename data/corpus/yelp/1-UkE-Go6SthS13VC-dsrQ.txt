Why do people wait an hour or more to eat here? That is the question.. . My excuse was that I had signed up with a secret shopper organization, and was getting a $40 gift card for my trouble. I figured, I'm reviewing things anyway, might as well receive some remuneration, right?. . One of the rules was I had to go for dinner at a particular time, and apparently 6:00 p.m. was when everyone in the world came downtown to hit the after-Christmas sales. I was not thrilled to wait an hour for a table, but rules are rules. The nice lady at the hostess desk informed me that the buzzer would not work outside the restaurant. She did not inform me that the upstairs cafe -- with its shorter menu and shorter wait -- was an option.  I had to figure that out on my own.. . The decor of this place is so bizarre -- the puffy tubelike ceiling made me think of intestines, and all the food moving through them. Ew.  Our service was delightful and the food was not half bad.  I really enjoyed my Cashew Chicken Salad, though I would venture to guess that about half the cashews were peanuts.. . And the cheesecake? Meh. I prefer Eli's.  . . People, don't wait an hour for this place, especially if you have hungry, cranky little kids in tow.  There are better places a stone's throw away.  Food Life at Water Tower Place, for one.  . . FYI -- they take reservations for groups between 2:00 and 5:00 p.m.
