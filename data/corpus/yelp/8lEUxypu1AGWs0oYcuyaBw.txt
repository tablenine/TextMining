One of my favorite places to take people who visit from out of town.  When I lived in Logan Square I went much more often, but I'll be back.   I've tried about 10 of their dishes and was impressed by every single one of them. One of my favorites is the spaghetti with white clam sauce.  So. Good.  Makes me hungry just thinking about it.  They also give you this amazing parmesan dip with bread to start.  Careful, though, it's so good it's very hard to stop.  I've been known to make myself full before dinner even arrives.   . . The fixed price is too much food for me, but one night they let my friend and I split it.  For $20 or so, total, we split an app, entree and dessert.  Which was PLENTY.  I don't know if they commonly let people do that, but we were appreciative, and it made me love this place all the more.  . . Obviously it's Italian, but it actually reminds me quite a bit of restaurants in southern France.  Cozy but not too tight a squeeze, nice art on the walls (I'd actually like to buy one if I could afford it and/or if they were for sale), and the staff is friendly.  Ok, that's not particularly French, but...   The owner's also always very friendly, so it's nice to see her business doing well.   . . The waitstaff in general does a good job.  Professional, not too in your face, but attentive.  They also have some really affordable wines by the glass.  Overall, it's totally affordable without skimping on flavors.  An absolute favorite...
