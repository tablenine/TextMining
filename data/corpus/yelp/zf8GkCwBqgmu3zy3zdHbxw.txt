WOW. I'm glad you can't change the format of the burger here, because it was absolutely perfect anyway. The sweet potato fries with garlic aoli = yum. The beer selection = well, you could wander back and forth all down the bar in a daze until deciding, there are that many, including some of my favorite microbrews from the Pacific Northwest.   Large place but cozy, great patio for happy hour.   . . The communal sink area was a bit discombobulating, but oh so trivial.. did I mention the beer selection?
