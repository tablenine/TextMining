I was pretty torn about what to rate this place.  If I was rating this place solely on atmosphere and for the view then definitely it would get 5 stars.  The view, decor, location, garden . . . it's all amazing! However, I was pretty disappointed with how so-so the food was.  We ordered sushi and I've got to say that I've had much better, fresher tasting sushi elsewhere.
