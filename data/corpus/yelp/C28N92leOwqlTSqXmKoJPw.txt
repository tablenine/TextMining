I find this place really mediocre.  As its been said, don't go here for the service.  I also find their seating about the most uncomfortable I've ever had the displeasure of sitting in.  Food's nothing special, ditto on the coffee.   The two points of light for me are a) the extensive tea list, and b) the mango jet tea.  whatever it is, and maybe I do not even want to know, it's crammed full of sweet-tart goodness.  Should I go back, I'll order some carrot cake and hot tea, and bring some sort of lumbar support.  Then I should be good to go.
