I'll admit it - I picked a place near the theater that I'd not been to before so I could Yelp about it. Seeing as how Strip is directly across from the theater, I thought why not? There was half price sushi to be had and I at least had a general idea on what to expect since it's another Here2Serve restaurant.. . There were a few rolls here that I've not seen on the other H2S menus, though all the rolls I was able to try were great. As usual, it's not authentic, but it was pretty decent. Everything was fresh and crisp, and not drenched in too much sauce.. . Unfortunately, there was a huge shortage of servers last night. Bartenders from upstairs (where you sit to get the half price sushi on Tuesday and Thursday) were having to bring out the drinks downstairs, and the lone server upstairs was having to work the bottom floor as well. Our group was a little bit bigger so we had to sit on the balcony, and at times it felt we were forgotten. I understand the situation, though, but it was a little disappointing that we had to scare them into thinking we were doing a dine and dash to get our checks passed out (every time our server picked them up to bring them over, she'd get called to bring food downstairs).. . They run a lot of various deals and specials here, so if you want to try it out without spending a lot, come during a happy hour or lunch. Half off sushi is Tuesday and Thursday, and there's a Monday-Friday special with reduced price entrees downstairs.
