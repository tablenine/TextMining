I recommend going here for the sake cocktails - refreshing with nary a taste of alcohol.  The atmosphere is also a bonus but most of what me and my friend ordered (1 app, 2 sides, 3 hot dishes) didn't leave us very full or wanting to come back. Some spices would have helped out the beet salad and the highly recommended rice and mushroom burger. The mushroom polenta dish however was addictive and flavorful enough to warrant us finishing the small plate. It would also have helped to have had any sort of lighting outside.  Being able to see what were probably colorful dishes of seasonal veggies would have helped to improve the experience a bit.
