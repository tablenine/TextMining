Restaurant: Reza&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Middle Eastern
What a let-down! We walked in to find three people standing at the maitre'd counter, all laughing amongst themselves -- they didn't even notice us until after several awkward seconds. The restaurant was chilly, and had its ceiling fans running, despite the 30 degree temperature outside. The menu was lengthy and indecipherable in places (think: trashy Mexican restaurant with dried salsa on some of the menu pages).. They had no by-the-glass wine list to speak of, despite having a separate wine list -- I ordered Merlot of unknown vintage; it was drinkable. Not fantastic, but drinkable. The tomato lentil soup was Campbell's tomato soup with lentils and about sixteen tablespoons of dried basil and oregano stirred in: weak and overdone. The kabobs, though moist, were not 'on the stick', as any American wants it, and the oddly-shaped mound of couscous was dry and unpalatable. There were no other kabob-style vegetables in either of our dishes, but there was a good-tasting sauce made almost entirely of mushroom stems.. Highlights:. Delicious, fresh-from-the-oven afghan-style bread.. Staring at cute guys walking along Clark St.. Given its location, I thought I was going to a fresh take on middle eastern cuisine, and ended up eating at something much more low brow. Unless you're absolutely dying for Middle Eastern food and can't find a good Indian place to eat at, eat elsewhere.
