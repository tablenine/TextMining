This joint smells like a latrine. The last time I came here, I walked in and walked right back out because of the intense odor of methane gas and cleaning solution. Almost gagged like my first encounter with a baby carrot.. . The place may have changed but the wings still taste like 'pigeon stool'. . . Beware of the dueling ass-banjos in the lavatory... Make that laboratory, who knows what the shit is culturing in them Petri bowls. . . Someone pull the chain pweez... Better yet, wrap it around my neck.. . You gat a reel purdee mouth, chicken head.. . Cluck.. . Cluck.. . Flush.
