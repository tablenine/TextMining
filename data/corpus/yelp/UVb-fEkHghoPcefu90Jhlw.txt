Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Let me begin with what not to do:. 1.  Come here on a hot day because this is an outdoor place with plenty of hot barbeques and no AC.. 2.  Underestimate Soju thinking that the BBQ and banchan (side dishes) will somehow slow down the affects of alcohol.  . 3.  Come here before your final destination, especially if the destination is a club.  . 4.  Bring a date expecting it to be romantic; unless, your partner or you are turned on with the BBQ, Kimchi, and cigarette smell.  If this is the case, you will be ripping off each others clothes in the restaurant.  . . We went during the summer (#1 don't do) because there were a few non-Korean business contacts that an aunt wanted to entertain.  By the way, the aunt is only a few years older than me.  Her clients wanted to experience the whole ktown journey: AYCE (specifically requested no-frills) Korean BBQ; Soju; and ktown clubbing.  . . The restaurant accommodates groups of 4+, 10+ and 20+, which is great because it promotes lots of nonsense.  As you know, I'm down with lots of nonsense.  If it was me and I was using the business expense account, I would have gone somewhere else.  However, I was just going along for the ride and drinking for free.  The food is mediocre but the whole vibe promotes bottle after bottle of drinking (#2 don't do).  Afterwards, I wanted to go home to freshen up but; her associate wants to stay together because he just called in to get the private room at Karnac (#3 don't do).  This all leads to a memorable night that probably should be forgotten.  . . By the way, I know better than to break #4.  However, as soon as I find someone who really likes all three at the same time, I'll break it.  . . Bottom line: Don't go for the food but go for the experience.
