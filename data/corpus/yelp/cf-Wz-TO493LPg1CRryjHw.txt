DTF is the world's most famous Hsiao Lung Pao house- well among the chinese speaking world.I have friends who would drive there at the drop of a hat and brave long queues on the road and at the door.. . I had the Spicy Beef Noodle soup - good very Taiwanese and good on a Â cold night. Their chicken stock they use as a base for their other noodles is good too( I had the pork cutlet noodle).Hsiao Lung Pau like anything handmade can be inconsistent. But nevertheless pretty good - cant go wrong with the DTF
