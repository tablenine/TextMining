Restaurant: Taco Mac
Category: American (Traditional)
Taco Mac has average to below average food, but they have an extensive beer list and tons of TVs. Its a great place to watch a game and have a brew.. This particular Taco Mac is the nicest I have seen - they really did a great job of improving the atmosphere from when it was Stool Pigeons.. I'm sure I'll be back.
