the salad bar is in fact really good, but i really dont think it'd be worthwhile if you dont eat meat.  the meat here is SO good. totally worth it + the sides and the salad bar are a really nice touch.  i would recommend going VERY hungry cuz seriously, it's all you can eat.  At first it seems like they're not giving you too much, but the small slices of meat are all you need.  the chicken and sausage is actually really good too, so make sure you leave room for those.  definitely want to go again when i am no longer a poor college student.
