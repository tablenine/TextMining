AMAZING.. . Everything we ordered was delicious, literally no complaints.. . I had the Scallops which were out of this world.  When we go back, it will be hard for me to try something new because ever since I had them, I've been craving them again!. . We also had a vegetarian at the table and they offer great options for that.. . Also, check out their frequent diner's club.  The first time you sign up you get a free $25 gift card!  They also own Gioco across the street, which I'll be trying next.
