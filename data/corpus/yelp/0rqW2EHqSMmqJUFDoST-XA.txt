Went here for a friend's birthday dinner for the first time.  The concept was nice, however, the prices were not.  My hubby and I shared the 2/3 pound burger and a basket of sweet potato fries, and we both had water.  We left there with approximately $20 less in our pockets.  Again, this was one burger and sweet potato fries, that's it!  We could've gotten the same thing, but better, at Vortex for half the price.  If it wasn't for the outstanding prices I probably would've have given this place 3.5 stars for the service and food.   . . Tips:  . -Do not get blue cheese on your burger.  They put so much on it that it totally overpowers the whole burger.      . -Have your burger cooked one level higher than you would normally order it.  We ordered it medium and it came out med-rare.
