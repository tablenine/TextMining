Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
I've been looking for a good deli/diner since moving into town. Oak Tree is OK - nothing special. Eppy's is good, but it's just a sandwich shop. Eleven City Diner reminds me of a cross between a great diner and a New York-style deli (Carnegie, Stage, Katz's).. . Their pastrami on rye is very good, and the matzo ball soup was authentic - a tender matzo ball in a not-too salty chicken broth with a few carrot slivers.. . My wife fell in love with their macaroni and cheese - a rich, creamy, hearty casserole (even better with the optional non-kosher ham!).. . Service was attentive, and brusquely friendly - what you would expect from a NY deli.. . Desserts are also great - multilayer chocolate cake, homemade pies, cheesecakes, and Homer's ice cream.. . This is my new comfort food spot in the south loop!
