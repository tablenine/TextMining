Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Lately I have a thing for burger and been trying out different burger joints in town so Umami burger was one of them.. . The place was small but clean. Its kinda easy to miss even though it on La Brea. I always bypass the area but never notice this restaurant until I discovered on yelp.  There're valet guys for this restaurant, Wow!. . The meat was cooked to perfection and the meat was definitely FRESH. Mushrooms, Tomatoes  and Grilled Cheese all worked perfectly with the burger itself.  The vinaigrette also enhance the beef patty's taste.. . Their fries are pretty good too.  I ordered the big chunky steak fries but next time I will try their regular fries.. . I realized many people visiting here are the first timers and been recommended by yelp.  My only gripe for this place is that the portion is quite small for the price that we are paying.
