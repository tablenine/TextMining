Wow!!  It was so much fun- our group of 12 was split into 2 tables which prompted a drinking contest. Our waitress and the host started counting for us, letting us know who was winning. Too funny! I split 2 kinds of burgers with a friend- the mushroom burger and the Big Kahuna. I definitely reccomend the Big Kahuna, so yummy! I probably wouldn't go here with just 1 other person, bu defintely great for a group!  oh yeah- AND the drinks are really good!
