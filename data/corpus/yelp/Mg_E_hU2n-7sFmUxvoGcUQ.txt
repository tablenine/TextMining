I am faithful to my ciudad.  Damn it if these aren't the BEST MOJITO"S EVER!  . . I have been for dinner a few times, and it's always pleasant and fine, but the main thing that calls me is the bar food.  Ciudad has some of the best bar/tapas in L.A.  It's my favorite place to go for SUNDAY HAPPY HOUR!  Get the argentine empandas, mini cubans, grilled artichoke, Mojito's, catalan bikini, cumin fries, mojito's, mojito's, oh and have another mojito.. . Late night happy hour 9-12 friday and saturday, $4 mojitos and yummy treats.. . Parking is a pain, you have to fork over $3 to park in the garage, be sure to get validated.
