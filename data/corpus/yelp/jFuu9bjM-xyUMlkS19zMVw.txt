This is the only Deli in Hollywood for me baby.. . A bad date took me here seven years ago and while we didn't fall in love at the deli, I feel in love with Canter's.  Love their reubens, yummy fries, delish Dr. Brown's sodas and yummy pickles.  The service is always what it is, not necessarily prompt but they get you your food.. . It's really bustling at 3 or 4 am when all of the drunkards are needing their fix.  Last time I was there the place was packed and these drunk SC guys were throwing things at some ladies.  The ladies got up and nearly kicked the guys asses for being so annoying.  Where else in LA will you see that?. . Do not forget to pick up some halvah on the way out.  It's a tasty tasty treat that will do more to clog your intenstines but it's so good.  . . Only kvetch (yeah, my inner jew is coming out) is that parking can be tricky sometimes.  But whatever, it's worth the little hassle.
