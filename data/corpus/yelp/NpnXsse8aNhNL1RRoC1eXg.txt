Bland diner food.  The burger was suggested to me over French Dip and all the other interesting choices on the menu - so you must assume that if they suggest it then it must be a top notch tastin burger.  . . it is the only burger i have tasted that had absolutely no flavor - it actually tasted like water.  It was awful.  I only ate half.. . Also - after reiterating 4 times that I did not want any 1000 Island on it and the waiter asking if I would like it on the side instead it came right on the burger - they sent it back and scraped it off and returned the same (and now cooled down burger) back with the cold fries.. . It's low end diner food with attitude - they are too trendy for their own good.
