First off, this is the place to go if you want fruity drinks or drinks that you can set on fire.  The Mai Tai's will get you wasted.  But they do serve a mean mojito.  I am a mojito snob and often they'll be way to lime-y.  But at Trader Vic's, they know their booze.  The lime and mint were perfectly muddled.  . . The decor is fabulous and I love the music.  It's just loud enough without being overwhelming.  It's definitely a great place to go for dates.. . The food is exceptionally tasty even though it is a bit pricey.  But it's totally worth it.  The Macadamia Nut Encrusted Mahi-Mahi is to die for.  I also love the fact that you can get a side of pad thai noodles.  And save room for dessert.  The Bananas Foster done table side is amazing.  Trader Vic's puts their own spin on it by adding macadamia nuts.
