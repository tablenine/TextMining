If you go to Versailles you're probably going to order the garlic chicken or if not that, the BBQ. I go for the BBQ personally, and man... what a plate! What makes it great is not just the flavor, but the texture of the chicken. It is smooth, moist and just falls off the bone. Delicious. If there is a Versailles near you then you owe it to yourself to drop by.
