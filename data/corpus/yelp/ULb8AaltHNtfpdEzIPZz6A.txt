The best French Vietnamese fusion restaurant in Chicago.  (Vietnam used to be a French colony so a lot of my Vietnamese friends - their parents speak French - that's for the other review that thought that French Vietnamese food was a weird combo).  The dinner menu is all Vietnamese; French influences are evident on the wine list, which has selections from Burgundy, Bordeaux, the Loire valley, Alsace and Champagne - definately get the zesty cold beef salad and the the duck and the coconut curry shrimp is really good combined with their rose champagne!
