My absolute favorite restaurant in the LA area.  I can't get past that lovely, slightly smoky flavor in the ground pork the sprinkle on top of the noodle dishes.  And their shaved ice is as good as the stuff in the night market in Taiwan (added bonus: they probably don't toss their blocks of ice straight on the alley floor).  I love the spicy wontons and their sweet sausages.  Everything is good -- I wish it were closer to the Westside.  Going there is like traveling to Mecca once a month.
