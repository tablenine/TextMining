This is really a 3.5, but I'm going to be generous because I love that they're all organic, right down to the vodka.. . Drinks:  5 stars--You know you're in a good place when the drink menu is twice as long as the food one.  I had a grapefruit cocktail and a strawberry one-- both delicious!  One more of either would have done me in for sure.. . Apps: 3 star.  Had the mushroom and onion and the roasted sweet potato antipasto platter.  The mushrooms were great-- big pieces and boldly flavored.  But the sweet potatoes were disappointing-- not very flavorful and they were kind of undercooked.  We also ordered the chips with homemade dip.  Very disappointing-- pretty much Ruffles with french onion dip.. . Flatbreads: 3.5 stars.  I loved loved loved the shroom pizza.  The combination of the mushrooms and cheese were perfect.  We also had the two arrabiata pizzas--  one with sausage, one with shrimp.  They were both very spicy, and the spice kind of overwhelmed any other flavor.  The rest of the pizzas looked interesting, so considering how tempting the drinks are, I'll probably be back to try the rest of them.
