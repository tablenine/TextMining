Restaurant: Vortex Bar &amp; Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
I have only been in Atlanta for a year and I love to try new places, so I am always disappointed when someone suggests going to Vortex. This place has great food and service, but I just want to experience all of the restaurants in Atlanta....I guess it is just the Yelp in me.. Funny thing is, I can't argue when someone wants to meet for lunch on a weekend afternoon.  The food is your classic American faire and there is nothing better than a burger cooked to order with a side of fries, after the previous evening's activities.  Oh and yes, I did say a side of fries.....I know most Yelpers love the Tater Tot's, but I don't think they are all that...in my opinion, you only get the tots, because everybody else is doing it!!!  The fries will always be the bomb!!
