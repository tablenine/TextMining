I've gotta admit that there are only two things on the menu I can order, since I'm a fishatarian. That leaves me only the tofu taco &amp; the quesedilla &amp; kimchi taco. I chose the former and it was REALLY scrumptious! Many others have pointed out how miniscule their portions are and it's true. But if I had three of these puppies it would probably be comparable to a gourmet dish somewhere else for $6, so it's 6 of one 1/2 doz of another... Even though I love kimchi and I love quesadilla, the idea of combining them is like, I don't know, a mayo and jelly sandwich on squaw bread - sounds really wretching!
