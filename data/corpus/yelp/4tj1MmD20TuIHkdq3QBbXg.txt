Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's hot dogs. Not that amazing...I still don't understand why people wait in line for so long.. . Don't get me wrong though...I was happy with what I got (chili cheese and jalapenos). The wait is just ridiculous.. . PS: parking does suck major a-hole.. . PPS: GO TO LARRYS CHILI in BURBANK!! You will not be dissatisfied.
