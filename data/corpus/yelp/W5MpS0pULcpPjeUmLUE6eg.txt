Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
BIRTHDAY DINNER HERE! :D Omgggggg I haven't had French food in such a long time (...since France...actually). How I miss it soooo.. . I went with my parents, who went immediately to Little Next Door despite my protests of, "No! That's NOT the restaurant!!!" We were seated pretty promptly in the piano room. We went right when it opened, so it was empty and really cozy. :) I love the ambiance of the place (my parents, on the other hand, do not appreciate French food or culture. Cry).. . I couldn't decide between the lamb and the sea scallops, but the waiter immediately assured me that his favorite was the Pistachio Crusted Seared Day Boat Sea Scallop with a Saffron Sauce (he actually said, "The scallops, for sure" instead of that long rant). My mom had the Roasted Black Cod with a Preserved Lemon Sauce, and my dad the Lamb Shank Tajine with Quince and Spicy Baby Okras.. . The lamb was amazingly tender, the fish perfectly roasted, and the scallops impeccably pan-seared. The tastes were so fresh and the meats amazingly tender. Mmm it was good. And it was filling. The portions weren't huge, but it was enough to make you fairly content, especially after a piece or two of that fresh bread they serve with their own blend of balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and some spices.. . The bill came to be about $150 including tax and tip. Pricey, but worth it. The service was kind, the food was what's to be expected, and the experience amazing. :). . ...LOVE.
