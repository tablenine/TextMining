One of my favorite restaurants in the world. A twist on the typical diner that I knew so well growing up in NY.. . Best to visit here with 4 people or less.. . The place is a favorite hot spot - but not a new one - there are lots of Los Feliz and Silverlake yuppie types that fill the place up.. . Still, I have never had anything that can compare to Bearded Mr. Frenchy - worth trying even if you DON'T usually like French Toast. You'll never have anything like this elsewhere.
