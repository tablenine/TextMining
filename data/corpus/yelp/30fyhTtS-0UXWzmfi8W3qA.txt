The filet mignon was excellent.  I went with a group of friends, and 2 of them ordered the porterhouse to share.  It looked great.  Their garlic mashed potatoes side is yummy and of course, the turtle macadamia pie is ENORMOUS and very yummy.  They use Haagen-Daaz ice-cream.  The waiter said they change some of their desserts everyday, so you may not find the same desserts on the menu when you go back.  I have heard the chocolate cake is also incredibly delicious.
