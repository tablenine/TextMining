Restaurant: f2o Fresh To Order
Category: Sandwiches
WOW!!!! Exhausted from my walk from work, I finally made it here to f2o Fresh To Order establishment today for the first time. Having already read the online menu before the long walk, I drooled over which meat I was going to add to my salad. I ordered the 1/2 World Famous Wedge Salad with Corn Chowder as my soup. Meat topping I selected was Burboun Steak. . . I must say this is a great lunch for under $20!!!. . The salad was fresh and soup very delicious!!! I also enjoyed the crossiant roll that comes with it.  Drink was Fiji. Normally I'd get sweet tea but it's water for me today.. . The inside is a beautiful zen-like settings that just puts one at ease although it is slightly cramped. I think it offers wifi too!. I really enjoyed relaxing near the window watching pedestrians go by. . If you haven't eating here yet, you must give it a try. . Although, I do wish f2o have more dessert options than giant cookies.   . Also, is there any way pretty, pretty please can you deliver during lunch hours as most of us are gone from work by 5ish.
