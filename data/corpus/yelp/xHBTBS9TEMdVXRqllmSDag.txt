I've been going to Panes for a good 10 or so years ever since I was in high school and the kick ass prices and quality has not changed a bit! Panes' food is always fresh and like others have said, seems almost homemade. Whenever I need a good loaf of sourdough (garlic-oregano is my fave), I always come here since they make it fresh everyday. The cavatapi pasta with veggies and goat cheese I can eat everyday, but I also like to grub on a portabella or popular sandwiches (tomato foccacia - yum!) every now and then. And the monster cookies... oh the monster cookies... those are a must for dessert.
