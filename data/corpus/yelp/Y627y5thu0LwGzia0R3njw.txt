I went here to see a friend who had a DJ set that night - the two stars are pretty much due to the music.. . The food, which came in tiny itsy-bitsy portions, was bland, uninspired and mis-cooked (overdone, underdone - it depended upon the dish). It didn't taste particularly nasty but it certainly wasn't any good.. . The drinks were alright but overpriced, which I expect to happen in the area, but other places at least have high points that make up for the overpriced drinks.. . The atmosphere was alright. The booth was sort of comfortable but we had to fight for it... even though we were ordering food they hardly wanted to seat us at it, which brings me to another point : the service stunk. The waitress was slow, ignored us and lagged on bringing our drinks a whole five feet to us from the bar. Blech.. . Completely unimpressed. I don't know if I'd go back, even if one of my friends was playing. . . Spend your money somewhere else. There's better places to listen to music.
