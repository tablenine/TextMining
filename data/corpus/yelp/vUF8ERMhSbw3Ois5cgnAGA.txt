I have been here quite alot of times when I came to Los Angeles for vacation getaways and nealy every time I came for their pastries at the front bakery. OH MY GOODNESS THEIR PASTRIES ARE SUCH GOODY GOODNESS IT IS SO NICE. I am a very picky eater and very health conscious about what ingredients are in my food but when I come here, I could care less about everything except what I eat. . . PROS. -All the turnovers are so absolutely blissful goodness (get the Apple!). -All their cookies (especially chocolate coated). -all their pastries. -Got a custom 3 meat sandwich. Rye bread with pastrami, corned beef, and salami. Comes with sauerkraut, coleslaw, and a pickle. THe sandwich was so big with gigantic portions of meat the sandwich was literally about 3 inches thick of meat. I nearly would get lockjaw from trying to open my mouth to bite into the sandwich. THat sandwich has got me craving for those sandwiches all the time since I came back home to HAwaii. . -Friendly workers. THe old guy at the bakery front can take a joke well and answer your questions in a nice manner and the deli dudes were very patient with my inconsistency on what to order and my indecisiveness. WHen I got takeout in the daytime, they let me sit in and eat my order in the bar.. -Turnover + pastrami/corn beef/salami sandwich is the bomb. -matzo ball soup is ok. -huge portions. I mean HUGE. . COns. -Dont get the spaghetti plates as they dont seem to compare with the other stuff. -Can be expensive on the wallet
