Restaurant: AMC Fork &amp; Screen
Category: American (Traditional)
If you manage your expectations wisely, AMC Fork &amp; Screen can be an OK night out at the movies. I mean, you can get beer brought *right to you*, so they've got to get some credit for that.. . I really do love the idea of this place, it's just the execution that stumbles a little bit. Despite having re-opened for a little bit now, they still don't have their full liquor license (they are serving beer and wine, however), but that's probably for the best considering their cocktail menu prices (and something tells me one of their mojitos probably would just make me sad, anyway).. . I agree with one of the other reviews -- the food descriptions are written in a way that'd make anyone hungry -- however what comes out is often markedly different. But if you compare that to typical movie theatre fare, it's actually not *horrible*.. . I wasn't a huge fan of the chairs, either. It felt a bit like watching a movie in a conference room at the office.. . All in all, I'd probably go back, but I would probably eat ahead of time, and just enjoy it for its beer-delivery goodness.
