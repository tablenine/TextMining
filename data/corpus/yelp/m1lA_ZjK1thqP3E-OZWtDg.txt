Really!?! . . Really, Naha!? Despite your recent rave reviews and 4 star rating on Yelp I was thoroughly disappointed with your poor Restaurant Week display. . . Really?! Naha, how long had our food been sitting in the window, under the hot lamps,  turning to mush before someone wearing a nuclear power plant suit had to deliver our entrees? Really! . . Really?!? Did you not notice that I ate two bites of my food, because it was an atrocious mess?  Really?  Probably not because we saw our server twice: to take our order and to pick up his tip. Really? Do the bus boys do all the work your your restaurant? . . The portions? Really? Naha, you left me starving. I had a bite of my boyfriend's quail and one potato wedge and that was about half of his meal. Really?!? Was I paying for food smells? . . Really Naha, I'm really disappointed in you, and I won't be back. Really.
