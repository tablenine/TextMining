Restaurant: Southern Sweets Bakery
Category: Bakeries
In the land of low acheivers, Southern Sweets appears to be a standout. The key word here is 'appears' - because scratch the surface and Southern Sweets' offerings are no better than the middle of the road bakeries in just about any other sweets-loving city.. . Yep, I'm that cynical bastard from out of town. But if you need to know one thing about me, it is this: I evaluate baked goods for a living but you won't find my name in print. I travel all the time, and I make it my business to know what's great in every city I visit and seek it out. After reading the stellar reviews here, I thought I was going to be pleasantly surprised by the quality and deliciousness of everything I tried. I was wrong. Really wrong.. . First let's talk about the way the baked goods look - they're oversized, just like the sweets at Cheesecake Factory. That's right. I just compared this joint to Cheesecake Factory. I'll concede that Cheesecake Factory is different in that they have a much larger plant - two actually, where thy make their stuff. And - just a guess - I can't imagine that Cheesecake Bakery offices have as many cool cookbooks as Southern Sweets has on display. . . The cakes I tried - allegedly the best Caramel Cake around and an apple spice cake and a red velvet - just didn't impress. I didn't like the texture and at room temperature it just didn't perform. I wasn't able to try the fresh baked pies, which looked amazing. Perhaps next time I'll have to pick up a couple to test them out. . . OK Southern Sweets. I'll give you another chance. Sometime.
