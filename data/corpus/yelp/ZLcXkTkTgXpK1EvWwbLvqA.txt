My friends and I waited over an hour to eat at this place...OVER AN HOUR!  And guess what???  Totally worth it!  We each got something different and everything was well worth it!  The pancakes were so good, we licked the plate!  The portions are really big so you will have enough left-over for your next meal.  This is a great place to go to for a long weekend brunch.  Don't expect to eat quickly!  Grab some great friends and get ready to stand around to wait for a table but it'll be totally worth it!
