I'm into Bahn Mi sandwiches and I heard this place has good ones.  I ordered the special Bahn Mi sandwich which is the grilled pork, Vietnamese mayo, sliced carrots, sliced daikon, a slice of jalapeno, one sliver of cucumber, and cilantro on a french baguette.  It was very meaty and tasty, but I would've like more vegetables.  All in all for $2.50, you can't beat a better sandwich for that price.
