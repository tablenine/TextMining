Restaurant: Gene &amp; Jude&#39;s Red Hot Stand
Category: Fast Food
I don't eat hot dogs on a regular basis, but when I get a taste for one, Gene &amp; Jude's is where I go, usually on my lunch break....hadn't been in a long while and I stopped by last week.. . When the fresh cut on the premises fries are "fully cooked" and not under cooked, greasy and limp, they are DAMN GOOD.  I always ask for mine "on the side".....you'll get MORE in most cases!  I HATE UNDERCOOKED FRIES WITH A PASSION.  The hot dog is a hot dog on a hot dog bun with mustard, raw onion, sport peppers and relish.  LOL!  I prefer all garnish minus the relish.. . P.S.~There is one guy (wears Mr. Peabody glasses &amp; Cubs attire on the regular) who I refuse to order from....I've witnessed him in years past doing yucky things (touching his nose/face) with his hands and then preparing people's food, etc.  If I make it to the counter and he's the one I figure I'll get, I'll let the person behind me order; or if I'm the last person in line and I get him, I'll pretend I'm not ready to order until someone else walks in and I'll let that person go ahead of me.. . I noticed during my visit last week that the Gene &amp; Jude's staff are now WEARING PLASTIC GLOVES when preparing the dogs, fries, etc.!  Hip Hip Hooray, I think!  I did witness one guy constantly touching his eyeglasses and then preparing people's food.. . THAT IS ALL!
