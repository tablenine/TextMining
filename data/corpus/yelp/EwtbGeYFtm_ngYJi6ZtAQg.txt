Inside the front window area is a raised platform with low tables and cushions for sit-on-the-floor dining.  The food is priced okay; expect to spend $15 on an entree + drink + tip.  I prefer the salads, but the tuna gets high marks too. . . The tea selection is amazing; I've only seen better at Bourgeois Pig and maybe Peets.  Personally, I go for the tea. . . Seating on the main floor is cramped and limited, and the tables are small, so you will be brushing elbows with your table neighbors when it's busy.   . . There is a boutique area at the back with "world market" type stuff, such as masks, scarves and other knickknacks.  I would rather have more seating.  Plus, all the clutter makes me think about dust and cleanliness and food safety, which can really put you off your feed.
