Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I live in Hawaii &amp; sometimes I haven intense cravings for Orochon #5.  I absolutely love their ramen.  A lot of people miss the delicious fried rice so definitely order fried rice &amp; if you're a gyoza fan maybe a small order of their dumplings.. . Orochon is bomb!!!
