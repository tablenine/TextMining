a solid four star place (at least for brunch). . here are the details:. . the portions are large, the food is cooked well, and the taste is right on. i ordered the huevos rancheros, and thoroughly enjoyed my dish. my friends ordered the goat cheese omlette and another veggie omlette. both were very tasty -- somple, but good. . . we also ordered a side of the turkey bacon which was DELICIOUS!! a little skimpy on the portions, but i guess three slices of turkey bacon is more than enough. . . staff and overall service was also very good. expect to wait, and you won't be seated until your entire party is present.
