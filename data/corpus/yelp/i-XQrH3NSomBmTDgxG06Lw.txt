Savoy, oh how I love you and have yet to find another place whose Hainan chicken comes close to yours.. . Since my girlfriends and I were in LA this past weekend, I was very insistent that Savoy was a place we had to go to for Hainan chicken.  I mentioned that we would meet one of my friends here at noon.  He got here around noon to put our names on the list while we drove in the opposite direction (seriously LA, I don't know which way is west or east, what happened to left or right?!) .  Once we arrived around 12:15pm, we still had to wait another 20 minutes or so for a table.  . . FOOD:. **Note: CASH ONLY!!**. *Hainan Chicken - YUM!  Generous portions of slices of dark meat is served with chicken rice.  Accompanying the dish is hot sauce and a delicious ginger sauce - don't worry if you run out of sauces, just ask for more.  . NOTE: Dark meat costs $2 extra, but for every order of white meat chicken, the costs will cancel out. . *Shrimp rolls - Delicious!  A crispy Shanghai lumpia like roll with a tasty shrimp mixture is simply delicious!  . . *Ice Tea - You cannot come here without ordering an ice tea (free refills) with the chrysanthemum syrup!. . SEATING:. *Indoor - seating or bar. *Outdoor - a nice mist comes from the canopies for those hot days. . SERVICE:. Comparing my past and current visits, I find that sitting inside, you get better service.  When you sit outside, you'll find yourself looking or attempting to wave down servers if you need them.  Because there is usually a wait, don't expect your after meal convo to take place that long, they'll put your check down on your table and start eyeing you every once in a while until you leave.. . PARKING:. Street. . Until my next LA trip Savoy...
