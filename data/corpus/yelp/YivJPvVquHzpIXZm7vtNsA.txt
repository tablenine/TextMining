Good food, drinks; HORRIBLE service! I've visited this establishment 15 or so times, giving chance after chance because of the solid food (Pancakes w/ Bacon cooked in, good burgers) but I do not plan to go back. . . Each and every time I've gone, with large groups or small, the service has been terrible - worst in the city. If you live in the area, it might be worth trying, but go late night on a Saturday when their 'a-team' is working. Almost the whole staff is completely incompotent.
