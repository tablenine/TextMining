Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
The first thing you always want to consider when going to Pink's is the line. Been in L.A. for over a year now, and a friend's visit spurred the trip out to Hollywood to check out this time-honored institution. . . We went around dinner time on a Sunday night. Waited in line for a total of 35 to 40 minutes. . . I ordered a 10" dog with American cheese, yellow mustard, and bacon. My buddy got the famous Chili Dog and we split some onion rings.. . 3 Stars. Nothing mind blowing (although bacon on a hot dog is pretty ridiculous ... and awesome). It's just good ol' down to earth fast food without the corporation behind it.. . Outdoor seating was nice and available. Hot dog was what's to be expected. Onion rings were your standard fried-from-frozen fare. No complaints, no raves. Just happy to say I went to Pink's.. . Probably won't go back on my own anytime ... most likely it'll be reserved for friends when they visit.. . But if you haven't tried it and you live here ... and you like hot dogs ... and bacon ... you can't go wrong at Pink's.
