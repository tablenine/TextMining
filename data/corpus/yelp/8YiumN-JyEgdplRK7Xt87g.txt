Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
my favorite taco stand! my family has been coming here for decades and i grew up on titos. i love the tacos with cheese. the burritos are so different from other places... try it with meat rice &amp; cheese. the chips are so crunchy and that watery salsa looks so blah but it is totally addicting. the lines aren't so bad, come in the early afternoon. you know the age old saying, "the only thing better than a titos taco is two." its true.
