Mmmmm..... Two suggestions: Curry Chicken and Coconut Baked Rice, and Beef Cubes with Tomato Sauce Rice, foundations for a good meal. The servings are very large; with a group of 4 or larger we order one less dish than the number of people at the table.. . The service is great if you're used to these kind of restaurants. You'll be hard pressed to find a place that will get your food to your table faster.. . My drink of choice is the milk tea with tapioca pearls. I have never tried anything else because I really don't want to. This is the only location I have found with milk tea that comes close to my favorite milk pearl tea in the SF Bay Area.
