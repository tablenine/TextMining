I'm sorry, but anything that's survived for over 70 years and STILL has long lines on any given day deserves more than 3 stars.  . . Here's the problem, I almost never go here, so when I do I feel like I need to really try everything out.  Which of course leads to over-ordering and over-eating and over-regretting later.  To that end, the girl and I got the 10 inch chili cheese dog, the double pastrami swiss cheeseburger, the Mulholland drive dog and the nacho chili cheese fries.  The woman at the counter looked at us like we were insane.  Which we probably were.  . . The cheese they put on the 10 inch dogs are slices of American, not nacho cheese, and it's not melted, so that's sort of lame.  The chili is very good.  The dogs are pretty good too.  The burger, which had two patties with cheese and pastrami in-between was delicious but felt like every bite was quickly killing me.  Seriously, way too much meat, but somehow a really good burger.  . . The fries were soggy by the end but still pretty good.  My advice is to forget trying to use your hands and use a fork from the very beginning. . . Chances are I won't be back soon, but when I do return, I'm trying the polish sausage!
