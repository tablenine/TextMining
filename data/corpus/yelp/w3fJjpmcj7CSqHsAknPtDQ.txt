This is Review #499 for F.O.  There is no way I could add something new to the other 498 reviews, is there?. . Sure there is.. . The restroom was super clean, although the communal unisex sink area is just a tad silly, isn't it?. . The F.O. burger?  It's very good, although I would have liked bacon on it.  But the sweet potato fries are killer.  And let the bartenders select your brew for you.  Between the wife and I, we tried three different interesting beers and really enjoyed the selections.. . It's also amazing how many new people and tourists come here and have no clue about the "no substiutions" policy.  That's the shtick here, folks.  At least 3 different people ordered near us at the bar and they all tried to delete this item or substiute that item.  Uh-huh.  Ain't gonna happen.
