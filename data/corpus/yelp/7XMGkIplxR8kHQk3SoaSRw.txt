Restaurant: Dantanna&#39;s
Category: Sports Bars
The name after "Dantannas" perfectly spells it out for you... SPORTS BAR, STEAK AND SEAFOOD. They have a sports bar on one side with huge tv's and the "normal" dining area on the other side. The dining area also have tv's so you don't miss out on whatever is on. The food is good for the price and setting. It's a sports bar, you can't expect much. Lots of fried foods, salads, and steak. Service was great. There wasn't too much to choose from the seafood section though.
