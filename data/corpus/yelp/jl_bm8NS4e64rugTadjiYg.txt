Is it considered cheating to think about cake while you're engaged in coitus with your lover?. . That cake...that yellow cake smothered in buttercream frosting, layered with cream and berries.  Little buttercrunches out the outside...like the white pieces in the Good Humor Strawberry Shortcake coating.  Cannot stop thinking about it.  Fevered, quickened breath, mind racing.  Moist cake...fluffy frosting...fresh, juicy berries.... . Oh, GOD..!!
