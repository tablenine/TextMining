Restaurant: Toro Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
The sushi here is pretty good.  It's hard for me to call it incredible when Mirai is out there.  For the price, however, you get large rolls that are tasty- but the selection is nothing like the more expensive joints. . . Now this place maximizes every square inch of their space- all 1000sf of it including the kitchen.  The wait can be tedious, there's little to no room to stand, but they will take your cell # and call you when your seat is ready.  . . Toro is byob and they have a cooler to keep your wine or brews cold.
