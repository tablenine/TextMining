All that and great service too. The staff was warm and very welcoming. The food was very good and a little bit different what I have in my typical Thai, Indian, Mexican, pizza, sushi routine. The Beef Kabobs had great flavor as well as the rice(yes the rice too.) Our appetizers and deserts were equally good; the hummus was especially good and our desert served in a martini glass with some ice cream with cheesecake type concoction was fabulous. Will go again and take more friends. Some people were smoking the hookah pipe it but we could not smell it at all... maybe you can't smell it. Well it was not an issue for us non-smokers and make it feel more authentic.  Staff was great.  Richard the manager and Sarah helped make our evening a great one.. . Go Go GO.
