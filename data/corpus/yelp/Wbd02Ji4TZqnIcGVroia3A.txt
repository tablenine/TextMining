Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I've been to The Apple Pan a bunch of times and it has been great each visit.. . The burgers are juicy and the apple pie is delicious.  The staff is always grumpy in a charming sort of way (you better know what you want to order).  The rustic Americana feel is a great escape from West LA drudgery.. . If you don't go at peak times then you shouldn't have to wait long for seats around the U-shaped counter but be wary of the lunch and dinner crowd.  The line can back out of the door.. . As much as I like this place the price keeps me from coming more often.  It is a bit steep for a burger joint.
