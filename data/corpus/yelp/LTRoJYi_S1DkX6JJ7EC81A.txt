This would be the last place I would have tried if I was choosing, but my friend Chella (semi vegan) insisted that it was excellent.  So I reluctantly tried it out and you know it was excellent!  Sort of like the Green Eggs and Ham story. . . Everything was of high quality, fresh, and tasted great!.  I actually felt like I did food exercise as it made me feel healthier if that's possible.  I have to admit that I had a craving to drive by Titos on the way home for a fried taco to balance  out my indulgence of healthy food.  Seating is outside so it can be limited on a busy night.  Worth a try, and it's a definite place to go if you can appreciate foods that don't say 'oink' or 'moo'.
