Took my mom here for some milkshakes....sooo yummy! Not only good milkshakes/floats, but food too. My mom said it was the best clam chowder she's ever had! That's quite a bold statement for her, she's been all over. So needless to say this place is great. They even brought a menu and our food out to us since we had my dog, so nice :)
