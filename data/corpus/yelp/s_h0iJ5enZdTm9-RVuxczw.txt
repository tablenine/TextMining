Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
Because I missed out on tasting the Grilled Cheese Truck at the LA Street Food Fest, I was on a quest to find/chase the truck to try the mac and cheese with rib and caramelized onions. And boy, was it worth the wait. . . It was as delicious as people have told me and more. Went to the truck during lunch time on a weekday, so the line was not long at all. The mac and cheese with rib was just heavenly, perfection!!!!
