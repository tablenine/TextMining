So, this place claims to be the birthplace of the french dip. I had the traditional beef sandwich, which I wasn't too impressed with. I unfortunately saw the episode of " no reservations" when Tony visited this place after I went here, otherwise I would have asked for my sandwich to be double or triple dipped. This is the only place I've had a pre dipped french dip, versus the expected au jus on the side. They also offer other cuts of meat for your sandwich, so if I ever make it back I would like to try the lamb. It hurts me to say it, but I think Quiznos has a better french dip. Please don't tar and feather me for it!! This place does have a following, so I'll probably have another go at it!!
