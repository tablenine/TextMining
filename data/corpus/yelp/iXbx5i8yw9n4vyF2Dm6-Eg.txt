I was between a 3 &amp; 4 on HB. I went with the 4 as I think if I was more of a daring foodie I would have been even more enthused. In addition to that fact, the little neighborhood bistro has excellent service - the staff is charming, attentive and knowledgeable. I loved that our server explained items on the menu completely devoid of any air of superiority (which you can sometimes get around here!). To my own fault, I was a little undereducated on the menu - HB offers a lot of very different dishes and my husband and I required a little explanation - out waiter couldn't have been more accommodating. We enjoyed the ambiance and will likely be back!
