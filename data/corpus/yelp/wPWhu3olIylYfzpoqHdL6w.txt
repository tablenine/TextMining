Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
I heart the bone in filet.... . . We went there last Friday with my boyfriend's parents who graciously treated us that night to Mastro's. I had heard so much about this place and I couldn't wait to try it. . . We were seated upstairs in the wine room which was perfect because it wasn't so loud that we couldn't hear each other because of the piano lounge but still hear the music which was what the parents wanted. But be warned ask for the table AWAY from the kitchen because there is a table that's right in front of the path of the waiters and I can see that it would get annoying. . . For food we had: . . Crab stuffed mushroom: so-so . . Kumamoto oysters: delicious! . . Wedge salad: refreshing and good . . Bone in filet: to die for tender, juicy and flavorful. A perfect medium rare . . Lobster tail: I never ever had this tender of a lobster meat before. . . Bone in ribeye: good but the filet was better . . Mac and Cheese: so so . . Mastro's mashed potato: so so it was really starchy . . Asparagus: nothing special . . Buttercake: this was actually pretty damn good and i don't like sweets. i imagine i ate about a pound of butter but it was worth it. . . Creme brulee': good . . Lastly there's a crazy dry ice cosmopolitan that my boyfriend's mom ordered that was pretty cool. not really my cup of tea but fun to watch.. . The best thing was truly the steak, I was a bit disappointed in the sides since I heard so much about them. I'll have to try the lobster mashed potatoes next time and the seafood tower. . . What really made our night too was our waitress Adea. She was absolutely amazing and to top it off she took off both corkage and the buttercake. . . Needless to say we'll be coming back for sure. . . Parking was $7 for valet.
