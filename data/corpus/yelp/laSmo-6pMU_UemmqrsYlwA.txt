Not a full review, just curious, am I the only one that doesn't expect gnocchi to "melt" in my mouth?. . I expect them to have a firm texture, not fall apart like a shaped mashed potato, which was the case at Bocado. I liked the sauce and the dinosaur (rar!) kale. . . Chef came out to ask how it was, as did the owner. Felt like a dick telling him I didn't like the style of the gnocchi, so gave the ubiquitous "good". I realize I should probably should tell him my thoughts, but who am I to argue with someone who is obviously well trained? Maybe I'm the wrong one, as there are some people on Yelp (with 2 reviews and no friends/picture btw) that gave it 5 stars.
