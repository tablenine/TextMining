Restaurant: Mary Mac&#39;s Tea Room
Category: Southern
Mary Mac's is a must see for every Atlantan simply because it is an icon.  I can't rave about the food, because in all the times I've been there, it's simply been average and a couple times below average.  The servers have been there a long time (most of them) and it is fun to be waited on by individuals with such a memory of Atlanta and its many changes.  I will say the sweet potato souffle is my favorite in the city, but that might just be because I've never found it on another menu.
