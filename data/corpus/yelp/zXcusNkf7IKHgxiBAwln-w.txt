Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Gastropubs
Adam Fleischman is slowly taking over the burger world. And now he's got some cocktails to add to his army of Umami, also referred to as the 5th taste. Fleischman has opened up a third location of the ultra popular burger spot in Hollywood proper at Space 15 Twenty. And, unlike the other locations, this one has a full liquor license.. . The cocktail menu, created by Steve Livigni and Daniel Nelson of Top Notch Beverage Consulting, features unique Japanese inspired cocktails. Like the Michamami with pickled vegetables, tomato juice, spices plus the secret Umami MSG or the Urban Manhattan with Japanese whiskey, coconut water, mushroom vermouth, and bitters. Try an Aloe Cocktail with Shochu, aloe water, Shiso and lime or a Sesame Song with vodka, chili powder, oj, black sesame seeds, and sesame oil. Finish your meal off with the Drinkberry, a sweet frozen concoction of Nigori Sake, mango, coconut, allspice, ginger key lime coulis and goji berries.. . Of course, the burgers are nothing short of amazing. Gone are the stack of arrogant Lincoln Log fries, the cheesy tots are a must try, as are tempura onion rings. The Hatch burger, is a sumptuous combination of four different types of green chiles with house cheese. Their standard Umami Burger, seasoned with their secret homemade Umami MSG spice, is one of the most flavorful burgers you'll ever sink your teeth into.
