Restaurant: Pizzeria Uno
Category: Pizza
I finally made it to "the institution" of Chicago pizza, where they proclaim that they're the original and draw tourists in by the thousands.  We stopped by on a whim on Sunday afternoon and were seated immediately, which was a nice surprise.. . This was actually my first real Uno's experience, since I never considered the "Uno's Chicago Grill" in Schaumburg (and O'Hare, and the rest of the country) to be a real representation of the brand.  And I have to say, the pizza was damn good.  In my opinion, it's still a step below my favorite, Pizano's, but only barely.  The crust was delicious, it wasn't overloaded with cheese, and the sauce still tasted of fresh tomatoes.. . The whole "authentic Chicago" experience in the restaurant is a bit grating, however - it seems very much a fabrication for the benefit of tourists.  And with the waits being as they are, even before you factor in the 45 minutes to bake the pie, would rule it out for most locals, even.  But, as a once in a while experience, it's good.  It's a shame that Uno's had to dilute their reputation with the terrible, TGI Friday's-esque restaurants that bear their name.  They could expand around Chicago like Giordano's and retain the same quality, yet be accessible to locals.  Instead they're a niche that seems only to cater to out of towners.  Interesting business plan.
