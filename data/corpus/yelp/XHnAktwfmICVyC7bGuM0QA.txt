Just went back for my 3rd H&amp;F burger. Definitely the best burger we've found in Atlanta, and the 10'oclock gimmick makes the whole eating experience feel like a special adventure. The cocktail menu is also impressive. They've changed up their variety quite a bit in the last week, adding an especially deliciousness ginger-infused martini to the list, but be prepared to spend $9-$11/ drink. I've tried a few of the other dishes on the menu (the deviled eggs trio, the crunchy gentleman, the cheese plate, veggie sides), but I wouldn't plan to eat dinner here except for the burger. As others have mentioned, dishes are pricey and not very substantial. I would recommend H&amp;F for people watching. I especially enjoy the sea of business travelers wining &amp; dining their dates.
