only one visit, but from that, previous reviews re the shoddy food are spot on. we ordered french toast and pancakes for brunch this morning. both were just bland, stodgy and tasteless. the menu as a whole seems completely blah. a pity, because they have outdoor tables, and the space and location are great!! service was decent too, and coffee not bad. but the brunch food was the worst I've had in a while...
