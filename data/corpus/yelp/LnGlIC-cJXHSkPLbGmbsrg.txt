Everything I expect from a Greek 24-hour Diner. . Menu comparable to a textbook, portions are gigantic, and always a crowd of Russian mafioso-type people. . Yes, it's a Diner, so have expect a diner experience. . Service is usually fast. . . The portions are probably larger than most people's entire Gastrointestinal tract, but hey, its reasonable. Chicken noodle soup is the best, Greek Salad is swimming in vegetables, everything is pretty average, excluding dessert, which is above average. . Much better alternative to the awful waffle if you are out late and happen to be hungry, just a little pricier.
