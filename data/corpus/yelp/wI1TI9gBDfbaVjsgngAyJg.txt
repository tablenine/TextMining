I met a few sorority sisters here this week for a couple of drinks, and it was very nice.  They had margaritas and loved them.  They seemed to be priced reasonably, and the wait staff was great.  I didn't have anything to eat besides their chips, which were good.  Overall a great place to stop for an evening cocktail!
