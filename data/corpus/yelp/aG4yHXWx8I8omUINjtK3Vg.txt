I don't drink (alcohol) so in order for me to give this place an unbiased review, I had to change the words on the beer menu from "WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION OF DRAFT BEER" to "WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION OF FRUIT SMOOTHIES" and then I thought to myself, "What an awesome place!"  . . I came here with a party of 10 for a friend's birthday and we got to sit in a cozy corner but it was still hard to listen to conversations because the music was so loud.  Either that or I'm going deaf in BOTH ears.  I felt like I was in a club without the dance floor nor the scantily clad women.  . . Anyhoo, I ordered the Seared Ahi Steak Sandwich (seared rare ahi, spinach, swiss cheese, tomatoes, caramelized onions and green peppercorn aioli) and it was delectable.  Quite yummy.  I highly recommend it.
