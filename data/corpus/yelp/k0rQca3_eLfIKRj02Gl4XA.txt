Met up with a few old and new friends here for drinks/dinner, and it was a very comfortable venue. . . for the "sports fan meets beer connoisseur.". . it's peopled and loud, but there's a calm welcoming atmosphere that makes up for the sporty chaos. . . I had two beers (one was Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat!) both deliciously chilled. The guys all enjoyed their drinks as well, and the service was good and timely. I didn't have any of the nachos or pizza we ordered but everything smelled delicious and went FAST. I instead ordered a bowl of salted edamame (which was delicious!). . The one issue I had was that it was a little loud, though it wasn't really their fault. If you're looking for a place to have an in-depth, serious conversation or catch up with old friends without losing your voice, maybe this isn't the place to pick.... . I'd suggest this location for anyone who wishes to see 114 beers on tap, anyone who wants to see the 'big game' in a comfy and fun environment, and to anyone who is looking for a new place to check out.
