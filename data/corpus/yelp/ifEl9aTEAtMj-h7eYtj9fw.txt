From the sassy grannies that show you to your booth (order when they first ask you b/c its hard to get their attention again!) to the wanna-be autumn foliage glass ceiling, this place is a small piece of "Jewish-Deli NY-style" here in L.A. Everyone loves the Matzo ball soup (splurge a little for the veggies) and pickles, but you go here for the meat. Great Pastrami sandwiches, Corned Beef &amp; Cabbage, even the beef tongue is good. Its not NY, but its a start, and just how many 24 hour places are there in LA?
