Came here Saturday morning around 9am so parking was brush on the shoulder and the crowd was nada. I got the omelette with goat cheese, spinach, and sun dried tomato. It was really good!!! You also had a choice of potatoes, fruit, or salad. I got the potatoes which I should have gotten the fruit. I thought the potatoes would be sauteed with shallots or something but they were just golden brown cubed potatoes that you need to have ketchup with. My sister had the belgian waffles again which she already had at the griddle cafe. (BTW, griddle cafe was better) . . They also had a bakery counter. And guess what?! They had MACARONS!!! Too bad I still have some from Jin's so I didn't get any.
