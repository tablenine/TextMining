I haven't been to Sotto Sotto since Halloween 2005.  I found their business card and flipped over to back and this is what I wrote:. . 1) Cape sante- :). 2) Saltimbocca alla komana- :). 3) Pappardelle al ragu di anatra- :). 4) Limocello cosmopolitan- :). . So, I definitely enjoyed my dinner!  I would like to visit Sotto Sotto again, but I'm the type of diner who likes to try new restaurants.  One day, I'll dine there again.
