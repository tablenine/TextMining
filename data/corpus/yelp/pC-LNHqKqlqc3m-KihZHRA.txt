Well this place is awesome that's all I have to say. . .   Actually that's not true, as you can tell if you glance up at the left corner of this review I am in fact 100% Korean so my review may be slightly biased.  OK so before you continue with my review scroll down and find the review by John C.  It's a very insightful and will in fact help you out a little when you go here.  I have quite a few "white" friends that really have had bad experiences here mostly waiting for a long long time, and having really bad service.  I went two days ago with a group of six Caucasians we went on a Thursday around 7:30 and waited for all of 5 minutes.  Our waitress was very very helpful and very polite our food came out lightning fast, and we were helped with some of the dishes.  The Cha-dol Gui is awesome!  So is the Bulgoge, and the be bim bop.  We had a couple of bottles of beer, and a couple of bottles of soju.  It was an absolutely fantastic experience for my friends and myself, plus the waitress was like my mom, it was very important to her that I ate alot because I'm one skinny dude and that makes me feel good.  GO TO THIS PLACE!!!  Be patient and tolerant, and like Mr. C said respectful and you will fall in love with this place.
