Restaurant: Cho Sun Ok Restaurant
Category: Korean
Being Korean and a little bit broke, it's always nice to find a place that serves good, authentic food at an affordable price. That's why I love this restaurant. My biggest complaint is how small it is. It gets pretty crowded at dinnertime. The wait is never too terrible (maybe around 20 mins?) but the restaurant is so small that there is really nowhere to wait. Also, it's awkward to get around the tables/chairs, especially when people are sitting in them. I'd say it's worth it though, for the food. I took my family here when they came to visit and they are still talking about how good the yook geh jang was. The service is ok. Sometimes they won't come by for a long time, which is strange especially when it's packed. You'd think they'd come by more often to try and get you to leave.
