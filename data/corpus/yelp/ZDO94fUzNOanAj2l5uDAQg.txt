I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews but it was good I did. We parked in the pay ($5) lot across the street from Lucky and that worked out fine. There's some dark alleys around there so be smart and pay to park in a well lit place. . . The Food: Awesome! We had a couple of rolls of sushi and it was really good. And we're sushi snobs. There's not a lot of good sushi joints in this town. The sushi here is worth it! Very unique.. . The atmosphere: Cool, chill kinda place. Mix crowd of well dressed folks out for a night on the town. Didn't seem pretentious to me which was nice for a change. The music was very good and not too loud. The video screens are entertaining. . . The service: we read a lotta things about the service here but I gotta tell ya we had a great server named KEVIN. So if you go, request Kevin. He was very attentative to us. Good service is hard to come by these day so we let him know we greatly appreciated his service and tipped him handsomely.. . BTW, there was no wait at 10:00 for dinner. Walked in, sat right down and had a drink on the table within 7 minutes. Nice!. . So check it out
