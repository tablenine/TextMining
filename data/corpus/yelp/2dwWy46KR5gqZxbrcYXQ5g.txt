Restaurant: Rathbun&#39;s
Category: American (New)
This place is elegant but not over the top. I especially love the location. Something in Atlanta begets amazing restaurants in very strange environments. I think it adds a flare of authenticity to Atlanta dining.. . Getting to the best part, the food. One week after Kevin won Iron Chef, I visited the restaurant for the first time. One of the courses that one it for him was his Elk Chops, which I had to order despite its hefty price tag. I'm not one to like food just because it is expensive, as a matter of fact it immediately brings it down a notch. I don't like spending big money on food, and when I do, it needs to deliver. Kevin Rathbun's restaurant delivered on its Elk Chops, and every other dish my girlfriend and I ordered. Â Our waitress, was very pretty, and offered the perfect recommendations. . . I was very pleased with my meal, despite its high price tag. It is a restaurant that makes me proud to be an Atlantan.
