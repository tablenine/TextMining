Here goes my first review on yelp. :). . Living close to 7th and Grand in downtown LA, I have driven by this restaurant numerous times. Finally, during my lunch break from work, my boyfriend and i decided to check this place out. I couldn't sit and dine in because i was already running late. the Restaurant is divided into two section: the restaurant and a section where you take-out pre-made food. they have a variety of selection from lasagnas to chicken breasts, they also have sides like potato salads..... . . i think it was the prime rib sliders but they are $2 and delicious. also, their mini fruit tarts are the best tarts i've ever put in my mouth. it was incredibly scrumptious and i enjoyed every single bite. . . a month later, my gf and i decided to stop by bottega louie for some desserts and we ended up feasting.. . We shared the:. 1) the server recommended the ravioli for starters (House made pasta stuffed with spinach and ricotta in a light cream sauce with pancetta, sage &amp; peas), . i've had my share of good ravioli and it was okay. it was extremely light but i don't think i'll ever order it again.  . 2) portobello fries comes with aioli. it starts off delicious but ends up being really oily. . 3)  the branzino (Imported sautéed boneless Italian sea bass,. micro herbs &amp; scarpa sauce) for our main dish. the presentation was nice. it was bland and a little fishy. i've had better branzino.. . overall, i love the vibe of the restaurant. it's so spacious and the high-ceiling gives it more of a majestic feel. the gold trimming outside of the building and the large wall windows allows you to people watch and enjoy the sun. Finally we have a cool, hip restaurant in LA. :) . . BTW, the service is spectacular!
