Everybody raves about this place, I don't get it. It is undeniably considered an institution, I don't get it. . . I want my hot dog to breath. The bun doesn't have to have poppy seeds, I just don't like a perfectly steamed bun crushed with fries. Now the fries may be great and all, but I ordered a hot dog. I don't consider the fries a condiment and I'm OK with the less than through the garden toppings. . . The key is the Vienna dog and fresh fries, I get that. If only life could be so simple.
