I've only recently started really appreciating Indian food and thanks to Groupon Stefanie W. and I decided to give Veerasway a try. So glad we did! The thing that impressed me the most was the service. Our server was fantastic and adorable to boot. He also doubled as our bartender. He did a great job answering questions, making recommendations, and describing the various dishes in detail. . . I was a bit unsure of the communal table at first since I'm not big on sharing my personal space but it turned out fine and was a good way to get recommendations from others. I suppose it encourages conversation. . . The chips with the dipping sauces they give you were fantastic. I was especially fond of the green one. It was so fresh and tasty! I unfortunately could not stop eating them so filled up pretty fast. I also started off with a Mumtaz Maharita (margarita) which was absolutely perfect. It even smelled fantastic. . My entr√©e was the tamarind grilled steak with whipped potatoes and kale . It was excellent. The chile-garlic butter on top of the steak made the dish. I also had an order of the stuffed mushroom, cream cheese, and ajwain naan. It was a bargain at $4.. . Finally we finished off with a dessert special they had which was some sort of chocolate tart with cinnamon ice cream and a rice foam. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. . . Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to going back and trying more of the dishes!
