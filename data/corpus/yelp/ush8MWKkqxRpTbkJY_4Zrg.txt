Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
My second visit to a Mario Batali restaurant, my second average experience. (read my Lupa review here: . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ) . . Once again, I called one month to the day to get a reservation yet we still had to wait 30+ minutes for our table. Our server was pretty disinterested in us from the start while the bussers were at the complete opposite end of the spectrum, totally overzealous in clearing plates that weren't quite finished. We tried a couple of different pizzas and while they were good, they paled in comparison to the pizza we had the night before at Gjelina. . . Final verdict? Pizzeria Mozza serves some pretty good food but it's not quite worth the effort and middling service.
