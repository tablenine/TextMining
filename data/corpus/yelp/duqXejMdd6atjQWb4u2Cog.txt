I've been putting off my review for Furaibo. Now that I come to think of it, I have no idea why. It's a great place to go for either lunch or dinner both in a small or large group (of course you should expect to wait for large groups). They have a great lunch menu and I usually share the pork katsu curry and the double teba dish (chicken wings) with the boy. The dishes are affordably priced and most come with a side salad. . . MENU:. pork katsu curry + double teba. . PRICE:. ~$9/dish. . fresh's 2 CENTS:. i think it would be difficult to come buy a dish that doesn't taste well. the best way would be to go in a bigger group and order a variety of dishes - family style! plus, they have some well-priced bottles of sake as well. KAN PAI!
