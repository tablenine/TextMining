This is another one of those places that I really want to love - but I just can't.  2 strikes:. . 1 - They only have 2 tables that can hold big parties, which is an issue in an of itself... But here's what happened.  It was January and we were going for a friend's bday.  There were maybe 9 folks, so we had a reservation.  Since everybody wasn't there exactly at reservation time, another big group stole out table.  we waited TWO HOURS until that party ate and left, and we got the table after them. in retrospect, i have no idea why we actually stayed.  everyone was annoyed and restless by the time we sat.  Then the food was just mediocre, and our server was sooooooooooooooooo overwhelmed and slow.  i got something called "breakfast all the time" (sans the bacon) and it didn't taste like anything... but i was hungry (and tipsy after 2 hours at the bar), so whatever...  strike 1. . 2 - i went again this past weekend... the wait wasn't too long... the issue again:  the food. i mean seriously, you're a restaurant, shouldn't food be your specialty?? i got the bbq chicken pizza (sans the chicken)... it literally tasted like NOTHING... how do you mess up pizza? it makes no sense... i barely ate any, and had no desire to take it home for later... it wasn't even worth the calories... we got spinach dip too, which wasn't horrible, but it didn't really taste like anything special... i mean, the food is edible, it's really just not worth the money... steeerike 2!. . Unfortunately for them, I don't allow 3 strikes... sorry luckie!. . p.s. they have like a $20 cover after 9.... restaurants that make you pay to enter kinda upset me... . p.p.s. the drinks are decent... come here to drink and meet sexy men (or women i suppose)... make sure you're good and full before you leave the house though... and get there before 9!!
