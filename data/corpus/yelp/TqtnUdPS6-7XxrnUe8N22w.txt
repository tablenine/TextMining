Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Average food, some great cheesecakes. . Three stars for the cheesecake, topped with fresh whipped cream. Sinfully good.   Eat dinner somewhere else, like the Grill on the Alley or the Saloon Steakhouse.  Have dessert here. And cut the tourists some slack. They just don't know any better.
