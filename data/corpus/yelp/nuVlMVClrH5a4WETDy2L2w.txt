Walking through gray streets of inner Latino Chicago neighborhoods, I was waiting for the "mexican" place that my friend told me was our breakfast destination.. Instead what I found was a quiet, decadent enclave of sparkling christmas lights and hollow-eyed Dio de los  Muerotos skulls.  The thick velvet curtains that greeted us as we walked in, kept the amorously brisk Chicago air out.. No doubt, I was really hung over.  A night out with old friends, making up for lost time--. I expected the food to be better.. I ordered the tortilla egg dish.  It ended up being a soupy mess of fried tortilla chips, eggs, and black beans.  It tasted like egg nachos-- save for all the extra water which turned it into a soggy sogg.. My friends had good enough dishes.  The french toast was fabulous.  My other friend was too nauseous to eat so I can't count him in.  I loved the atmosphere.  Certainly one of those places that deserves another visit, except I live in St. Louis.  So....I'll leave it up to ya'll.   : )
