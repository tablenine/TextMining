Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I've been to almost every gourmet burger joint in LA and a few in OC, and as of this moment I believe Umami Burger makes the best burger.. . I've read reviews of poor service.  But my experience was the service was just fine.  In fact, I was a bit surprised at how quickly the burgers came out after ordering them.  It actually concerned me.  "Was this burger meat pre-cooked and hanging out under a heat lamp?" I wondered as I saw the waiter bringing it over to me.  But the first bite was nirvana...and so was the last one.. . Maybe the fact that I was there at an off-hour had something to do with it.  I was there at 4:00 PM last Saturday, which should be a slow time, but the place was full.  So if you're a little weary of poor service from the reviews you've read, perhaps try visiting at an off hour and you definitely won't be disappointed.
