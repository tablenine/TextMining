OMG OMG OMG! I'm excited cuz I finally get to review Portos Bakery. Hands down, prolly the best pastries I've had. Everytime I visit the parentals home, I HAVE to take a trip to Burbank (despite of 101 south traffic- I don't care). . . 1. Cheese Rolls - holy crap I can't even describe how amazing and delish this is! Especially when they are freshly baked-omg! . . 2. Guava and Guava&amp;Cheese Roll- my second favorite goodie! . . 3. Potato Balls- yummy yummy yummy. . Ok those 3 are a must on my list. There are, however, tons of other mouth watering goodies on the menu. Food wise, the dishes are also good. I don't think I have gotten anything that I didn't like.
