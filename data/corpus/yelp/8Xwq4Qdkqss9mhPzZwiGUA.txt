Restaurant: Greek Islands Restaurant
Category: Greek
Whenever I get a craving for Greek food, I somehow always wind up here. Though there are many choices in Greektown, I like this one the best. I like the interior of the restaurant, with all the crazy different levels. The waiters are cute and flirty, and fun to dish with. I LOVE the beet appetizer (so simple, but so good) and the creamy potato/garlic spread (though I just spoon it up without the bread. Hopefully one day I will travel to Greece, and then I will know if this place is "authentic", but it suits me just great. And . . . bonus - free valet!
