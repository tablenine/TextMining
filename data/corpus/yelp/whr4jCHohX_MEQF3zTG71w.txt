Cheap ($5 for a basic banh mi), delicious, and fast.  I order lunch from here about 2-3 times a week, and even that doesn't seem enough.  Generously stuffed sandwiches, but be prepared for a crowded lunch hour in a small space.  Call or order ahead online to skip the wait...though the sandwiches are definitely worth the wait, anyway.
