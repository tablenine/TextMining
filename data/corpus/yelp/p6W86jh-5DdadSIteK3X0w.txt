We learned about the Kogi BBQ truck last summer from my niece ~ Anyway, finally had the opportunity to sample some of their specialties. . . My husband and I sampled the short rib taco, short rib burrito, short rib sliders and kimchee quesadilla. The short rib burrito was good and the best of all the items we tried. We prefer beef so we did not try the chicken or spicy pork. The kimchee quesadilla was definitely different. Can't say we found that cheese and kimchee compliment each other. Â Plus they drizzled hot sauce all over the top which made it very messy to eat. . . Found the prices to be on the high side for what you get, definitely not budget friendly like Rick C. mentions in his review. Overall, the food was okay, but would not go out of my way to follow them. Too many other options to check out still.
