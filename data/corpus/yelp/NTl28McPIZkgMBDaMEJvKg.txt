Two visits:. . #1 Heavenly vanilla latte, yummy single shot.  Good house tater chips.. . #2 Orange infused cappuccino - ick and way too much cocoa power, jelly donut espresso, eh.  Yummy sliders, peanut butter cup dessert excessively petite for $9. . 50% chance you will have condescending service.  If you can allow yourself to be victimized in exchange for the posh caffeine infused atmosphere as I may on occasion, what the hell.  . . The beans are $16 per pound, bring back the tin and I think its $3 off next time.  My problem is that these beans are NUTTY.  And I mean they taste like roasted nuts.  I'm afraid to try again but my in-store beverages weren't nutty so maybe someone threw these in the nut roaster by accident.  ????
