Restaurant: Pura Vida
Category: Tapas Bars
I've always loved Pura Vida.  I've taken some serious LA foodies to this place and they loved Pura Vida.  So I've got back-up!. . Now on to some info that you might not be able to get elsewhere ... this place isn't really set up for large groups.  There's one large table in the center of the restaurant and I believe it seats 12 max.  Call just to be sure before you finalize your plans.  But "max" means max.  The height of the table is much higher than all of the other tables in the restaurant which means it uses special bar chairs.  So you can't even pull any additional chairs over if someone shows up.  Also, they only reserve the table twice per night at the times are pre-determined.  Again, call to see what those are.  But there's not much flexibility with that.. . I took a bachelorette party there and we had a tremendously good time.  The owner or manager of the restaurant came out with a very cool caraffe filled with champagne and showed us how to hold it at arm's length above our heads and let the champagne flow in!  It was hysterical and a great way to start off our night.  And the champagne was on the house!. . Also on that night, the restaurant helped with parking validation.  But I think they will only do that for their large groups.  It seemed like a covert operation that I won't blow for the owners!  But hey, I had a safe place to park my car for the night so all is well.  Ask about it if you are there with a large group for a special occasion.. . Just love those tapas.  They are the best in Atlanta.  The Foie Gras on Banana Bread is just absolutely amazing and SO unique for a tapas place.  Oh, I just love it ... might have to go this weekend and see if I can add another star.  :)
