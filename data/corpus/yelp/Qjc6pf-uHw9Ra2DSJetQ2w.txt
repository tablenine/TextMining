Wow, was this place bliss or what? How can you go wrong with garlic, butter, spicy goodness, and fresh seafood? Maybe add some cold beers and excellent service? Well my friends and I got just that on Memorial Day. We got there just when it opened so no wait. After about 10 mins they were like 100 people waiting outside. Yikes, were we luckly. Only thing I would suggest next time would be to bring gloves as my hands (after washing 3 times) still smelled like what I just ate. But well worth it! For sure will be back!
