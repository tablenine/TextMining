GREAT service even better LOBSTER. If you want Asian style lobster this is the place to go. The minced filet mignon aka luc loc however you spell that is one of the best in sgv. All in all the best family style authentic Asian food. only bad thing is eating here on the weekend sometimes a long wait but definitely worth it.
