Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I wanted to know what the hype was all about when I heard about Pinks on the Food Network. Luckily, I came on a non-busy hour so I didn't have to wait 30 minutes in line just to order. I ordered the Martha Stewart hotdog...and it was really good...but messy. Its not the BEST hotdog in the world...but I will admit that this spot has pretty good hotdogs for a good price.
