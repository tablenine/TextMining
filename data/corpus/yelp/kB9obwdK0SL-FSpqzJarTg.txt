It's actually about a 3.5... That is generous, but considering their competition (any other normally priced Asian restaurant) they are on the better side. . . The gingersnap cookies are the bomb.. Try the basil elixer.. . Can't say what's best.... just good all around.. . I am totally burned out on this place... but I have eaten there over 20 times for sure.
