Best Brazilian barbecue in Los angeles. As a good Brazilian I have being at all big BBQ chains in Brazil and Fogo de Chao is the best. The service is impeccable, huge Salad Bar, succulent meat, (try the picanha), great wine list. Just come really hungry and ask your server for the white rice, black beans (feijoada) and the yucca in order to have the genuine "churrasco" experience.
