This breakfast spot is awesome! The drawback is that it is tiny and you will have to wait to sit down. But it is worth it! The crab egg benedict rocks! Also they're pancakes are the best I have ever had. Fluffy inside and just a little crispy on the outside- great! The service is very friendly and prompt- its not "semi-rude diner-like service." Go here now!!!
