Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Today, let us focus on the beauty of Pink's onion rings.  These babies are battered (not coated in that corn mealy crap), light, fluffy and oh so very tasty.  They weren't even greasy, which made me want to rate Pink's with 5 stars.  . . We waited in line for a whole freakin' hour. And, I was thinking to myself, this better be damn good.  We had chili dogs, which were tasty, but didn't put me over the moon.  But then I ate an onion ring...... . the clouds opened up, and a ray of light shone down on my little onion ring basket. It was as if Jesus made them himself. They were absolutely divine.  I wouldn't wait in line in the hot sun for an hour just to get a dog. But, I'd definitely do it again to get me some more of those tasty rings.
