This restaurant is good for one things: the view.  Perched atop the Hollywood Hills, this place is gorgeous and romantic, the perfect place for a first date.  The food, however, is definitley not worth the high price.  The sushi is below average...fish is not very fresh.  The entrees are good, but very overpriced.  Drinks are good.  I would go here for drinks and appetizers, and to enjoy the view, but I would skip dinner.
