Mitch is the king of Chicago sushi.  He makes amazing creative rolls, but the regular pieces of sashimi are some of the best fish I've ever tasted, as well.. . I love all the crunchy stuff - Oh My God roll, MJ roll, JJ roll.. . There is always a wait, but we just go down the street to the wine bar until Toro calls us.  Service is friendly but slow.  Lots of fun for a date or a big group (especially if you just order a whole bunch and share it).
