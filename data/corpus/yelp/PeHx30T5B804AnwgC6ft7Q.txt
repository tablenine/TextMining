Hype x10.. . I actually come here a lot but usually not because I brought it up or I recommended.  Most of the time it's someone that wants a spicy fix and the first thing they think of is.. "I want spicy food... I know!  I'll go drink of bowl of water boiled with chili and spices and kill my taste bud for the next 3 days!". . To be honest, besides being known for their spicy as hell ramen, there's really not much going on.  Usually I get a 3 or 4 and that's the right level for me.  Just spicy enough for me to break a sweat.  If you do get their ramen and a lower heat level, you'll realize that the broth/soup base is really nothing and Orochon's ramen is all about the heat.  It just doesn't have much depth and flavor like other ramen shops.. . I do find myself laughing at my friends who always think they can take on much more spice than they really can and I think that's part of the whole Orochon experience.  You go and eat average spicy ramen, and you laugh at the fools who take on the Specials and tear up by the first sip of the soup.  When you do see those who finishes the Specials as if they are nothing you can't help but cheer along with everybody.  Orochon has cleverly positioned itself as one of the main players in these food challenges.. . All in all, it's a fun place to grab a meal with friends and hope you can dare someone into challenging 2-3 levels above their spice tolerance haha.  Oh gyozas are a good choice here since pretty much all Japanese restaurants make damn good ones.
