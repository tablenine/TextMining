Category: Sushi Bars
Sushi Gen is my favorite sushi place hands down.  I just don't like the horribly long wait that you inevitably have to endure.  There is pretty much zero chance you would ever walk in and sit right down.  Even 5 minutes prior to closing there are usually still a couple of parties waiting to be seated.  . . I always get the Sashimi Deluxe (giant platter of assorted sashimi),  tuna cut rolls, albacore, scallops, yellowtail and plum cut roll.  Consistently fresh quality cuts of fish!!  . http://www.yelp.com/bi....  The MUST TRY item I would recommend is the Yellowtail &amp; Scallion handroll or cut roll.  It's a roll of buttery goodness with perfect sushi rice and quality nori.  You'll be hooked once you try it.  =)  . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . . They've also got pretty good salads like salmon skin, seafood, or crab.  If you're in the mood for a steaming bowl of rice in light broth, they offer 4 or 5 kinds of Ochazuke.  A complete dinner for 2 is usually around $130.  It's worth every penny because the fish and the rice is unmatched anywhere else.  . . Make sure your whole party is there - this is one of those places that won't seat you without everyone present.  Parking is $1.50 for lunch and $2.50 for dinner.
