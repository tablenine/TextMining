I love this bar.  Every time I come back to Atlanta, I stop by at least once.  Three words.  TATER FREAKIN' TOTS.  The tots come as many different ways as Waffle House hashbrowns and taste twice as good.  . . Beer selection is great, and the staff is awesome.  There is no pretention in this bar, so leave yours at home if you're in the habit of bringin' it with you!
