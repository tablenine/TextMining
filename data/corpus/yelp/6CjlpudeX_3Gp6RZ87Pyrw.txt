Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: Bars
I don't give out (4) stars like they're going out of style, but I'll certainly give (4) stars to Uncommon Ground based on cuisine and setting.  It is the complete package vis-a-vis cozy, American brunch spots, and includes a sizable menu offering several wonderful comfort food selections.  . . Little is left to be wanted in terms of the setting, complete with cozy leather couches set in front of a roaring fireplace, rough hardwood floors, throughout, and three separate dining rooms which break up the space, nicely, add a fairly intimate feel to the restaurant.  There's even a bonus fireplace in the second dining room area that adds a nice touch to the place.. . Since it's winter, right now, I'm currently stuck in a crispy potatoes and mac 'n' cheese phase, which, together, are entirely too much food to consume, but manageable upon harassing my other crispy potato and and mac 'n' cheese-lovin' pals to dine out with me.. . The prices could be a bit lower, but no one's forcing me to eat there every night of the week, so when I do go, I suppose that I don't mind terribly.. . In any event, it's definitely worth the trip and, though I have yet to schedule the time, I'd like to stop in at some point to just lounge in front of the fireplace with coffee, or grab a pint at the very welcoming bar.
