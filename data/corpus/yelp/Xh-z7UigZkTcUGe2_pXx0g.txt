I can't believe I forgot to review my terrible, awful, horrible experience there.. . C loves this place, or used to, I should say.  So we headed over there for a nice dinner out even though I am now gluten free.  I thought, hey no problem I can just sub something.  Boy was I wrong!. . I couldn't sub anything for the pasta with my chicken because they make no substitutions.  I said, "I don't think you understand.  I can't have pasta.  As in can't, I'm allergic, can't.". . "I'm sorry we don't do substitutions.". . "Fine, I'll have a salad.". . C asked about the Karma card because she had just gotten an email that there was a free entree on there, "Nope, nothing, sorry."  . . "I got an email.". . "Might have been from Stella," which the whole time I'm there I'm thinking, wish we would have gone to Stella instead.. . Then I used my Karma card to get points and the chick, without asking, uses my free appetizer.. . Bad service = bad management = no going back.  And to not substitute someone with a food allergy?  That's ridiculous.  I can't stay away from Italian places, unless I eat by myself.  Seriously?. . Osteria, I'd just like to tell you - Stella is better when it comes to service, food, and atmosphere.  What happened to you?
