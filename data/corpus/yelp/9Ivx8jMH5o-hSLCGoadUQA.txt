For some reason, I just can't really handle hot stuff.  We're talking temperature and not spicy.  I love spicy.. . Anyways, I love to order their Tsukemen.  It's basically a cold version of their Daikoku Ramen.  Wash that down with an order of spicy tuna roll and Asahi....yum....YUM!. . Street parking sux (but that's LA for ya) and if you get there in the lunch rush, expect to wait.
