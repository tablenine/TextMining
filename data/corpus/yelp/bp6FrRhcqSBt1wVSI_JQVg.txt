Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Melt in Your Mouth Prime Rib and Lobster! How much better can it get! yorkshire pudding, creamed corn and spinning salad are all highlights of one of my favorite restaurants. i always request for the end cut. yes you can do that. oh i forgot the baked potato. and when all is said and done after a great meal...."AHHH, Satisfaction!"
