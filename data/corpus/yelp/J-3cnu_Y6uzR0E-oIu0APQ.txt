Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I used to think Manna was the most amazing place on the planet.  The feeling is akin to your first kiss or lover, there's no better feeling...until you find someone with better execution.. . Manna brought me into the AYCE korean bbq world.  I loved it for a long while, but it's lackluster at best after i cheated on it with others.  The meat is fine, there's nothing wrong with it.  But that's the major problem with Manna, everything is just fine.  Why spend money on 'fine' when you can get 'good' or 'great' for the same price?. . The atmosphere is definitely a bit better than other KBBQ places for larger parties that want to be loud because the seats are mainly outside in tents.  However, it is for this reason that it is not as nice as other AYCE kbbq restaurants. . . My biggest gripe is their service.  I honestly believe that unless you go with someone who speaks Korean, just don't go.  They are rude, slow, and not attentive unless you have a Korean with you.  I've gotten many screwed up orders and some orders that didn't come until my 4th asking.  I've had grills that were blacker than tar without anyone to change the grill.. . Try tahoe or road to seoul.  it's just better.  believe me.
