Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
As my girls and I walk down the street from the Regent Beverly Hotel bar, I honestly could not say anything about Mastro's as far as the decor or customer service goes since my girls and I dropped in drunk as a skunk. But I must say that during those 4 bites of the fine juicy petite fillet that I had in my mouth were sooooo good that I was sober for the duration of the chewing process. None of us really got to finish the food... just had a bunch of fun! It must have been great customer service since they didnt kick us young'ns out... even with all the other swanky customers that were giving us the evil eye. . . Money is Money.
