Category: Latin American
Three of us went here expecting to take advantage of the recent restaurant week; however, we chose to go with the Wednesday special deal that included wine pairings.. . First, I did enjoy the mojito I had at the bar while waiting for my party to arrive. It was neither too strong or too sweet but it was just a bit pricey. Let me just say now, I reduced a star on this review just on that alone. I enjoyed my time here but I just thought it didn't seem like it needed to be as pricey.. . We had empanadas, paella and the farm raised chicken mole verde as well as three pairings of wine they selected. The food tasted good and it was certainly enjoyable that night but as I write this review I can't say that any of it was memorable. I wish we had a couple more choices to choose from but we at least liked our food.. . I will have to go back on one of the nights they have latin dancing going on so I can get a taste for the whole expierence. The service was good and the menu is extensive so I will have come back to try other items and then work it off on the dance floor.
