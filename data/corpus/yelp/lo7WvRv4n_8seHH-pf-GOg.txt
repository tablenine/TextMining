When the highlight of the meal was the cheesy rolls, something's wrong. Now don't get me wrong, the cheesy rolls were amazing, probably the best I've ever had. The cheese and bread blended so well together that the texture of the bread is delightfully soft and gooey on the inside, while slightly crispy on the outside. Other memorable dishes include the caramelized bananas and crispy hot polenta, both side dishes that are periodically brought to your table.. . But I came here for the MEAT! My favorites were the alcatra (top sirloin) and linguica (sausage), but they were no better than any other churrascaria I've been to, which was kind of disappointing. Also available is a glorified salad bar, but none of items really stood out; you can get proscuitto and chicken salad anywhere. . . For about $50 + tax + tip, it's all-you-can-eat, and food just flows to you from all directions. You can be stuffed from trying just a little bit of everything, so don't be greedy and take too much! With that being said, the restaurant is SO wasteful. There'd be times when we didn't even touch our side dishes and the servers would come take them away and replace them with new ones. It just makes me cringe every time they come around, and I'd have to try to stop them from throwing a whole plate of food away!. . In any case, quality is more important than quantity, and I expected better meat from this churrascaria, so I'm giving Fogo de Chao only 3 stars.
