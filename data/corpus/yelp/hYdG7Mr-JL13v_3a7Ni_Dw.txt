perfect combos. i like to get the filet or ahi plate with a "side" caesar which is a full-size salad and mashed potatoes. it comes with this delicious bread/crouton thing. Â the ahi is nice and pink, very quickly seared. super satisfying. and they have diet rootbeer! hard to come by at restaurants. . . only gripes: its a lil bit pricey and there's often a line out the door come lunch time.
