Impressive decor inside, great sushi, slightly high priced, but the Cowboy rolls (kobe rolls) were awesome. $200 bottle of Sake from Kyoto, Japan was delightful, props to the Kyoto monks who made it.. . Kinda ritzy scene, Jeremy Pivens and several hollywood celebritiy types make appearances here.. . It is in Hollywood after all.
