Restaurant: Gibsons Bar &amp; Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
I took my bf there for his birthday last Oct. because he said Gibson's is his boss's favorite steakhouse in Chicago. It has been awhile but there are still several things that are memorable: . . Atomsphere--the interior is very classy and old school. It felt more like a family-style dinning restaurant than a romantic restaurant. Even though it says here the attire is dressy, there were enough people in jeans and t-shirts. Also it could be quite loud so if you are looking for a quiet and romantic dinner, this is not the place for you. . . Food--we ordered some appetizer, BUT I don't remember what exactly we had. All I could remember is how BIG my bf's steak was. I think he ordered the smaller of the two porterhouse cuts, yet it's still probably the largest cut I've seen. And my bf said it was very tender and yummy. I had the fillet, medium well (I don't like seeing pink in my food unless it's waygu), it was pretty yummy but I'm not the steak expert to say whether it's the best. We also had asparagus as side, very fresh and enough to share for two. . . Dessert--Okay here's the key, their dessert is HUGE! I mean HUGE! I am a dessert person so we've never taken home any dessert, except here. We had the chocolate mousse cake, both of us together probably only finished 1/3. We boxed the remaining and I had it for breakfast and lunch the next day... Anyways, just because the quantity was big doesn't mean they lack the quality. I think their dessert was very very yummy. So if you want go somewhere to satisfy your dessert craving, Gibson's is the place for you. . . P.s. we didn't order this, but a table next to us ordered the bigger or larger than life cake--it was even bigger than my chocolate mousse cake, and it looked delicious! I will definitely try that next time.
