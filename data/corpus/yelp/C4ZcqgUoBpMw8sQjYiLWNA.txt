Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza, but this was pretty good.  We ordered the Deluxe with the butter crust and Malnati salad minus Gorgonzola.. . Enjoyed the salad very much.  I thought the meat crunch was bacon bits, but then husband told me it was salami.  Oooohh!  Even better (in my mind, anyway...)!. . The pizza was very good.  At first bite, really enjoyed the crust, but the more I ate, the less I enjoyed it...  or rather, it seemed to lose flavor.  Can that be true?  Husband thought the same thing.  Strange, huh?
