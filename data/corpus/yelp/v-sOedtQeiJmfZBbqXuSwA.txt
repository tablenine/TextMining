This is vegetarian food done right! Mana is a place where both a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian can both enjoy some amazing food and not feel like anything was missing.. . I walk by here at least once a week and have read all the great yelp reviews. Today my fiancée and I stopped in for a late lunch / early dinner. The place was pretty empty so there wasn't any trouble getting a seat. Neither one of us are vegetarians but we do love a good vegetarian dish when its well done. The two of us ordered three small dishes and one slider. The small size was surprisingly large. Along with the mushroom slider we ordered the pumpkin ravioli, the yellow curry special and sweet potato pancakes. Everything was delicious. I'm not sure if I can even put into words how tasty the pumpkin ravioli was. To wash all these wonderful dishes down both of us tried one of the smoothies. I had the avocado one and my fiancée had the carrot one. I enjoyed the avocado a lot more but I'm not a huge carrot juice fan.. . Service was good, nothing speedy I didn't feel like we were rushed out the door and I didn't feel like we were sitting around waiting for anything too long. I can see myself going back again and showing some people how good vegetarian can be.
