I like Fat Cat a lot. They have great beer and cocktail menus. I recommend the Gatsby and the Peach Tree Tea. The first couple of times I went there, I didn't really enjoy the food. In fact, when I went there this past weekend, I wasn't bowled over by the Heartichoke burger (basically their artichoke dip on a burger). However, their homeade-ish fried mac and cheese bites are really yummy. I think that if I tried other things on the menu, I'd find something I really loved. One of my friends swears by the Velveeta burger. I will definitely be going Â back to Fat Cat for games because it's never too crowded. Go Bears!
