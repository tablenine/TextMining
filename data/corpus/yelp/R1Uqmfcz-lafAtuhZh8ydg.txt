Lunch special is a great deal. Food is too sweet. Service is fine. That's all.. . EDIT: went in recently for hair...I mean lunch. Had a HUGE hair in my food. Long and black. I forgot to say "no hair". Gosh it must be my fault.. And when I told the server I needed a minute to look at the menu, he disappeared for 10 minutes. I was alone. I turned to look at him a few times and he was just sitting at a table talking to his friend. Come on, man! I want my hair plate!
