We showed up here at 6:15 and thank god we did because not 5 minutes after we sat down, the line blew up. As we were leaving, we had to fight through a throng of people attempting to sign up their name for a table. . . There were only two parties before us so we were sat almost immediately. We accepted two spots at the counter which made me feel like we were at an actual ramen place in Japan, but the drawback was that those around us could hear our entire conversation. Not good if you are trying to discuss things that are private.. . As far as the food, we started off with a spicy tuna roll. It was good, but also unmemorable. We both got the daikokuya ramen, and its probably the best ramen I have ever had. The broth is just so different, in a good way. It's thickier and creamier than what you would find at another ramen place, but its delicious. I have never gone into a ramen place and not eaten the whole bowl, but the combination of the thick broth, noodles, and meat made me give up about 3/4 into the bowl. But I left completely satisfied. . . Cost: $26.95 for a spicy tuna roll and two daikokuya ramens
