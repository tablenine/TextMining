My favorite breakfast in Atlanta.. . I could eat here everyday. It's cute and delicious. I love everything I have had but I now almost always get the tomato and goat scramble (goat cheese basil and scrambled eggs on grilled tomatoes). The sides are fantastic as well. My wife likes the sweet potato pancakes with the berry cup. . . The service has been really sweet too. They are friendly and keep refilling your cup. If it wasn't so crowded I would want to hang out all day. . . Dang, I'm getting hungry writing about it. . . To sum up, it is a cute and friendly place with some unique and delicious twists on classic breakfast dishes.
