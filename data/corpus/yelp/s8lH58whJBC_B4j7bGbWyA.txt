Food is pretty good here, only thing that ruined my experience was the "every man for himself" approach at getting a table...HORRIBLE. I was lucky enough to find a seat at the bar after scavaging for a good 30 minutes, but my date wasn't so lucky he ended up standing the whole time. . . We had the bone marrow, which was great!!! I had the steak au poivre, at first I thought it was an au poivre burger (so I was surprised when I had a plate of steak and not a burger, but that  was my fault I should have asked or read lol) it was alright nothing special sauce was alright and meat was bleehh. My date had the fo burger, which was very nice we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, loved the aioli or w.e that was.  . . Their service is very weird, but at least the bartender was nice and very helpful at recommending pairings. . . The food and atmosphere is not enough to bring me back, 2.5 stars.
