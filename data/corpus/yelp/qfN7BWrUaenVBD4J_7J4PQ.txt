Great food.  This might be the cheesiest looking restaurant you will ever find.  I know your worried but trust me.  This is real mexican food.  The tortillas are worth it alone.  Dipping them into the queso fundido is a definite must.  The margaritas are yummy and the place is a lot of fun.  Your going to have to wait so just order a margarita and squeeze into the tiny waiting area, which is fun as well when the Lakers are playing!  If you love mexican you have to try this place, it will become your local go to, and dont forget the takeout.
