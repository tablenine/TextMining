Wonderful food that satisfies you, but isn't horribly expensive. Most dishes are around $7-10, depending, with the maki around $8-12. It's also a BYOB, which is nice. Also, they don't charge even a dollar for a corking fee! They just hand you the corkscrew. The food was delicious! I can't wait to bring friends there.
