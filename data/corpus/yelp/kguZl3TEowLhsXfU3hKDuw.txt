Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I had lunch twice on the "Cardiff side". What's up with that system anyways? Just make one d*mn restaurant already. Anyways, the food was bad. The first time,I had a Risotto with sundried tomato, saffron, and chicken. And they messed that up royally. It was so bad that I had a Gordon Ramsay Â flashback (DAMMIT! IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL A @#$%ING RISOTTO? TASTE LIKE DOG VOMIT!). The rice is undercooked, the sundried tomato just overpowered anything else on the dish, the saffron might as well be fabric dye, and the chicken is bone dry (which is almost impossible, but they manage to do it anyways.. . I actually gave them a second chance when my friend insisted that we ate there (the location and decor is top-notch I should say). I had a penne dish with cream/alfredo sauce. It was decent, at par with canned sauce. And my friend also made the same comment (She claimed hers tasted like Chef Boyardee).. . Most of the other reviews indicated that their desert was very good, but after those horrible meal, I decided against ordering them. Maybe next time, and I'll edit my review accordingly.
