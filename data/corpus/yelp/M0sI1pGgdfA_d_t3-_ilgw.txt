A meal at Social is like a trip to the south of France, the north of Africa, the non-Atlanta, in a very good way. The kind of place that I wish I could walk to, to escape the ordinary, to enjoy some interesting, real, food and wine and company. I hope a few more people discover this portal into another place, but not so many that it loses its magic to transport.
