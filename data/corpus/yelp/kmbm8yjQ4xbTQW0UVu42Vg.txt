Got here around 10:30 Easter Sunday and didn't have a wait for a group of 5. . . The mimosas were so-so--I wished the Cava was more sweet and tasted more OJ than bitter champagne. Our table shared an order of banana-chocolate pancakes as an appetizer. Minus the banana and chocolate, the pancake itself didn't have too much flavor (I guess that's the point). Had room for improvement in terms of moisture. . . Overall its brunch and egg dishes were pretty regular, nothing to write home about although I did like its Mexican-infused flavors (like the green poblano sauce on my Flo White omelet). Those who ordered the turkey hash were surprised by how much greasier it was than expected, at least it had a "healthy" part that filled the plate with a selection of fruit! The multi-grain toast that accompanied with our selections was very tasty--fully enjoyed. . . We had a pretty disgruntled waiter but we agreed that he was probably just an overall grumpy person but still, lighten up!. . Didn't have the best selection of healthier fare so this probably isn't the place for you
