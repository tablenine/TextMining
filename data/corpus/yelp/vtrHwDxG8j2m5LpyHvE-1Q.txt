C. Thomas Howell doesn't need to take Bronzing Pills if he wanted Soul... all he had to do was grub at the Busy Bee. . . Mary Mac's and Glady Knight &amp; the Pimps ain't got nuthin' on Busy Bee... this chow is tastee. You have to get there early or else the wait is unreal. If there is a line...go next door and get a fade from Calvin Palmer at the Barbershop.. . The jewel of the menu is of course the Fried Chicken. Mebbe one of the best I have ever eaten. Super crispy, thin batter, juicy yet not greezy, seasoned nicely... just OMG. The Collards are excellent. The Mac was good but needed that crispy semi-burnt crust. Cheese grease factor was low which is good. The corn bread is decent, they just break apart like sawdust when you bite into it...but it's not a bad thing though.. . The rest of the menu is just plain good...some dishes better than others but still homemade with love and attention. The "Joe Lewis" Ham Hock is a shank to be reckon with. The Daily Specials are quite special as well... served with sweet tea. The tea is so sweet, if you put a string in it... you'll get rock candy in 5 minzies. Â  . . "Comin to ya on a dusty road. Good lovin I got a truck load. And when you get it you got something. So don't worry cause I'm coming. . I'm a Soul Man..."
