The Good: . The Server. The Food. Kung Pao Chicken Lollipops. Spicy Basil Chicken(small portion-not spicy). Nasi Goreng Rice . The Drinks. . The Bad:. Our table location was horrible. My husband planned a Birthday dinner &amp; they sat us right next to a wall and on the other side of us a couple sitting next to us. The only thing seperating the couple next to us was a throw pillow-literally. Shortly after we sat a couple with jeans &amp; t shirt were seated at a nice intimate table next to a window-could we have been over dressed?. They failed to relay the note about my Birthday that my husband made so after saying something Â to the hostess who aknowledged they has a note dessert was brought out &amp; after it hit the table the server runs out with a candle.. Valet was not "ready" when we arrived so we parked across the street. . Although they were not busy at the time they "ran out" of kettles for the green tea.. I doubt very seriously we will return. .
