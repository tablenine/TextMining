The first time I went to Soul Veg I expected to walk out feeling lighter and healthier and ready to run a marathon. I didn't expect the food to be very good.. . I was wrong on all counts. I got the bbq tofu platter with collard greens and Â sweet potatoes. It was delicious. A fried slab of tofu fried and covered with tangy bbq sauce. Well seasoned veggies. Yum.. . But here's the thing: Soul Veg's menu is not healthy. Sure, the salads are all good for you. But many of the entrees are fried and are high in fat.. . There's a common misconception that all vegetarian food is healthy. It's not true. Soul Veg is proof of that.. . But it's also proof that vegetarian food can be damn good.
