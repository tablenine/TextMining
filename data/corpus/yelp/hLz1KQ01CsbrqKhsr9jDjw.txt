I like this location better than Santa Monica because of the space, but it is pretty much the same. Get there early, even on a Monday or Tuesday night! Else you will be standing around waiting for a seat! I really hate when people compare the burger here to In-N-Out. Yes, the burger and fries are really good but it's almost like comparing apples to oranges.
