Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
"I would like 10 tacos and 10 burritos, large salsa and guac."  And that's just for me!  I love this place so so much.  The tacos, burritos, salsas, everything here is delicious.  If you have never ate here, do yourself a huge favor and try it.  If you're looking for a nice sit down, get outta here.  haha This place is usually crowded, has limited parking and seating... but none of that really matters when the food is really good.
