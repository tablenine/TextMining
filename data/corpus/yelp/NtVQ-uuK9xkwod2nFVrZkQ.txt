I like:. . The mini red velvet cupcakes.. The Bon Bons.. The friendly staff.. The espresso ala mode sundae.. The iced coffee.. The nice man who gave me another iced coffee after I dumped mine all over the cream/sugar station like a dunce.. The turnovers (bring back strawberry + cream cheese pls).. The tables outside.. The banana bread.. That window into the kitchen by the cream/sugar station.. The feel of the place.. That I can buy things for $.50 that are awesome.. The quality of the napkins.. The fact that Becca bugged them so much when they stopped making muffins that they brought them back.. That it's open late(ish).. The coffee toffee milk shake (I DRINK YOUR... ok, I'll stop).. That it's busy but not usually crowded.. That it's the perfect dog walking destination.. . edit 11/03/08:  Mini muffins and cup cakes are now 75 cents.  Boooooooo!
