Restaurant: Pho #1
Category: Vietnamese
This place is precisely what I look for in a Pho restaurant on Buford Hwy.  Basic interior, cheap eats, oh and, must not forget...the TV.  I can't say that I've had the regular Pho, but I love how they have so many varieties, from regular, to spicy beef stew, to even a veggie option.  The veggie is probably my favorite....Pho filled with vegetables and fried tofu in a subtle but flavorful clear broth.  You can also opt for egg noodles instead of rice noodles.  I wouldn't recommend getting anything but Pho, as it is their specialty, why would you get anything else?
