OK so I was taken here after school with some friends thinking we were just gonna stop for a minute and eat. I was really surprised when I arrived and am now spreading the word. This place is great. don't expect any kind of service whatsoever, you need to ring a bell and they will get to you. Otherwise they just give you big asss plates of meat and lots of different sides and let you go crazy. Awesome place..love it!
