Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Mexican
The best of the Rosa Mexicano chain (not a huge fan of the original on the East side).  Fresh guac made to order, killer pomagranate margheritas, and my favorite Mexican dish in the city (the perfectly cooked steak with tequilla / mushroom / cream sauce -- last item on the menu).  All this in a cool space complete with Acapulco cliff drivers in minature lining the waterfall alongside the staircase to the main dining level.  Why not 5 stars then?  Honestly, unless someone can prove me wrong, the best Mexican in the world is a restaurant known as Tequilla's in Philly (and I have worked in Mexico City and tried some of the best food there).  And nothing in NY that I've tried compares...hope I'm wrong but I'll still drive down a few times a year for their queso fundido with chorizo and real chihuaha cheese alone.  In a pinch, Rosa is a capable replacement and my favorite Mexican place in the city, but not at the level of Tequila's.
