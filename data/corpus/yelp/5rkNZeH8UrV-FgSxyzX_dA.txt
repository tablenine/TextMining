I had pretty high hopes for this place and they were not disappointed. The atmosphere was so nice. It seems like a great date place. I went for "tourist" restaurant week and had the pork belly carbonara, the salmon, and a collection of sorbet.. . The appetizer was really good with crispy pork belly and really yummy gnocchi. I'm a huge fan of gnocchi so I was glad that to have it made well. The salmon was also good. The biggest disappointment was sorbets over the vanilla shortbread. They were interesting, but not really on par with the rest of the menu. The sorbet just tasted normal and ordinary, which is not what I wanted for dessert.. . I'm extremely interested in returning and trying some of the other specials like the champagne and chicken and the burgers.
