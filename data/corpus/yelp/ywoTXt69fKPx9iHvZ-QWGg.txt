Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
you know what...im not even sure why im writing this review...its a complete personal opinion restaurant...what i say is lou malnaucious..yea i know real original...but to be honest im just not feelin it....i keep tryin it and wanting to love it but i guess im just a giorandos guy..dont get me started on this deep dish thin crust nonsense..both pizzas can co-exist..they are different styles..there should be no comparison..i compare lou's deep to ginos and giordanos and it falls in last place to me... . and by the way..the delivery time is god awful at this place..i get it..it takes 45 minutes to make a deep dish pizza..but waiting over 2 hours is just nuts..being that hungry you should love your pizza..
