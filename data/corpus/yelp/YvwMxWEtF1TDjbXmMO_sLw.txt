Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
I'm only giving 4 stars because I didn't try the food here, but the drink were fan-fucking-tastic. Seriously. I went to another spot, the name of which I can't remember, (first time in Culver City), and found a "mixologist" created cocktail list that was fucking horrible. I work in a classic cocktail bar and would never put "mixologist" by my name because of shitheads like that.... . ...this guy Ray at the Filling Station, on the other hand, is a true bartender, with amazing and fresh cocktails. Hands down, the BEST cocktails I've had outside of Downtown.
