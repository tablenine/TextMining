Oy Vey!  Don't  my fellow yelpers know that pastrami should have a good amt of fat thru it to make it  taste as outstanding as it does at LANGERS !!   This old time Jewish Deli gives you a feeling like you are  in  New York  or Chicago back in the 50's .. (including the old adorable  white haired waitress who has worked there for years -and the tall, thin red head who reminds you of Flo from Mel's diner on the old tv show  Alice.. . Both of them are soo cool- know how to wait on a table blindfolded and can run rings around any young kid today- lets say they work hard for the money!!. . The east coast Jews knew how to make a sandwich -no skimping-piled high with juicy, flavorful corned beef, pastrami, etc..  thick crusted REAL rye bread, not like  the thin no taste rye bread from the supermarket.  . And......LANGERS in LA knows the rules of the best sandwich making too.   . So, please, if you haven't  eaten  in a good Jewish deli -with authentic meats and bread, don't  say there is fat on the meat and don't say the bread is too thick.. CAUSE that is how it is supposed to be.!!! . . If you want a poor excuse for a  Pastrami sandwich- then go to one of those fast food places that have the nerve to have on their billboard  Pastrami- right next to Tacos' and hamburgers ! Uggh !!!. . And guess what- I'm not even Jewish- but I know a good sandwich when I eat it !!!   And BTW -the garlic pickles are great, and the Matzo ball chicken soup ain't bad either!!!. Try it -you'll like it- trust me !!!
