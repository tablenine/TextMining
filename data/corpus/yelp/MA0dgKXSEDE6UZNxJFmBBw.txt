Scrumpdelicious food here! . I was here with 6 of my friends from out of town and they all absolutely LOVED the food and the venue!. It looks super casual from the outside, next to KooKooRoo... but good music, very young environment with modern vibe. . I do have to admit... the service is pretty slow... but it is very compacted and crowded almost every weekend. Not the cheapest Mexican/ Latin American Cuisine, per entree, it's about 40-50 dollars, but the food is just awesome!. The portion is pretty reasonable and they are extremely flavorful. It's a nice place for a happy hour/ after work socializing, but also great restaurant to visit right before watching great performance arts in downtown. The patio is heated so if you feel suffocated by the crowd inside, you can always dine outside. Fresh air with nice view of downtown...just be prepared for slow service.
