Restaurant: Eclipse Di Luna
Category: Tapas Bars
I don't frequent tapas joints too often.  This one is pretty cool and the food choices are fun.  One side of the menu is strictly vegetarian.  The other, meat, seafood and fish.  Is it wrong to order tapas plates by the numbers and keep them to yourself?  That's my M.O.. . Two friends and I strolled into Eclipse di Luna Saturday.  It was so busy but we found a parking spot and got seated relatively quickly. The live Latin band was turning up the energy.  Each of us got our own plates and drinks.  I got five different items and ate them all except for the calamari.  My calamari loving friend absconded my plate after I got two tastes from it.  She ended up paying for it.. . On to the food I ordered:. . Ejotes Crujientes - battered and fried green beans.  They were ok.  I wouldn't get them again, though.. . Calamares Fritos - lightly battered and fried.  I got two pieces before my friend claimed them.  I figured, they're fried and I should share them... er, give them away.  I ended up not paying for them.. . Ceviche de Salmon - the star of the evening!  Fresh salmon chunks sashimi-style with the right amount of lemon, salt and decorative veggies that went well together.. . Empanada de Pollo y Chile Poblano - tasty little chicken and veggie pocket. . . And the Lamb meatballs in a mint and olive oil mixture (not listed on the online menu) - tasty and not at all 'gamy' as lamb is sometimes.  Still, not a bell ringer in my mouth... . Grapefruit martini - a palate cleansing citrusy surprise.  Didn't taste any vodka, if you know what I mean.  Still, a good drink.  I didn't want to pay $12.50 for a premium drink!  Next time, it'll be a pitcher of mojito for the group to split.  . . This place is a total do-over!  I loved the energy inside.  The music, dim lighting with candles everywhere made it a relaxing experience despite all the noise.
