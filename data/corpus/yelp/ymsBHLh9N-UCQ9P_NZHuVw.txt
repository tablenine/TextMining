Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
Duck Walk is a great place to order take out from. I've never been to the restaurant itself as I have always ordered food to be delivered. The food here is excellent!! Every time I try to order something new and I love everything that I have tried on the menu so far. My favorites are the Crab Rangoon appetizer and the cashew chicken. Also I have tried several of the seafood dishes and they are all excellent as well. Delivery service is reasonable fast although there is a two dollar delivery charge. This is fine with me because there is no minimum amount required to order delivery.
