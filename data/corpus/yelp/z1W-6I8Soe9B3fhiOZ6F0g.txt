I've been here for Sunday brunch on a couple of occasions.  The spread on the buffet is decent with a wide array of dishes including a couple of salads, gyros, a fish dish, crepes, eggs etc.  The waitstaff is a bit slow on replenishing the empty dishes , which is a big negative for a $20 buffet.  One of the best things about their Sunday brunch is the nice jazz trio.  Not sure if that's a regular thing, but what a nice touch and really should be bumped up to 3.5 stars.
