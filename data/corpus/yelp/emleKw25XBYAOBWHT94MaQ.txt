alcove used to be made of win but now, it can be made of suck.  this is because there are too many hipsters there, and because of the fact that the food is also sometimes suck.. . hipsters: i don't care about you and i don't like you taking over my neighborhood.  take your emo hair and your horn-rimmed glasses and your skinny jeans and plaid shirts and go live in hell.  thanks.
