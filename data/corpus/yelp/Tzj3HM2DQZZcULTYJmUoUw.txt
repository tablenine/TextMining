Restaurant: Bin Wine Cafe
Category: American (New)
I've eaten at bin twice, and both times loved the food and service.  On my most recent visit, I tried the Spanish red wine flight and the Spanish cheese flight.  Both were out of this world and complemented each other nicely.  . . I ordered the daily pizza special, which had some pretty sharp cheese, bacon, and fresh sweet corn.  I love bacon on pizza; who am I kidding--I love bacon period!  This pizza was amazing.. . The rest of my party tried a skate wing special, the sauteed escolar, and the steak frites.  All were stellar and reflected the quality I'd seen on my previous visit.. . The service was good as well.  Our server was very attentive and gave many recommendations.. . I recommend bin for a date night, special occasion, or just a chill night for wine and cheese.  I will not hesitate to go back on future trips to my favorite food city!
