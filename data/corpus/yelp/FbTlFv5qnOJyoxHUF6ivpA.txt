I HATE dancing here. The "floor" which is actually just a space where tables are removed, is *tiny* and there are terribly-placed columns, so beware if you don't know your dance partner well. It's every woman for herself! The guys who tend to come here either have a partner OR can't dance for crap, IMO.. . Back to the food. Went here for Valentine's Day and was underwhelmed with the food, but the drinks were phenomenal! Take me here ANY day for drinks, please! I actually get passion fruit drinks that taste like it, excellent rum, and other lovely Caribbean drinks. Yay!
