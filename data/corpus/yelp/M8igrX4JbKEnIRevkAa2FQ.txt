They have a nice large outdoor seating area.  That only makes it more disappointing that everything else makes this a place I avoid.. . One note is I have only been to brunch.  I wish I could do an even review having tried everything else, but my few brunch experiences have been so bad I don't want to take the chance.. . The last time I went just recently so a friend could try the Southern food she thought she was craving the service sucked.  Half ass, slow thinking, indifferent waiter is what I got.    For example on refilling my water once and poured some ice water on to my half finished meal plate where upon his response was a simple oops and walk away.. . The killer is beyond this the food is bland.  I mean I expect some flavor, some spices, etc for this type of cuisine.  Jambalaya omlette was like eggs with some chicken chunks and a very light dose of tomato sauce.  Bland, bland, bland.  Had to drench it in the hot sauce to get some flavor.  Crab cakes were slightly better but still seemed like a D+ frozen product from Jewel.. . The corn bread muffins are pretty good.  But how hard can it be to make decent corn bread muffins.  Oh and the Peppar Mary drink I kind of liked, but it isn't any bargain for sure.
