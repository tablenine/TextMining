Its crazy how hype can hurt even a tiny storefront in the East Village and I think Porchetta (por-ketta) falls into that trap.  I have been there a couple of times and there are some divisive pros and cons.  . . The positive is that the components are all individually spectacular and really work well together.  The bread is a crispy rustic baguette that has perfect texture.  The pork is extremely flavorful and includes some of the hard skin that adds complexity to the sandwich.  The sides are must-have additions. The amazing cooked-to-order brussel sprouts are perfectly caramelized and the potatoes are well seasoned and accompanied by some crunchy pieces of pork.. . The cons may arise from my extremely high expectations.  The hype machine should chill out and let Porchetta live like Tron (America don't want to see Tron work).  I think the pork, although incredibly flavorful, can teeter on the dry side and definitely benefits from some hot sauce (I recommend chili garlic siracha, although it is not offered in house so you will have to take-out or bring your own).  I would also appreciate it if they were more consistent on the amount of pork in the sandwich... daddy has big appetite.  . . Don't get more wrong, Prochetta is delicious (4-star delicious) and one of the better sandwiches in NYC, but I think it gets hurt by the unrealistic expectation set by the food blogosphere.
