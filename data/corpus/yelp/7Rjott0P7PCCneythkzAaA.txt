Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
I went here last year with my girlfriend. It wasn't so good. There were fruit flies pestering us throughout our meal. The food was kind of bland and not very memorable.. . A couple months ago, Sticky Rice was shut down for health code violations, specifically rodent droppings everywhere. I'm sure they've cleaned up since then, but I will not be back.
