Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I am in search of the perfect burger. Along the way, I wound up at Father's Office... I am still searching. Their burger was not bad, but for the price tag, and the good reviews on yelp, my expectations were high. The restaurant is trendy and the patrons seemed cool. I would probably go back if I lived closer.
