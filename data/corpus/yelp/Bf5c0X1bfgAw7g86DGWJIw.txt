Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
The sudden sharp edged pain known only as 'hunger' struck each of us around dinnertime this evening.  Someone in the group whispered Orochon..  And so began the journey eastward, towards the glowing city lights of downtown Los Angeles.. . Tonight was different.  We arrived around 8pm'ish and were immediately seated inside.  . . After eyeballing the menu for a couple of minutes, each of us decided upon our individual levels of pain.  We also ordered the spicy sausages and the fried won ton appetizers to curb that fat hairy bastard 'hunger' while waiting for our soups to arrive.  (The spicy sausage is more a 'salty' sausage than anything else.  And the fried won tons are so filled with grease that they 'pop' in your mouth when biting into them.  Like little greasy pork meat filled oriental Pop Rocks..  Well, maybe not..). . Its pretty much cut and dry at this point in the story.  The soup is damn good.  I've never actually finished an entire bowl myself, let alone a Special #2.  God bless the sicktards who actually manage to slurp down one of those spice filled nightmares.  I'll only stick to good old #5.  Once I tried #3, and that was enough to send me running to the bathroom in a coughing fit.  . . If I'm not mistaken, #2 is an alternate bizzaro world reference of some sort.  You know, the 'dropping the kids off at the pool' kind.  In this case however, the kids are surely on fire, screaming at the top of their firey pepper paste filled lungs.  . . Always good ramen at a decent price.  Free parking downstairs with validation.  . . 4 stars baby!
