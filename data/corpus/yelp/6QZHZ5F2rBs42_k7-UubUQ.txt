Gotta love good southern food.  This place has character, there are pictures of famous people who have tried it, so why shouldn't you be one of them.  I love the blackened catfish, and if you are eating southern food you must have the sweet potato souffle and some green beans.  If you don't like that I am sure mary mac will have some sort of casserole to strike your fancy.  This is a must try.
