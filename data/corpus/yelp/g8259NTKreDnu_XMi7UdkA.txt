Great place! I really like the freshness of the food,and their outstanding Â service! It is a perfect place to take your date. Located just across from Culver City Movie Theater, it is a good stop to get something to eat after watching a good flick. . P.S and they have the best selection of freshly made delicious gelatto ice cream. My favorite "PARADISE".
