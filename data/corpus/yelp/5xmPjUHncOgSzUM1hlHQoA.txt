Restaurant: The Iberian Pig
Category: Spanish
Decor is fantastic. Predominantly porcine. Service was very friendly. Very efficient. Manager visited with each guest. TAPAS are great and not overly pricey. Entrees are expensive but are very good. My only criticism is that they could provide some simpler fare, especially in the Tapas menu. Olives, anchovies, smelt, some of the stuff they serve in Spain. They also need a cheap serviceable dry sherry. The shaved jamon is the bomb. Don't go there and get distracted and not order it. . Location on the Decatur Square is perfect. This place could become a standard.
