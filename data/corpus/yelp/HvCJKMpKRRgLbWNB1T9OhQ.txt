Right off the bat I gotta mention the service here. 5 stars for the service. Our waiter was very attentive. The bus boy was attentive. We were even asked several times by other employees if we needed anything. Awesome service.. . We didn't have to wait when we arrived at 6:40pm. But as soon as we sat down, the wait started, it got real crowded. . . Not sure why but this place is really hot. They really need better ventilation or fix the air because it's uncomfortable to eat in that kind of heat. I felt like I should have came in a wife beater.. . I ordered the angel hair pasta with tiger shrimp $19 and my bf ordered the red curry risotto with seafood $22. I ordered a pomegranate martini $10 (it was gross) and he ordered guinness $5. We also go tiramisu $8 for dessert. All the food was delicious. Really generous portions and really good flavors. The bread they gave was also good, arrived nice and warm. (food, drinks, tax, tip $89).. . This place gets really loud at times and I can barely hear my partner when we're trying to have a conversation. The tables are also seated so close to each other that you feel like you're part of someone else' conversation.
