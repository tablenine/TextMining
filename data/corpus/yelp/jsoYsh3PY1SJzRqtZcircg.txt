Restaurant: Bhojanic
Category: Indian
Indian cuisine is noted for the variety of strong, zesty spices used in most of its dishes, so I suppose that the cooks at Bhojanic should be proud of at least one thing: they have, through singlemindedly devoted effort, managed to take this incredibly flavorful cuisine, and contort it into the blandest mush masquerading as Indian food that you can imagine. Seriously, how do you make a curry flavorless? As mind-boggling and seemingly impossible as the concept of bland Indian food is, the folks at Bhojanic manage it. Everything they serve is perfectly serviceable, just boring as the blandest white bread you've ever tasted. On top of all that, everything on the menu is overpriced, which causes me to wonder: why on EARTH would anyone ever choose to eat here when Zyka is right around the corner? Beats me.
