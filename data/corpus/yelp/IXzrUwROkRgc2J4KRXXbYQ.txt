knock your socks off type of place.... the white walls and high ceilings make you feel like your walking into a ballroom...or a bank, lol.  either way, the majestic decor makes you feel very special and that you are in for a special treat...and that you are!  loved the variety of small plates.  we tried the fennel with oranges and sweet onion - seasoned to perfection and all ingredients in a fresh, crisp state.  my husband had the rock shrimp with cucumbers and peppers prepared much like a ceviche.  they were perfect as light appetizers.  then for the main course: our burrata pizza!  OMG.  the most mouth watering mozz that has ever hit my palate.  the crust was heartier than most other italian style pizzas but that was okay by me as it too was delicious.  i was so sad that i could not take down another slice!  . for some "reason" though, i was able to find room for dessert :)  we headed to the market section of the restaurant and decided on a vanilla and a raspberry cupcake.  prettily and "expensively" coiffed with not one but two cupcake wrappers, the cake inside was just not up to par with the rest of the restaurant - a very blah cupcake with tasteless frosting.  such a disappointment after an outstanding lunch.. . just a note: the service was a bit absent at first.  we got there just before the lunch rush, were seated right away and then forgotten... i had to reintroduce myself to the hostess and explained to her that at least 3 tables - seated after us - had been waited on.  after that mention, however, service was great!
