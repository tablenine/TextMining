Restaurant: Cho Sun Ok Restaurant
Category: Korean
Korean or not-you'll get the same service here.  Take it or leave it (like it or not), simply put.  People may get seated ahead of you because they know the owner, or maybe they called ahead of time.  You may have to get up and get your own water, or get the attention of a waitress by yelling across the restaurant, but that's pretty standard for all Korean restaurants.  My dad is a good friend of the owner--so obviously I can't say anything really bad about it!  But I will have to say that I was expecting a dirty, dark restaurant from, what apparently is, mixed reviews.  But it was clean, well-lit, and I saw NO cockroaches or anything that even resembled one.  Nothing in the restaurant even made me think there might be a cockroach in the place.  . . Food was good, service was as expected, overall a good experience.
