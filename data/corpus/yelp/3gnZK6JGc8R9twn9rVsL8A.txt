Restaurant: Spacca Napoli
Category: Pizza
I have been here several times.  Each time I've had excellent service and excellent food. . The pizza is, as far as I know, authentic Italian style.  I've had many different types and have not been disappointed at all.  Spacca Napoli also has a reasonably priced wine list.  . This is really, really good stuff.  If you think Pizza Hut knows how to make a pizza, this place is not for you.
