Restaurant: Manny&#39;s Coffee Shop &amp; Deli
Category: Delis
5+ stars for Manny's Deli.  This is where I want to be on St. Patty's Day!  :)  By far the best corned beef and cabbage I've had.  The MOUND of corned beef was enough to build a sandwich to take home while still having way more than enough for dinner alongside cabbage and potatoes.  . . Although the restaurant itself is cafeteria-style with fluorescent lights and all, it was great to see tables of ladies meeting to play scrabble and card games.  This place is definitely a Chicago institution.  . . I can't believe that they only recently opened for dinner, but I certainly hope it stays this way.  I can only dream that they start delivering....
