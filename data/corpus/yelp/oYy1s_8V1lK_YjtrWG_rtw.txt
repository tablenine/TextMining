Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If you aren't hungry but a meal is about an hour or two away, head to Pink's because that's about how long it will take to get your food. I know this place doesn't need anymore reviews but as a tourist in LA, I had to add mine. . . Really that's the only reason to go to Pink's during the day. You are a tourist and you want to be at an LA institution. Lots of people waiting in line and unfortunately you wait so long you probably change your mind on which hot dog you are going to get at least 4 times. Their menu selection is cuhrayzee. Interestingly enough, it's pretty good. But I think it's good because by the time you get your food, you are starving so anything would taste great. Good marketing plan Pink's! . . I got the Mulholland Dr. dog which has grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon and nacho cheese and also tried the Martha Stewart dog that comes with tomatoes, onions, bacon, sauerkraut and sour cream. I now only want to eat hot dogs that have nacho cheese on them. It's so gross it's good. You can barely take a bite with all the stuff they put on your dog. . . Had their chili cheese fries too. Not enough cheese but plenty of chili. The fries are crispy and good, I think they have seasoned salt on them too. Big order which is enough to share. . . It's cool to see all the headshots they have posted of the stars that have visited Pink's. The place is small though so seating sucks. If you want to eat there, stalk some people at their table and pounce on it when it becomes available. If you are around the area and have an hour to kill, go just to say you've been.
