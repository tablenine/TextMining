Fairly inexpensive for the amount you get. The staff could use some friendliness training so I usually just pick it up and go home. Once the cashier gave me change for a twenty instead of the ten I gave him..realizing this as I got to my car I went back and told him about it..he barely looked up, took the change and muttered 'thanks'..you know..for saving him a probable lecture and cut in his paycheck. The older (owners?) staff members tend to be very warm and appreciative. I can't figure out why no place in Chicago serves squash in their red curry though..I really miss it after leaving Madison.
