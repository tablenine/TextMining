Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
The only thing that disappoints me about Alcove is the parking. I remember when they first opened it was self-parking in the back. Now it's valet, that's crap. So pointless to be valeting the cars when the parking lot is extremely tiny. . . However, the food and atmosphere what makes me come to Alcove. The amazing caesar salad, with the parmesan shavings and dill croutons... yum! The soup is always amazing. Potato cakes is great with your breakfast, and the turkey with humus on olive bread. To wash all that food down, you want to drink the velvet tea is a must, it's caffeine-free and has a slight vanilla flavor.
