Holy overly packed place Batman.  I love being 3 deep at the bar....  when there is a band, copious amounts of cleavage and we're all not waiting 45 minutes for tables to sit at.  Pure pure pure...  I love your Alpharetta location.  Truly love it.  Your Inman Park location?  Yep, it would get 4 stars from me if you made some minor adjustments to interior infrastructure.  . . That's my soapbox moment for now.  Otherwise, I've always been a fan of Pure.  The one in Inman Park actually provides great great people watching.  Bama bangs boy with his floppy ass hair, pink polo shirt, plaid shorts and flip flops hanging out with his sundress, UGA girlfriend and her DG glasses and Louis Vuitton purse.  Tatted up Affliction t-shirt guy with huge boobed, fake tan girlfriend.  People like me that just love free-basing Jager and eating chips.  . . I'm here to eat chips and kick ass.  Looks like Pure is never going to run out of chips.  . . Anyways, other than crowd control issues, I truly enjoy Pure.  They make a wickedly good Margarita.  Too bad I can't drink them.  Bartenders are pretty attentive and service isn't too bad.  Get the Fish Tacos and add Tomatillo to it.  AWESOME.  . . Go on Friday nights too.  Yet again, crowd management drives me a little insane, but the people watching alone is enough that I've been there 5 times in 6 weeks.  Ok, maybe it's the Chips and Guac.
