I went here for the first time after a nerve-wracking visit to the Los Angeles Gun Club. Needless to say, the proportions are gigantic and the ramen is on par with some of the best that I've ever had. . . What I don't understand is how the place got a "C" rating from the health department. Did someone accidentally pick their nose in front of the inspector? Well, whatever. I look forward to biking back to Daikokuya once I get back to LA, preferably without gunpowder all over my hands this time.
