The curry wrap is amazing. I love all their salads. Portions are more than enough.  The atmosphere is cozy and quaint despite its location on a major street like hillhurst. I love their outdoor seating area with the trees giving shade to its many patrons. One downside...parking is a pain and valet is making money! Which means we're losin money on PARKING. Minus one point! Otherwise i loves.
