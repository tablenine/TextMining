juicy pork dumplings heaven in your mouth? stop joking around. Â the crab meat dumplings were pretty good, but even then, it's not anything near "heaven" IMO..... . . we live in cerritos, and we drove 20 mi to get here... not worth the drive, won't be going back... the best part of the meal was the pork fried rice, which isn't saying much.. . the best part of the trip was AFTER the meal, where we went to phoenix (right next door) and got the staple drink, the coconut milk thingy (goooooooooood..... that's heavenly).. . don't waste ur gas if u live far from this place, i think u can get similar tasting if not better in ur neighborhood chinese joints
