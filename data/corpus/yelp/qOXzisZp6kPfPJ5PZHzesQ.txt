Yeah this place is ok. I went in with high hopes, but wasn't that impressed. I had the veggie spring rolls and fried calamari for an appetizer. The spring rolls were amazing, and the calamari was pretty good too. I really like the sweet chili sauce they were served with. For my entree I decided on the spicy garlic shrimp, over the sweet chili shrimp. I think I should have gone with the latter. The black bean sauce was too thick and goopy on the shrimp. It was great over rice, but just on the shrimp it was too much.. . My friend had the shanghai noodles, and i think sans-chicken, i would have preferred that dish over both. Maybe next time.... . The service was pretty wretched. Slower than molasses! I might order take out shanghai noodles, but I'd probably venture elsewhere for chinese. Plus, no vegetarian soups! bah!
