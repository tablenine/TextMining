I don't know why, but I wasn't expecting to be that impressed by Chops.  I think I've just found too many times in the past that some of Atlanta's most talked-up restaurants didn't live up to the hype.  . . I was pleasantly surprised.  My 12-oz New York Strip was LUSCIOUS.  And for some reason, I ordered the Creme Brulee for dessert.  I'm not sure why, because I normally don't even like Creme Brulee too much.  But it was SO GOOD.  Also, the fresh mozzarella cheese salad had some of the most flavorful fresh mozzarella I've ever had.. . The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that I have very high expectations of the service in a fine-dining establishment.  The service did not quite meet those expectations.  It was good enough, but in a place like this I expect to be wowed.. . That said, the food at Chops DOES live up to the hype.  :D
