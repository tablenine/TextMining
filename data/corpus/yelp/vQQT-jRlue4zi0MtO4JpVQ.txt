I've heard so many good things about this place, and today was the first time I actually got to try it out.  Let me just say, when I opened the menu I immediately wanted to order every type of pancake/waffle they had listed on there.  Pancakes with brown sugar baked bananas??  Oh my god.  Strawberries and cream waffles?  Geez!  I finally settled on "Tis the Season" which was pancakes with  pumpkin pie filling and whipped cream on top.  I made the mistake of getting two pancakes instead of one, and about 7 bites into my meal I had to give up.  Not because it wasn't good, but because it was simply too much food.  I tried to eat as much as I could, because it was so tasty.  I couldn't do it though, and unfortunately I wasn't able to bring my leftovers with me so I had to part with my fantastic breakfast.  Oh, before I forget, the coffee was quite good too! . . The wait wasn't bad at all, and we were able to get a table right away.  This is probably because it was 11:30am on a Monday, though.  One thing is for sure, the next time I eat there I'm either going to stick to getting one pancake or I'm bringing someone who is willing to split two with me.  I also want to try out the lunch menu, because I caught a glimpse of someone's order of chili fries and it looked really good.
