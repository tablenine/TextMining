Been here about a handful of times already and I still dream about the broth from this place...mmm nom nom.. . The serving of ramen is huge and I always leave about 5 pounds heavier, which causes me to warn myself that the next time, I will just share with a friend &amp; not order a combo (I've tried tuna sashimi, pork cutlet, teri chicken, and eel-- all so good!!) but guess what? That never happens.... . Yes, waiting can be a drag, but well worth the wait. Servers are always friendly and to add, I'm not a huge fan of gyoza but Daikokuya's version is pretty yumamazing!!
