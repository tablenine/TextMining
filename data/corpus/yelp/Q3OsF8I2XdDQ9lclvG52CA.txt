mmmmm mmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm sooo goood.. . i sat in a gluttonous stupor after i ate the pastries here. but god was it worth it!!! . . there is easy and convenient parking right behind the store in the lot and the service runs a tad slow when its busy but totally worth it. . as soon as u walk in grab a number and take a look around...there is SO much to choose from.. . me and my 2 other friends spent about $35 here...i know, it was crazy. some of the things we got:. -gauva pastry. -coconut glazed balls. -coconut macaroons. -chocolate mousse. -strawberry cream cake. -coffee mousse cake. . and for protien. -pulled pork sandwiches. -strawberry banana smoothies. -plantain chips. . mmmmmmmmmmm...i wish this place were closer so i could go all the time. i guess it's better off being here instead of LA..better for my thighs at least
