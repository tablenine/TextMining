Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Best dumpling you'll ever have!. . Do you know that this same restaurant - is part of Japanese tour package? People arrive by tour bus!!  . . When I had my first bite - a strong emotion came rushing to my brain - it was a clean, organized taste.  I know this probably doesn't make sense.  So allow me to put it in another way.  The stuffing they had inside, was organized cut and put together, so when you bite down, it was not messy.. . I've never had to use the word "organized" to describe food.  But that's how it made me feel.  Note - "FEEL", beyond "TASTE".  Yes - it felt good from heart, not just stomach.. . : )
