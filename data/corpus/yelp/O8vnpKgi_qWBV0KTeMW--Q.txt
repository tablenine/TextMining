Restaurant: Yeah! Burger
Category: Burgers
So i was tempted to give this place only 1 or 2 stars so that people would be discouraged from going here and the lines would be less long.  I think the long lines are the only downside to this place.. . The food is great! A little pricey if you get a burger w/ cheese and premium topping (these are  a dollar each so it adds up if you want a fancy burger).  However, considering the quality of the food, i think its worth it.  Since I avoid non-organic meats, this is one of the few places i can get a good burger, and better yet, hot dog when i have the craving.  As a side, i got the 50/50 and really liked the onion rings.. . Yeah!  has bison, chicken, turkey and veggie options (along with gluten free) so it seems like there's something for almost everyone.. . .  It would be a 5 star place if the wait and lines weren't so long
