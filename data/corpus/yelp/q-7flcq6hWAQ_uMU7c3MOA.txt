this is not the best izakaya in town, but it's one of the better ones. in terms of a good place to gather a group of people and have izakaya food/drinks, this place may be the best. it's nice decorated, and for large groups they have a private room. the food menu is extensive, and they have some very good and very authentic dishes. you may need to go w/ someone japanese or someone who knows how/what to order in an izakaya to get the most out of it. it gets crowded, and it's in a crowded (but historic) area. one of my favorites in the sawtelle area
