I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.   (Sorry, it's Valentine's Day- I must be feeling the LOVE) Anyhow, this place definitely caters to the "foodie and winey" so it's a good thing I'd consider myself to me both.  I've only dined in the garden room, but that's ok- I don't know that I ever need to explore the rest of the place because as soon as you walk in, the twinkling candlelights on the tables and the meandering plants take you away to another place.. . Yes, it's a bit pricey but for the quality, amount of food, selection in the menu and the amazing service (and unpretentious), it's worth every penny.  I will continue to go again and again and again...in fact, I'm already thinking about my next visit.
