Well, well. Here's a blue cheese burger that walks like a blue cheese burger and talks like a blue cheese burger--delicious dish! My husband and I have been here twice, and were totally happy about the large portions, the yummy fries and really nice pitcher of sangria. We drank it with straws (it was my birthday) so good! Love the beer garden, love the burgers, service is a little hit or miss, depending on how busy they are, but their hearts are in the right place. They have a parking lot! Which I've never used because they're so close to the Thorndale red line stop, but still! Inside is a bit dark, which looks like the only opportunity to eat at Moody's in Winter, so I took a star off for the sticky beer hall quality of the indoors, but outside is great--excellent pub food! Go Moody's!
