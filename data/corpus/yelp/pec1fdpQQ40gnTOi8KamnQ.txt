One of the best bars I've been to in Chicago. Not only do they have a ridiculous beer and alcohol menu, but the food is pretty damn good and reasonably priced. I went all out and got the bacon tempura along with the fried cheese curd. Both were fried perfectly and delicious. I washed it down with the Two Floyd's/Dogfishead collaboration beer, nuff said...
