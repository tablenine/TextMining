Yay! I'm going back to the Magic Castlle while I'm on business in LA. I haven't been back in years, since I performed there (that's the full disclosure happenning again). . This mansion is what so many magic hotels and clubs and bars are based on. It's up for sale damnit, and it's one of the last classy magic destinations every lover of magic should visit.. . It's a private club, so you must know a member, and you should really plan on staying all night so you can see all the magic shows, in the close up room, the parlour, and the stage, let alone all the various magic that happens in the lounges, halls, and other secret rooms.  have the expensive dinner and explore the secret staircases, talk to Irma the invisible piano player who will play any song you like, see some ghosts, come back for Halloween Seances in the secret back room, when you're sober, come back and check out the library (with a magician to guide you of course). . I'd love to open the NY version of this luxurious scene in the next few years. It is coat required lol. My ex made the mistake of forgetting and they made him wear a plaid tie and jacket. lol a scene straight out of a  Dean Martin comedy. . . The acts range from astounding oh my god I need to change religions, to omg this guy sucks get me the hell out of here but it is worth the experience. I've met quite a few amazing people here, magic wise, in the sciences, the arts, and some cool celebrities, like Tony Curtis--awesome! . . FULL DISCLOSURE AND SELF PROMO: I'm performing there the week of Jan 21-27th.  if anyone wants to meet up, I might be able to hook you up with admission, just let me know. I'll be there on business and pretty bored, so say hi.
