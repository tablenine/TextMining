Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Went to Soowon this past Saturday and I can say I left a happy camper.  There is an easy recipe to good Korean BBQ :Good meat + beer + good banchan (which is constantly refilled) = good times, and SooWon didn't dissapoint.  Not only was the food very tasty, the service was awesome!  The korean ladies working here are top notch.  Even to people that don't speak Korean!  Believe it or not!  Definitely a good place to go, the Pork belly and marinated Galbi were . http://bomb.com. .  Also definitely go with one of the combos if you have a few people, definitely a great deal.
