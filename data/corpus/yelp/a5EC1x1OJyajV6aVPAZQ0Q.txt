Restaurant: Willy&#39;s Mexicana Grill
Category: Mexican
Man, I'd really really like to give this place 4 1/2 stars, because I feel oddly awkward about giving what is essentially a fast food joint 5.  However, compared to most other fast food Mexican places that come to mind (ahhem, particularly you, Qudoba of the soggy mess that you try to call a quesadilla), Willy's pretty much rocks.  They have vegetarian choices splattered all over their menu, their tofu is more than decent, and according to my boyfriend their tofu burrito is supercalafragalisticexpialadociously good.  . . I have the tofu tacos, and can attest that they are good, and that if you ask nicely enough, they'll load it up with so much deliciousness that you won't even be able to pick the thing up without it collapsing in your hands.. . Now I'm hungry.
