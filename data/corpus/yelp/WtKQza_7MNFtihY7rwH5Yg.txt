So obviously this place doesn't need my review. I have to say how happy I am that I strolled in today after seeing a couple eating the most delicious looking piece of pizza I had ever seen.  It turns out it was a lasagna pizza.  This slice is now my current favorite over Pie hole's pizza selections.  SO GOOD!!!!!  All of the pizza in this place looked amazing so I feel pretty confidant giving it five stars.
