Oh Crust,  I am very appreciative of your fancy pies.  Who knew that a combination of bacon, caramelized onions, bechamel sauce, caraway seeds and parmesan cheese would be such a fantastic pizza combination (Flammkuchen) ?  Or how about potato slices and baked potato toppings on a pizza crust?  I never, ever, want to quote that old ho Rachel Ray but as I was eating that all I could think was "Yum-o!"  (damn her and her catchy one-liners!). . I am also very appreciative of the fact that we had a totally cool server and not some snobby hipster.  And I know Andy M was appreciative of the fact that they served 3 Floyds Ale!  I love Unibroue ale and thought the Ephemere paired wonderfully with the Flammkuchen.  (wow try saying THAT three times fast!). . The pies are a little on the pricey side, but thats OK.  You do a fabulous job and I am intrigued to try other flavour combinations.  Yum-O,Crust, Yum-O.
