Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Of course I love Tito's Tacos, and you'll love Tito's too.  I don't know what people expect when they come here but ever since my first bite about 5 years ago I have been a loyal customer!. . The lines are long, yes. But since the recession the lines have been a teeny bit shorter.  Good for me, but bad for business.... . ANYWAY. The cheese is so delicious and the tacos are nice and crispy.  The salsa is just tomato and some cilantro but it's pureed really well and it's not spicy at all.  They have some jalapeno type salsa too that is also mild but adds a nice flavor.  I love the rice here.  And the beef, bean, and cheese burrito is to die for!. . I love Tito's Tacos, and you should love Tito's too!. . Cash only, and pay attention to where you are and who takes your order.  They take your order, prepare your food, and come back to the window for payment.  Go inside for faster service!  And go in pairs or more...have someone scouting out a table while you're waiting in line.  Maybe take your iphone or nintendo DS to have something to do while waiting hahaha
