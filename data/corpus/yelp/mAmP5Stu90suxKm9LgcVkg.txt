Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Griddle Cafe is, hands down, one of the best brunch places around that must be visited at least once in your life.  Everything comes in huge portions and tastes delicious.  There's a not-so-secret room in the back with a giant booth and a much more private setting.  There's only enough space for one group and Griddle doesn't accept reservations so getting there depends on the luck of the draw.. . The pancakes are humongous and come with all sorts of topping combinations that accommodate all types of sweet tooths.  As someone with a huge sweet tooth, I'd recommend either the Scotch on the Rocks or the Yellow Brick Road, both of which include butterscotch chips with various other toppings.  The pumpkin pancake is great for when the autumn holidays roll around and isn't too sweet.  Just be sure to order a single for your pancakes instead of going for a short stack -- one pancake is more than enough.. . Griddle also offers plenty of other options for people that prefer savory entrees for breakfast.  Their omelets are like their pancakes -- large and stuffed with lots of toppings.  A personal favorite is their Cobb omelet, which is stuffed full of bacon and chicken and topped with avocado upon request.. . However, there isn't enough space for such a popular restaurant-- so there is a bit of a wait.  Getting here early is the key to beating the 1-2 hour long waits.  And like all LA establishments, parking is a bitch so be sure to drop off someone to put your names down while the driver struggles for a parking spot in the lot in the back or on the street.
