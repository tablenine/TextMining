Everything, and I mean everything went up in price 20-30%.  . . That cookie that used to be $1?  It's now $1.25. . That salad that used to be $9?  It's now $12-13. . The special that used to be $12?  It's now $14.  . . The soup that was $6?  Now it's $6.50.. . At least the red velvet poppers are still $0.75. . When they raise the price of that one, I'm going to have to call it quits on this love affair.
