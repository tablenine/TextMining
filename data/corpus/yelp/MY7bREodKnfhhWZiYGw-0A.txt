Maybe Katsu-ya had an "off" day, but after dining here, I wouldn't exactly join the katsu-ya cult.  . . The food was good, I've had better in Seattle (which reminds me I should review) and the service was ok.  What I really enjoyed was my company - Mel, Sheryl, and Mike, and we'd tally stars throughout our dining experience.  Scorching hot green tea?  MINUS ONE! we agreed.  Not letting us see the board with all the specials was a unanimous MINUS ONE, etc.... . I'd come back, and maybe this review will be revised.
