Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Definitely not the "best fish taco in Ensenada," but most definitely ONE of Â the best I've had in Southern Cali. It's pretty difficult to not like this place. Both the fish and shrimp tacos are pretty good and priced nicely, they have a decently sized patio to chill at and drink your booze you brought from home or purchased right next door at the Cap n' Cork, and have a nice assortment of salsas and condiments available for your tacos.. . I probably would have given it four stars due to the "cash only" rule, but considering the crappy day I had today, having to go next door to get money out of the ATM, and having to use an upside down trash can as a table (see photos) because all the actual tables were being used in the patio, did not bother me one bit and was actually very enjoyable. No doubt, will be a new neighborhood spot I will frequent on a regular.
