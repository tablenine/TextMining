The tacos here are great. As is the Chilada. Mind you its nothing you can't get at a billion of the other kickass taco stands all over the city but some of the little specialty tacos that you can get across the city are under one roof here. Also, if you are a yuppie you may find this place more comfortable than heaven forbid wandering around Pilsen and such. These conveniences plus the fact that you are surrounded by all the beautiful people will cost you though. Its pretty overpriced.
