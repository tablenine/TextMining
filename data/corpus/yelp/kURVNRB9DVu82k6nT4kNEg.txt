Restaurant: Maoz
Category: Middle Eastern
And I thought my love for Maoz ended when I left Barcelona! On my Europe trip, Maoz was located on the bottom of our hostel and we ventured in a minimum of twice a day.  Not the cheapest falafel, but a delicious one.  What makes Maoz so fun is all the toppings laid out like a salad bar that you can add to your falafel.  By far the best addition is the almost crispy cauliflower salad drenched in olive oil.  Add some tahini, some yogurt sauce and eggplant and I am the happiest girl.  One love Maoz.
