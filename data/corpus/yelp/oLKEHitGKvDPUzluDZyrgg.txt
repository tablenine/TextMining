Stopped by this market last Thursday to see what the talk was all about. Got there about 6:30pm and it was a little quiet. Decided to first do a walk       through to see which vendors were there. Some of them I have seen at other markets. Like The Breadman, Alexis Fruits, Cobblermania, &amp; the Crepe guy. After completing my first go around I decided to buy some muffins(one for then and the other for the morning) from The Breadman stand. I've had them before and they are delicious. It's a must try. Had them with a cup of coffee . Coffee by the way was very good as well. Looks like this market has a little bit of everything but they do need some more food stands aside from those wannabe Tacos they were selling from the restaurant. Overall, it has the potential of being a good market if they add a couple of more good stands.
