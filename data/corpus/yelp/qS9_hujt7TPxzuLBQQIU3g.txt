Pros. Romantic . Candles in the middle outside patio . The view. . Cons. -Even though this place is huge. the seating is so cramped . Tables are too close to each other. -Perimeter seating of the restaurant - way too dark. -Valet Parking - takes a while for you to get your car. -No need to make reservations because when I did - I ended up waiting for over 1 hour anyways. . -Hard to find because it's tucked away on a windy back street. . P.S. Included photos for y'all to view :)
