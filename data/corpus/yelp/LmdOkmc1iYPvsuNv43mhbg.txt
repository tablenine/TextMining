Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I really didn't like the food here. For some reason, I came back, and it was worse the second time around. Not to sound like a loser iron chef judge, but the food just lacks soul. It doesn't have the taste/charm of an authentic, family owned Italian restaurant, and it doesn't have ambiance/sophistication of a trendy place. It just lacks.... . Wine bar is pretty cool though. I like trying wines that I'm too poor to afford by the bottle. Too bad they all taste the same to me. The good thing is that you don't have to be a huge wine connoisseur to enjoy the wine bar.
