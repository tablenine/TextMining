Nice place,  Good food.  If you are a beer lover Yard House is the place to go.  I was going to go to Houston's which I know is much more pricey but they were closed.. . Bad First...  The bar is central, so it means much more  foot traffic by your table.. . I ordered a avacado and Swiss burger which was cooked perfectly.  I wolfed it down!. . I tried Blue Moon, with the oranges and wasn't really impressed.  Didn't taste like beer to me.
