oh how i love you.. . i first met you in taiwan and you stole my heart. then i met you again in beijing and again, i left a piece of my heart with you there. and finally, you are close enough to me so i can visit you more than once every few years. . . the shanghai dumplings are the best here!!! nice and juicy and hot. we didn't have to wait for a seat and the service was fast!
