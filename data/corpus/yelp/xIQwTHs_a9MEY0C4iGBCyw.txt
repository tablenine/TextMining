My hubbie and I love this place.  Mind you, I don't even like garlic that much, but everything I've had at this place, is delicious.  Their rolls are soo good w/ that garlic spread.  And the Acine de Pepe is so good.  It's buckshot pasta and I love it.  I like the caesar salad and the salmon is good.  My husband loved the 40 clove garlic chicken, but he stank for about 3 days afterwards.  So yeah, make sure you don't go here on a first date, you might lose the girl or guy because he/she thinks you stink.
