Restaurant: Loca Luna
Category: Tapas Bars
I am going to have to agree with Drew about the Loca Luna being a popular spot for Birthday parties.  Both of the times that I have been here it has been for a birthday party.  . . I wonder why so many people prefer to celebrate the day of their birth here.  The only two explanations that I come to is the fact that they take reservations and they offer larger tables for the bigger parties that seem to be able to sit nearly 20 people.  . . The hostess at the last party I attended here informed me that it is usually best if you call and make your reservations at least 2 weeks ahead of time, depending on which day of the week you plan on going.. . The building is fairly large, and there are two different bars where you can get drinks.  I really did not like the outside patio portion of the restaurant because they provide picnic tables for the seating arrangements.  This may have been because they were weary of purchasing expensive patio furniture, because of the possibility of an individual stealing some pieces to use as furniture for their own porch, or in some cases as furniture inside their card board box.  . . The interior of the restaurant is decorated nicely.  It looks great in the afternoon with sun windows on the ceiling providing a majority of the light, and even better at night when they dim the lights leaving a majority of their light source coming from the blue and purple based light fixtures on the sides of the bar and in the ceiling.. . Loca Luna gets very crowded on the weekend, so make sure that you get there early and find a table or you may be standing a majority of the night.
