The food here is really good.  The portions are also abundant.  And they have gluten-free options (like pizza and nachos).  For food, I would give it five stars.. . Avoid the juices.  The two people I ate with both ordered drinks - one a juice and the other an iced tea of sorts and neither one of them had more than a quarter of it.  Stick with the water or something else you know you like to drink.. . Half a star is taken away for price.  Vegan food is usually more than regular food and the stuff they use is usually fresh and delicious, but the prices are about 13-16 dollars for an entree. Ouch.. . The other half a star is taken away because of the setup.  The inside is nice with a pretty plain but still somewhat stylish decor.  But the place is set up that there isn't a lot of room to move around.  I feel like it could be remodeled in some way to make it seem more spacious without sacrificing how many tables they have.. . There's metered parking (if you can find it) and I think there's residential parking, but be careful and check the signs.  There's also valet.
