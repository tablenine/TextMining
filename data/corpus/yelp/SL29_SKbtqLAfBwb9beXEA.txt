Note:  There are no - repeat - NO true vegetarian options on this menu ... INCLUDING the chips.  I was told by my waiter the last time I was there that everything is prepared in animal fat &amp;/or made with some sort of meat product.  Please also note:  This was only after I asked.  Please also ALSO note:  I've told the waitstaff there on other dining occasions that I am a vegetarian &amp; not ONE bothered to tell me this information.  No wonder my intestines got a workout an hour later..... . Also, once we waited twenty minutes for a table when there were clearly several available.  Then we spent the whole time trying to track down our waiter so we could get water, order, refill chips, get our tab, get our credit card back so we could just sign the check &amp; leave.  We were subsequently late to our appointment.. . Boo.
