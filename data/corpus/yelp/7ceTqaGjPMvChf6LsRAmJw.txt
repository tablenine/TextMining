Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
I think this may be my new favorite restaurant in the Palms/Culver City stretch of Venice.  . . The atmopshere is rather cave-like, and old-school. It very much resembles most Mexican restaurant holes in the wall.  . . After reading all of the great yelp reviews, I was really excited about coming here.  Of course, the meal started with that bowl of fat, greasy tortilla chips, and homemade salsa.  I could have eaten these for my meal alone.  I ordered a Sangria, and definitely suggest it.  It's definitely worth the low price.. . What is there to say about the food that hasn't already been said?  It's great for a vegetarian like me, as well as hardcore meat eaters.
