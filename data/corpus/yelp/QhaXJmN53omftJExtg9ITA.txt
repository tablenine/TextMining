My friends and I came here tonight for their Tuesdays, $8.95/entree special.  It was a great deal but I would never come back on a normal night. . . We had to wait 20 minutes even though we had a reservation.  That was annoying.  But service overall was very good and quick.  . . We ordered 4 dishes: . . GRILLED HONG KONG STEAK  (too salty). HOT HUNAN SHRIMP (very good!  loved the sauce). PEKING DUCK L'ORANGE  (very big portion, tasted good) . LO MEIN (typical lo mein, nothing special). . Overall I liked the food but it's not real Chinese food.  Ok maybe I'm wrong b/c I'm not Chinese but it doesn't take the same as other restaurants in Chinatown.  . . It's BYOB, which is awesome but they charge $3 for corkage fee.  Our bottle didn't have a cork but they still charged us.  I didn't appreciate that. . . I took the blue line and got off at Logan Square and walked 3-4 blocks.  The area is kinda shady but it's not bad.  . . I probably will not be back but I suggest giving it a try on a Tuesday night!
