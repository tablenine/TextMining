Have you ever found a dish you loved so much you sometimes dream of it? I did and I found it here. . . If you love steak, you can't go wrong here. My favorite is the skirt steak (earns the 5 stars for this). It's a 9 oz. piece of meat that's slightly flat and long, hence the name. It's served on a huge plate with rice, salsa, beans, plantains, and yucca flour. I get my steak done medium and it's always tender and juicy. It's even just as good when you eat it the next day if you have any left overs. . . I enjoyed other things I've eaten here. I like the bread that they serve before meals, especially when you dip it in some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I also liked the Caprese for an appetizer, which is some kind of marinated mozzarella, sliced marinated tomatoes, basil and olive oil served with toasted bread slices. . . Bottom line: Great almost any time of day, although it does get busy at times and it's not always easy to get a table. Service was great. The servers I've encountered so far were friendly and attentive. Always refilling water before I had to ask, checking up on my table, and packed up my leftovers. Everyone I know who's tried this places loves it, there's plenty of variety for almost anyone. And if you're a meat lover, get the skirt steak!
