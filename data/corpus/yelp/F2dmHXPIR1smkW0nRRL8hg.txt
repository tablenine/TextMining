Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
It's a garlic restaurant with average food with inflated prices, and the decor is a bit cheezy.  However, I do love the bagna calda.  It is whole cloves of garlic that have been simmering in olive oil in the oven.  You smear it on your bread and it is just orgasmic.  Then the other must-have is the garlic relish that is on the table.  It is just parley, garlic, olive oil and salt (you can get the recipe in the restaurant cookbook they sell in the gift shop).  Just smear it all over your food (I make it at home and put it on my pizza and pastas).  And if you're really brave, try the garlic ice cream.  Your mouth is so garlic gaga at this point, all you taste is the vanilla and caramel.  Granted, the original one in San Francisco is better, but who's going to drive all the way up there for garlic?
