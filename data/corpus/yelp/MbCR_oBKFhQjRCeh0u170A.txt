This review is SOLELY based on their peking duck. I made reservations for a duck on Sunday 1 week ahead, and was excited to taste what Time Out Chicago deemed as "best duck of the city". We got there, the place was half packed, and we ordered the duck 3 course, 1/2 order of their famous roast pork, and shanghai bok choy.  We were sitting there for 1/2 hour, with nothing to eat, watching the lady with duck wheeling by. Finally I asked our non-existent waiter, and was informed that there is only 1 duck slicer tonight, since the other person called off. He then offers to give us our other food first, and assured us to be next on the wait for the duck.  1/2 hour and countless ducks for other tables later, we got ours. It was DISAPPOINTING. It was NOT Peking duck at all, just Cantonese roast duck. The skin was NOT crispy, too much fat under the skin, and the meat was dry. Needless to say, I was SUPER upset that I had to wait 1 hour for a bad duck, but on a good note. I LOVED their famous roast pork. I will continue my quest for Peking duck in Chicago, any recommendations?
