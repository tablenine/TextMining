This place is down the street from me so I walk by constantly and have been dying to go.  The interior is simply beautiful.  Moreover, I've been a big fan of jean georges other restaurants so when RW came around, this was on the top of my list.  Fairy tale ends there.. . Although the atmosphere is top-notch (otherwise I'd have to give this a 2), the food was bland and unappealing.  For brunch I ordered the goat cheese omelette at the suggestion of our server, and found it entirely underwelming.  The omlette was extremely fluffy but, sadly, had no taste.. . I may one day go back for lunch or dinner and try something else on the menu, but I won't get my hopes up.  Ugh. I hate being disappointed, don't you?
