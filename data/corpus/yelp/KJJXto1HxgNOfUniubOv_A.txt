Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Okay, so the lines are long. The way you order and get your food is pretty inefficient, and OK the people who take your order are usually looking at you with the are-you-done-yet look. But the tacos are so GOOD! The burritos are delicious, and the guacamole is always fresh. Â I know a lot of people aren't fans, and perhaps its an acquired taste for this type of Mexican food, but if you have a chanced, you must go!
