Good burgers, good fried zucchini.  My burger was great, but having tasted my gf's black bean veggie burger, I could have gone with that too.  We paid the $2 extra for a non-potato side - fried zucchini and the house salad.  The salad was huge and very satisfying.  The zucchini were great.  We didn't get anything to drink, but I did notice the beer was pretty standard price - didn't see any great deals there.
