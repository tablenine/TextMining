I love this place! The cocktails are tasty (and I am a hard critic on mixed drinks...I don't like much) and they serve personal bottles of champagne. The food is super!  Definately try the Wasabi Fries, they are a bowl full of heaven. The music is great and the mix of people is always interesting, there is a little bit for everyone. And the place gets really busy after 10pm, but not so busy you can't find somewhere to sit.  . . The only reason I took off one star is that it is practically impossible to get a drink after midnight.  The waitresses/waiters practically disappear and it's a challenge to get to the bar.
