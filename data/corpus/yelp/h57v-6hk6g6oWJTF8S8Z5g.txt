I cannot believe I have not written a review about Freds yet!!. . I love this place and have been coming here for about 5 years.. . I will forever and ever be in love with the #69 chinese chicken salad. The dressing is like crack...its AMAZING and a lil spicy. I also love that they put cashew in it. YUM YUM.. . You can't fail with breakfast here either. And they have the sourdough bread thats soft and doesn't tear your mouth up. The breakfast burrito is pretty good. And if you haven't had the Bosa Nova waffles yet YOU BETTER!! . . Their chili cheese fries are decent...not the best, but I'm not going to dock any points for them. . . The juicy lucy is FABULOUS. It is def in my top 10 burger list. If you feel like a challenge the probably a foot tall Tower of Power is tasty.. . -1/2 a star for never mixing up the malts good enough. -1/2 a star for sometimes soggy french fries. . But I love this place so much that waiting 30 minutes at 3am doesn't bother me!! They also have beer and wine if you make it before 2.. . And don't forget to check out the duck in the left bathroom!
