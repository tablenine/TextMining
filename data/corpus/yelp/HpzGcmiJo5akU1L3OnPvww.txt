The ice cream bars are what sold me. A friend brought 2 over once (I had a strawberry shortcake) and they're heaven in ice cream form.. . I ordered lunch here yesterday, an edamame soup and a chinese chicken salad with of course an ice cream bar. I ended up trying to call in a pickup order but found out the salad I really wanted was no longer being served. I really love restaurants who are on top of updating the site and keeping the menu current. The edamame soup was AMAZING I think it had pears (or apples?) in it with a little sour cream. The salad was ok - the chicken kind of tasted like canned chicken (where it could easily pass as cat food) but the greens and dressing were delicious. I just worked my way around the chicken.. . Also bummer that they don't take American Express. I usually order food in WeHo for my office so not being able to read their menu online and not being able to put it on a company card is kind of a hassle.. . But I'd go back for the ice cream and soup.
