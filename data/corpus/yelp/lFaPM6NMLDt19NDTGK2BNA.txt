Restaurant: Pylos
Category: Greek
i've had a few great meals here and cannot think of a reason not to give pylos 5 stars.. . i would call the decor sophisticated casual - good for a lunch with friends, a date, or family dinner.. . the pastitsio was addictingly good. i hate to say this, but if you're unfamiliar with the dish think of hamburger helper (but waaaaaaay better).. . the vegetable pita sandwich is also very good as are the greek potato wedges (think fancy fries).. . this place gets pretty busy during peak (trendy) hours so if you can hit it up for a slightly earlier lunch/dinner you can walk in without worrying about waiting for a table.
