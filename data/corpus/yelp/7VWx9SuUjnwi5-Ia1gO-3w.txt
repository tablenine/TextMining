An unassuming (but fanastic) find in the quaint Japanese shopping malls of downtown L.A. !. . They had some cuts of fish that you would not necessarily find in run-of-the-mill sushi places such as yellowtail belly, sea urchin, and monkfish liver. . . The Chirashi dinner special had great value for the price! You get to try all of their main cuts of fish (minus salmon, but I think they were out that night). Yellowtail, snapper, tuna, belly, squid, octopus, plus tamago and eel. Recommended for those who want to try a variety of sushi without the pressure of doing a la carte.. . Kudos to my Aviator connoisseur who was brave to venture out of his California rolls by gettting the Sushi Dinner special instead. It had the same cuts of fish as Chirashi, but sushi-style. He explored what fish he liked (and did not like). He also made reservations and discovered the place (double down bonus points).. . We also ordered the sweet shrimp (large portions, hint of natural sweetness) and monkfish liver appetizer (tasty). They serve up the fried shrimp head too, a gesture by the chef to indicate the shrimp was indeed, fresh.. . Make note of the 4 order minimum per person if you sit at the sushi bar. Parking is limited on the mall lot, but Jtown Plaza across the street has a competitive flat rate. Bonus points for not having the pomp and circumstance of WeHo or Hollywood.. . A step above the dizzying array of sushi places in L.A. Save to the list of places to go when downtown.
