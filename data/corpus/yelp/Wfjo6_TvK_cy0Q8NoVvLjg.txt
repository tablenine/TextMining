This place has only been open a hot minute and already has a ton of positive reviews so.... . Do I have anything new and fascinating info on the place... no, . was is absolutely delicious? YES. Awesome, thin delicious crust and the freshest sauce and toppings ever. . This pizza made my friend and I almost have to go back an order an additional pizza because we nearly ate her husband's share, thank the lord for the cannoli! Â . Go and eat it!
