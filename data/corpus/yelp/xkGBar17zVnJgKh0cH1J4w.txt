Let's talk SALT!!!!. Had a great experience with this restaurant. 10pm reservation on a Thursday night, was able to get in earlier coz we showed up so much earlier, but then again the fact that Osteria is now open might have something to do with it also.. Start with Mozzarella+Prosciutto, delicious, clean, simple, but what makes a difference here is the Olive oil+ SALT flakes, it makes the MP combo so much sweeter. Note: if they asked if you want to have bread with that, the answer is "HELL YES!" That bread is so good, yet so simple, grilled with some garlic rubbed and SALT flakes, a perfect combination between texture and flavor, nicely done.. Move on to a small cup of Shrimp+Melon+Mint, again, nicely seasoned, well balanced on the flavor and texture.  Then there is the Bruschette, yumm, Chicken liver+Capers+Parsley+Guanciale, delicious, though I thought the portion is bigger than expected. The hint of lemon in it makes a big difference.. Two Pizzas ordered were the Egg+Guanciale, and Anchovy+tomato, both were good, but I was not wowed by it. Good crust and flavor.. Dessert came, ordered the Butterscotch Budino, delicious, again the Salt flakes throughout the bites makes a big difference, made me smile everytime my tounge hit that  note.  The other dessert was a trio of gelati, Olive Oil, Gianduia, and Passion Fruit, purposely ordered 3 distinct flavor, all were good but  the Olive Oil was excellent, hmm with some Olive oil drizzled on top and some Salt flakes......ahhh heaven.
