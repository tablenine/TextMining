Before I went vegan, I went to Urban Belly (Bill Kim's other restaurant) quite often, so I was excited to hear about the menu at Belly Shack because they offer several vegan options. I recommend the boricua - messy, but flavorful and satisfying. No vegan desserts on the menu unfortunately. It's BYOB. Order and pay at the counter, then they bring your food to you.
