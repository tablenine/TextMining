Ok, so it's very possible that I had the greatest burrito of my life at Loteria. And I have had a lot of Mexican food. I always say that I could eat Mexican every day, but I could ACTUALLY eat the mole chicken burrito every day for the rest of my life. It's kind of that good. I went back again tonight, and I promised myself I'd try something else, I really did...but no. The mole chicken called to me once again. No regrets!
