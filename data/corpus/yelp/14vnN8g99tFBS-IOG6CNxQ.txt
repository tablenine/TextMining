It's nice to have something different for lunch now and again.  When I know it's going to be a long day at the office, I'll come here for a sandwich and whatever other treats I'm fancying for.. . Absolutely love the garlic roasted lamb sandwich.  I like that you can get sandwiches, salads, or pre-made items to go.  Then there's the bakery section with all it's yummy goodness and how can you walk past the chocolates without thinking about getting one?. . Service is spotty here, I've come during the day and it's like pulling teeth to get something done while I've come at night and the chefs are popping out to get you a taste of this or a morsel of that.  It won't stop me from coming here to enjoy a break from the office on the shaded patio.
