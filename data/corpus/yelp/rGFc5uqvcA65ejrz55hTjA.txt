Restaurant: JCT Kitchen &amp; Bar
Category: Southern
Whether downstairs at the kitchen or upstairs at the bar I've always had a good experience at JCT. I ate at the kitchen during their Sunday Supper and had a stellar prix fixe meal for only $24 which included a salad, biscuits, meat &amp; three, and a delicious dessert. Up @ the bar you've got a nice skyline view, live music and a great beer selection and cocktails. I'm in *love* with their Long Island iced teas crafted with fresh lemonade!
