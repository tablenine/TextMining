Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
I really like Culver City, and from my understanding the atmosphere has gotten tremendously greater over the past few years.. . Ford's Filling Station doesn't have bad food, it's just far over-priced, and there's nothing spectacular about the plates here.. . I enjoyed sitting outside at Ford's with the company I kept, but in all, if I had to do it again, I'd probably pick to eat elsewhere.
