Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Third generation Papa Cristos customer!  This place makes me feel at home.  The deli is loaded with cured meats and sausages.  The feta cheese is THE BEST in town.  And my dear friends at Papa Cristos are the ones who taught me that there is no such thing as French or Bulgarian "feta".  There is only Greek feta. while the others make "feta-style" cheese.  Take this with a grain of salt, but he claimed this was now a legally recognized definition :)  The other imported cheeses are wonderful too.  They bake fresh bread daily and offer a variety of imported, fresh, Greek olives.  Their yogurt is thick and creamy and as close to Yia-yia's as I can get these days.  The shelves are stocked with Greek wines, pastas, olive oil, ouzos, canned foods, etc.  . . And, of course, the restaurant!  The shrimp Santorini is my favorite and I now recreate it at home.  It's wonderful with the fresh bread.  The tzatziki, tarama, dolmales, hummos, salad, grilled eggplant, lamb chops, you name it... it's great.  This is the real deal and the prices are fair enough.  . . My family ordered catering from Papa Cristos once and although there was a bad mix up, the owner, Chris, made up for it with TONS of food and sincerity.  Thanks guys!  We love you!
