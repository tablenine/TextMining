My favorite BC is the one on Brookhurst in Garden Grove. When I went to this one, I expected the same but NOPE. I waited three hours to be seated, from 7:30 to 10:30!! (the most I have ever waited for BC.) And the food did not taste like BC, it tasted bootleg.. the sauce was not even spicy and we ordered medium which is usually spicy enough.. it was just really disappointing..
