Came here from a recommendation, since Chicago is known for their steaks. We were able to make a last min 9pm reservation which when we got there was still REALLY packed. The surrounding area around the restaurant is actually very lively! We were seated almost immediately, and got great seats at the window of the restaurant so it was a lot quieter than sitting inside.. . We were given bread and butter - and it comes with 3 different types of bread - my favorite was the one with all the nuts in it. Yum! The cool thing about this place is that the waiter came out with a whole tray of raw steaks and one lobster tail. Just to show us the steak and explain the cuts to us. Very cool. I ordered the small sirloin, since the regular sized sirloin looked really big. We also decided to share the twice baked potato amongst the three of us. Even my small steak was pretty big - and rare just like I wanted. The waiter did tell us that the meat is normally a bit rarely than what it normally is. So when I ordered rare, he did tell me it'd be pretty rare. I told him to bring it on, the bloodier the better! The steak itself was very juice and tender. Crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside. My friends ordered the filet mignon and the classic cut and said that was excellent as well. I was so full from my "small" steak that I could barely finish the 1/3 of the twice baked potato! . . We were going to order dessert, when we saw that the table next to us ordered a dessert - and it was huge! One dessert could easily feed 4 people! Too stuffed for me. The bathroom is upstairs - and they have a bathroom tenant working there. Overall, great steak. Service was excellent here, our waiter was wonderful. Def. a must try if you are looking for some great steak in Chicago.
