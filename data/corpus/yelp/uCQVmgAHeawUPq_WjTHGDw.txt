Seriously the best chicken I have ever had... in my life. If turkey tasted like this on Thanksgiving, no one would ever leave the table. . . Words of advice:. 1) One order of Pio Pio (the sound a chicken makes in Spanish) will feed two hungry people, and three people picking. . 2) The plantanos are amazing, order them. . . 3) Service is AMAZINGLY fast... I mean, like 5 minutes after ordering food was on the table. So dont plan for a long dinner. . . 4) Use the green hot sauce on whatever you can put it on... jalapeos, basil and mayo can not be bad for you... really... . . 5) If you dont like chicken, this is not your place... you have the option of chicken, chicken with some sides, or chicken with a lot of sides. Thats it. . . 6) Sangria is great, very juicy. . 7) *** THEY ONLY TAKE AMERICAN EXPRESS *** So be forewarned (who does that, really?). . The foodie in me wants to come back, and use the left over bones to make chicken stock... just because it was that damned good. Is that sad? Don't answer that.
