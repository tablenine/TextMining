Something tells me that this place isn't 'what it used to be'  like in the olden days.  No doubt there's a lot of history there, but the food is not so awesome.  The potato knish is bland, the meat knish tastes like plastic.  Plus everything is a bit overpriced.  . . I come from the east coast, and I know my Jewish-style delis.  I have tried this place over and over again, wishing for it to be good.  I have not lived in Los Angeles long.  So despite everyone's "I've been here since I was a kid" thing, I have no fond memories as a teen going here.  Just as an adult that knows the difference between a good and a bad  deli.. . This is not a good deli.   . . I prefer going to Greenblatt's on Sunset.  They have parking, too.
