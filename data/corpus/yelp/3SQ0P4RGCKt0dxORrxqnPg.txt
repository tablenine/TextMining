Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
The view is nice...blah, blah, blah...although I find the whole theme of the restaurant a little cheesy.  If I was taken here on a first date, I may be impressed a little because it's a little pricey...but overall, I don't think I'd be impressed because Yamashiro's is notorious for not delivering good food.    Service is spotty too....a bunch of waiters that forget they are waiters.  What's with that anyway?  If it was just about the view and the ambiance...I probably still wouldn't go since I could find that elsewhere...and not have to pay for overpriced mediocre food.
