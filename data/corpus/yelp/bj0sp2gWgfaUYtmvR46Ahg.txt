Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
I came here with a few of my friends and if you are a seafood fiend, this place is heaven for you.. . The service was average, but the way it was served is somewhat caveman-like.  You sit down on a table covered with wax paper and the food comes in plastic bags.  The waiter just drops the plastic bag in the middle of the table and everyone just digs in.  The utensils are your hands.  Makes me feel like some sort of animal  trapped in a cage at Petco during feeding time.  The place offer bibs to people because it will get messy.  It is Cajun style food so expect it to be spicy.  The wait time is horrible.  To me, the wait was not worth it.  I was there 10 minutes after the place opened and still had to wait about 2 hrs.  There will be people lining up before this place opens.  Similar to a black Friday lines at a local best buy store.  They have a parking lot, but don't even bother unless you drive a clown car.  The lot fits like 6 cars, maybe 4 SUV vehicles.  Do yourself a favor and just look for street parking around the local residential area.. . I got to taste the following -. dungeness crab, fried catfish and fries, crayfish, shrimp.. . My favorite is out of the bunch are the fries.  They have very tasty french fries.  Weird how french fries is the star of the show at a seafood restaurant.  The crab would be my second choice.  The food is really messy and has a lot of butter.  I smelled like butter when I was done with my meal.  The price was average to fair for what you get.. . I have to deduct 2 stars for the long wait times and bad parking situation.  Other than that, this place is a good hangout location to be with friends and eat like barbarians.  . . Bon Appetit!
