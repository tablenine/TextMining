Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
One street that I rarely walk down is Broadway.  I think I need to start exploring this area more.  I've been to three restaurants here and they have all been excellent.  I stopped in Saturday night and the menu looked good enough to stay.  They make all of their food fresh daily, or at least that's what the waitress told me.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich which came with cajun fries and my girlfriend ordered the french toast.  They were both really tasty.  We then decided to order a vanilla malt for desert, it was as good as any milkshake I've had.  This place is great if you're in the mood for good diner food.  They have a very large menu and serve breakfast all day.
