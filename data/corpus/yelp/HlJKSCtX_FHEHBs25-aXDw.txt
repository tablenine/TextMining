Save your trip to Lala's for when you are experiencing an acute carnivorous appetite.  Then order the Plato Mixto with your dining companion.  The "mixed plate" consists of italian sausages, a New York strip, skirt steak, half a chicken, sweetbread, and a mixed salad.  You're sure to suffer a food coma after this meal.  Oh and of course, be sure to order lots of Sangria.  The only thing I didn't like about the Sangria was that it was too pulpy.  The prices here are really reasonable as well, so save those extra $$ for going out on Melrose afterwards.
