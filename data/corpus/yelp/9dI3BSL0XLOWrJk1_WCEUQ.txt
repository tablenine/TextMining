4/25/09 - Tried it the first time last weekend. Found this place from reading reviews from Yelp. There are over 700 reviews so I figured it must be worth to try. I however agree with Len S. The place failed to impress. The ramen itself has a nice texture to it and the pork is good, but there is just very little pork in the bowl. The broth looks really good, but tasted bland. The side fried rice has a lot of pork in it, which was really good, but also bland. A bit disappointing after waiting for over 1 hour. Â Another negative, the place is filthy and no air circulation inside. You do get a lot of food though for the price, so food value is a plus. The service is also very friendly. . I say this place is better than Ramen Ya or Asahi but Santouka is more superior.
