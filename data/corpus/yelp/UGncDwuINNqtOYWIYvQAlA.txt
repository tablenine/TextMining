Restaurant: The Bluebird
Category: Wine Bars
This Bluebird is as good at what it does as the old Bluebird on Clybourn was dark. The ambience of this place is especially warm and convivial. At once sophisticated and casual, all the aesthetic touches from the surprisingly comfy Art School Stools to the wood mounted menus, are inviting and well thought out.  The bar itself is gorgeous. Douglas Fir maybe??? The artesian beer and the diverse wine lists including a very nice $7 Pinot will keep me in the fold.  The food selection is quite diverse (Fish, Quail, Flatbreads to canap style "toasts") will seemingly support both a destination and neighborhood crowd. Just one taste of the Garlic aioli and Curry Ketchup accompanying my Frites ($5) was enough to displace my monthly need for Hot Doug's Duck Fat Fries and Streetside's Chipotle Ketchup. The kitchen is open late night and I can see myself easily becoming a regular here.  Perhaps the most NYC place I've been to in Chicago.  That's a good thing.
