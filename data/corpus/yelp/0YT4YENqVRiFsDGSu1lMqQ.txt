Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Last night we went here after eating a pretty filling dinner.. . Why? i don't know neither but i was craving for it... I know i liked their burger but i forgot that i only gave them 3 stars.. . The only thing that sucks is that they close early, we got here around 9:30 and they only allow to go orders. So we just have to get it that way. We got the Umami Burger and Pork Burger.. . its just freaking good!!! i swear i ate it when i got home even though its cold already its still tastes good!!! Next time i'm coming early!!!
