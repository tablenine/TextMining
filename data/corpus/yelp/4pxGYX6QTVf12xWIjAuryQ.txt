Restaurant: Caf√© Santorini
Category: Greek
Very nice restaurant with decent food. Seating outside is beautiful and somewhat romantical. . Service is great and the waiters are humorous. . Pricey. . I don't recommend the "Toasted Walnut and Gorgonzola Salad." I can't cook and I can make a better salad than this! The gorgonzola was weak-sauce. Twas so light I thought I was eating parmesean!. . The "Farfalle con Pollo al Pesto" (grilled chicken with bowtie pasta with cilantro pesto sauce) was excellent. Not greasy and the chicken was tender despite it being breast meat. . . The free garlic bread appetizer is forgettable. . I would give it another try
