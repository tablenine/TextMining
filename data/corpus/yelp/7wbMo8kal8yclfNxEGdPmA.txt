Why is this place getting such good reviews?  The food was pretty good, nothing special.  The service sucks.  As our party of four was entering the restaraunt this skinny bearded waiter yelled at us to shut the door.  One of our party said, "we're just coming in," at which point the waiter practically yelled, "I used to have nipples and now I don't so shut the door."  So we sit down.  The same guy comes by and THROWS our silverware down on the table and BANGS our water glasses down.  I was praying that this guy would not be our waitor and luckily he wasn't.  A lovely, attentive waitress with pink hair waited on us and she was great.  Except that wanker-boy kept coming around to refill our water glasses and BANGING them on the table.  Is this guy related to the owner or something?  How does he keep his job?  I don't really need that sh*t when I go out with my friends for a quiet Sunday brunch.  Because of him alone I will not go back.  If you want a good vegetarian brunch without the attitude, go to Victory's Banner in Roscoe Village.  I just hope our waitress didn't have to share here tip with this jaggoff.
