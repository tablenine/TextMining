k, i dropped by the location right by Americana for Lunch.  wowzers.  i absolutely love the lunch options.  &amp; of course, i stuffed myself with the pastries w/ a box togo.  the location is quite large.  and there's seats aplenty.  line moves by quick. . the Food:. - turkey sandwich on crossaint.  delicioso!  and VERy affordable.  from what i remember, $2-3.  i'm quite picky about my meats, but this one passes with an A!. - mango custard thing: its a dessert. i just ordered it since its a cute little round mound.  not a huge custard fan, but the couple forkfuls (yes, forgot to pickup a spoon) was yummy!! also, has a little grahmcracker bottom
