Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
This is my current favorite Korean BBQ.  The meat is very high quality, well trimmed, and comes with many tasty sauces and kim chi plates that I haven't found at other spots.  I especially liked the course salt/sesame oil dipping sauce.  I thought the price was very good for the quality/quantity of food, and the combos include soju/beer too!
