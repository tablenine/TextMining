Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Gastropubs
Could have been better.. . Burger a bit small... if u want a better burger for the same price, go to 25 degrees!. . Meat was juicy. Nothing really wrong with the burger, but nothing really wow... . . didn't taste the umami... . . service was lacking...  Our server, some dude, thought he's soooo cool that he doesn't need to write down our order. He was soooooo cool that the ice tea we ordered  and never came, ended up canceling it.. . I hate it when servers think they dont need to write down an order cause they think they can remember it all. . . Fries are as usual.. . Ketchup here is good, i can taste  kick of soy sauce and possibly a little fish sauce.... . btw: UMAMI BURGER: if you use fish sauce in your burger meat, you should put a disclaimer for those that don't eat fish or could have fish allergies.... . I was honestly dissappointed in this place
