Recipe for good times.. . Combine:. . 1. A good, good, good, good burger at 1:00 a.m. (Did I say good?) . 2. A first-time Sweetwater beer drinker.. 3. Some hardcore rock at decent volume.. 4. A stinky movie to trash. Hint: a sequel where a sixty-year old (still attractive) hero of our mighty, mighty 80s childhood acts.. 5. Scary. zombie-esque videos on the TVs.. 6. Kick-ass tater tots. Still dreaming about them.. 7. The coolest restaurant manager in Atlanta (attitude+extensive tattoos).. 8.Tulie.. 9. Kit.. 10. Adam (Lord Bacon).. 11. Two bacon strips Adam ate mimicking a Greek God (yeah, like grapes).. 12. The Highlander itself. Order the burger. It's good. Yeah, it is.. . Yeah, good times.
