I do love chicken and waffles. I found my chicken to be a little too well done. and when the bill came I was paying $40 but they accidentally charged me $400 - i was furious! The charge didn't come off my card for a few days - that's just plain silly. But the food was ok... just next time don't forget about my chicken and leave it in the fryer too long. Â I do love chicken and waffles such a good combination!
