I first came here, last January, for my girlfriend's birthday. She had told me that the place used to be Eurochow and they had moved, and that this was a new establishment, so we hoped the best since it looked good. The server was very cordial and helpful in choosing a great meal. It was a bit pricey when we went, but we've been getting little ads in the mail showing their new prices and happy hour theme, and have not gone back to try it yet.
