First of all, I got a free meal here on a work lunch, so I might be a little biased.. . The service was good, probably because they realized they were making bank off our table. Our waitress kept our wine glasses properly filled the whole lunch.. . We ordered the zucchini flowers (read: fried cheese balls with flowers in them) and grilled calamari for the appetizer. I loved the zucchini flowers. I can't say anything about the calamari because the plate never got around to me, but I'm freaked out by edible tentacles in general anyway.. . For the main meal, I ordered what they call an Orso panini, which has mascarpone, prosciutto, zucchini, and mint. The true star of the sandwich was the mascarpone, as expected. Delicious. The homemade pasta I sampled from my co-workers was also good.. . Dessert changed my life. They make a Nutella semifreddo. Nutella. Ice cream. With a cookie inside. What. My dessert was the envy of the table, even though people got tiramisu and molten, flourless, dark chocolate cakes. I also sampled those dishes, but my Nutella ice cream was the clear winner. . . I took a star off because of the prices, but I enjoyed myself. In addition to the wine, I had iced tea and espresso, so I was loopy and wired when we got back to the office.
