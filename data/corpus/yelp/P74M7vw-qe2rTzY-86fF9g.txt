Talk about stuffy. If I yearned for the feeling of constant asphyxiation, I would have entered the priesthood.  I definitely don't like having to pretend like I'm part of the bourgeois to fit in. Plus, I already have this stigma surrounding celebrity owned restaurants. I don't believe 'amazing' til I taste 'amazing.'  I digress. . . Anywho, we were a little late (colored people and time... we just won't ever learn to get along) to find they'd given our reservation away.  I'm a little disappointed, then Wolfgang himself comes out to apologize!  Says he's gonna make me the best meal ever- we'll see Wolfey, we shall see.. . My date begins with some salad with anchovies- It was good. But even my domestically challenged mother could throw together some lettuce and dressing. Needless to say, I'm unimpressed by salads in general.  On to the steak.  My bf is a man's man, throw a chunk of red meat down his gullet and he's happy as a clam.  I took the liberty of smelling the meat, tasting it, appreciating the texture. It was indeed, juicy, flavorful and cooked the most perfect shades of pink/ red/ brown. Ol' Wolfy had delivered on his promise. . . I remember a lot of the items on the menu having an Asian influence. 'Hong Kong' this and 'Szechauan' that, it was generally confusing to a simple minded person like myself. ::shakes Wolfgang:: "I don't like teriyakai dammit, but you've left me no choice."  With all due respect, I'd have been just as happy gallivanting down to "Wolfgang express" and having a dish from there... with leftovers abound!
