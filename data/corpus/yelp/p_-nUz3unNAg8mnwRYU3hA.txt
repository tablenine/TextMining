Category: American (Traditional)
the beef pastrami sandwichs with swiss or provolone cheese are to die for. the fresh french roll is the best. and the dill pickles and peppers are killer too. oh yeah, don't forget about the killer milkshakes too. go enjoy a great pastrami right now. you won't regret it
