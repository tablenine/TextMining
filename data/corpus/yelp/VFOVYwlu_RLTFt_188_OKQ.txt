Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Gastropubs
A fantastic burger.  I arrived at Umami Burger with high expectations and I was completly satisfied with my experience.  The lunchtime crowd on a weekend was moderately busy and the service a little slow and awkward (they ran out of turkey burgers!?) but the food made up for any of those concerns.  The burgers were flavorful and masterfully cooked.  I like to order my burgers well-done (hiss hiss, I know the shame!).  Because some restaurants feel that when you say medium-well you want a burger spewing with some red goo, which is not medium-well!  Thankfully when I ordered my original unami burger medium-well it came out perfectly cooked with a faint pink core and very juicy.  Other people at my table also had perfectly cooked burgers swimming with flavor.. . Some tips to know:. 1) the regular french fries are good but nothing more extraordinary than Burger King (actually they may have been BK fries) so take note you may want to skip them for the price.  . 2) be sure to ask what is included in the different burgers.  The menu does not necessarily describe the "fixins" that come standard (ie. mushrooms on the original Umami burger).. . All in all, it was a fantastic burger.  I'm too nervous to call it the "best ever" but it is definetly impressive.
