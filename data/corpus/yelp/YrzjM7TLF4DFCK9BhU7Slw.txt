Why do I love Katsu-ya?  Temperature.  That sushi may have been cold while it was still swimming around but by the time it gets to my plate I want it room temperature.  Not warm, not cold but room temperature.  Katsu-ya's dishes are consistently the perfect temp and I love them for that.  They also have the absolute best spicy tuna on crispy rice, spicy rock shrmip to die for, crispy albacore rivaled by none and a shockingly good chocolate cake.  They aren't cheap and they're always crowded but mmmmmm its so worth it everytime!
