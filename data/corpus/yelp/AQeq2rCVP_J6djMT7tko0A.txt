Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Shin Sen Gumi is decent.  Points for being able to specify how you want your ramen cooked (noodle consistency, broth consistency, etc)  Noodles were interesting, smaller in diameter but decent.  Broth was rather on point, im assuming they didnt put too much msg (which some ramen spots are notorious for).  The pork was aight, I've definately had better.  Lunch specials are good and cheap, got a bowl of ramen and side of shredded chicken over rice (from the recommendation of my persistent coworkers) for around 8 clams.  The chicken over rice reminded me of captain crunch (no joke!) and I craved some milk to pour over the dish.  Next time I'll go with the spam masubi or pot stickers though.  Also, id give this place a half star for the very enthusiastic staff, and the ackward cheers.  Oh and the people there are actually japanese.  word life to that.
