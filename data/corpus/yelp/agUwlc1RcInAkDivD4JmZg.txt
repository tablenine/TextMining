Yamishiro is similar to Takami in Downtown LA where the view is amazing, but the food is so-so.  What makes Yamishiro different from Takami though is that it seems a little more upscale and classy, where as Takami is more trendy and young.  This is definitely a place where you would take that special someone for a romantic night out.
