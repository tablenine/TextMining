There is almost no better place than Sushi Gen. Period. That was the only thing I had in mind when I was heading to LA.... Sushi Gen engraved in my mind like an obsession.  I NEED. I WANT. I DESIRE.. . We were in the sushi bar chatting with the friendly Japanese chef, who managed to impress us by saying simple greetings in French, German, and Mandarin.  Skip the menu, Omakase is the chef's choice, and you can't go wrong with it.  We were delighted by the super fresh hamachi belly, medium Toro, and other amazingly authentic sushi.  The green tea ice-cream wasn't great (taste artificial) but they gladly changed it with red bean ice-cream for us.  . . I then passed out with sushi joy and satisfaction.  Thank you Sushi Gen.
