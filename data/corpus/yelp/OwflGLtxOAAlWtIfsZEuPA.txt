Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
My bf took me to House of Prime Rib up in SF, but I preferred Lawry's so I took him to the one in Beverly Hills.  Lawry's was delicious as always.  I think they do medium rare just perfectly.  He thought that the meat was seasoned better at Lawry's, but the creamed spinach was better at House of Prime Rib.  Next time we'll get the creamed corn. Not really a fan of the spinning salad bowl though, too much dressing.. . We arrived 30 minutes before our reservation, and they were still able to accomodate us very quickly.  We barely had time to grab some meatballs and sit at the bar.  The service of the waitress, hostess, carver, and busboy were all very good.  The waitress even recommended  a different drink then the one I ordered, saying that she got better customer reviews of it.  I can't remember the name, it was a pear flavored cocktail, but it was good, and made pretty strong.. . I usually get the Lawry's cut and end up taking a lot of it home and having 2 more meals out of it.  Yum.. it still tastes good after.  The non creamy horseradish is also very delicious.
