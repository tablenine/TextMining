now Marlay House, prices are higher and they are busier.  the bread has changed from a crusty french bread to a ciabatta, not as good and probably cheaper for them.  my beloved $5.95 tomato, basil, mozzarella sandwich is now $7 :(  We only saw the server three time over the course of the entire meal.  . . food is decent and they serve beer, but i def loved you more before!
