Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
I haven't been to Hide in years. Bf came up to visit on sunday and we decided on sushi for dinner. We arrived around 6:45 and waited for about 10-15 mins. We were seated at the sushi bar. The sushi chef took our order right away. I got the spicy tuna roll and salmon teriyaki dinner. Bf got the sushi combo (yellowtail and salmon). Both of our dinners came with rice, picked veggies and miso soup. My salmon teriyaki was the best I have ever had. The spicy tuna was good and so was the soup. Bf said that the sushi was fresh and good. When he says something is good that means it's really good. So yay! He also commented how Hide was nicely decorated inside. I liked the picture of cherry blossom trees on the ceiling. Nice touch! The service was great, they kept refilling our hot tea. Oh and I just found out they have parking in the back which they validate! Extra bonus star for them b/c its hard to find parking on sawtell. P.S. Cash only, however there is an atm machine inside the restaurant.
