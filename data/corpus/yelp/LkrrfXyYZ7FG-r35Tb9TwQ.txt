Glad we found this place.  This is a nice BYOB that's good for a date, or to catch up with friends.  Everything on the menu is recognizeable, but with a new twist to it.  I had the Lamb burger with pomme frittes, which was awesome but a very large quantity.  I've also had the Wild Boar, which was perfectly cooked, and came with amazing mashed potatoes. . . I would definitely recommend making reservations, though, unless you're going at an odd time (Tues - Wed, or outside of meal times). . . The staff are really friendly as well.  They take good care of you.
