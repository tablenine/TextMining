You have no idea how much we need a place like this where I live (San Francisco). . . 1 Star for being open 24 hours a day, natch. . 1 Star for the location on Fairfax. . 1 Star for the Kibbutz room. . 1 Star for preserving the decor over the decades. . 1 Star for Potato Pancakes with sour cream and applesauce. . . Last time I was here, 12 clowns walked in while my friend and I were eating ourselves sober. I tried to take a discreet photograph of my friend with the clowns in the background and they flipped me off.
