Love it. The subdued lighting, nice decor, quality furniture, good service, great food and fireplace in the waiting area - a winner. I really like the flavorful and small-to-midsize portion sizes. A surprisingly nice selection of wines are stocked. I was extremely impressed with my waiter for pacing the meal's service and his knowledge of the menu and wine pairings. I had heard this place was good - and it really was.
