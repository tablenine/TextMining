Finally got the chance to eat at Tender Greens today.  My boyfriend and I split plates, so we could try a little of everything.  We ordered the Cobb salad, the tuna hot plate which came with small salad (we got baby spinach), and an order of tomato bread soup.  The cobb salad was nothing to write home about.  The chunks of blue cheese were HUGE...so it made it kind of gross.  Dressing was already mixed in and it was a little watery.  The tuna was a little over cooked, but the mashed potatoes and spinach salad were pretty good.  I definitely liked the piece of garlic bread that came with the food.  . . The only thing that was really impressive was the tomato soup.  It had little chunks of bread at the bottom and tasted really fresh.  All in all, it was decent.  I might visit again, but only for the lighter salads.
