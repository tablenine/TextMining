Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
My best bud took me, El Burrito Aficionado, to this spot a couple of months ago. The indoor dining room is really tiny, so naturally, there was a line that formed outside. It didn't help that people celebrated birthday parties here, hogging all the tables and taking their sweet time, singing, laughing, taking pictures (posing w/ the giant burrito or remnants of it), opening presents and so on, but I digress.. . Being a party of three, we waited about 30+ minutes until we got sat. While waiting, we were entertained by a couple of hood people fighting over parking. One of them started yelling at the parked car and started to spit on it. I found that very entertaining especially since the car couldn't defend itself. But I digress.. . This place is known for their HUMONGOUS burrito, which according to their menu, feeds about 4 average size civilians. Of course we ordered the HUMONGOUS Manuel Special de Machaca and the regular size Hollenback Burrito. The food was seasoned well and everything tasted great. I have no complaints about the quality, and I sure as hell don't have any complaints about the portion. Goodness, I couldn't breath after eating, and we still had quite a few leftovers.. . I only give 5 stars to places that I frequent, so I can't give this a 5 star yet. If I'm in the neck of the hood again, I'd definitely drop by and try the other stuff on their menu. Oh, I failed to mention that their wait staff are really nice ladies. Make sure to tip them fat.. . Salsa Rating: 4/5. . PRO: El giante burrito, friendly service, great price, good portion, other items on the menu look good for future trips.. . CON: El peque√±o comedor, long wait outside, in the ghetto.
