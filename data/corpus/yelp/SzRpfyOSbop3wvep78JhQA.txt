My friend would be shocked to see that I'm actually rating this place as a 4 instead of 5, or even 6 if there is an extra star. But I'm gonna settle with a 4 instead.. . This place is often the location of dining when after night of shopping with friends at the Lennox and Philips Square. It's normally quite crowded at night where we have to wait for a set to open up. At times, it was worth it.. . What I like about this place is the hipness of a young professional crowd (unlike the other end of the strip which is more for a different age group of crowd). The servers are rather attentive. The food is rather good/fair/decently well prepared. My favorites are: Asian chicken salad, the list of several sushi were all pretty decent, their mix "girly" drinks, the seafood (that lobster dish was good...), and the appetizers. Normally, my friends and I just like to order some appetizers rather than getting a meal.. . The over all experience had always been rather nice. Also, they have some rather good red wines. Good place to chill with friends, just not for one-on-one dates. It's too loud to have a decent conversation, but great for a girls night out!. . Oh, if it's not raining or too cold outside, sit out! The view is rather nice... =)
