Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
I love the light, delectable fare in Gingergrass.  The size of their plates are just right--not too large, but not too shi-shi tiny.   I've only had their tilapia and their "Gingergrass" tofu, but both dishes have been delish.  . . I also just wanted to point out to the folks who've commented about the authenticity and the lack-of-hole-in-the-wall-ishness of this restaurant that----. . Nowhere in Gingergrass' publicity does it say it's AUTHENTIC VIETNAMESE.  I believe their claim to fame is "FRESH VIETNAMESE CUISINE".  And the last time I checked, there is a significant difference between AUTHENTIC and FRESH..    . I'm an avid lover of the five-dollar, m.s.g.-filled, waitress'-finger-dipped-in-the-bowl kind of beef pho myself; however, I think I'd know which restaurant I'd expect to get that kind of food.  . . Perhaps before folks walk in and start dissing Gingergrass, they ought to make an exerted effort to rethink whether their expectations match what the restaurant truly specializes in.
