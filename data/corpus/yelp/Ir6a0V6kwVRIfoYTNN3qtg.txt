4 stars because their steak isn't the best.  I was however very pleased with their appetizers.  Their shrimp cocktail comes nicely presented in a bowl with dry ice coming out of it - fun, fresh and delicious.  I also liked their sauteed scallops, those were very tasty.  And you gotta love their bread basket.  But back to the steak...I ordered their bone in ribeye, the steak was tender but not juicy nor tasty, something was missing.  As for the sides, I ordered their creamed corn which was average and their asparagus which wasn't even cooked thoroughly.  I was a bit disappointed until my bf pointed out that Lance Bass was sitting right next to us...score!  jk.
