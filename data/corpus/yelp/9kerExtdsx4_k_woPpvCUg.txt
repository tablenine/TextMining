Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
We tried a bunch of different dumplings, 2 pork buns, green beans (secret menu item?), pork fried rice, and pork noodles and it was all delicious. The dumplings defiantly lived up to their hype, probably the best ones I've ever had. I was surprised for 4 of us it only came out to $15 dollars a person so it wasn't too bad, could have been a little cheaper though.. . P.S. The bakery across the parking lot is good for dessert and they are moderately priced :)
