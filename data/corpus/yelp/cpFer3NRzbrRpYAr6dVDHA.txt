First time I went to this place was for a Valentine's Day dinner surprise.  I am a fan of garlic so I was amazed at the selection.  If my date is takin' me to a garlic house it's best if we both join in the stench!  We definately went for it- for starters, the Bagda Calda and for dinner, 40 Cloves Of Garlic Chicken, damn, that was excellent cuisine not to mention service. They do have a garlic martini &amp; garlic ice cream but it seemed too "hard core".  This was a pleasant surprise (as a garlic lover) so I'd recommend  this place for a romantic dinner.  411: Even checking out the phone line is a kick... Vantastic!    Remember to reserve in advance!  I saw people waiting 1hr. 1/2 for a table for 2!
