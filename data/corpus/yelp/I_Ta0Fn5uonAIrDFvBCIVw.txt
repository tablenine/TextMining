Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
Jerry's gets a solid "eh" in my book. The menu is kind of overwhelming with the millions of choices, but every time I have eaten here, it's been nothing very special. All the food is sort of bland. . . It's nice to eat outside in the summer, though. And in the winter the fireplace is a nice touch.. . The service is pretty hit or miss. I went in for carry out one night, and the woman at the front desk was pretty rude for no reason. It was weird, but it was toward the end of the night, so maybe she was just over it. And when I went today, my waiter was very nice. Although, I had to ask for a glass of water three times before I actually got it. See? Eh.
