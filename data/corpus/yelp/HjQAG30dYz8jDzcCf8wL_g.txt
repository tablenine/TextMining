2.5 stars. This place serves up Tonkotsu Ramen which is the white, milky and pork based soup. It is average. The fried rice dish everyone is talking about was also average. . . I cannot believe nobody mentioned Shin-Sen-Gumi Ramen which is a much better version of the Tonkotsu Ramen. Is everyone taste deaf?. . Shin-Sen-Gumi's ramen is much more flavorful and the noodles are not as soft as this place. Also SSG has better fried rice and at night they have a entire Japanese Tapas dishes.. . The only think I liked at this place is the cut of pork they serve inside the ramen is the pork belly so it melts in your mouth. . Well at least this place is a better option than Mr. Ramen.
