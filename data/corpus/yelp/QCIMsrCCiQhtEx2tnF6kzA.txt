2 words - Garlic Fries! Your breathe will smell for hours but it's definitely worth it. GB has a great patio right on Peachtree Street and is an ideal spot for people-watching and having a beer or two. Their marzen barbecue burger is a fave of mine. They've got the usual TGIFriday-ish type fare. Nothing groundbreaking here in terms of the menu but the service is decent
