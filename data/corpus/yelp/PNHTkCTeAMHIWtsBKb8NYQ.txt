Um, yeah, to the person who complained that they don't have a grill in their kitchen--it's a VEGETARIAN outfit.  The eggs are steamed, not microwaved, and they do have a stove.. This place rocks. Both the chai and expresso milkshakes are too die for.  There are so many healthy options, but naughty sweets, too.  I love their coffee. If you can't decide on which expresso drink, their drip coffee is still great.  I love the store in the back and have bought presents for people there.
