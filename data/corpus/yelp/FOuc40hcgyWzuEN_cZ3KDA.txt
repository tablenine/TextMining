Tag teamed this spot with partner in domestic crimes/sister from another mister Alyssa J. When we got in, I had no idea there was a huge dining area in the back. just goes to show how much attention i pay to the reviews i read, eh. after a few minutes we walked back there and grabbed some seats. The music was awesome. sounded like they had my ipod. hhhmmm . I had a santa fe pepper jack + jalapeno + smoked turkey w/ onions and spicy peppers and then had a sundried tomato + mozzarella +smoked chicken&amp;turkey w/ onions and sweet peppers. The sausages were cooked to perfection and the bun they were in, nestled it in like a glove. all the condiments you can possibly need are easily accessible and the fries are OK. . We also tried a $5 cinnamon apple ice cream sandwich that was pretty good. I liked it. I'll be back too.
