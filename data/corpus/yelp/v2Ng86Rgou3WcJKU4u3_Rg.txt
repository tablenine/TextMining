I've unfortunately only been here once when a certain other sushi restaurant down the street was closed around 10 pm on a Friday  night, but it was EXCELLENT sushi, service and atmosphere. I went with a couple girlfriends, but it's definitely intimate enough for a good date. I was ravenous and ordered 4 rolls and split edamame, seawood salad and dessert with my friends. Everything was awesome. We were pleasantly surprised with the bill after all the food we ordered.  Also the wait staff was really nice, offered honest recommendations about menu items, and was prompt and attentive. I need to go back very soon! It's also open pretty late night. Plus the location is great - Old Town is just so darn cute!
