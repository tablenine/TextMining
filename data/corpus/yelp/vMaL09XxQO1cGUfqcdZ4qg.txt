Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pinks highly lives up to its hype of being one of the best Hot Dog places in Los Angeles.  I've only been here twice but each time it has been a new experience as I tried out things I couldn't even imagine would taste right together, but somehow they made it so.  However, expect to lose a few years of your life each time you go as the grease and oils gush out of each bite.
