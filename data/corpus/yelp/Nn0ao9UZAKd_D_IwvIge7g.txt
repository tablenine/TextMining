Hollywood!. . Want to spot a star before eating?. Put your name on the list, wait outside for an hour and watch the rapstars valet their cars before they come in to eat (I think i saw Common drop off his RollsRoyce).. Chicken is very tasty if you dip it in their gravy or hot sauce.. Waffles are very fluffy and loaded with taste.. Bring your East Coast friends &amp; family here to show them how we do here on the West Coast.. Hopefully, ya'll will see Snoop Dogg valet his car right in front of your eyes. Fo shizzle.
