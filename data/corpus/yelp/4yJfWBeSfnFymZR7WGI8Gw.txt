Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Good Gnocchi....and that's what really matters. Food...always good. Service....pleasant and attentive. ...only downer is the required wait and the mandatory bum across the street. Hey, it's not a Michelin star restaurant, but it's nice (and it's fun to poke at the wine "experts" next door)
