Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I fell in love with Din Tai Fung when I last visited Shanghai. When I was in LA and heard there was a location there, I nearly fell off my chair. The line was long, as usual and parking was atrocious, but it was oh so worth it! The juicy dumplings were amazing, crab meat and pork. We also got the spicy beef noodle soup and the wonton soup. Both delicious and perfect for hangovers. (yes i was) If you are in LA, you must make a stop here!
