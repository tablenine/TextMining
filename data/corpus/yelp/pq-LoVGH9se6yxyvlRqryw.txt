Came here to catch up with my friend and her boyfriend after not seeing them for more than a year.  We ever told that the table was not going to be ready for 45 minutes so we went to the Starbucks next door but apparently our receiver device could not go that far so when we went to check with the front we were told that we were paged and our table was given already but another table just opened up.  SWEET ... . . The Yard House does have a lot of beers on tap yes they do, they are a little pricier than your standard bar right?? Not really, they are reasonably priced given their selection, and location.  All of us were very happy with our different beer choices.  We split the mini-sliders, the original, and they were very nicely done.  The buns were fluffy and soft and meat was juicy and tender, the bernaise sauce was very well done, but my biggest complaint ... couldn't throw in couple of tomatoes, onions type veggies to accompany the sliders?
