Update - stopped in for pizza after the line for Piece was incredibly long one night during March Madness.  We were pleasantly surprised with the pizza we ordered - it was delicious!!!  We got the fig pizza, which had prosciutto, Gorgonzola, mozzarella, and figs.  Very different, but great flavors together.  We also got the pizza that had tomatoes, field greens, mozzarella, and balsamic drizzle which was equally interesting a delicious.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  An all around great experience.
