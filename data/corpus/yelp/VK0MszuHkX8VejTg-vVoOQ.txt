Restaurant: 90 Miles Cuban Caf√©
Category: Cuban
It took us almost a year to get back to the 90 Miles Cuban cafe. It was better than I remembered it. The staff was still as wonderful as ever, and the food seemed to get better. . We did the Croquettes, and the Cuban tamale's for an appetizer and the Cuban Sandwich for the entree. Everything was mouth watering. I can't recommend this place enough. If you haven't tried this place yet, get off of your ass and do it. . This is going to be the place that I get all of my take out food for Bears games this season. Football, and a Cuban Sandwich. . Heaven Indeed!!!!
