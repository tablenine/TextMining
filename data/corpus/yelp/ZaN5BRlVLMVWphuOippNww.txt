Excellent, friendly servers, and delicious food that will only put a teensy, tiny dent in your wallet. I chowed down, and my total was less than $15!!! And I STILL had food leftover!. . I went there for breakfast this morning, I ordered the apple chicken sausage and a goat cheese, spinach and tomato omelette (with THREE iced cofffees)!. . It's sort of a greasy spoon diner, minus the greasiness.. . I've lived one block from this place for three years, and this was my first time I showed my face there. But this won't be the last they see of me! Â ;)
