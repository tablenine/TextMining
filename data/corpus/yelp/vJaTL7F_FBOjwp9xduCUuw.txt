Cooper's is a great place to start the night out. The $4 mojitos always hit the spot, especially before heading out to clubs in the meatpacking where drinks are quadruple the price. It has a nice atmosphere for hanging out with friends, and the outdoor patio is definitely nice during warm weather. The food is pretty good, just don't expect anything gourmet. I've also always had nice and attentive waitstaff.
