Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
What? I haven't reviewed this place yet? Doh!. . The food - Frufru burger!!! haha Yes, but it does taste pretty good and it is unique - well at least the Umami one is. It's savoy yet...a tad sweet - MSG! I'd definitely recommend trying this place at least once. The meat is also very melt in your mouth tender. I wouldn't recommend ordering the fries since they're basically steak fries (but you only get a few sticks). . . The price - It's pretty expensive for a small burger - $9.50 or more. But hey, worth a try ...again the Umami! Don't get persuaded by the other burgers like my fiance did! They taste like a normal burger. Oh, and skip the fries. =). . The ambiance- It's a very small place, so don't bring your massive posse over unless you're willing to do take out (not even sure if they do that) or wait a while for a room in the back. It's very ideal for a date place or small hang out. Not much to look at though, and not much outside to look at either.. . The service - Good. They serve you in a timely manner and your drinks get refilled. =). . Go for the umami burger and skip the rest =) I'll only go back on a special occasion or if my blood is feeling particularly rich. =p
