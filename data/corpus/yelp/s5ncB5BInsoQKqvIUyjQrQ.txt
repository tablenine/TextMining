Restaurant: French American Brasserie
Category: French
I've been to FAB several times and enjoyed it every time.  (I too don't care about the flag football politics, and am used to this neighborhood being suspicious of shady characters such as Yelpers running crazy in the streets.). . I have a bad habit of getting the duck confit every time, but it's Just So Darned Good. This is a nice place for an expense account lunch or a romantic dinner.  If you're not a foody, the descriptions may not make the food appeal all that much when you read it, but it's always been delish to me when I tasted it.. . If you want food that is overly processed, super cheap, and has been sitting under heat lamps for hours.... this is not your place.  French food is much better fresh out of the kitchen, doesn't reheat well, and can cost a tad more.  (These things are not unrelated.). . The wine list is fine.  You may luck out and get a server who can steer you the right way. Or you might get one that prefers a cold beer and McNuggets.  (The bane of all French restaurants in America is being able to find enough servers who like French food.). . The desserts are good, but not great.  They're well done, but missing some essential ingredient to make them very memorable (probably extra sugar).  It could just be that I'm always full by then.   They don't serve gobs and gobs of food, but it's not possible to go away hungry.  (Unless you go in all close-minded and peevish like a little kid who is about to gain a stepparent.). . I think I spend about $10-$20 for lunch, and $50ish for dinner, but I'll get wine with dinner here.  Not so much for lunch.  The atmosphere is lovely, and the hike all the way up the stairs to the powder room is worth it.
