Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Feeling retro?  Inside Kitsch'n on Roscoe, everything from old advertisements to cheesy toys bring the funkadelic '60s and '70s back to life.  Customers enjoy classic hits while seated at orange, formica kitchen tables on a linoleum floor.  And the bright yellow and lime-green walls add to the cheery atmosphere.. . However, you won't be finding the salad bars and Hamburger Helper that were made popular during that era here.  Instead, you'll find traditional favorites with a modern touch.  The breakfast menu offers items like a low-carb egg scramble or French toast made out of huge bread slices and served with sauted pineapple, banana, and peach compote.  In a box or with a fox, I like the green eggs and ham--scrambled eggs with spinach pesto, scallions, and smoked ham.  There's even a Twinkie tiramisu and a Pop-Tart sundae if I find myself with a morning sweet tooth.  Brunch cocktails include the Chipotle Bloody Mary and a Tequila Sunrise.  If you're looking for breakfast on the weekend though, be prepared for a wait; the "Hangover Brunch" menu attracts a significant crowd.. . Dinnertime isn't quite as busy as brunch, but the menu is just as tasty, including Not Your Mom's Meatloaf (lean ground beef, oatmeal, Portobello mushrooms, and roasted peppers), fried chicken and waffles, and puff pastry pot pies (chicken and fennel, ginger beef, or mushroom duxelle).  Need something to wash all that down?  If you're a fan of Pabst Blue Ribbon, have it for only a buck!  Or try something funky, like the Purple Haze Ketel One Citron Lemonade or the Huggie Bear Cocktail.. . You may find that living in the past--or at least eating in it--isn't such a bad thing after all.
