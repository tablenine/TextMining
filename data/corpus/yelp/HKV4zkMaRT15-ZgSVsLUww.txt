Such a contrast to that piece of shit BLT. This place is happening without all the attitude and bullshit. Went straight here after a horrible experience at BLT. Got here and were greeted with a smile and a wonderful place on the super great patio! Drinks came out pretty quickly and we were all feeling great in no time! Let me tell you this place is very sexy.. the wait staff.. the space and the patio.. very comforting and exciting unlike BLT (Be Like Tom).. . Everything is family style.. though what they don't tell you is that the portion size is the same as a normal portion any where else. So you have to order a ton just to get a decent meal together. Fortunately our LA friends are food centric and we all ordered 3 items each which made for a very pleasant experience. . . Now I have to say there are a ton of dishes here.. all were good but nothing great. I think because there are so many none can be great due to sheer quantity of menu items. It was a real treat being able to try so many items like the old small plates used to do. No remember this is Craft so its fairly pricey.. 400+ bucks for 4 people with 6 drinks. So not to bad but 20 bucks for a salad, seriously!. . Craft also exhumes class and sophistication. The wait staff were so friendly and accommodating.. we were made to feel so welcome that many places should learn from Crafts service. In the end they sent each of us a muffin to take home with us as well as chocolates.. I wish I had tried the chocolates but unfortunately it was so hot on the way back to Scottsdale they melted into one huge glob. . . Class act all the way! I have to thank our friends for agreeing to ditch BLT for this wonderful experience!
