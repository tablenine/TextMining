Restaurant: Five Seasons Brewing
Category: Pubs
One of my favorites when we visit Atlanta. I'm not a real fan of beer, but the server always comes up with something I'll enjoy. (My general rule is: if you're in a hamburger joint, try the hamburger; if you're at a seafood place, try the seafood; and if you go to a brewery, try the beer! Duh.). . We've been here on several occasions, but our most recent visit wasn't all that special. My wife and I enjoyed several entrees and sides that used to be on their menu, and we missed them since the change. (I don't know when the change happened, but they changed their menu. Hey, it's what restaurants do sometimes, right?). . Anyway, the food is organic without being in-your-face hippie about it, and it's always good. Sometimes it's even great. I've enjoyed all the beers I've tried there, and that's saying a lot for a beer noob.. . The service is always good, and they have plenty of varied seating, from the bar to regular tables and booths to the covered patio if the weather's right.
