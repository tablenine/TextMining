Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This place is good!! I love their ramen and I love how they have different levels of spiciness.... . Back in college (approximately 3 or 4 years ago), I finished the Special 2 in 30 mins! It was glorious, and then I immediately rushed to the restroom. Unfortunately, I can never accomplish that feat again because I'm older and might die so I usually get soy or miso ramen number 1, which is still pretty spicy and GOOD!. . I really like this place. I think its a great place to just go whenever you're craving ramen. =) And if you go with your friends, I'm sure it's also fun to try to convince someone to attempt to eat the spiciest ramen. . . Plus, I really liked this one waitress who served us. She knew minimal english and whenever she spoke it, she said a lot of broken sentences that strangely sounded really cute.
