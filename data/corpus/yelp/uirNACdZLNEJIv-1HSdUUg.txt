Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I love breakfast, and I specifically love sweet stuff for breakfast. It's always Â an awesome excuse to have chocolate for breakfast, so when I had the option to have french toast stuffed with chocolate pastry creme I knew I was going to have a wonderful morning. After the disaster at Cafe Matou on Friday with my parents at least Chicago restaurants vindicated themselves this weekend. Even my mom, who isn't a brunch person, enjoyed her breakfast burrito!
