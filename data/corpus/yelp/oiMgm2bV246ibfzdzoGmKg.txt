Luckily even though we showed up right at 7PM on a Saturday night, we beat most of the crowd and only had to wait in line for like 10 minutes, and the food came out pretty fast too...another 5-10 minutes...not bad as I was expecting to wait a really long time from what I read previously.  But after we sat down to eat, everyone showed up and there was definitely a long wait for those people.. . I tried the Oinkster Pastrami Combo with fries &amp; drink ($12) and my bf had the Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich.  I give the Pastrami 5 stars for being one of the best i've had. It was tender, nice and juicy with the red cabbage and yummy cheese.  I like Pastrami that is tender and drenched in juices so this was pretty good.  However, the BBQ Pulled Pork was not BBQ tasting at all....in fact it was bland. We were wondering why there was no BBQ sauce in the sandwich when it stated it had BBQ sauce..and I now that I came home to Yelp, I realized that they never gave us a side of BBQ sauce as some others mentioned here...so it was pretty much bland and did not have enough of any flavor whatsoever and I would tell anyone not to order it. EVER...just eat PASTRAMI.  I enjoyed the Garlic Aioli sauce with the THICK version of In N out style fresh fries very much!... (they also serve animal style In N out fries too!)  They also give you free Homemade Ketchup and Chipotle Ketchup...I didn't like the Chipotle Ketchup much...I can tell that this place is a once in awhile thing as eating too much Pastrami is not good for your health...But I will be back next time I crave Pastrami and Aioli fries. =)
