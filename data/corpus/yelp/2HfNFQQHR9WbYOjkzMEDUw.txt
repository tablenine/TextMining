Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
Hey, I'm a fan!  . . Bagna Calda. BBQ Chicken Pizza. Lasanga. Garlic fries (my fave!). Steamed Mussels. . This place was a great first try at this famous restaurant.  I see the mixed reviews, but again, you will never know until you try and if you like garlic, you won't be disappointed. The garlic/onion rolls were a treat and a great match with the Bagna Calda (roasted garlic in olive oil and butter). You can just spread it as the garlic is so soft and sweet.. . Service was normal and the waiters were great in refilling bread and iced water in the jugs.  We were all amazed at the fries topped with julien garlic and green onion and cheese.  All of it lightly sprinkled on the fries, amazing.. . The downside is finding parking -- seems like it is valet only. Try for the street.
