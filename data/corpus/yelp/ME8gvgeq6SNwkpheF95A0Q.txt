The pork plate:. . Pork and skin is delicious. Nicely seasoned, tender and juicy--with extremely crunchy skin. I get a little nervous chewing on the crunchy fearing it will break one of my fillings.. . Beans are lovely and so, so salty.. . The greens were perfectly cooked and also, sadly, so darn salty.. . Whats up with the excessive salt, Porchetta? Take it easy.
