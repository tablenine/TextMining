Took notes on other reviews and tried the suprema mojito 15.00 it was really good, but not enough alcohol for me!  We went here for dinner on a Tuesday with another couple. Its a fusion of peruvian,brazilian, and cuban; we had the cerviche for a starter it was really good but kind of small to share for 4 people.  All of us Loved our main dishes- very well done food.  All of us had 1-2 drinks the bill came to 240.00....The service was fast so no complaints there.  They also had vallet parking for 5.00 which was great!
