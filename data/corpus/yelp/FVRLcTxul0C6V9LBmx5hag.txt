Restaurant: La Crêperie
Category: French
If you are a crepe lover like I am, this is the best place to go!  My mom and I have a tradition of going to La Creperie when she comes to visit.  It's a fun place for conversation over a quality glass of wine, and they have a very nice selection.  The decor and back patio are very reminiscent of a Parisian cafe.  Last but not least, the Crepes are out of this world!  There are different fillings for every taste, and you must of course top it all off with the traditional banana and nutella for desert!  Oh la la!
