A friend brought me here for breakfast and it was decent. Valet is an absolute must. Portions were a bit small although I may be biased after eating at Hash House in San Diego. I will, however, add one star for running into Jessica Alba and Cash Warren as they were coming out of their Prius at the valet stop!
