Read about this place in the AJC a few weeks ago, and when I had a hankerin' for fried fish yesterday it immediately came to mind. . . It is exactly what you have read. Be prepared to wait in line to order and then grab a table. Then be patient and wait for your food. . . The food was good. I got the shrimp and tilapia meal with corn on the cob and hushpuppies. . . Shrimp- good sized and flavorful . Tilapia- huge portion. Not as crispy as I like my fish . Corn- tasty though I could have had a bigger piece . Hushpuppies- YUM! I would seriously get a basket of these the next time. . Sugar cane drink- waste of money, but I was curious. Basically tastes like sugar water. . . I saw po-'boys and crawfish buckets going past me. They are definitely next up on my list of things to try. . . I wouldn't imagine going to this place on a weekday, but weekends are perfect when you aren't in rush.
