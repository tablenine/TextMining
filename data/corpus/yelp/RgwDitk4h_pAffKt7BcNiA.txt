We've been to this place a few times with our ten year old.  It's got a lot of fun stuff to look at - specially if you grew up in the 70s.  The service is lame.  The servers are typically stoned hipsters who are bratty, entitled assholes who don't give a shit about just doing their job because they are "above it" but not so far above it that they become a hobo and start eating from the dumpster.  The food tastes pretty good after you've had two bottles of wine by yourself and you're too drunk to forget that a single sandwich from this place probably packs about a 4000 calorie punch in your face.  I get that they're trying to be different with some of their spicing notions, but they get it really wrong a lot of the time.  Luckily,you can sort of tell in the description of the food where they're getting it wrong and avoid those things.  It's ok for hangover or drunken eating - it's not ok for sober eating.  I like my food to be good whether I'm wasted or not.
