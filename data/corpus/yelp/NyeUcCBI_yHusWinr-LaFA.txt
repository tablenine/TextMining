Restaurant: Yard House

This Yard House is the same as all the others. And since there's about 150 reviews for it already, I needn't get into explaining why you may or may not enjoy it there. . Last weekend, I had to find an impromptu location for a 12 person dinner/drinks rendezvous. No, I wasn't the host of this party, and when I finally got over the awful etiquette, I decided Yard House would work. Any place with 100+ beers will be a hit with most groups. I have to give them credit for taking a group of 12 with no notice on a Saturday night. We waited only 30 minutes for our tables to be set up. I can't think of another place in the area that would've been able to accommodate us that way. . Since I left Long Beach, I can easily say that living near a Yard House is something I miss. Love the happy hour and their 1/2 price sashimi.. I really like that they have such a huge menu... and it isn't covered in advertising (hello Jerry's deli and Cheesecake Factory.) "Maybe I'll have the nachos.... and I could use a new realtor, yes!"
