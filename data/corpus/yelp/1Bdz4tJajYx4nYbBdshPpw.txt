The ribs are smokey and fall-off-the-bone tender, but this is what you would expect from a place like this. What was really exceptional was the sides. Accompanying my half slab of baby back ribs was their coleslaw and cornbread. The coleslaw was light and refreshing and more like a side salad than the mayonnaise heavy version. The cornbread had bits of jalepeno throughout but it wasn't overly spicy and it had a bit of sweetness to it as well. I also stole some sweet potato fries from my friend's plate and those were crispy and perfectly seasoned. I could come here and just have sides and leave full and happy.
