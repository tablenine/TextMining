Loca Luna: the hottest, literally sweat dripping from your neighbor into your drink, salsa club in Atlanta.. . Oh, and it apparently has good food too.. . I've only been to Loca Luna to experience the drinks (mucho Marguerites, Mojitos, Caipirinhas, and sangria)and the music. It's an 18 to party (5 dollar cover), 21 to drink (free) on Friday and Saturday nights. I actually came here on my 21st because most of my friends were younger then. . . If you don't know how to salsa, just let one of the handsome Mexican men teach you as they whisk you away from your friends in the crowd. Just go with the flow of the crowd, don't worry about sweat, drink tequila, and have a great time.. . On Sunday's you can order all you can drink Sangria for 10 dollars. Check the website for specials like 1 dollar tacos on Tuesdays in May. Also, sign up to be an Amigo and receive a 10 dollar certificate. Everything is a bit pricey otherwise, but the music and dancing is free!
