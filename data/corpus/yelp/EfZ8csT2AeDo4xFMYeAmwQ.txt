If you're looking to save money.  The best time to go is during there lunch specials.  Reasonable prices for an insanely good food.  The french style beef is a must.  It's not on the lunch special but worth ordering it a la carte.  Don't forget the clam in basil sauce.  I dislike seafood but that sauce is damn good.
