Went here for brunch, not ata ll impressed with the service. Â we waited 15 minutes to get seated, even though there were plenty of empty seats, When we were finally served, the food was lukewarm. The meal itself (I had an omelette) was very bland, the eggs didn't seem seasoned at all. I was not a huge fan of its predecessor, Square Kitchen, but at least for brunch, I would welcome it back in a heartbeat.
