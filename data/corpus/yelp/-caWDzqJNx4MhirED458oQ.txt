After seeing the raves about this place on the food channel, I couldn't wait to try it out. It took me a bit to find, and you could imagine the look on my face when I saw that big PHILLEPE'S sign just ahead. As I entered, I noticed a large crowd of people, in business attire, eagerly waiting for their order. I thought, "wow, I guess the food channel was right. the menu seems awesome." . We finally get to the front of the line, it's my first time and I'm trying to get used to the style of ordering. . The prices seem great and fair. When we get our order, I'm put off by the lack of places to sit, but luckily scored a booth in the back. . I take a first bite of my french dip with au jus and BLEH! . I'm a tad grossed out by the soggy bun, the flavor of what DOG FOOD might taste like, and assume my only hope is the mustard that could put this disagreement between the food and my taste buds to a grinding halt.. No go. The mustard was worse, as the heat eminated from my flaring nostriles, I thought I was gonna pass out. The tiny (joke) of a cup of soda wasn't enough to extinguish my inflammed palatte, and HELL if I was gonna stand in line for a refill. . I'll never do this again. I don't see how so many people are attracted to this place.. Perhaps Phillepe should box up this place, like their nasty sandwiches, and let its old history lie in the PAST. . Maybe this meat experience is why I turned vegetarian in the first place. ;[
