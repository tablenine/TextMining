The pastrami here is top notch.  My friend and I shared two sandwiches here and were blown away by both.. . First off, I had the #88 which was corned beef, sauerkraut, and swiss cheese grilled on rye.  I've had some terrible corned beef in my past so I was a little bit wary.  Once I took the first bite into that piece of deliciousness I realized that I wasted about ten minutes of my life wondering if I made a wrong choice.  I didn't.  The waitress recommended this sandwich to us and she definitely did not do us wrong.  The interplay of its components came together in a savory composition that left me just about floored.  This baby is good.. . Next up: the #19.  This heralded as their best selling sandwich and it is for good reason.  Pastrami, coleslaw, swiss cheese, and russian dressing on rye bread.  I'm getting flush thinking about the thing.  I've never had such exquisite pastrami...ever.  Every part of the sandwich was just damn good.  You could put some mustard on it but it is not needed whatsoever.  If it's your first time going there, I suggest you get the #19 and let that leave you with wobbly limbs.. . We also ordered fries with our sandwiches but really, they're just there.  Pastrami here takes center stage and everything else is just plain extraneous.  Be prepared to spend a bit of dough on a sandwich though.  About $12 or $13 bucks a pop.  And it only comes with two pickles.  Two very delicious pickles.  I normally don't like pickles, but this changed my life-long opinion on them.
