Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
First, let me just say this: mac and cheese on a grilled cheese sandwich?  BRILLIANT!. . Very impressive overall for a food truck.  I'm a big fan of grilled cheese, and the Grilled Cheese truck did not disappoint.  I ordered 2 sandwiches: a standard with cheddar and the mac and cheese with pork and onions.  The cheddar one was pretty good although I felt there should've been more cheese.  The highlight was the mac and cheese sandwich, which was every bit as delicious as I imagined it.  The pork was a nice touch as well and complemented the flavor.  I also got a side of tater tots, which were good but not quite as crispy as I normally like.. . Overall this place is not quite perfect, but pretty close.  With a little more cheese on their regular sandwiches, some slightly better tots, and maybe the ability to add-on ham, this would be a 5 star place.
