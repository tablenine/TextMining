We came here for the $44 dineLA restaurant week dinner last Thursday. I came with high expectations for Chef Colicchio to WOW me. Unfortunately, it wasn't a WOW factor. Maybe we're just not "New American" cuisine kinda people. . . The cool thing was the way they set up their prix fixe menu. The two starters, three side dishes &amp; four desserts were served for the table. So all we had to choose was our entree. That made it quite easy. . . We ended up ordering three different entrees, cuz we just wanted to try a few things. We had the diver sea scallops, braised short ribs &amp; striped bass. Here's a list:. . endive &amp; apple salad-good. smoked salmon rillette-reminded us of a tuna salad w/salmon, but it was really good. market veggies, assorted mushrooms &amp; potato gratin-meh. scallops-sandy &amp; grainy . short ribs-a little dry. striped bass-no flavor, salt please?!. ice cream &amp; sorbet-okay. roasted pear-way too sweet. chocolate torte &amp; cheesecake-bagged it to-go and gave it to the sitter (the next day, she told me it was really good). . I don't think the hubby and I will return. There are too many other restaurants in LA to try...
