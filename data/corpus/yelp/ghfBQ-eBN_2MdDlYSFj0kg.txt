Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I brought my friend from Chicago here, who had never been to K'town LA. We both agree that Chicago, surprisingly, has some very good Korean food. Of course, I already knew that LA Korean food can't be beat, and Soowon Galbi did not disappoint.. . The meats were all so tender, and I'm not sure what they put in the marinade, but it was probably CRACK! It was so good!  The panchan was all very good, but pretty typical. [Side note: Ondal 2's panchan variety and quality is still the best!] But I wasn't here for panchan. I was here for BBQ with wood, but I didn't want to walk out totally smelling like smoke and having a smoky film on my eyeballs like I did when I finished eating at Soot Bull Jeep.. . The ambiance is great. It all looks very shiny and new. And there's good lighting, which is good since the servers are working with hot chunks of wood. I also like the flat screen tv's, which were very good since it was Bowl season when I went.. . Speaking of the servers... this place appealed to the feminist foodie in me. All these Korean aunties were clearly in charge, and there were all these very very cute Korean men who were servers. My friend commented on how it was a restaurant run by Korean cougars with attractive young men at their beckon call.  Hey... A little eye candy never hurts!  Oh yea... and the service was great. Very attentive, which is always rare at Asian restaurants.. . So to sum up... food was amazing! Servers were very cute!  But I'm sure the overhead on running this place isn't cheap.  So, save up a lil money and hit this place up.
