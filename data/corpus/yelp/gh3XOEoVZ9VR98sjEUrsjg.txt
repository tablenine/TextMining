This was a great establishment, very Hollywood "ish" but LOVE IT!. Be prepared to spend some money to do this place right!!. The ambience is to die for, very poppin place, they have a DJ playing while you eat, and just a great vibe.  . We went on a Friday night, so that is probably why it was so busy.. . ALL the sushi was very fresh and amazing, we did not have one bad dish... and we enjoyed two bottles of cloudy sake which was sooo good too!. . This is not a place for children I'd say, but seems to be a great place for a date or business gatherings,  just be prepared to drop some serious cash!
