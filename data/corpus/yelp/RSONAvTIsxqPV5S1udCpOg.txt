Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
I love this place.  Always come by here when I'm in LA.  They have the best apple turnovers I have ever eaten.  They have a very good bakery and deli but the food from the kitchen can be only described as mediocre.  Still five stars because the bakery and deli rocks, theres nothing comparable to Canter's in Hawaii.
