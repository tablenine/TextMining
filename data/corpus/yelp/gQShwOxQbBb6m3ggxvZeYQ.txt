The food is solid here but lacks the creativity I would expect at a restaurant with these kind of prices.  The apetitizers ranged from $6 to ~$12, the entrees from $20 to $30, but the menu is pretty standard, with no really no original items on the menu.  . . The food is heavily focused on seafood with a tendency to sweet flavors (sauces/accompaniments that are fruits, figs, etc.).  For example, the tuna tartare I had for an apetitizer was standard.  The scallops I had were better than average (not rubbery and not too salty), but similar to other seafood places I've been to.  Beware of "medium rare" lamb that is very red - it was their special for the night, so while it was tasty it seemed like it was breaded with shake 'n' bake.   . . Service is a bit slow.  The decor is modern and clean, with outdoor patio seating as well.  Hooray for heating lamps!. . All in all, a good restaurant that will satisfy - but not one that I give raving reviews.
