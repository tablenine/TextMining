When I first came here I was such a silly little rabbit.. . I was into the California roll movement but stayed away from the raw stuff.. Originally this place had a bad review in my mind because the cooked food sucked.. . Since that first introduction I have been properly educated. Sakura isn't that bad at all. Even with the crowds it still has this strange little intimate vibe with its gold luck cats and humble television screen that I actually adore. I hope they never give into to the flat screen - I really do. Little things like that give it a nice charm.. . The only thing I actually did not like was the fish tank. There is just something wrong about waiting to eat fish while watching fish.
