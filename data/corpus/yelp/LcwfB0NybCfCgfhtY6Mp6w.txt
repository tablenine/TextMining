Really high quality sandwiches and desserts.. . I get a little frustrated because I tend to want both a sandwich and a piece of cake, but that would up costing well over $10 which is unreasonable for lunch, plus with their proportions it is just too much food.  As a result, when I go, I usually end up getting only cake, because I am bad like that.  Thus, I usually don't go, because I am good like that.. . In conclusion, I am perplexed by this place and don't know what to do about it. But it's my fault, not theirs (I guess, unless they could give me half a sandwich and half a piece of cake, which would be considerate).
