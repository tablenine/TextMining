Bonjour! je me pelle Destry. I used to study my I mean etudier mon francais here at the pick me up, mais je parle franglais now. I mean.....yeah as you can see it really didn't pay off that much. . . I would always get a zombie or 2 and after 2 of these drinks you can kind of kiss studying goodbye and say hello to chain smoking and rocking back and forth in your chair and looking in general like a psycho.. . The grilled cheese was good and everything on the menu was always well prepared and the atmosphere wasn't to douchbaggy hipsterish, although some of the drunk people were kind of annoying.. . I had some great conversations with my partners du francais dans this restaurant. And i pulled down une b- average. So as you can see when i go to Europe now i have no trouble parle ing avec babies. . . The end. Â I mean ummm fin.
