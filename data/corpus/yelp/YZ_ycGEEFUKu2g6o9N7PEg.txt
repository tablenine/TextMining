Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Eclectic decor (and servers) coupled with great coffee and good food. Usually in places like this the service is completely lacking, but I had a really great experience. Their Mediterranean plate was delicious as was their tempeh. Great spot for vegetarians and you can't beat the neighborhood.
