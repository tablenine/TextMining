Great new restaurant.  I went the first time for a wine tasting.   Second time for a friend's birthday.  The bacon flatbread is awesome.  Wonder where they get the bacon.  So flavorful !!  It's not huge, but quality over quantity, next time I'll order 2 because it's so good.  There website is pretty cool too, check it out
