Hawai'ian fusion?  Yes please!  I have been several times and always have a great time.  The service is fantastic, food is well thought-out without being over the top.  This is the only place I've had macadamia nut-encrusted Mahi Mahi outside of Hawai'i and enjoyed it.  I also love their fresh-caught fish specials.  Their house-made desserts are redunkulous and the management is great as well.  I always look forward to a trip to Roy's!
