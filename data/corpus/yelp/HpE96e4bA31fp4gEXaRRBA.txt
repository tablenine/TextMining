I had heard that Kogi makes Korean tacos worth waiting in lines for 2 hours, however I hadn't taken the time to find out where the truck is at, nor did I want to wait two hours. Luckily, as I was getting out of the MOCA today, I saw the Kogi truck and decided today was my night to take advantage! I went home (nearby) and waited for the line to die down. I came back around 9:30 and the wait was only 30 minutes. . . The Korean Tacos were great and even better than I had expected. To me it wouldn't have been worth a two hour wait, but oh, what a savory taste! These were very good.
