Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
My coworkers introduced me to this place for lunch. They swore by it like it was the best thing ever. Let me tell you now, I hated noodles, I hated most asian cuisines and most importantly I hated all things soup based. . . This place changed my perception of what I thought I knew about myself. It is so good I eat it slow so I don't rush the experience. It is so good I don't even care about mr. cockroach and his issues (sorry oscar f). . . I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Just don't get there on a weekend around 7pm because you'll end up waiting like 85 hours for a table for 4... and don't call this place top ramen or you'll get beat up by your friends (like I did).
