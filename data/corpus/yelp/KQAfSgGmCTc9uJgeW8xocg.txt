Restaurant: Belly Shack
Category: Latin American
Being a huge fan of Urban Belly, I had a feeling I'd like Belly Shack.  I was right.. . My friend and I stopped in for lunch last week on Tuesday. It's counter service, so we placed our order and paid up.  Oh, and I waved at an old classmate working in their open kitchen. . . We shared a few dishes: . Asian meatball sandwich, a most delicious plantain sandwich, and the brussels sprouts.   My old classmate sent us an order of the hot and sour soup for us to enjoy, too.. . My favorite thing was the brussels sprouts with chorizo.   If you haven't had them since you were a kid or just think you hate them, do yourself a favor and taste these.  They are delicious, fatty, salty, so yummy you forget you're eating veggies.. . We didn't get ice cream.  I think we forgot about it, honestly.   I can't wait to come back and try more dishes...and next time I'm coming in for dinner so I can enjoy my meal with wine (they are byob).
