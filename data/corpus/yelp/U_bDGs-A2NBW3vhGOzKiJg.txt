This is hands down my absolute favorite restaurant in Los Angeles.  The prix-fixe is priced very reasonably and every course is delicious.  The warm summer salad and the duck entre are 2 of my favorites.  The menu changes weekly and they serve everything from Octopus to Salmon to deviled quail eggs.  The service is great, the decor is tasteful and the wine selection rocks.  I would come hear every night if I lived closer.
