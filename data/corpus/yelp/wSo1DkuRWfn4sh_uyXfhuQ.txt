Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Ramen is one of my favorite foods and decided to give this place a try after watching the host of "Man vs Food" trek his way into here.... . Unfortunately, the hype is what makes most of us come try this place.. . The ramen is okay, but it's nothing to rave about.  I think the salty MSG taste and spiciness from the soup is what attracts a lot of non-Japanese people, but I don't know of too many traditional Ramenists who enjoy this place. . The ramen comes in a big bowl, so if quantity is what you want you'll get it here.  You can choose from 3 soup broths: shoyu, miso, or shio (salt).. I've tried shoyu and shio before and both are salty and tasty when hungry and/or hungover.. . The noodles have a nice firm texture to them.  The toppings in the ramen are few, but the kikurage are a nice surprise (type of Japanese mushroom).. . All in all this place is good...I've been 2x before, and I'll probably take visiting friends here and have them try out the spicy stuff....but it's nothing to rave about.. . Just my opinion though, feel free to try for yourself.
