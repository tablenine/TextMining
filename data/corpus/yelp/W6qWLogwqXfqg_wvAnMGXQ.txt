On my visit to Chicago....our concierge recommended this place and Boy am I glad he did!!!!. . Devon is amazing.  Perfect for dinner or a late night appetizer/drink session. I went for dinner and I must say I was extremely impressed.  The seafood was deliciously fresh.  The crab cake appetizer is awesome!!!!!  Perfect.  I ordered the chilean seabass.....extremely fresh and tasty.  . . This place is truly worth a visit or three!!!!
