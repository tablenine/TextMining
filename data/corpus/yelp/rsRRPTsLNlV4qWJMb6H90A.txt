Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: Bars
It was my oldest daughters 18th birthday and she asked Dad to see his Check Please database, she knows he just loves the show. She picks Uncommon Ground. So we have a party of 15 heading north to the Wrigleyville area and not for a Cubbies game but for a birthday lunch for my little girl. The place is really neat and cool inside. I just loved the exposed brick walls and hard wood floors. The place is quite large for a Chicago restaurant. It was pretty crowded on the day we went. It was very clean. The decor was really pretty cool also. I thought the food was really very good. I had the goat cheese pizza, which my birthday girl daughter also had. We both just loved it and would recommend it to anyone. The staff was very friendly. It was reasonably priced, not cheap but not really expensive either. I know if we are in the area again and have a taste for some goat cheese pizza we will be heading to Uncommon Ground.
