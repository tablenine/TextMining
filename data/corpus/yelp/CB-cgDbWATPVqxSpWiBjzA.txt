Super crowded during the prime lunch hours.  . . A nice place to grab some cheap eats and just hang out for a while.  . . The portions are kind of small so if you anything but starving I suggest you get two sandwiches.  I really love their roast beef.. . To bad it's out of my way to eat here regularly with today's gas prices.
