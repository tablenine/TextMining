Honestly, this place is really nice.  The meal was bursting with flavor at a price that is less than I'd pay elsewhere for the same thing.  I felt like I got a lot of food for my money.. . Unfortunately, the wait sucks, but this isn't really the fault of the restaurant, so I don't feel like I can take off stars.
