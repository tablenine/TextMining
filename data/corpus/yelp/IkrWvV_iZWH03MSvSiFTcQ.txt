Restaurant: Fontaine&#39;s Oyster House
Category: Seafood
Great service, and $2 Red Stripes (on a Saturday night!) make Fontaine's a winner in my book.. . I'm not sure I like the setup of the place - the bar is small, and the back is strangely arranged in a "u shape." Â It's a cool feel out back - but seems more like a restaurant than a bar, even late at night.
