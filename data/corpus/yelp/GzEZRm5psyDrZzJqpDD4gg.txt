Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
This is definitely not Mexican food, and any place that charges for chips automatically loses a star (tip - give me salty things for free and I'll probably buy more drinks!).  . . But the not-really-carnitas carnitas, as much as it pains the purist in me to say, was delicious.  Especially with big scoops of the cowboy beans and free salsa piled into the tortilla.. . This won't be my Mexican go-to spot, but for a lighter dinner close to home and a couple drinks out on the patio, it will do quite nicely.
