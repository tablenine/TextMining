well we went to check out UK Village today as that's were we thing we want to live when we finally move out here, and we stumbled on this great little place, the Natural Bakery sign had my interest from across the street. . so we went over just thinking ok we will bet some bread and butter ? maybe some cookies? who knows ......then we cross the street and see that they are serving Breakfast / brunch hey lets get some real food not just a snack. . The BF had french toast with fresh strawberries on it and 100% pure maple syrup very delish,and I got the house special Polenta with fresh grated Parmesan, and garlic sausage, with 2 eggs your way, and some fresh grain bread with nice big sun flower seeds. . the coffee was really good too don't know if it was 2.50 a cup good tho. . over all a nice meal in the sun I enjoyed my self
