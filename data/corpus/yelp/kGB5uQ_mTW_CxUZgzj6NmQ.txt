....waiting.... hold on, still waiting .... . Got an extra hour to kill?!? Then look for the Kogi truck via Twitter and let the waiting game begin!. . I'm so lucky to have a crazy friend who is open to eat anything and darn patient (and popular!!). We agreed on Kogi which was suppose to arrive at 9:15PM in an urban location. A group of 20+ people were already in line with a good attitude and a healthy appetite. The sand was slowly draining in the hourglass and no sign of the truck. Finally, it appears but needed an extra ten minutes to set up. Â . . We got up to the counter and ordered a spicy pork burrito and a kalbi short rib burrito ($5/each). The anticipation nearly killed me. It took about five minutes to prepare and we walked away with the goodies in hand and started chomping it down in the car. The spicy pork was so disappointing because the flavor wasn't as strong and it had too much filling instead of meat. I had to use my puppy dog eyes to get more of the short rib burrito which was loaded with seasoned meat.. . Was it worth it? Yeah, I guess it was cool to try it and tell all my friends back home. Would I do it again? Hmmm, depends on the company and how much spare time I've got!
