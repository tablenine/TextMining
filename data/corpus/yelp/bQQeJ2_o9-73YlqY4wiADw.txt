Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I finally tried the Father's Office burger - DELICIOUS!  This is the only fancy burger I've had that I didn't have to deconstruct to eat.  The meat was cooked perfectly and the toppings were full of flavor - did I mention that I could eat it with my hands??  Joining the burger in my stomach were amazing sweet potatoes fries and a nice glass of Syrah.  I'll definitely be heading back for a late Sunday lunch when the crowds are manageable.
