Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
After experience going once here for a group birthday dinner, I was addicted and craving Manna.. . Its best to go early or make reservation.  You can either park on the streets if there's any available or valet which is free but you would have to tip.. . All you can eat bbq for $17.99!  Not bad for the quality of the meat.. Service is great and the employees are very helpful!. This place is entertaining when it comes to birthdays.  If you tell them its someone's birthday, they get champagne and pour all over you! hahahahahah  (its in good fun and laugh...)
