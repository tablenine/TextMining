I actually thought this place was going to be better than it was. I admit that I wasn't exceptionally hungry, so maybe that had something to do with it. I will say that the mozzarella from the bar was scrumptious. The service was also a little iffy. I'm usually okay with less-than-stellar service but our waiter didn't take our order until about 20 minutes after he first took drink orders. I had to ask one of the Maitre D's who was checking in on tables a few questions about the menu since our waiter was MIA.
