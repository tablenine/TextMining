Okay, by now, I've had Kogi several times both at the truck and at Alibi Room and I have also tried several other food trucks, so I can now confidently say....Kogi is the king of all food trucks!  Thus, I have to give up my previous rating from a 4 to 5 stars.  . . Yeah, there were food trucks before Kogi, but they took it to another level. Now look, there's a huge food truck phenomenon taking place in Los Angeles and it all makes for good eats.  Kogi keeps it fresh by adding specials to their menu, so you keep coming back to try it. They gave purpose to a Tweeting (really...if you don't have a business, what value does Twitter have?).  It is one of the few food trucks that I actually crave the food.  Some may think it is overrated, but that is because they don't appreciate the impact Kogi has made.  The food is good, the prices aren't too bad, and it fills you up.  Kudos, Kogi! I heart you!
