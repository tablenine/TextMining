I live in the area and this is a reliable place. I usually opt for the fish sandwich that I really enjoy. It comes with spicy mayonnaise and definitely has some kick. Other things I've repeat ordered has been the Wiseguy Pizza (caramelized onions and sausage) and the crab cakes - surprising good for a place with little seafood. I've never noticed a noise problem and have quite a few conversations here.. . Updated - They increased prices so minus a star.
