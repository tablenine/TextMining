Restaurant: Twin Anchors Restaurant &amp; Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
Some of the best ribs I've eaten in the city. This is a carnivore-only type establishment. The ribs and pulled pork sandwich are the front runners here. I also had a cup of the chili and it was very good as well. . . My buddy lives in Napa Valley now, and holds food to the highest of standards. Twin Anchors is a must visit for him everytime he comes to Chicago.
