Yum.. Roommate and I went by on opening night. Um, just a few blocks from our place, how could we pass it up?. I ordered the Boricua: marinated tofu, black beans, brown rice and greens in between fried plantains. Supposedly a sandwich but it was so hardy I ate that bad boy with a fork. A great, strong mix of tastes, and the love of my life, fried plantains, was an awesome touch.. Roommate got the Asian Meatball Sammich. Meatballs, noodles, and mint in between soft torta-looking bread. She thoroughly enjoyed it.. We tried the brussel sprouts with chorizo; I am not a brussel sprouts fan. My roommate seems to think they are making a "comeback." I never knew they were 'gone,' but this side dish was so tasty, that I'll support the brussel sprouts movement.. I tried to make room for the soft serve w/ bacon-chocolate-chip-cookies, but was too full. Staff was super nice, food was super good, I will be back.
