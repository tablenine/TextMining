The chicken is a huge, Flinstone's size bird.  Lots of garlic seasoning with slightly overpowering lemon juice.  They use the same or similar seasoning on the halibut.  I've tried a couple of other main courses, but none are as memorable as the chicken and the halibut.  Both plates come w/ a s__tload of black beans and plantains, and both are good, but something is mildly offsetting to me about the sweetness of the plantains.  . Also, try the yucca appetizer.  A little dry, but it has a nice potato flavor with a different, almost rhubarb texture.. The waiters are very accomodating too.   A couple of times I went w/ a group of about 30 people, and despite the chaos, they remained calm and friendly.
