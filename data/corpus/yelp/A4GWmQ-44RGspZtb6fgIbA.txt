I should really take notes. I keep going here with people that know just what to order, but instead of taking note, I'm more concentrated on stuffing my belly full of what's in front of me. . . Just had the opportunity to eat here at 1 AM, and the sea bass and the salt &amp; pepper squid were insanely tasty. Next time, next time I shall pull out a pen and jot down all those dishes on a napkin though!
