Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
EDIT: I was just notified that Crawdaddy ALSO serves king crab legs...sorry Boiling Crab, you don't have anything that sets you apart from my favorite place...... . After visiting a Northern Cali version of this restaurant, I was sure that this place would kick Crawdaddy's butt (see other review).  After all the New Orleans style seafood with a hint of Vietnamese style cooking to it did begin in Southern California, didn't it?  . I decided to hit up this place at 2pm afraid that there would be tons of people coming to eat.  To my surprise it was fairly empty today with maybe around 5-6 tables full of people.  I ordered one pound of shrimp ($8.99/lb) with Cajun sauce, one pound of king crab legs with the whole sha-bang sauce, half dozen raw oysters ($7.99), and Cajun fries.  All items were of medium spiciness.. Having only Crawdaddy to compare this restaurant to, their sauce was completely different.  Here, their sauce was more solid and oily, reminding me of the Sa-Cha BBQ sauce you would use for Shabu Shabu, while Crawdaddy's sauce was more liquid and less oily.  Personally, I prefer the more liquid sauce at Crawdaddy.  I will give Boiling Crab one more point for having a better selection of seafood.    The king crab legs were perfect and delicious.  If I were to come here again I'd like to just get the king crab legs, but at $16.99/lb and a pound being close to three legs, it doesn't seem like that much.... *Sigh*, my search continues to find a better restaurant down south compared to up north.....
