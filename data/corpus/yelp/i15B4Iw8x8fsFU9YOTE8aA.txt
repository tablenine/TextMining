I've never had anything but brunch here but it never fails to be exactly what I was hungry for. Whomever poaches the eggs in the kitchen deserves a raise; best eggs benedict ever! I've been there three times between the hours of 12-2 and have never had to wait. The service has been consistently, well, perfect. My servers have all seemed genuinely friendly and damn good at their jobs; sparse when they should be, happy to help when they see your orange juice is getting low. Oh yeah -- ALL YOU CAN DRINK OJ. Sold! Nothing like chilled, fresh-squeezed (or at least it tastes that way) orange juice that keeps on coming. . . Besides the eggs benedict and the orange juice, I've also tried the yogurt/granola/fruit, the biscuits and gravy (damn good bikkie), the macaroni and cheese, and the croque monsieur. Some people may think there's little to get excited over a glorified ham and cheese sandwich but this croque is where it's at. . . The only reason I'm withholding the fifth star is because of whispered shady business practices, although it is just a restaurant and poor management is so common. But as long as the employees are happy and the food stays legit, this will remain my favorite brunching spot.
