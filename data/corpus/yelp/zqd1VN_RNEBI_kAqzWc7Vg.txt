Not bad - but nothing to write home about. I enjoy the booths here - they are comfy. The mixed drink specials are okay. The food was just so-so. . . Oh - and they have this weird system where if you go in and want a table but they are all full, you go over to the middle of the room where there is a chalkboard on a pillar and write your name....but nowhere does it say to do this. So if you walk in and want a booth, go straight to the board and write your name down..the employees will be impressed.
