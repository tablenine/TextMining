Seriously jetlagged after a trip to the orient, we found ourselves bright eyed and bushy tailed at the wee hours of 5am.  Hungry.  Starving, what's open at this time?. . First choice would have been Griddle but they open at 8:30.  Boo.  So we were left with either Canters and Norms and decided Canters it was.. . Breakfast was mediocre at best and really pricey too.  I had two eggs, french toast, bacon, ham, and a very poor attempt at scalloped potato hash.  First off, the french toast was on a plate that had a dried crusty residue on the edge.  I suddenly didn't feel like eating it and  so didn't even want to bother complaining about it either.  The potatoes were dry, hard to chew and even harder to swallow.  Everything else was just OK.. . My husband had the corned beef which was served like a meatloaf.  It was a large serving but I didn't think it tasted all that great, plus it was a tad dry.. . At this point we decided on a side of potato salad which is one of my favorites at Canters.  Yum.  It didn't disappoint.. . So, one star for being open, one for the food, and one for the delish potato salad.  Hence, 3 stars.. . Btw, halfway into the meal, we realized Dupars could have been another option.  Never been, but I hear their breakfast is excellent.
