My husband and I love this place, we are always getting buckhead life group gift cards from my company.  Out of all the restaraunts in the group, we've only gone to Chops, it is that amazing!  I'm calling this week to make our reservations for Valentine's Day, they always have a really great menu  prepared for this night.  Yummy!  My favorite is the flash-fried lobster tail appetizer...give it a try.
