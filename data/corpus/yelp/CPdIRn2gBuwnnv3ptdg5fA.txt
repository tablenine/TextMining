I personally like the spicy pork filling over the short rib and the tofu. Haven't tried the chicken. . . If you get the tacos, make sure you order enough. They are pretty tiny! 3-4 is perfect for a meal. Remember to ask for slices of oranges and limes! . . The Kogi hotdog is amazing! The frank itself has a little spicy heat and is extra juicy! The trucks don't always carry the hot dogs, so head to the alibi room if you want to try!
