My intro experience at Radial was a good one. Just felt like picking up something to eat while running errand. I made the perfect choice in picking a Radial bagel- super fresh sesame bagel, sprouts, tomato, avocado and cream cheese. Fresh and tasty. Service was nice, food was out in a jiffy, and I have been craving another one every since! I am looking forward to going back this weekend to eat it again!
