Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
I was hanging out with my buddy who works in Culver City and we happened to stumble here after checking out the wine bar next door.  Since we had a hankerin' for some Italian, we decided to give this place a try.  The atmosphere inside was cool and inviting, with the parchment paper bistro-style tables to accent the blue walls.  Since it was a very cold night, everyone sat inside.  But I noticed that there was about 10 tables outside making it perfect to hang out on a summer day.. . The menu itself consisted of basic italian fare:  pomodoros, paninis, pizzas, and piccata accentuate the list.  We both went ahead and got the Quattro Formaggia pizza (gorgonzola, mozzarella, parmigiano, and goat cheese) with chicken added on to it.  Served on a thin crust, this pizza.......was okay.  I could've lived without the gorgonzola as it adds a chewiness and a hint of sourness to the pizza that wasn't welcomed.  Maybe asiago would've done it more justice.  And the added chicken actually made the pizza very chewy.  It was kinda our fault for getting this option, but I felt that the chicken could've been a little more tender and less dry.. . In any case, the bill came out to about $22 with two drinks and the pizza.  This restaurant didn't really have anything to scream about.  However, the gelato place linked next door seems interesting and maybe that will be worth another look the next time I get a chance to visit downtown Culver.
