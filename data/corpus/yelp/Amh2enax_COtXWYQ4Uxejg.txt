Restaurant: Los Nopales
Category: Mexican
We've dined in quite a few times, but now mainly order out.  The restaurant is so small, in the winter when the door opens, it is freezing!  Service is slow, but they could not be nicer people.. . Now, I would love to order from here more, but they get so busy - we give them a good 10 minutes longer than they say it will take and we're still waiting for our carry-out.. . The food is very good.  Their green salsa is seriously amazing, so amazing they are very stingy with it.  I love my salsa and one little "cup" just isn't gong to do it.  Even when asked for extra salsa, you get one red and one green.. . Worth the try, especially if you are in the neighborhood.
