Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
One of the first things I did before entering the restaurant was to look up the restaurant on Yelp, and I'm glad I did. I ordered the Latin Heat (because it was one of those top-mentioned items), and it was delicious. The tuna was fresh and the chili mayo wasn't too creamy that it tasted more like mayo than anything else -- it was perfect. . . My friends and I came here as part of a meetup gathering, and the staff were really helpful. We didn't know how many people were going to show up, so they gave us a room separated from the rest of the people in the restaurant. One of the people at our table accidentally bumped into the waitress as she was setting the food down and although she insisted that the waitress give her the food as is, the waitress came back with a new plate of edamame (which is an indication of good service to me). . . I also ordered a plate of calamari as an appetizer, but I hadn't expected it to be so big (it was listed as a small plate). The calamari was delicious, but it wasn't what I expected -- I don't remember reading that it was fried on the menu. . . Overall, I had a good time. I haven't had a lot of good sushi in Chicago (I'm not sure what it is with this city and not-so-great seafood), but the freshness of the tuna definitely helped put this restaurant at the top of the list for me for sushi.
