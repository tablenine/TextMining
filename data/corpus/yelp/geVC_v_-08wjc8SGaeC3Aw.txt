Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Sadly, the Fogo de Chao on La Cienega's not as good as the Fogo I'd eaten at in Brazil. But, hey, all-you-can-eat meat! . . Like a dim sum restaurant, waiters walk around with food. Except instead of old Chinese ladies pushing metal carts filled with dumplings, it's non-Brazilian guys carrying cooked chunks of cow, pig, and lamb impaled on large metal sticks. My personal favorites that day were the ribeye and beef ribs. My only complaint is that I prefer my meat medium-rare Â and sometimes the servings bordered on overcooked.. . They give you a coin with a green side for "Sock it to me!" and a red side for "No mas!" But even when I had the red side up, I couldn't stop looking up from my feeding anytime I sensed the presence of red meat. I just can't say no to anybody offering to fill my belly with delicious animal, and the waiters were very eager to pile slices of domesticated beasts on my plate. The service, by the way, was excellent.. . For those who want to include some vegetation in their meal so that their colon isn't blocked up like the 405, they've got a nice salad bar, complete with hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, and a bevy of heartless items.
