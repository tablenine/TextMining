This place is pretty awesome! All you have to do is get to the city, and you're magically there! It just happens.. . The largest pizza I have ever seen and enjoyed. For the slice of pie you get, it's definitely worth the money. The jumbo definitely feeds a van-full of dudes at a reasonable price. A little on the greasy side, but the flavor won't get you down. The management should improve drink options. . . It's fun trying to measure the pizza in terms of body parts.
