I can't go anywhere without hearing about the Korean BBQ Taco Truck, so when I learned it was coming to the Japanese American National Musuem, I thought it would be a good time for me to give it a try, since I work Downtown.  Actually a friend of mine talked me into trying it, but he couldn't make it, so I talked another friend into going who happens to live a block away.  ANYHOW...  There was a long line formed BEFORE the truck got there!  We got to JANM just as the truck arrived and there was loud music coming from a DJ.  It took them a while to set up before they started serving.  We ended up waiting a total of 2 hours before we had the food in our hands.. . Was it worth it?  I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed the food!  I tried one short rib taco, one spicy pork taco, one chicken taco, and one "sliders" (they should call it slider, since they give you only one for your $2).  They were all pretty good!  I especially enjoyed the spicy pork taco.  I didn't try any of the burritos, but my friend bought one, and he said the tacos were better.  So, is it Korean or is it Mexican?  I would describe it as Mexican with a Korean flavor.  Two great tastes that taste great together.. . I felt like I was attending an event rather than having a culinary experience.  The lines were just crazy!.  But I'm glad I went and tried this new trend.  I have a feeling we'll be seeing more Korean BBQ taco trucks unless these people have a patent or copyright or something on this idea.  One good thing is that they gave me an extra short rib taco, the dude said I was sexy.  Maybe I misheard him because the music was so loud.
