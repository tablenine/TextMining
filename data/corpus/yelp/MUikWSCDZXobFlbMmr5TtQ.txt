I expected something phenomenal - the amous bouche was alright, a bit creamy for me and it wasn't described to us at the table.. . The marinated hamachi appetizer I began with was alright - but the fish was just a-ok in terms of freshness and the marinade was mediocre, a bit on the sour side with not much flavor.. . Chicken entree came in a pot, looked almost tasted liek coq-qu-vin but was a little bit too buttery and not very flavorful or me.. . Dessert was good on the other hand, I had the chocolate tart with the mandarin orange sorbet.. . Service was pretty good but overall for the prices and everything considered, I don't really think it was worth it.
