Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Boiling Crab was great!. . Four of us went on a Saturday night and the place was overflowing with people. I was later told it's always that packed. Once seated we all got some beers, ordered a few pounds of crawfish, sausage, fried fish, and a couple dozen raw oysters. Service was quick and smooth the entire time, it was refreshing to be looked after so well. . . Within minutes of ordering our bags of critters were placed in front of us. One bag had two pounds of un-spiced crawfish and the third pound was with mild heat. I got to say, that mild seasoning packed a nice little kick. I'm guessing the hot is actually hot. Half of the substance I took in was just the seasoning rub on the crawfish, so much garlic! I loved it. . . The raw oysters were just okay, not much flavor and nothing to write home about. Whatever fried fish we got was equally meh, but was a nice change from just eating crawfish after crawfish. . . I can't comment on the food to price ratio as one of our friends grabbed the bill and insisted on paying (thanks Tommy!) All in all it was a great meal and I can't wait to go back!
