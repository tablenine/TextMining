Restaurant: Pho Dai Loi
Category: Vietnamese
So feeling adventurous and getting bored of going to pho #1 for pho, I journeyed over to pho dai loi 2. The restaurant is located in the corner of a small plaza just past burlington coat factory and less than 2 mi from pho #1. Compared to Pho #1 the restaurant is more updated with more decor on the inside namely a large chandelier in the dining room. When you walk into the door usually a waiter will greet you and seat you. My first time there I was waited on by a shorter fellow with dark hair that came down to his eye level. He was pretty rude and insisted that we had ordered something we didn't, when my guest asked him to take it back he kinda gave a sigh and went back to the kitchen. I now avoid that waiter like the plague and it seems that he goes out of his way not to serve me (fine by me). . . Thank god the food saved my first experience here. The prices range from 5.25 for a small to 6.50 for an 'ex-large' bowl of pho. The broth is a tad bland for me and seems to be missing a bit of that bold beef flavor found in some other bowls of pho i've had. But at the same time it was good. The noodles were cooked correctly and the meat and side items were very fresh. In addition to the pho, I've also had the opportunity to try their rice dishes (and there is plenty, priced around $6.95 or so). Their meats are well marinated and the quiches they serve are quite tasty. Despite the mediocre service (short guy with bangs), the prices and good food more than make up for it.
