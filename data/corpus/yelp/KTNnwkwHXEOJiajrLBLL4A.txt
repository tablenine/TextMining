this place is alright.  I ate here a month ago.  The place is cool and all, and I like how they are like a deli kind of place and also a bakery kinda place.  However, I think its kind of overpriced.  It's like almost 10 bucks for a sandwich, which tastes alright but I think it should be worth 5-6 bucks instead.  I'd rcommend this place if you are maybe thinking of eating a quick lunch, and kinda wanna eat fast instead of at a restaurant.
