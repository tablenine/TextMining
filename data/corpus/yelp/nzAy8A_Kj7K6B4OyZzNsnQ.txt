If I could, I'd give Roys 3.5 stars. Everything was good, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. . . At the beginning, some of the edamame was cold and some was warm. Some had no seasoning and some had way too much. No big deal, really, just an observation. . . We had the tuna poke-tini which was good, but not spectacular. The fish was fresh, but the flavor was off. I had the butter fish for my meal which was outstanding. I had the signature Hawaiian martini which tasted like a melted pina colada. Again, good, but not spectacular. . . The desserts were great. We had the chocolate souffle and the assorted plate. Everything chocolate was incredible. The rest of the table enjoyed the cheesecake and carrot cake as well. . . Overall, the ambiance and service were fantastic. It was good, just didn't live up to all the hype I guess.
