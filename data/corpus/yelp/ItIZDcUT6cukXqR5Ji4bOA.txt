MM, MM, MMMM. I am so excited about this place, contrary to their name, they have healthy options, but they also have numerous none healthy options.. . I have only been here once, and cant wait to go again, their mango dressing, and small side salad with quinoa on top was wonderful, who puts quiona on top of a side salad?! HELLO AWESOME NON STINGYS! . . My foe chicken sammy burger thang was so so yummers, and the sweet potato fries, ugh, kill me now. . . I cant wait to go back, oh, the service was very friendly, the food was served in a reasonable amount of time and the establishment it self appeared to be well kept and clean. . . Keep on keepin on Veggie Grill, I WILL be back
