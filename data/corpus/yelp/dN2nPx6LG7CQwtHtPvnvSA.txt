What is the fascination of Americans in general, and some of the reviewers here, with portion size?  How many pairs of "buffet pants" do you own?  Is Applebee's your gold standard of haute cuisine?. . Urban Belly is a perfect example of quality over quantity.  Fresh ingredients, expertly prepared that leave you savoring every bite.  Yes, the price is higher than you will find at Panda Express, but PE won't let you bring in your favorite bottle of Mad Dog 20/20.. . On second thought, please go to Applebee's or Panda Express, seating is bench style and limited at Urban Belly...  you would take more than your fair share of space.
