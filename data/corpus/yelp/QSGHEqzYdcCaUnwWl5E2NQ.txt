Strolled into Gato Bizco the other day, surprised to find many empty seats, juxtaposed with hungry hordes lined up outside the Flying Biscuit, just across the street. I love cats, so I of course appreciated the multitude of feline decorations, especially the three Pete the Cat pieces. . . I sat at the bar, watching a greasy granola boy cook my garden omelet, stuffed with chopped bell peppers and other vegetables and plenty of cheddar cheese. My sides included a cup of black beans and a delicious biscuit. (A second greasy granola boy brought me my food.). . I am flabbergasted that Gato Bizco doesn't get some of the Flying Biscuit traffic that has grown tired of waiting for a seat, as the food is as good or--dare I say--better...
