Restaurant: The Flying Biscuit
Category: American (Traditional)
We heard stories about this joint while visiting ATL. We finally made our way there, and after a 30-minute wait, we immediately knew what everyone was raving about! . . I had the soft, fluffy biscuit topped with thick yet creamy gravy that was sprinkled with just the right amount of flavorful, moist sausage. I'm still drooling over that! . . The service was fast! The wait was minimal! The food was divine! Talk about Southern Hospitality!
