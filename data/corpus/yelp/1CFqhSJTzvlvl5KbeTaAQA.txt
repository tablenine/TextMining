Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Not really feeling this Shabu Shabu Restaurant, the whole entire place itself smelled, everything looked dirty, even the hot pot that I was putting my meat and veggies into looked rusty and not washed thoroughly. The counters was sticky, and as for the area that I was sitting at had food pieces all over the ground (I kind of regret putting my purse down too because it was all sticky and dirty after I had picked it up). . . As for the wait, it was pretty long on the weekend that I came on; we had a party of six and they couldn't even seat us together, so our party pretty much split up into two's and we all ate at different times. As for the meat and veggies, it was pretty decent, but for $17 for a large I could have went to cleaner restaurant in Orange County where the smell won't gross me out and not make me want to touch anything and the food is equally as good.
