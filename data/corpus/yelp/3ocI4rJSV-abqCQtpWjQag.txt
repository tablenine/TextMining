Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Let's be honest here. The only reason anyone comes here is for the #2 Special right? It's like climbing Everest... .  U need a strong stomach, not strong tongue.. . I tried the regular levels of the spicy ramen and the #2 special. The noodles weren't too great. It's thick and rough so it won't soak up the spicy soup too much. I would rank it as a ramen to be very average if not subpar to others like Foo Foo Tei. As I said, Â u only come here for the challenge or to watch other suffer at the hands of the challenge. The actual ramen is nothing special. Pork is average also. Places like Daikokuya or Shinsengumi are totally on a different level than here.
