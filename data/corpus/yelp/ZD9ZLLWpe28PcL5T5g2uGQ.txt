Restaurant: Sushi Go 55
Category: Sushi Bars
Don't let the name and location fool you, Sushi Go 55 is a hidden gem. Something you don't expect to find on the top floor of a japanese strip mall.  . . The quality of their fish is superb and their miso soup is one of the best I've ever tasted. Their shoyu sauce is made from scratch and really enhances the flavor of the fish. Make sure to try their hamachi! . . Fortunately, I've never had to wait to get seated but be warned, this place is very, very small. Closed Sundays.
