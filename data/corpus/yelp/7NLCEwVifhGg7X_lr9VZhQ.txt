Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
If you want a quick test to know if someone knows good restaurants in LA just ask them about din tai fung. If they don't know DTF, don't trust their other recommendations!. . This place could charge 3x the price and i'd still pay it, there is nothing comparable I've found in la or the country for that matter.. . Everyone needs to experience their juicy pork dumplings at least once. I try to take my family and out of state guests here. If you love food then this joint must be experienced at least once.
