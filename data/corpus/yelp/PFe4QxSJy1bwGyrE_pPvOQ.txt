Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
I am definitely a fan of Bottega Louie!  Loved the high ceilings and the open feel of the restaurant.  As we were waiting for our table, we got a drink at the bar and watched the chefs making the food and browsed the market.  Although we got seated after about 15 minutes, even after we finished our food, I noticed a large party still waiting so if you're going to go, it might just be better to go with a small group since they don't take reservations.. . We ordered the mussels and clams, meatballs, calamari, and portebello fries.  More than enough for the 3 of us!  The mussels and clams were great...we dipped all of our bread in the sauce and then had to ask for more bread!  But those portebello fries were to die for!  who would've thought?  It's a must try if you're going to go to Bottega Louie.  Meatballs and calamari were good too.. . The ambience here is great, lively, and the staff is super nice.  They have valet parking but don't park there because you can literally go down one not even half a block and park for $3.
