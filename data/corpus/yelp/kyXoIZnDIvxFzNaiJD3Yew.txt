Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
This may be the restaurant that changed my opinion of deep dish. A true thin crust lover I finally tried what I've been told is the best deep dish in Chicago. While I still love my thin crust, Lou Malnatis did not disappoint. Very good crust, nice tomato sauce and not too much cheese (which is usually what I hate about deep dish, it just makes me feel sick).. . Their dining room is pretty small, but on a Monday night we got seated within a couple minutes. Our server was attentive and their prices are very reasonable. I don't understand the weird lounge area in the dining room with the couches and tv? Seems like wasted space. I think I'll definitely be back.
