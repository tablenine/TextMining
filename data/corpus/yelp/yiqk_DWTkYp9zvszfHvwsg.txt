I'll definitely be back. We had lunch last Sunday. I'm happy we were able to get a reservation for our party of six within a week.. . We started with the Bone Marrow Al Forno and the Fried Squash Bottoms.. . The Fried Squash Bottoms were stuffed with mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan and some herbs. It was dipped in Rice Flour and soda water and fried to a golden crisp. It was delicious. I'd definitely order that again.. . The Bone Marrow Al Forno was served with roasted garlic, celery leaves, salt and grilled/toasted baguette. It was good but I thought the consistency of the bone marrow could have been better. I'm going to try to make this at home. I'm going to cook the shank and then roast it.. . I ordered the Little gem lettuce, dates, red onion and gorgonzola, It was fantastic. I ate a lot of that.. . We ordered the Platto del giorno and it was lasagna that day. Wow is all I can say.. . We ordered a few pizzas and my favorite was the Strachino with artichokes, lemon and olives.. . We also ordered dessert. The chocolate and coconut sorbetti was rich and it hit the spot. I also tried the Meyer lemon gelato pie and butterscotch budino. Yes Yes and yes to ordering it again.. . I plan to go back one day and try some other things.
