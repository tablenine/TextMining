love their tuna nicoise salad. Â the tuna is seared perfectly and if you don't like too much dressing, opt to get it on the side.. . if you're craving a small salad, they have the caesar salad and a mixed greens salad for $5.. . if you're taking your non-salad loving friends here, they can indulge in their meat entrees with a side of mash.
