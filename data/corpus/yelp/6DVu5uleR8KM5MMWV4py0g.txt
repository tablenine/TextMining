Came here for the Hainan chicken. I had 2 orders of Hainan chicken to go. Hainan chicken is just boiled FRESH (recently killed) chicken. Â I normally eat a lot of fresh chicken because you can buy them around the area. The meal was OK, nothing impressive. The chicken was a tad dry for my tastes. At over $7 for the meal I don't think it's worth it. You might like it if you normally buy frozen chicken at the grocery stores. I suggest people here to just buy costco rotisserie at $5 and just cook some rice and save yourself some monies.
