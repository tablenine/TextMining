Disappointment. . Why?. I came for brunch with a party of 4 and our server (man with brown hair and glasses) told us he was having a bad day after one of us made a little joke with him. Shouldn't he at least wait until a mistake is made to make excuses? But the point is, I was put off by our server starting our service with that.  There was something wrong with almost all our dishes. . . My montecristo was burnt on one side (top side) and uncooked on the bottom. It was simply bread dipped in egg that was heated over.  I didn't eat that part of course.  And I dont think it was a coincidence that the BOTTOM was uncooked. You think I won't notice???. . 2 friends got the duck confit sandwich. The menu description mentioned spinach, I think...but the sandwish contained NO GREENS at all.. . The cheese selections were overpriced for the portion. . While there, I noticed a cook walk in and let's say  I've SEEN this person work elsewhere. Good thing said cook started his shift after we got our food. . . This place is fine if you want to drop in to pick up a bottle of wine, but don't eat here.
