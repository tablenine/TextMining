How is this possibly the top ranked Chinese food in Atlanta? . I went here for lunch on Sunday and it was some of the worst, most uninspired food Ive had (Chinese or otherwise) in a long long time. . . The waitress was on point and kept my water full. That's about the nicest thing I can say about my experience here.
