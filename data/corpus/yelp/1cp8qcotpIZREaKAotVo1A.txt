yum yum!  . . i came here without reservations on a friday night which i thought would be a bad idea, but we waited at the bar for a bit and enjoyed the great martini/beer/wine menu- they have some creative and delicious drinks!  . . once we were seated, we received excellent service- knowledgeable and attentive, but not impatient with us even though we took our time figuring out what to eat.  although it is not a very extensive menu, everything sounded delicious.  i loved the salmon with edamame puree and the vegetable spring rolls too.  my dad enjoyed his seared scallops and the mac and cheese was pretty good too, and i don't like mac and cheese.  . . the atmosphere of the place was what i enjoyed the most though.  it is definitely a nicer restaurant, but the energy of the place made it welcoming and fun.  there were several larger parties and i would definitely consider eating here again for a big bday bash or something.  . . one last note:  it's a bit pricey, so i'm glad i went here when my dad was visiting!!
