Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Admittedly, I was initially turned off from this place BECAUSE of all the hype. I thought, a hot dog can't be so good that it's worth waiting in line for an hour plus. If I wasn't dragged here after seeing the Presets with a few friends at the El Rey, I definitely would've never chosen this place.. . It was about 12am, the lot was 3/4 full and the line was long for a normal line but I'm guessing short for a Pink's line. We waited for about 45 minutes and by the time we ordered + got our food (which took about 5 minutes), we had already experienced a night of dancing, an angry black homeless dude riding a bike with one sandal yelling, "GET THE EFF OFF MY SIDEWALK!" and I was dying of hunger. The simple spicy polish dog (w/ chili and mustard) is just hot enough for anyone who loves the sensation of their taste buds dying, the chili cheese fries are perfect if you're looking for something salty, greasy and chili cheesy, and the bottled sodas are perfect for digesting the mess you just ate (but it's not like you can't buy those anywhere else).. . It's cash only and perfect for a late night snack if you're in the area, but that wait could be incredibly irritating at any other time of day (to say the least).
