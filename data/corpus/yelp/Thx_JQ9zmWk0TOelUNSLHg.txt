not a super fan of this location. i do love the OG location in santa monica, with its darkly lit, closet sized space of goodness and fantabulous hamburgers. yeah, its a little pricey, but if its a good burger, i'm alright with that once in a while. plus theres a ton of beer.. . this location was a bit disappointing. im used to the cozy, chill atmosphere of the original location, however, i found this location to be kinda like the 'club' version of father's office. bouncer-like guys standing at the entrance with their mics in their ears looking "cool" in all black. the space itself is lovely, but it doesn't give off that comfy vibe. it's definitely geared towards the hip crowd looking to be a part of the trendy scene. they still have a ton of beer, so at least they saved that part, but the seating situation is a mess here. at the original location, the seating situation works. the doorman knows the count and makes sure that there aren't more people than the place can handle inside. the doorman is also pretty nice and helps you find a half table or a couple of chairs to sit down in the crowded place. this location pretty much lets you fend for yourself and you're a little screwed. i saw people wait as long as an hour and a half for a table. we were lucky though as a kind waiter seated us at the bar on the side where the drinks are set out just so we could actually sit and eat. . . i dunno... i just didn't really dig the vibe in this place and wasn't comfortable. i felt like i should go home, dress up a lil, and then come back. this wasn't the chill joint that the original is. meh. i'll stil with the santa monica location. gluck father's office (culver city)
