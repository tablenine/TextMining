I finally made it here! I was super excited, but left thinking , "meh".. . Service was very friendly, though a liiiiil' slow..even when it was not super busy. Â The place smells like an elderly relative's basement ( gotta be the stack of ancient board games near the wall, or the Leif Garrett LPs), but thankfully the smells of the hearty cookin' overpowers that.. . I tried the tuna melt. ' Twas a bit busy for my taste, but still good. The curly fries, on the other hand, were superb. . . I think if I'd go here again I'd try the "cult hit": chicken and waffles. . . I also think that the fact that they have a Barbarella poster means I should,indeed, give 'em another shot.
