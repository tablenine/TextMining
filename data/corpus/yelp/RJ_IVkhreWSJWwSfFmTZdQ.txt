Love taco truck style korean bbq. Very novel idea. The slaw that accompanies the tacos was absolutely delicious (reminds me of Bakesale Betty's chicken sandwiches in Berkeley). . . Spicy pork was everyone's favorite. The other meats (short rib and chicken) were a bit lackluster. We haven't tried the kimchi quesadilla, but hear that is pretty delicious -- grilled kimchi is pretty amazing, can't go wrong there. . . $2 tacos - cheap and good.. $2 sodas - uhh, kind of pricey, no?. . Overall - I'm a fan! But, am wondering if it will continue to be a success after it loses its novelty.
