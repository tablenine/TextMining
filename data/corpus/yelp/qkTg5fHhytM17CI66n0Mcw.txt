Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Titos Tacos... Not sure why everyone boasts about them. They are not the greatest tacos in the city of Los Angeles. . . I finally tried their tacos this weekend and I really dig the taste of Shredded Beef instead of Ground Beef in their hard shell tacos. But even with the change in beef, I still don't understand why there are huge lines waiting to get these tacos? I do like how they give you plenty of chips and Salsa although, the salsa taste like it has a bit too much lemon in it... Â . . Overall In my opinion, titos tacos is mediocre.... but.... If you're in the vicinity and don't mind waiting 5-10 minutes for your order than I say give it a try. Who knows, you may like it...
