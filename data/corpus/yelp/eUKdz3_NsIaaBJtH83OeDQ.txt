Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
I agree, that The Little door is not cheap, but you are paying for amazing food, ambiance, and service. Our waiter was french and one of my friends is a fluent in the romance language, we had a great time and it was also a great place for people watching since there were so many beautiful people around.
