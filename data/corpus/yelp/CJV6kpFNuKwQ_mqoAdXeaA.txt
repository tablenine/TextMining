my cardboard tasting spaghetti with wanna-be cheese made from cashews, with tempeh (an Oriental food made by fermenting soybeans with Rhizopus oligosporusfermented) Â "meatballs" . . no thanks! . . the fresh apple juice was a plus though. i dont even know why i even try to eat healthy junk sometimes. . . it's just not as good!. i need meat. and msg.. . but i give them 1 extra star for trying to make it taste/look like real food. very creative. if i was vegan, i would probably love it here.
