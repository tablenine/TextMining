Everything here taste very good. the flavor is terrific on nearly everything I have tried. But the amount of food inside your crepe is not what I expect. I have been here 3 times. I have had savory crepes for dinner and part of a sweet one for dessert. It comes out and looks massive, but as I get half way through (which is when I usually get full), I realize that looks have been deceiving. It just always feels a bit skimpy. Very tasty though.
