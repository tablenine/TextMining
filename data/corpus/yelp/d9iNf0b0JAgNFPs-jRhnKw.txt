This is a great little italian spot in logan square - cozy feel with excellent food.  . . We went saturday night at 6:30 without a reservation - just early enough to beat the rush and got seated right away.  We started with cream of mushroom soup and fresh italian bread with an awesome garlic/parmesan tapenade (did i mention awesome?).  Expecting large portions, me and my girl split the red beet salad and a special entree consisting of filet of beef tenderloin, mash potatoes, and green beans.  Both were insanely good, but super small portions.  I prolly got 2-3 oz of meat, 8 green beans, and a couple spoonfulls of mashed potatoes.  I easily could have eaten 2 orders of that, maybe 3 if i did not have bread or anything else.  But yeah, insanely good - meat was high quality with a mushroom marsala sauce cooked to perfection, potatoes and beans rounded it out nicely.  The beet salad came with beets, arugal, and lightly-fried goat cheese - a combination giving you a mouth full of bliss. Normally we don't get dessert but since i was still hungry - we had the chocolate pecan tart and the cannoli.  Both were great, but that cannoli was fabulous (most cannoli's I have disappoint).  . . Our hostess was extremely personable, wait service was not bad but not good, atmosphere was nice but nothing to write home about, and our meal was not super expensive but no value - it came out to $80 with 3 glasses of wine, tax and tip.   But yeah, the food quality is definitely the reason to go and I'll be back.
