Restaurant: Rare Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Burgers
It's Black Friday. Tourists all about Times Square and Grand Central. But on 37th Street and Lexington, not a creature was stirring. Not even a mouse. Well, except for me and my Super Mario Bros partner, for we were craving burgers, baby, burgers. And one of the places that I had been dying to try for at least three days was Rare Bar &amp; Grill.. . I ordered the M&amp;M burger, which consisted of apple smoked bacon, shallots, lettuce, lots of cheese and nice beefy burger, cooked medium rare for that juicy goodness. My oh my, was it a tasty burger. My only criticism was the bun. Because the burger was so juicy, the bun was pretty much a crumbling mess by the time I was down to my last two or three bites. Thus, the elimination of one star. . . We also got an order of the horseshoe string fries, and they were really good too. They are my second fave type of fries, behind the immortal waffle fries that I can never find anywhere in Manhattan.. . Well, if you like burgers give them a try sometime. I can't usually get them myself because my girlfriend's a vegetarian which pretty much makes me a vegetarian. But I do love the taste of a good burger. Mm-mm-mm.
