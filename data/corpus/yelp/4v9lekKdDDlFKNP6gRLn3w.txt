Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Fast.  Decent.  Cheap.  . . Really, this isn't a place where you should expect a taco miracle to happen, but it is better than Taco Bell, and I think it is actually cheaper or as cheap, so there you go.  The food totally comes in weird little cardboard boxes like little kid meals, and the enchiladas are my favorite - I could do without their tacos, but the enchiladas are drenched in sauce and they're tasty.. . I go here once in a while when I'm craving really bad-for-me food.
