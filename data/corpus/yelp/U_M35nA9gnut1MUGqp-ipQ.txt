Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
These darn Hot Dogs are very tasty, well at least the dogs I get my favorites are the Mulholland Â Dr., Lord of the Rings, Martha Stewart (w/out relish or tomatoes), and the bacon Chili Cheese Dog, those are really the only hot dogs I get every time I go, Yes the hot dogs may be a little on the messy side, but you just gotta know how to eat them, also I cant forget about the onion rings yum-o, the fries are pretty tasty as well, I've also tried the Coconut cake which was moist and tasty, and to drink I gotta get Dr. Brown's Root Beer or cream flav. soda, the lines are long and worth the wait, take cash c/c's are not accepted and no ATM, parking is kind of like Valet, so don't be scared to leave your keys and don't get freaked out if you see your car moving or if its parked somewhere else...
