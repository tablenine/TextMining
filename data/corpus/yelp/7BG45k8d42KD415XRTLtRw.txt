Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
I wanted so badly to like this place. Perhaps I had overhyped it in my mind or I was intent on proving my boyfriend wrong (he had less than stellar reviews). Either way, I was incredibly disappointed. My sister and I came on a Saturday night. I lucked out on parking and found a spot right in front of the restaurant. It was pretty empty when we arrived; there were only about three other couples there. Menu was simple: fish tacos $1.50, shrimp tacos $2, and drinks $1. I got two fish tacos, and my sister got two shrimp. Once the food was done, we headed over to the salsa bar and I was excited to give everything a try. However, everything pretty much tasted alike that I could no longer distinguish which was which. The fish was greasy and tasteless. My sister had the same reviews of her shrimp tacos. We were glad that we only got two each, any more would have been a waste of my buck fifty.
