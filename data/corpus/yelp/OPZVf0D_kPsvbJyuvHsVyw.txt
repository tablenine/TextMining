I've been told I'm somewhat transparent when it comes to things I like. Probably because I wax ecstatic about them over and over and over until people practically declare "Yes, we knew the first 20 times you told us.". . Oops. . . Well, in case it wasn't obvious YET, I really, really, with whipped cream and sprinkles on top love tequila. Considering I dislike just about any other hard liquor on earth, all of my palatable love must have gone into whatever makes this agave nectar so delightful. And no, I'm not talking about Mr Jose C. I only do the good stuff. In fact, I might be the only person I know who has actually gotten a Patron hangover. You know, the alcohol you're not supposed to get hangovers from? Yeah. Not so true.... . That being said, places like El Carmen simply make my eyes light up. If a tequila bar opens up, I'm usually there within a week. But no tequila haven has impressed me quite like this Luchador-laden nook. This place was old school before it was 'cool' to be a tequila bar, and they know their shit. It's no frills, no attitude, and all good times. . . Yeah, it might be slightly annoying when it takes 20 minutes to get a table, but get me just some of that orgasmic pineapple-infused stuff and I'm one happy senorita. Add a great jukebox and the best damn chicken flautas I've ever had, and... gawd El Carmen, why do you have to make me look like such a soft-hearted pansy? It's not fair!. . Best bar in LA? Just about...
