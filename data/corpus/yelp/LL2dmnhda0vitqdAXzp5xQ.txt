One of the many Vietnamese restaurants I've seen while driving down Buford Highway.  Bum bo hue was tasty and very red and spicy.  My husband's grill pork wasn't too bad though the pork portion was on the smaller side.  The rest of my family loved their food so it's gotta be good.  Parking is terrible though.
