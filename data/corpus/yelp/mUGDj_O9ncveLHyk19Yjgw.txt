5 stars for the huge portions. . 4 stars for the Daikokuya Ramen (very flavorful broth &amp; well braised pork belly). So far, it's the next best and closest joint to Hakata Ramen (yumm).. . 3 stars for the Gyoza (I always like having dumplings to accompany my ramen noodles, but they make it pretty bland here and not cooked enough). I'll probably try the tempura next time. . . 2 stars for cramped space---i feel like a packed sardine in there. Plus, it kinda sucks having people eying you (while you eat) to leave for your spot.. . 1 star for the looooooooong wait!!!
