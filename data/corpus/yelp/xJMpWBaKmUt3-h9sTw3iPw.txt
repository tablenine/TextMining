Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Yet another food destination I can cross off my list!!  Philippes is a place I heard much about from locals and from travel/food channel exposes on places to get a great sandwich.  . . First off, we came during the evening for a late dinner right before a Dodgers game finished and the crowds started coming.  We got our food pretty quickly.  . . Since there were several people in our group we were able to try a number of sandwiches (lamb, roast beef, pork, ham). As far as 'dipping' the bread is dipped before its given to you so don't be confused if they don't give you a cup of au jus for self dipping.  We got all our sandwiches double dipped (both top and bottom slices of bread dipped in au jus).  It sounds like it would be a wet gooey mess but this is not the case.  Since they don't adorn their sandwiches with much sauce, they could use some lubrication from dipping.   Truth be told, my favorite of the bunch was the pork sandwich.  . . They sides were of potato salad and coleslaw were okay.  at 6 bucks per sandwich ($5.55 plus another 50 cents or so with cheese) and ice tea or lemonade for under a buck, this place is incredible easy on the wallet.  . . The folks who come here are also an interesting melange of the L.A. population so people watching is another activity to throw in while coming here!
