I feel the same way about Kogi as I do about Pink's. What on earth is the fuss about. Considering that the Kogi line is only half as long Pink's, I'll give it a generous 3 stars, although it would be lower if I factored in the anticipation and disappointment, but that's my own fault for believing the hype. . . Hype. Hype is a smart thing, the smartest thing, for a business to create. Make some decent burritos, some average tacos, and then make people run around town to get them. Â Oh the wind your hair as you race down the freeway to the destination, the sun gleaming in your eyes as you look over the 20 shoulders ahead of you in line, the taste of luscious morsels of food- oops, that's where the magic ends.. . The burrito was cheesy, and a cheesy burrito can never be bad. The tacos had little mountains of shredded lettuce and a tangy taste, neither of which I found very mind-blowing. The meat was also not that flavorful. Go buy some pre-marinated meat from any Korean market and put it in a tortilla. There, you have Kogi's, or probably something better. . . So the chase is over. This is when you throw the dishes at the wall, screaming "You're not the person I thought I married!" Well, they're never the person you thought you married, not if your expectations were built by nothing but the thrill of the chase. Now all you're left with is the baffling question of why you engaged in the pursuit at all. But I guess you end up a little wiser. A little poorer too, but wiser nonetheless.
