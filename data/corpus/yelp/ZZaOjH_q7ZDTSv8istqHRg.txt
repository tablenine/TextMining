Restaurant: The Mermaid Inn
Category: Seafood
the most memorable item on the menu continues to be the pork chop.....it continues to be most impressive pork chop i have EVER been served! Â to this day when i crave one and either order it or cook it myself, it is never up to par with the chop here....ironically, none of the other seafood items at this seafood restaurant even come close to being notable (that is, cooked items, i have not tried any of the raw bar); either that, or the overall darkness of the space just happened to obscure everything but the pork chop...!
