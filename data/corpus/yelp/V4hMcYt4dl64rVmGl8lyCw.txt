Restaurant: Mirai
Category: Sushi Bars
Always fresh fish, and one of the most innovative menus combine to make Mirai my consistently favorite sushi in the City.  Menu is about the same as Japonais (I think the same owner), but better food and less of a sceney club vibe.  The seating on the second floor has a completely different ambiance than the first floor.  The first floor has the sushi bar and a bright, restaurant feel; the second floor has the bar, lounge seating, and great views.  Almost two different restaurants.   . . My only knock is that the space is somewhat small, and I feel cramped if I don't get the second floor window seat.. . Pricey, but some of the best sushi you'll find in Chicago.
