Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I think this place is just okay...there ramen was kinda bland....maybe cause i've tried better...i think hakata ramen in Gardena is way better than this place....the only reason why the bf and i went was cause he wanted to try the special #2 challenge (which he failed only cause they stuffed the bowl with a bunch of jalapenos and filled the huggggeee bowl all the way to the rim)....
