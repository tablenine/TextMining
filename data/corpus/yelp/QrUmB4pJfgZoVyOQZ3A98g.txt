I was extremely impressed with the quality of the food - and as a non-vegan I was particularly impressed with how much I enjoyed everything.. . I felt completely satisfied after dinner.  Originally I was planning to hit a taco joint on my way home - but no way did i want to erase the awesome food we had at Green Zebra.. . I was very pleasantly surprised.  The service was outstanding - This is definitely on my recommended list
