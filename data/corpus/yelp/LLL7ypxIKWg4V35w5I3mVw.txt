Restaurant: Zocalo Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
Came here on a Sunday last summer around 1:30 pm.  Unfortunately the lunch menu is not available at all on Sundays, so we have to pay dinner prices all day on Sunday.. . Ordered the molcajete carmelita for one ($16).  I thought the portion was rather small and expensive, especially because I was still hungry immediately afterward.  The flavoring is okay, but I was disappointed after hearing my friends hype about Zocalo.. . Had I known the prices beforehand, I would have gone to Rosa Mexicano instead for lunch, because Rosa Mexicano serves authentic Mexican food at the same expensive lunch prices (around $16) but in a posh, air-conditioned, and way more elegant setting.. . Also, despite its ultra casual atmosphere, Zocalo only has valet parking.. . I won't be back.  I dislike paying such high prices for average food at a dive.
