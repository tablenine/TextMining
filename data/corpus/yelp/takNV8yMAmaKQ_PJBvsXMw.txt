Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
One of my secrets to happiness is maintaining absurdly low expectations.  That way, I'm always pleasantly surprised when things don't completely suck donkey balls. Despite this knowledge, I couldn't help but get a little excited over my visit to Osteria Mozza. With such high expectations, it's no surprise that I came away from the experience slightly disappointed.. . I am not the kind of person who takes malicious pleasure in nick-picking every detail of a restaurant. True, I am admittedly a miserable and wretched human being 99% of the time, but on the night in question, I was actually in a good mood. Unfortunately, it didn't last long as we waited an eternity to be seated. Yes, I can be a little impatient at times, but after waiting for 45 minutes even the Dalai Lama himself would be screaming "WHAT THE FUCK IS TAKIN' SO LONG?". The hostess should consider herself fortunate that I left my numchucks at home, or else she would be walking into her next audition with a fresh welt on her noggin.. . In fairness, the service was excellent once we got seated, though I was disappointed to see there were no chimichangas on the menu.  Despite this omission, the food we ate was quite good for the most part - nothing transcendental but generally quite tasty. All the same, I'd be lying if I said I'm dying to return to Osteria Mozza.  Sadly, when your dining experience starts off on the wrong foot, nothing that subsequently happens, however positive, will erase that negative first impression - especially considering the prices.  After dropping mad ducats at Osteria Mozza, I have to revert back to my pauper's diet of Top Ramen noodles and the ketchup packets that I hoard from Jack In The Box.
