Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Orochon is pretty good as far as ramen places go.  Their specialty lies not in the ingredients, but rather in the level of spiciness, so if you're up for a challenge this place is for you.  But if you're like me (i.e. a total wuss when it comes to spicy food), the small choice of fixings is a little disappointing.  You can add a small selection of extra ingredients at your leisure (my faves are the bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and the amazingly juicy cha-shu pork), but beware as they are a little over-priced and can add up fast.  Grab a glass (or pitcher) of Kirin on tap to really round out your meal.. . However, as Jon J. already mentioned, this place has a tendency to give you a bad (and I mean BAD) case of the farts.  I only got level six on the spicy scale, and even I was stinking it up all afternoon long.  So either go home alone after eating here, or make sure your company consists of people you're REALLY comfortable with, because at the end of the day you'll be sharing a lot more than your meal.
