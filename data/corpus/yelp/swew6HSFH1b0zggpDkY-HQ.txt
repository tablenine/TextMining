Just a 15min walk from my place. Very reasonably priced for a nice, casual, and unique spot. I've been a couple of times with friends and love it. I'll admit to ordering the same thing both times, a belly dog and apple soda, but hey, it was delicious and on both occasions I tried the food that my friends had ordered as well -so I have some variety! Great place and I'm looking forward to going again.
