Just look at the rating distribution and you know that Porto's is legit.. . Yesterday I ordered my normal media noche sandwich, ham croquetta, and potato ball.  But as I was order, a nice lady came out with a tray of cupcakes... they were featuring red velvet this week!  So of course I have to get one.  The cake was moist, delicious, and not overly sweet.  The frosting was a cream cheese type, a little on the sweet side.  There was also some pink sugar crystals and a red chocolate heart which put the sweetness over the top, so I scraped those off and went back to the cake, which then struck a nice balance.. . Depressing will be the day when I actually get something mediocre here.  But it'll never happen!
