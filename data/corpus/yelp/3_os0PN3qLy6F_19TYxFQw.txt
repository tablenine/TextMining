I've been to Les Deux a few times, most recently about 6 months ago.  . It's a well designed, very Hollywood club with a few areas....outside and 2 or 3 indoor areas.  There have been posses of celebs or sort-of-celebrities (reality show contestants who are famous for a minute etc) and other Hollywood people watching delights.  Girls dress up pretty nicely, people are generally upscale though it also feels like people drive in from far away and dress up for the big night out...some of it is a bit cheesy.   There are also lots of beautiful locals.  . The table service is good, and the random people I've chatted with are usually really cool.  The dance floor can get to be a bit much.  Actually, the whole place can be a bit much.  I can imagine bad experiences with paying $25 to park, getting velvet roped, waiting forever for some rude bartender to serve an overpriced drink....but I've been lucky so far.  Overall I think it's a cool place but I'm a bit over it I guess.  It's probably great if you're single and don't mind that it's spendy and trendy.  I'd take an out of town guest or go to a party, but probably not choose it as my favored destination.
