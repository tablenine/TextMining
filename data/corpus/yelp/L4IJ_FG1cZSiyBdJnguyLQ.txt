Went for a business lunch, after hearing about this place for months. It was crowded when I first got there, and it was the tail end of lunch hour. Didn't have to wait as my colleagues were already there. Got to sample the meatball sandwich and a new addition, some chicken sausage with pasta. Both were really good. If that meatball sandwich was a footlong and maybe 6 inches wider, it might be the greatest meatball sandwich ever. Service was pretty good, and my water was always topped off. Dessert blew me away. Tried the pannacotta, chocolate pot de creme and the profiterole. Profiterole had butterscotch and some sugar stuff on it, and was a hit. Everyone else thought the pannacotta was too plain, but I thought thats what made it awesome. . . This review is for lunch only though. I really want to try dinner. We got to hang out after they closed for the afternoon, and the workers were all eating before dinner opened. The chefs prepared a buffet of chicken for them and that looked better than anything I had for lunch. I'd also like to do the bar there too. Looks like they have a wide menu of specialty cocktails and a bar menu that includes oysters. Definitely a hot spot in downtown Culver.
