Waking up this morning after one of the worst sushi experiences that I have ever encountered in Chicago i felt the need to inform others of the over-priced &amp; poorly presented rolls that Mirai has to offer.. . After recommendations from numerous friends my girlfriends and I decided to give Mirai a shot and steer away from our normal "BYOB" sushi spots.. . Upon sitting down we ordered a bottle of wine which the waiter ever so graciously (meant to be sarcastic) kept filling our glasses so that we were done with the first bottle before we even ORDERED any of our rolls.  When we asked the waiter to suggest some "good" rolls he really didn't seem to have a clear answer.  Upon receiving our meal if you want to call it that, the rolls, which came in about $16 a pop for 6 pieces were very sloppily made and consisted of a SEA of rice.... . At this point both the rice filled rolls and sparse maki selection combined with the absurd prices it was easy to say our dinner was pretty much a wash.  I know this is harsh but the rolls honestly looked like something you could pick up at your local grocery store :(. . There are so MANY great sushi places in Chicago that cost about half as much and serve better quality rolls so forewarning, if you LOVE Maki Rolls this is not the place to go.... . unless you feel like spending about $60 a person on white rice :)
