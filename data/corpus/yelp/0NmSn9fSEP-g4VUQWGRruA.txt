Restaurant: La Parrilla
Category: Mexican
The place is good for the Basic Mexican-American meal (mostly Tex-Mex).  If you are looking for true Mexican or neuvo Latino, then this is not your place.  The service is very efficient, food comes out in mere minutes, and the chips and salsa are good (and replenished often!).  The patio is great for the right weather.
