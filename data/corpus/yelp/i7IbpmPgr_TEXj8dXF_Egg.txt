The Daily Bar and Grill is a pretty good place. I go there quite a bit....mostly for lunch. They have a pretty good menu and the food is pretty tasty and reasonably priced. I always end up going with more than six people and they reserve the big booth in the back for larger parties so we almost never have to wait for a table. But even if we have do, it's usually not long. . . It's a really comfortable place to hang out and the service is decent most times.
