Headed over for a quick dinner last Sunday night, and sat at the bar.  Husband REALLY liked the salsa, since it was very smoky, but I would prefer something a bit brighter and heavier on the tomato and cilantro.  Husband ordered a platter with chicken and beef enchiladas, and they were really good--the meat was quite tender, and the sauces had great flavor.  I ordered a platter with a fried fish taco and some shrimp enchiladas; the former was really crispy and spicy, with a nice cooling slaw on top.  The shrimp enchiladas were just meh, largely because the shrimp were the smaller, cheaper variety.  They charge $4 for a Miller Lite draft, which I think is steep, but this could be a good standby when husband has a craving for Mexican food.
