Restaurant: Icosium Kaf√©
Category: Creperies
Awesome place for great crepes. I met some friends for Sunday brunch and I received very attentive service from multiple staff members. I had the Icosium Crepe that had roasted veggies and the all too important goat cheese among other things. Great flavor combination. Crepe came with a delicious and creamy vegetable soup on the side. I also ordered the Banana Nutella Crepe. It reminded me of the ones I had in France.(If you don't know what Nutella is, then your life is not yet complete.) I really recommend this place for great crepes and good service.
