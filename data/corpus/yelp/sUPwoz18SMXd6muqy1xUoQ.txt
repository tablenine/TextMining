Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This is the best ramen place in town! No other place have I ever tasted mouth watering cha shu pork, well textured noodles, and flavourful soups. I have no cons for this place, except for the occasional long line. However, the food will make you forget about that. As you know, Orochon has different levels of spiciness. 7 being the lowest and 1 being the highest. If you want to go for the challenge, you'll have to go beyond the charts for special spicy level 2. I recommend the miso broth for the ramen. It's a dollar more, but ever so good.
