"It's in the (chocolate) bag...". . We went here last night for our anniversary expecting big things.  We came away full, if not a bit disappointed.. . Decor is great.  Service top notch.  But the food, for the most part, was decidedly mediocre.  . . First off, this place is LOUD.  Granted, it was a Saturday night, but any notion of 'romance' is out the window once you realize this is more of a party/group atmosphere as opposed to a romantic dinner for two.  Mildly annoying considering it was our anniversary, but nothing some good food couldn't overcome.. . First up were mango lobster rolls.  Not bad, but very small and a bit bland.  Wine was good, though expect to pay at least 10 bucks a glass.  Then came the glazed green beans.  These were great and did live up to the hype.  . . For the main course I tried their vaunted and much talked about whole catfish.  Great presentation, but it looked much better than it tasted.  Not bad, but once again, for $32 I expected a 'wow factor' that was absent here.  My wife got the Shrimp Ninety Nine, which was below average...way too much cilantro and paired with these unappetizing and rather crunchy rice cakes.. . For desert we got the infamous Chocolate Bag, which was hands down the best part of the meal.  Mmmm...I'm not a big sweets guy, but you wouldn't have known it the way I scarfed this thing down.  This helped take some of the sting out of the disappointing entrees.. . Overall, not bad per se, but you could do much better.  For $140 I felt that we didn't really get the bang for our buck I would have liked.  Maybe a good place to go with a group for a drink and desserts, but for 'good food' you can do so much better for the price.
