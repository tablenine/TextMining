I am so so excited to have found the best Italian food joint by my apartment and I can't wait to come back for some more.. A friend and I met here for dinner tonight and boy am I glad she suggested this place.. Just walking distance from both of our places, Terroni is the perfect little lunch or dinner spot on Beverly.. We took a seat on their outdoor patio to enjoy the gorgeous weather and for her pup to sit with us.. . We started off our order by ordering a couple of authentic Italian beers (No not Meretti or Peroni).  I can't remember what the name of the beer was but there were only two so it shouldnt be that hard to figure out what I'm talking about.. They also had a large selection of wines to choose from.. . She had a  very typical Italian style pizza.  Very thin crust and not cut into slices!  They had many choices and I definitely plan on coming back to try one of their pieces.  Keep in mind that they are  fairly large so you can order an appetizer and split the pizza.. . I had the spaghetti e limone and let me just say this was the best spaghetti I've ever had.  No Joke!    The lemon made it so fresh and citrusy and added tons of flavor.  I found myself picking through the food just to figure out what exactly is in it so I can attempt to make an exact replica of it at home.. . Perfect place to have a casual dinner on a warm sunny evening!!
