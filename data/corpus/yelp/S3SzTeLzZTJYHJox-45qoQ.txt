Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Love this place.  It's only been about 3-4 times in the past 10 years but I have to say it's the best pastrami sandwich.  For $10, you can split a sandwich.  The fries are crispy.   I feel transported from SoCal to some diner in the midwest or East coast whenever i indulge myself.   YUM!
