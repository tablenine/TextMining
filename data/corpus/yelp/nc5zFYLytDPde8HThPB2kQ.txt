Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
A first class experience from start to finish.  The atmosphere, service, food and drink are nothing short of exceptional.  The history (Beef Bowl, etc) and class of this place ooze through in everything they do here.  . . The best part about the experience is that it is a great value.  Yes, your check for two (with wine) will exceed $100, but unlike steakhouses which charge for everything a la carte, here your salad and (most) sides are included.
