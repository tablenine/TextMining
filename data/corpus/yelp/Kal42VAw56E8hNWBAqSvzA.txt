Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
The Counter is a California franchise that recently opened on Mansell. The concept is this: you are given a "menu," which consists of a notepad on a clipboard. You check off the size of your burger, the type of meat, bun, and toppings you want, and write in how you want it cooked. They have an array of cheeses, gourmet toppings, and recommendations of their favorite combinations. . . The burgers are very good, but you can get in a little trouble with topping slippage. Keep that in mind when you go for that 4th or 5th vegetable. I like mine with grilled onions and roasted chile peppers, but not much else. The sweet potato fries with horseradish mayo are sinful and the milkshakes are hand-spun and high quality. I can't speak for the sandwiches or salads because I don't go to burger joints for sandwiches or salads and I advise you the same. . . All in all, your experience is up to you. The atmosphere is pretty cool (stainless steel fixtures and a portrait of Jake and Elwood Blues behind the bar), the service is good, and they set you up to have the burger of your dreams. The rest is up to you.
