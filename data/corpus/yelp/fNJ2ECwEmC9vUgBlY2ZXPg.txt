Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
I don't know that I would go out of my way to eat at Bossa Nova, but if you happen to be in the West Hollywood area and are looking for a quality meal at an affordable place, I would absolutely check this place out.  I normally order the Bossa Nova sandwich and am always satisfied.  While the inside of the restaurant offers a comfortable environment, I would recommend sitting outside and enjoying the beautiful SoCal weather.
