Restaurant: Oinkster
Category: Burgers
It's like fast food, but it's not. And it's like barbecue, but it's not. Oinkster is definitely a cut above a fast food joint.  But it's not quite a diner.  Anyways, the inside is bright and clean.  You order your food at a counter and pick it up.. . Their special dish is the pulled pork sandwich.  It's pretty good. You need to like meat to enjoy Oinkster. Pulled pork, pastrami, reubens, burgers, that sort of meat and bread thing.. . I don't remember the french fries being great but the photo on yelp makes them look delicious, so I may have to go back and try again.. . I tried a cupcake.  I don't remember much about it. I guess it wasn't memorable, but not repulsive either.. . The more you love meat and garlic, the more you will love Oinkster.  I kind of like meat once in awhile, and kind of like Oinkster once in awhile.
