Great seafood and wines with good service. I would highly recommend this place to all of my friends and family. I had the four course dinner and all of the wine parings were right on. I would have given 5 stars but our reservation was for 9pm on a Friday night and we arrived at 8:45 and didn't get seated until 9:30pm. That was OK with my wife and I, cuz it was date night and we enjoyed the drinks and atmosphere at the bar. Many others were having dinner at the bar but wait to be seated the dinning area if you can.
