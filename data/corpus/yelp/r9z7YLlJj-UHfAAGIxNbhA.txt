Good: . . Mojitos are AWESOME. . Duck empanada and carne asada are very good.. . Bad:. . They took the duck empanada off the menu, and replaced it with a soggy lobster one. Instead of chunks of lobster, it was a mushy cold paste inside of ground of lobster(maybe) and sliced carrots?? YUCK. The carne asada was served cold to me the last 3 times I went. the waitstaff is snooty, and often missing.. . All in all..I would definetely come here for some drinks and a chat over some sexy salsa music..but if your hungry, cross over to Cafe Intermezzo and grab some Gnocchi or some Pie.
