Restaurant: Ru San&#39;s
Category: Sushi Bars
So I get why a sushi buffet would not appeal to everyone.  But come on...it's RuSans!  If you're expecting a 5-star meal, please do not even take up one of the very valuable parking spaces with your Acura, Audi, or Lexus.  Leave those 4 spots for those of us who appreciate what we're getting: decent sushi that won't break the bank.  And who said you had to order from the buffet?  There are 173 pages of menu items you can choose from, including fare for the non-sushi eaters (BTW - why are you at a sushi restaurant if you don't like raw fish and rice??).. . Parking - sparse. Service - inconsistent, but when it's good, it's very good. Food - it's raw fish...aren't you already taking a chance?  Then live with it and enjoy the bargain.  . Music - you can make a game out of guessing what song used to live and breathe behind that techno beat.  Go there often enough and if the radio isn't working, you'll feel like something is missing but you just can't put your finger on it.. Recommendations: Japanese bagel, unagi, rising sun maki, Dr. Zhivago
