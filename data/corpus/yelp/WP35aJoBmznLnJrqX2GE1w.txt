The word Godzilla does not give this roll justice. Great sushi.. . If you are in the mood for some crab rangoon and you've already been to Friendship Chinese, don't do it unless you want less crab and more friedness.. . They lost our reservation and sat us next to other people with our butt's touching the whole time and no FREE cheesecake at the end. What happened to the cheesecake. Disappointment.. . The food was delicious.
