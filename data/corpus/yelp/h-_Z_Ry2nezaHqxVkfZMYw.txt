Restaurant: Parish
Category: Cajun/Creole
This almost completes my tour of the Concentrics restaurants in Atlanta. I still haven't been to Luma. Parish, however, completely stands out from all the others.  It's not modern and slick. It has it's own feel. Maybe it's the historical building it's in, or the eccentricities of its Inman Park location. You know it's unique when they hand you a menu printed on a paper bag! It mixes the "green" and organic craze with fresh eating and shopping.  It's hard to describe; it's kind of a mix between a whole foods, an organic restaurant, and a farmer's market.  It's under cajun/creole in yelp, but I would've categorize it as such. It's a melting pot of New Orleans culture -but it includes fresh pastas, baked goods, and fish.  That doesn't sound cajun to me.  You can come here five times and have a different experience each time and eat something new and fresh each time.  Is it a bakery, a market, a bar, or a nice restaurant? It's all of the above!
