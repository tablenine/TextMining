Two words:  French.  Toast.  . . Holy sweet mother of Xenu!  They do it right--the egg soaks all the way through the bread, the crust is crisp, but they manage to keep the inside moist, but not gooey.  And the toppings, including a bacon infused butterscotch syrup (or something like that), will send you to heaven in a diabetic coma.. . The other dishes I've had--skillet, pancakes, homemade muffins--are good.  But not necessarily worth the 20-45 minute wait you'll face if you show up after 10 AM on a weekend.  On the other hand, you can spend the time basking in the shadow of the monolithic Scientology Center across the street and wondering if They (you know. . .Them) can feel your lack of caffeine based stress.  . . French.  Toast.
