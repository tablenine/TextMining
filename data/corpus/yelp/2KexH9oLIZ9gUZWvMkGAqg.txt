Restaurant: La Crêperie
Category: French
This place is one of my favs.  Warm, cozy atmosphere - romantic for sure, or a close friend and good conversation.  The French onion soup, as expected, is to die for.  Probably the best I've had, even in Paris. The crepes are good, a little dry, but what's inside is always amazing.  And the dessert crepes... wow.  You can't go wrong with these.  Ever.  And there is a courtyard in the back that's great for summer dining. Definitely recommended.
