$47 to feed 4 people on burritos and tacos and tuna melts was way outta hand. 2 spicy pork burritos --- I didn't taste them but my parents weren't that impressed. Tuna melts were --- basically just tuna melts, nothing different that what you'd expect from a tuna melt except no cheese. I found it a little unusually fishy tasting however but my wife liked it just fine. I would never wait 30 minutes for one in the future. I had the spicy chicken taco, the beef taco and the pork taco. Honestly I couldn't tell the difference which one was what. It was dark sitting on a street step and they all tasted the same. Like a taco with chinese chicken salad dressing. By the way, we ordered 2 kim chee quesadillas and they guy never gave them to us. We didn't notice until the end of the meal that they didn't arrive because we were underimpressed with the rest of the meal. For a $2 taco, I would go back but never wait in the line... There was no line when we went.
