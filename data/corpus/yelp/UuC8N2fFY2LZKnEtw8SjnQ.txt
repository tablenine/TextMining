I came here on a cocktail hunt - so I can't speak for the food (yet).. If the cuisine is anything like the drinks, then I cannot wait to give it a go.. Came in and sat myself down at the bar this past summer and got one of their blueberry lemonades.... wellll, its now december and I think its pretty obvious that this place is still on my mind!. I NEED to get back there and check out the winter drink AND try their fare.. Its out of the way for sure (unless you live in the west loop) but do yourself a favor and save yourself the wait at Violet Hour and get yourself over to Jefferson Street.
