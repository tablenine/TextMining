Food is spectacular, always very busy, aquarium glass floor is very fun, the staff is very knowledgable and spend a lot of time with the menu. Â Atmosphere is enjoyable and there is a cheap lot across the street rather than the valet. 4 guests can easily run over 400$ tab. Would go again for the Crab and Garlic Noodles.
