The location of this place is a bit odd. It's not really on a major street and it's right across from the huge scientology building. That aside the food here is fantastic. I had the shiitake, oyster mushroom and feta omelette. The portion is a bit small for the price but it's a very very good omelette. In this case you're paying for quality over quantity.. The atmosphere is very quaint and cozy. We sat outside for breakfast. Their outdoor dining area is very nice as well with plenty of umbrellas keeping you in the shade. . The service was fantastic. The waitress was very nice and made sure to check up on us to see if we needed something else. . I was just visiting LA and found this place through yelp. . Fantastic place. Well worth going here if you live in the area or are just visiting.
