Dear Lord.  . . I love this place! The food is freaking awesome....best Eggs Benedict ever! Pancakes are to die for. The food takes a little bit long to get to the table, but it's no big deal, because sitting at your table talking with friends, sipping coffee from your french press and listening to old blues makes you forget you are in LA.. . Another HUGE plus...there is a parking lot!
