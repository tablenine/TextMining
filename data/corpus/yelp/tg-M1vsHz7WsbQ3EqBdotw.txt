Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
What an uncomfortable night!  How could my good friend call this her K-town fave??    We suffered poor quality korean bbq in a screaming environment billowing with grease smoke. I always eagerly anticipate the tapas-style sides that are normally so delicious  in korean bbq; but here they were uninspired &amp; bland; the meat was unattractively presented &amp; similarly tasteless; and I was stuck smelling like a fast food joint for the rest of the night.   The two stars are for having successfully escaped food poisoning, fast seating &amp; the harried but attentive wait staff that served up the scrummy Hite beer that made the night bearable.
