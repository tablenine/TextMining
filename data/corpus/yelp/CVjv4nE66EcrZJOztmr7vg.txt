Restaurant: Noche
Category: Tapas Bars
Noche opened as a Southwestern bistro with much fanfare, but quiclkly the crowds diminished.  They reconcepted a bit and went tapas.  The reformulation seemed to click, and an emphasis was placed on the bar business which also proved fruitful.  Noche features $1 Dos XX draft beer on Sundays, and the crowds pack in the tiny (claustrophobic) bar area.  the bartenders are characters and the regular customers appreciate their attention.  Rookies may feel a little left out however. The large menu of tapas items includes everything from seafood to salads.  Generally they are average at best, and seem to be kind of rushed out of the kitchen.   The grilled items are overly smoke flavored from too much hickory wood in the fire--which makes them quite bitter tasting.  A pet peeve of mine is that the restuarant serves its  tortilla corn chips in baskets without a paper lining (do these baskets get washed?) Doubtful.  Service here is notoriously whacky, partially because the place gets so overwhelmingly crowded, and partially because some of the servers themselves are a little coo-ccoo for Cocoa Puffs.  If you've been here quite a bit like myself, you know what I mean.  With all it faults, Noche remains a fun place to gather with friends, and a great place to meet new ones.  A quiet date place this ain't.
