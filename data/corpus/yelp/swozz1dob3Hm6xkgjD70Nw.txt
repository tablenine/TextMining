the best ramen ive ever had. the soup is really good, the noodles are prefectly cooked, the pork melts in your mouth, the vegetables in it give it that nice crunch ,gives it good texture. i usually get the combo with chicken teriyaki bowl . the cabbage salad is freaking good and the teriyaki chicken is really good too. they make it a little crispy. and best but not least its inexpensive. the combo with a drink is like $15 and its alot of food. ive never finished everything and i can tear it up when im eating something good. . . cons. parking sucks . its small. you might get lucky and get seated with in 20min but always expect to wait an hour.. its freakin hot in there
