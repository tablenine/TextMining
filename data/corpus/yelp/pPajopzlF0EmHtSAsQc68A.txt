One word: disappointment.. . My expectations of this place were pretty high. The dress code is ultra fancy, its expensive to get in, you have to pay x amount of dollars to become a member...etc.. What most others fail to mention is that this place is for losers. Straight up. The regulars here spend time preying on tourists to watch their lousy magic acts and listen to their lame stories. . I saw 4 acts here and 2 were less than average, 1 was good, and I left 10 minutes into the other one. . The decor is atrocious to say the least. It tries hard, but apparently not hard enough, Its sad when the "haunted mansion" look you were going for is an utter failure. This place just looked cheap.. I guess I had an alright time. I managed to rack up a $100 bar tab to make this place tolerable.
