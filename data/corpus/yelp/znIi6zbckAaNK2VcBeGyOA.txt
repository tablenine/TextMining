F*ing delicious.  . . So I went more of a lunch-y route and chose the chicken sandwich (breast meat) with the fries.  Heaven ensued.  First off, I am pretty sure they give you about 4 giant potatoes worth of fries.  !!!!  The fries!!!  Clearly homemade, and delicious.  Just sprinkle them with a little salt and pepper and you don't even need ketchup, they're that good.  The sandwich came on wheat toast with chopped lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.  Pretty solid sandwich, it seems like something that my grandmother would have made if she was a fried chicken making grandmother (she tended to make polish dishes for us, and clam chowder).  The chicken was a tiny bit dry, but the crispy crust had such a good flavor that it didn't matter.  So good.. . My boy had the same meal as I did, and he gave it a thumbs up as well.  Our friend got the chicken breast/waffle special, and oh man, it looked fabulous.  (That's what I would have gotten if I hadn't wanted a sandwich.)  He also got a side of the smothered potatoes and the gravy was so flavorful without being too salty.  . . Next time I go, I'm definitely getting the waffles.
