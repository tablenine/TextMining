The first time I ate at Mastros it was a religious, carnivore, experience.  The filet mignon was prefect - the plate was hot, the steak was cooked prefectly, the spinach was tasty, the wine was excellent and the chocolate souffle was incredible.  I have been back many times and it is still always great, but something about that first time was "holy".  I know it will happen again...
