Restaurant: Crawfish Shack Seafood
Category: Seafood
Picture two yelpers at the cash register browsing over the menu trying to decide what to order for lunch.  I'm a little hesitant because instead of eating tacos, Sean M. wanted to try Crawfish Shack instead.  Really, crawfish in Atlanta?. . Owner: Do you want to try a sample of our crawfish?. Sean M. and myself: Sure.. Me: Holy crap it's spicy. I know what I am getting for lunch.. . Sean and I end up ordering two 2lbs of crawfish,  a pound of shrimp, an order of hush puppies, an order of red potatoes along with a bottle of Thai iced tea and fresh sugar cane drink with a hint of orange.. . While we were waiting for our food, Sean took a sip of his sugar cane drink.  He made the strangest face.  I honestly thought he didn't like it.  Quite the contrary. He thought it was pretty damn good.  So I tried it.  I liked it so much, I got one to go as we were leaving.  . . Now for the food.  If you can't eat spicy food, DO NOT EAT HERE.  OMG were the crawfish spicy.  My mouth was on fire.  And man were they good.  The crawfish peeled so easily.  The flavor was awesome, and really, really messy. (Wear washable clothing.  Seriously, it's messy.)  The shrimp were huge.  HUGE!  Also spicy, but not quite like the crawfish.  Occasionally, you had to eat a hush puppy or a potato to put out the fire.  Even though I shy away from eating a lot of fried food, the hush puppies were really good and not greasy.  Thumbs up.. . The space is small.  We were lucky and got a table, as there were only three tables in the whole place.  But it was cozy for a Friday lunch which was nice.  I am sure if you want dinner, you would have to go the take out route.. . I am glad Sean suggested eating here.  I think we are going to go back next week and try the fish and maybe more shrimp.  . . Crawfish Shack takes cash, VISA, and MasterCard.
