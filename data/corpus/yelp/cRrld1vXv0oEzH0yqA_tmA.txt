I'm a fan of this place for sure. . . Whiskey+tacos=awesome. . . The only caveat is that I wish the tortillas used in the tacos were maybe a half inch bigger around, to capture the meat better... though it might overwhelm the texture and seasoning so I defer to the expertise of the chef. One of the more amazing things, and so simple in retrospect is the use of pineapple in the al pastor. It just explodes with taste as a result! It should be criminal to offer al pastor without the option of pineapple or possibly mango. Just tiny amounts, dry and chopped... but still. . . The Lamb shoulder is something amazing, it melts and the au jus is superb. I wish they offered a plate of this with rice and beans. . . Ah the bar. Best Old Fashioned I've had outside of Louisville. The proportions are all spot-on. I can't remember the other bourbon cocktails i've had here, but they were damn good too. . . This place wins for me, I just have to remember to order 4 tacos, not 3 next time.
