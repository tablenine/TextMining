Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Went to LA for the weekend and we made it an objective to go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles after watching Snoop Doggs new reality show.  Came on a sunday afternoon and we were expecting a long wait but we put our names down and were seated in less than 20, the hostess was really sweet too.. . The waffles are sooooo delicious and I love the gravy and skin on the chicken (yes, im chinese and I LOVE CHICKEN SKIN).  Shout out to Napolean T for ordering the 1/2 lb of chicken and finishing all of it.  I loved the greens and the corn bread too.  We ordered so much food and took the corn bread home but it was no good the next day.. . If you're going on a road trip to So-Cal, Roscoe's is a must!
