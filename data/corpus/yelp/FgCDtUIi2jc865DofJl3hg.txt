Restaurant: El Tapatio Caf√©
Category: Mexican
I constantly find myself at Tapatio, especially during the summer. The actual restaurant is really small, so we try to sit outside whenever possible. Its one of those places where you want to try something new, but can't b/c you love one particular dish. It's not the best or the most authentic Latin food, but its really good and the drinks are even better! The service is very friendly and attentive.
