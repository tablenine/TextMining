Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Probably the best dumpling place around.  A little pricey for the amount you get (quality vs quantity).  My friend once ate 50 of these in one sitting!. . Gotta go with the crab dumplings as well as the shanghai rice cakes.  . . For dessert, get the red bean dumpling.
