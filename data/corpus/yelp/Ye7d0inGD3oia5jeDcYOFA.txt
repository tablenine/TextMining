I was surprised with previous reviews.  I really really really loved the food here, and my only complaint was that it's hard to get a table.  The other day I stopped by on an off hour and wasn't able to partake due to time constraints.  . . The pizza is more gormet-esque than grease town.  The butterscotch dessert is effing amazing, though they tend to run out.  Salads are fabulous.  And the wine is really lovely.. . Just make a reservation.  Or prepare to eat at the bar.  Or wait a while.  But the food?  Total Deliciousness.
