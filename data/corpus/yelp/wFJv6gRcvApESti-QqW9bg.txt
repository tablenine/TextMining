Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Milk is a cute, small, adorable place to get a quick bite and or sweets to satisfy your sweet tooth cravings. I didn't get to try any of their food but it sure did look tasty when I saw it coming out. But we did order sweets:. . Toffee Coffee Ice Cream. Blue Velvet Cake. Strawberry Shortcake Shake. Tres Leches Cake. Mini Red Velvet Cupcakes. . Which came out to a total of $29.82 - and in my opinion I think is expensive just for some dessert. I like to cook and bake myself and I feel that my cakes come out equally as good as theirs and at a lower cost too.
