I have been to Fraiche a few times and have had consistently tasty meals. First went there on a Saturday and had an excellent chicken dish. At the time there was a chocolate hazelnut dessert that was really tasty. We had a friendly waiter who told us they do a tasting menu during the week nights, so we went back a few weeks later to try it. We were not disappointed. The beet salad was super good, monkfish was cooked to perfection. We also had an olive oil cake which is now ranked as one of my favorite desserts.
