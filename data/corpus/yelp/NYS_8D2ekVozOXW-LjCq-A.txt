Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
I've now been here a couple times, and I have to say for its class of restaurant, it is pretty great. It's cheap, simple Mexican food perfect for the end of a late night.. . I would avoid the breakfast items personally, but the standard food is pretty good, both in flavor and price. They have a salsa bar as well, which is pretty nice, and the salsa is passable.. . Overall, it's nothing out of the ordinary, but it achieves its purpose, and it is definitely better than Taco Bell. I would miss it if it were gone.
