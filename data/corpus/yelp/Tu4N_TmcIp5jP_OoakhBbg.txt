Oh how I love thee Din Tai Fung. The cold winter days are better with a xiao long bao in my tummy. Since it is too late for a JUICY PORK DUMPLING, the only way to satisfy my craving is through a review. Tonight I will dream of one warming my body and making me giggle inside. I love the original location, where one can watch theses beauties being made. The only think that hate about this place is the lines. This weekend me and you, Din Tai Fung, have a gluttonous date. Please let the line be short and brief and the food be savory and enjoyable. YUM YUM YUMMY in my TUMMY!!!
