I'm hear the daikokuya... again. I think this is the 3rd time I'm here in past 2 weeks. Been coming here for several years now and I still can't get enough. My brother had been talking about it for years, but since I don't really eat pork I never bothered with it for years. Finally he brought me with him... Omg! I never knew ramen could taste so good! I took my boyfriend with me the second time and he's totally addicted to it!!! He wants to go there all the time! Some days are better then other days. I wish it could be more consistent but still good every single time. . . Like everyone else has said the place is small and stuffy and you defianly smell like Ramen after you leave, but its still totally worth it! If the line is long just put your name down, walk over to the Yougurtland get a quck pre- dinner dessert snack and walk back and wait. I never get the combo just the daikoku and then yogurtland.
