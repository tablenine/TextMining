Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Came in here for takeout since we're all not hungry, but decided to stay because we're paying for valet anyways. We seiously came in after a lunch at the Petrossian, then Crepes at the farmer's market. We seiously did maybe an hour stroll at the grove and went straight here. The food was soo good that we actually finished the burgers and sides. The fries and onion rings are actually the highlight of this meal for me. I heart fried foods. The fries were triple fired. But, the onion rings... it felt like your eating pork rinds. It was crunchy fried goodness!
