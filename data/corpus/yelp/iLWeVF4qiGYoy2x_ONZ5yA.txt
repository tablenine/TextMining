I'd been sittin' on the railroad, all the live-long day. . . Yep, I had an unfortunate Amtrak experience yesterday.  My brother, who lives in Chicago and often takes the train back and forth, had recently told me Amtrak was doing much better at running on time.  So, I decided to book my trip into the Windy City on the train.  . . Big mistake. The trek ended up taking 2+ hours longer than scheduled.  Since I wasn't about to eat the cardboard discs they call pizza in the dining car, I was about ready to gnaw off my arm by the time I arrived in town. . . Luckily, my friend shuttled my low-blood-sugared-self down to Jerry's. Just what I needed!  I had the Louie A on Tuscan white -- a heaping helping of cheese, roasted peppers, avocado, basil and honey mustard. . . I see some people complaining about the prices, but honestly, you get *two sides* as well, and the little cups of baked beans and mac n cheese hit the spot.  This was plenty of food, but since I hadn't eaten all day, I mowed it all down. . . The decor/environment was cozy.  The gas fireplace was a nice touch on a day of non-stop drizzle. As for service -- maybe it was just because we were there during an off time (I doubt 2-3 p.m. is a standard lunch rush!) -- but our server was fairly attentive and friendly. . . So, I have to give some love to Jerry's. After a meal there, I was happily satisfied and ready to face the rest of the day.
