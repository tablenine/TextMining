Damn, this is the 300th review for Philippe's!  It's definitely an LA institution.. . When looking for a place to eat downtown that was low-key, and unpretentious Philippe is the place for you to go.  I'm not going to have much to add to the other reviews here, but, I will mention the fact that we liked the food so much that we ate there for dinner for the French-dipped sandwich then ate there for breakfast the next day.  . . The sandwich was great, and it was SO good.  Just watch out for the spicy mustard, because they aren't messing around when they say it's SPICY, so use it in moderation.  . . The breakfast menu is ... eh, does its job.  I had the French toast, with eggs, and sausage and it was something like $6.95, plus a whole $0.10 for a cup of coffee.  . . CASH ONLY ... . . Seating is cafeteria-style, and you get to sit wherever you find a spot.  So, either be comfortable with a random stranger sharing a table with you, or make a beeline for the booths for some privacy.
