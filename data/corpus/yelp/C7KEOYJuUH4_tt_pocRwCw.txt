Yum- Restaurant week encouraged a return visit to South CIty Kitchen, this time a completely different experience for dinner.   I sat up on the 2nd floor near the railing, which made for great people and entree watching of the ground floor.  In the dimmer lighting, I noticed the modern and sleek touches of the dining room decor, yet the open kitchen and energetic atmosphere still made the restaurant feel warm and comfortable.  Cheers to the server and bartender for making me an alcoholic "Perfect Pear" libation- requested based on my love affair with the brunch version of the beverage.  (Good thing the food and restaurant was excellent b/c it was the only thing that night that went well!)  Nice touch- I signed my credit card receipt with a Yelp! pen.. . App: Low and Slow Smoked Pork BBQ scallion potato hoecake, house made BBQ sauce, cabbage slaw.  I usually don't like slaw but this was deee-licious and complimented the pounds of pork.  The appetizer is HUGE- enough to share.. . Entree: Buttermilk Fried Chicken sautéed green beans, buttermilk whipped potatoes, bourbon gravy.  I *had* to try the much raved about fried chicken and mashed potatoes, which were perfect, though the green beans were a little overcooked.. . Dessert: Chocolate Chip "Ice Cream Sandwich" bittersweet chocolate ganache.  Cookies were one of the best parts of the meal- soft, chewy and fresh and stood on their own without being made soggy by generic vanilla ice cream.
