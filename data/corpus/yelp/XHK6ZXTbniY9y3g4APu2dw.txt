I've been here so many times I can't believe I forgot to yelp it. Easily one of my go-tos for late night noshing/simple Japanese comfort foods. I order the udon regularly. My usual used to be the vegetable udon, which came with lots of spinach, napa and enoki mushrooms but then I recently tried the beef udon and I'm converting simply because the beef broth yields much more flavor than the former. I also add two pieces of grilled mochi and then I have my comfort in a bowl. Â . . The pork gyoza is also tasty, perfectly fried to a nice crisp on one side, then soft and supple everywhere else -- the dipping sauce has a nice zip of chili oil and ponzu. . . Those two things alone will keep me coming back.
