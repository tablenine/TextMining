If you love garlic, you will love this place. I love the garlic fries, the garlic taureen for your garlic bread rolls. The rabbit is delicious as is the salmon. But the king of the show for me has to be the Prime Rib. I loves me the prime ribey at this place. To die for, and with the huge servings available, you just may. Try it and you'll see. This place might just make a garlic lover outta you.
