Category: Dim Sum
I love coming to Phoenix and I still think it's the best dim sum in Chicago....at least out of all the places I've been to.. . I love the dim sum here and come at least once a month.  I especially like the sweet tofu pudding, the stuffed eggplant, the fried taro dumplings, the chicken feet, and pretty much all of the dumplings.  Yes, I pretty much like it all.. . The only downsides are:. 1. long wait . 2. as dim sum goes, it's expensive.  Don't get me wrong, it's cheap to eat here, but usually dim sum is much cheaper than this.
