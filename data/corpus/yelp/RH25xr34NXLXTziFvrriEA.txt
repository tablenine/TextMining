Super easy takeout option if you live on the west side of town. Delivery to Ukrainian Village is lightning fast, and you can order online, too. . . It's a nice bonus that the quality is pretty consistently decent, but then again, when you realize at 9:30 that your fridge is empty, how picky can you be?
