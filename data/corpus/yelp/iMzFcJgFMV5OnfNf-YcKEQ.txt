Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Mmmmmm!!!!. . I get really excited about Korean BBQ!! and I get even MORE excited when I find a great Korean BBQ restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ over the weekend!  Our group of 4 arrived at around 9:30 pm and were seated immediately...YES!  We were starving!!  The first things you will notice when you enter the restaurant are the friendly staff/hostess.  The booths are nice and spacey- a plus in my book!  And the interior is very clean.  This Korean BBQ restaurant is unique in that it uses charcoal to cook the meat instead of gas- the meat seemed to cook more evenly and the juices stayed more intact with the charcoal.  The staff were all very attentive and would come by often to help grill/cut our meat, re-fill our water glasses and side dishes...Mmmm how I love rice paper! Did I also mention that they bring out enough side dishes to fill up the ENTIRE table?  Excellent service aside, the meat was DELICIOUS!  We ordered Combo A, which serves 4-5 people and comes with a variety of meat with your choice of beverage (we got Soju).  Biting into the meat, you can immediately taste the quality and flavors!  Yum! A party in my mouth.  All 4 of us left fully satisfied and FULL!!  If I ever get that craving for Korean BBQ again, I am definitely heading back here to get my fix!
