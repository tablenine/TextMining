Finally got around to going here for lunch today. They combine two of my great loves. Korean food and things wrapped in tortillas. I chose the chicken and pork tacos and both were great. I liked the combination of sweet and spicy bbq sauce in the pork taco a little better however and highly recommend it.. . I was a little worried because I got my order to go, but everything was still delicious and intact when I got home. The sauce does make it a little messy but the flavors complement each other so well I didn't notice until I was finished that my hands were covered in sauce.. . So if you're looking for something different and nontraditional I highly recommend this place, which is sadly only open for lunch. I get the feeling I will have 2am Korean taco cravings now.
