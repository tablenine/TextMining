I'm not a vegetarian.  But if I were, I would find this place to be close to heaven.  I was lucky enough to be treated to a six-course dinner here that was a feast for the senses.  Vegetarian doesn't have to mean Boca burgers and tofu loaf.  We had exotic tomatoes with mozzarella, sweet corn soup (with leek and mascarpone napoleon), some sort of bleu cheese cake, crispy sweet potato dumplings with dandelion miso, roasted halibut and cornbread, and I believe chocolate chiffon cake.  Service was excellent but the whole meal lasted almost 4 hours!
