I don't know, maybe it's because people are so used to Mammouns or other low-cost falafel that they are noting the 'high' price.  The fact is at Moaz you can get a high quality, delicious, and extremely filling and satisfying falafel for under $6.  The standard falafel comes with 5 large and tasty falafel balls stuffed into a very soft and delicious pita (the pita is much better at moaz than at other spots).  After you receive your falafel you have the choice of over 20 toppings from olives, to pickled tomatoes, to coleslaw, onions, pickles and more.  The wide variety of options and endless amounts of salad bar toppings really makes Moaz unique.  The only reason I wouldn't give this place five stars is that there is only room for two or three people to eat in the restaurant.. . Bottom line = delicious, filling falafel + delicious, all you can eat toppings/salad + about $6 = 4 stars
