I THINK I'M A FAN OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND VIEWS RATHER THAN THEIR FOOD. . . Pros:. -It would have been a 5 if the food was more up to par. But 4 stars because of the view all around!. -When you walk in... no matter how rowdy you and your guest were outside, everything just becomes calm and relaxing (slow paced). . -I'm a light lover so the city was just foots steps away because the restaurant is located at the top of the "mountain/hill". You were able to over look the city as you where dinning (assuming you were having dinner). . -They have an indoor garden/coy pond... beautiful! I can't explain the beauty of it. It's almost like your dinning in the backyard of some oriental garden that's lite by accent lighting and white christmas lights.. -Service was great, very friendly. . -Their drink list seem extensive or at least it seemed like they had more drinks than food.. . Cons:. -Seats were a little too hard. I was a bit uncomfortable the whole night trying to "catch up" with friends.. -I ordered the Crisp roll (aka-shrimp tempura roll). Sadly... it was nothing special. I was really disappointed because the flavors of the roll didn't stand out. Thank goodness for soy sauce and extra wasabi. The calamari wasn't too bad. =). . If you're a sucker for views... you should check this place out!
