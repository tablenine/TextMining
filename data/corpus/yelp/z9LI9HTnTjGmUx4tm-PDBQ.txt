Restaurant: Crustacean
Category: Vietnamese
Crustacean is widely known in L.A. I believe one of the main reasons is due to their location on Rodeo Dr. and the high traffic of celebrities that dine there.. It is always crowded when I come dine here, but it amazes me how busy they are because I don't think their food is food is great. The only dish I like at Crustacean is their garlic noodles. The rest of their other dishes are quite bland and not impressive. . . The decor is elegant and classy so the atmosphere is of fine dining comes into mind. However, I still believe that the quality of food isn't worth the hole in your wallet. . . Overall, I believe the reason why Crustacean is so recognized is due to the high traffic of celebrities and the fact that they are located right in Rodeo Dr.
