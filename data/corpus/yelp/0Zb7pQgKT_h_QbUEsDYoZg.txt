Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Simply put. The ramen is good, the price is just ok. Some of the pricing in here is a bit out there. When I typically go to a ramen house (theres a good one in the SF valley) they give you the ramen inclusive of all the nice additions, ie: egg, ginger, etc. This place however charges for all that. I think they would do better if they didnt nickel and dime you for that stuff.
