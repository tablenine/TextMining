Cheap drinks all the time - like $10 buckets of beer or $5 all you can drink champagne.  Yep, that's awesome and worth a couple stars all by itself.. . I've only eaten the breakfast food and it's pretty good - kinda your standard fare of omelettes, scrambles, etc that's a level above a Denny's....but plus a star because they include turkey sausage as an option.  Food prices are pretty average for this kind of brunch place.. . Parking sucks.. . The servers are good, but the whole system they've got going with the hostess is not even a system at all.  We arrived at a lull in traffic, so were told it would be ~10 mins to seat our party of 4.  No problem, even though I could see about 3 empty 4-tops from the hostess stand.  After about 5 minutes a group of 6 comes in and the hostess is ready to seat them immediately!  Good thing my husband was right by the stand and could remind her we were waiting.  We saw that happen to lots of different people throughout our meal - I guess the hostess has a very short memory?. . I've never hung out in Los Feliz, so I don't know if the Overland Cafe fits in there, but I do know it has a pretty lively crowd on the weekends. I think that's kinda expected when you get a bunch of people in that just want to get drunk for cheap.... . Anyway 4 stars for Overland Cafe.  You should go there.
