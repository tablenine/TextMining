Buyers Remorse Warning: If you don't like fresh healthy food, didn't eat your veggies as a kid and still don't as an adult, a fan of the one dollar McDonald's/Fast Food unknown processed shit of a menu then get out of that long ass line and take your butt to Honey Kettle, Wendy's, In and Out or any of the great restaurants in Culver City(there's so many).. . Me? Whoa! I love me some Tender Greens! It's my favorite salad place of all time. The costs are moderate and the quality is outstanding. The menu consists of hot plates,sandwiches, soups and okay drinks. The food is prepared in front of you as you wait. Though everything seems delicious, my main choice are the big salads. My favorites are the Happy Vegan - $10(tabbouleh, hummus(yummy), pasta pearls, farro wheat, young kale, tender greens); Mediterranean Spinach - $10(cucumber, sans feta cheese,kalamata olives, green peppers,red onion, lemon oregano dressing) and the salad in the raw(vegetables and raw nuts with something called living vinaigrette). Don't let the veggie choices scare you meat lovers cause Tender Greens give you some extra loving (my coworkers love the Cesar salad,Chinese chicken salad and heard the steak was to die for - not my cup of tea but hey there you go - mucho love to ya!). You can sit outside or inside. The interior is warm, inviting and comfortable when there are not too many people(which is almost never).. . Tip: Call or better still order &amp; pay online and go pick up your grub in 20-30mins. Not only do I get my food quick but sometimes It's feels great passing the long winding line like a VIP (never had this experience in daylight, without the slutty night club attire and sans makeup...big yeh!!) Also don't waste your time circling around for parking at the meters outside..there's a free 2 hour parking a few steps away.
