My wife and a friend met at Market last evening(5/20) for dinner and some drinks.  The space is great and the outdoor beer garden is a nice addition to the West Loop area.  My wife and her friend were able to get a table rather quickly in the beer garden.. . My wife ordered one of the pizza's and thought that is was very good.  . . I met up with them later in the evening for a drink and experienced some of the worst service I have ever had.  I was there over 15 minutes before the waiter came to take our drink order, and it was another 20 minutes before the drinks came only to be completely wrong.  I had to go into the bar and have the bartender make new drinks for the table.  The waiter never stopped by the table again and we needed to track him down to get our bill.  We asked for a manager and he took care of the problem which was greatly appreciated.  . . I live in the West Loop and plan to give them another chance this weekend for dinner, but I sure hope they can work out the issues with their service or it may be my last visit.
