Looks like very few people have much to say about this place, and sadly neither do I.  It has a really big outdoors sitting area complete with a fountain, which is pretty nice.  But it doesn't actually extend onto the sidewalk, so there's not much to look at but other diners.  Potential wasted.  Food portions are big, I've been here with friends a couple times and nobody could finish their food.  It's got a bit of Cajun on the menu, but I found the Cajun dishes here worse than the non-Cajun ones, go figure.  That's another potential wasted.  . . While the food isn't bad for what it is, there just isn't anything particularly attractive to draw me back.  Other reviewers were right on--this is a mundane, passable brunch option.  I am giving three stars because I don't remember being noticeably displeased each time I dined there.
