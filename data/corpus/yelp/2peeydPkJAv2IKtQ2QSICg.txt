Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Fried chicken n waffles is like the best pair since PB &amp; jam...or Ren &amp; Stimpy! It's always crowded at any Roscoe's but can you blame them? The food keeps ppl happy and draws in new fans all the time. I don't know a single soul who has a bad thing to say about this place. If you hate crowds, get it to-go. But I like it eat it there so I can get my fill of their hot sauce. Mmm...I could drink that stuff.
