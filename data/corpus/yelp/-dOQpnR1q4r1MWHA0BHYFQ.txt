"Lot of meat" - the moms. . I've been to the one in Chicago, and this is the place which I say every meat-loving person must hit up at least one time in their lives. The Beverly Hills one maintained my positive impressions of this place. I have no negative comments for this restaurant. . . Positives: about 13 different kinds of meat (ranging from filet mignon wrapped in bacon, rib-eye, top sirlion, linguica, rack of lamb, chicken wrapped in bacon, linguica, etc....all with flavor so exuberant I cannot describe the ecstasy with each bite), wonderful side dishes that help cleanse the palate (garlic mashed potatoes, plantains), and cheese rolls as a starter bread. Desserts were all great too: papaya cream with a hint of liquer, flan, chocolate/vanilla gelato, and a passion fruit sorbet...all of which I tried tonight and have my seal of approval. . . Also, the service at this restaurant is impeccable. First, "gauchos" come around with skewers of the aforementioned meats and slice off the quantity you desire. With a simple two-sided card, you determine whether these servers bombard your table or not. Also, the main waiter's service was exemplary, keeping the drinks flowing as well as taking away plates or bringing out fresh sides. Also, having two managers come out and ask how our meal was implies that management cares about the satisfaction of its customers. . . Also, because we went on Father's Day, one of the managers came to us at the end of the meal and gave gift cards for a free future lunch at Fogo. How great is that?! More restaurants should follow Fogo's example. . . Fogo's quality of meat is A+++++. There is a salad bar, but seriously....who comes to Fogo for the salad. If you love meat (13 different kinds folks), you must experience this restaurant and go Fogo de Chao'ing.
