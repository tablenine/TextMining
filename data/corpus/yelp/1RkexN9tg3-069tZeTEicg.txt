Been there a couple of times including the one in Dunwoody. Food's always been exceptional, but service at the Buckhead location was not the best. . . Great ambiance, with live piano music if you sit at the bar. . . The flat breads are "to die for!", and the shrimps stuffed with scallops if my favorite! Overall, great seasonal menu, and at a decent price.
