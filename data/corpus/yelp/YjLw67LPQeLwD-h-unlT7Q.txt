Recently went to Fraiche for my birthday dinner with 4 friends.. . The hostess was horrible! We had reservations, but she was terribly rude anyway. Yuck. Seriously, bad attitudes like that can ruin a night.. . Anyway, after we were seated everything got better. The service was great - no problems at all and our server was very attentive and friendly. Shared some tasty oysters on the half shell with my boyfriend and then Â I had the red snapper with mussels, clams and sunchoke puree in a saffron-based sauce and it was AMAZING. . . My friends' brought in a cupcake and candle for me and there was no fuss or "cake-cutting" charge - which was a relief. It was a great night.
