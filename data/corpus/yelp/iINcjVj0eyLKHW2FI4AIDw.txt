If you like your sushi covered in mayonaise and other crazy sauces then this is the place for you. Never in my life have I seen a sushi place use this much mayo. We ordered 4 rolls that did not have mayo listed as an ingredient on the menu and yet when they came out every single one was COVERED in mayonaise. One of them basically had "seafood salad" from subway (imitation crabmeat and mayo) dumped on top of one of the rolls. Disgusting. . . I understand some people actually like these culinary abominations, but my big gripe is they didn't accurately describe the rolls on the menu. You got mayo no matter what.
