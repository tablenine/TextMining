I am so excited to write my first review and thanks to a friend, I picked an eatery that is easy because all I can do is brag, brag, brag.  It's located in a small strip mall off of Buford Highway south of the CDC.  With regards to the decor, like others have said, it is clean, modern and welcoming.  I was so excited to try their food because I only heard good things about this place.  My friend and I spoiled ourselves with the Bo La Lot (a.k.a W3) and with the Hai San Tay Cam (a.k.a. E7).  I also had the opportunity to enjoy a nice glass of Shiraz. (yes they have their liquor license now I assume).  I absolutely loved the rolls - had so much fun making my own rolls with these stuffed betal leaves, rice vermicelli noodles and fresh herbs.  I also loved the 2 dipping sauces they came with.  The waiter thought we couldn't handle the more 'exotic' dipping sauce...but we came and conquered.  The other dish (E7) was good, but not great.  I don't think I enjoyed this dish as much as the other simply because it really didn't play up to the spices that I really enjoy in Vietnamese dishes; not necessarily because the dish was bad.  In fact, all of the seafood in the claypot was cooked to perfection and they offered generous portions as well.  The waitstaff was extremely friendly and they even remembered my friend dining there once before.  Now that's impressive.  I enjoed my outing and would highly recommend this eatery!
