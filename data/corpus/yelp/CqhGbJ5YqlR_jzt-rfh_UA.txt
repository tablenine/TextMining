Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
How the heck did I miss this place on my previous LA visits? Thanks to Cynthia and my dessert buddy who brought Porto's to my attention. If it wasn't for her love of tres leches, I would have bypassed this Glendale icon. . . On my first solo visit, I was amazed of all the goodies in the display case from baked pastries, to single slice cakes to full blown cakes and tarts. My eyes got bigger and my mouth started salivating with each step closer to the front. . . I explained to the employee that this was my first visit and asked for some favorites. Unfortunately, I had to use some self control or over else I wouldn't be able to see my toes over my tummy! My gazillion caloric choices were: . . tres leches $1.60-creamy and rich . mango mousse $2.50-great texture with a smooth mango taste . red velvet cupcake $1.50-very reasonable and nice frosting . peach empanada $0.80-just the right size for a breakfast snack . . They threw in a complimentary guava cheese roll (usually $0.65) which was the perfect marriage of fruit and dairy. . . I only wish I had an excuse to buy a cake there because they all looked delicious. If you're looking to purchase only a whole cake, you can wait in the "fast pass" line. Also, on the second floor, they have a bunch of children's party supplies. . . As you notice, I only tried out the pastries side of the restaurant. On the left hand side is their cafe where they serve the real food. One of these days I'll try their sandwiches because Cynthia raves about that too. . . Two problems: lines and parking. Aaah, typical when you treat yourself to high quality food. It's worth every minute you have to wait in the queue. . . Great employee service, clean and an ample amount of desserts to choose from. There is no excuse not to stop here when you're in neighborhood.
