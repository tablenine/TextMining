Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
LA Institution:. . Upgrading Johnnie's to 5 stars after my experience last night.  Johnnie's cannot be compared to a Brent's or a Langer's as its more of a 'fast food' pastrami.  Minced, fattier &amp; greaser, and dipped au jus.  Catty corner to the terrible Tito's tacos.. . Eating a whole Johnnie's sandwich is like a night in Vegas.  Feels great when you do it...and a whole lot of pain afterwards...I still feel like I'm about to give birth.  It's a damn good sandwich, and great for hangovers...3.5 - 4 stars.. . But after going last night at 11pm, I saw a whole other side of Johnnie's.  Retro outdoor seating, with dual firepits.  Every walk of life and cross section of LA represented, all harmoniously interacting and waiting for their high caloric creation.  A waitress who had clearly been working there for decades, yet pleasant and confident as ever.   $3.75 tap beers (before getting upsold to the $10 pitcher) of cold Coors.  . . Johnnie's is from a different time, which makes it special, and a West Side landmark.
