I've only actually eaten here once, but the experience was good.  It's a little crowded and since we live in the neighborhood, we almost always get takeout.  Once we ordered out on a Sunday which was my boyfriend's idea and got sick.  I try not to order sushi on Sundays but he really wanted it.  Honestly, I have no idea if the sushi is what made us sick but we both felt it the morning after we ate it.  I gave it a 4 star rating because it's definitely above average.  It's consistent, which is what I want from a place I frequent.
