Restaurant: Yuca&#39;s
Category: Mexican
So I grew up in East LA surrounded by some great Taco trucks and stands. I read great reviews about this place and was thrilled to try this place out. . . The Carnitas taco was okay. The Carne Asada taco was okay. I asked for cheese in my taco and was a bit thrown off to see American Cheese in my taco. Yuck. . . The place was okay. There are not many other great Mexican places near Yucca so I suppose this is why people have fallen in love with this place.
