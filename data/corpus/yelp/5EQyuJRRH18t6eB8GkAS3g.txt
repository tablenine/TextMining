I've been to Rodan twice now (at least from what I remember) and each time has been pretty good. The people are soooooooo pretty, like, eye-rollingly so. My boyfriend likes to go here for the pretty girls, but no one ever really talks to strangers here. It's like the uber-chic cliques from high school, only now they're wearing skinny jeans and ironic plastic 80s sunglasses. Inside. At 11pm.. . All that aside, I like the space, the drinks are made properly, if a touch expensive (but that's the area, so I can't really complain) and the MUSIC rocks! The night we were there, they were playing some mix with all of my favorite music! I realize I have niche taste, and it's just plain awful to many other people out there, but you know all that bad R&amp;B and rap/hip hop from around 1991? That is MY GROOVE, and they were playing it! I was absolutely dancing in my seat. . . So, as a tipsy stop in a full night of bar hopping, i like this place.
