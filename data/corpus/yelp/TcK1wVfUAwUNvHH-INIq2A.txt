I don't mind that they have plastic on the tables. The margaritas are good, the chips and homemade salsa are good. The service is good, server's are attentive and the environment is pleasant. Boys and girls if you've ever had the lobster tacos, you would have thought that you were in heaven. I usually do not gush over a dish but this one will keep me coming back. If there was linen on the table or a valet outside there would be a fifth star awarded.. . My lovely friend took me back for another meal. It merely confirmed that the lobster tacos are outstanding. I was also introduced to the cheese dip that is obviously illegal in a dozen States because it's too damn good. I'm convinced that there is crack in that dip.
