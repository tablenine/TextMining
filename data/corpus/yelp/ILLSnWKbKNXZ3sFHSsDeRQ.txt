Definitely overrated in Zagat review...  I gave it 4 stars for being one of those rare French/Japanese cuisine, and chef Akira is a good chef.  No doubt.   . . I happen to be that unlucky guy who got not so good waitress... (one reason I took away a star) I ordered free range chicken dish because it was my first time, and I wanted to try something simple.  The waitress questioned my order and said I was being too typical...   . . Anyways, if you can take some bread home, then do so.  The bread is awesome.
