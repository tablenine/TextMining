I really enjoyed my experience at Osteria Mozza.  First of all, I lucked into a coworkers primetime reservations when she had to cancel last minute.  When we got there, we were immediately seated and though I did not adore the waiter, he was attentive enough and sent the sommelier right over.. . The food was good, but not as spectacular as I expected.  We shared the following items:. . Burata with bacon which was  very good albeit not incredibly out of the ordinary. . Fresh Ricotta and Egg Ravioli-- lovely presentation and a unique idea. It was a little rich yet bland to be a favorite- I think I need a little more kick but was definately perfectly made pasta and a neat flavor combination.  . . Beef Brasato-- very tender and good flavor.. . We planned on getting more but were too full.  I disagree with those who thought this place was too expensive for not enough food- Our bill was only 100 dollars for two people with wine and I was stuffed.
