Restaurant: Hae Woon Dae BBQ
Category: Korean
As far as Korean BBQ goes, this is the standard place in the Atlanta Metro area.  The food is good quality, the place is open pretty late, and there is always a steady flow of clientele in there (always a good sign).  I get more and more of a sense that this is one of the most popular in Atlanta. Until i find a better one, this is the place i take first timers to experience good Korean BBQ.
