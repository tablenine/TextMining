I was really looking forward to eating here, and was really let down. The food was just straight up boring. I tried 6 tapas, and none of them were above average. The chicken dish was cold and bland, the cheese plate was unexceptional, the lamb was prepared poorly. The only thing they have going for them is the free corkage. . . I'm not a super picky person, but I would NOT recommend this to a friend. Try somewhere else.
