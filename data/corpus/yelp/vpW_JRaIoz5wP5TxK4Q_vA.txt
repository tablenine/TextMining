i can honestly tell you that the meats here are delicious!! they are not like the other brazilian bbq places where they give you the crappy meat first and by the time you are full, they bring in the good stuff.  they are very attentive at this restaurant, so you will feel like a king/queen there.  although the salad bar does not have too many choices, you are there for the meat anyways.. so who cares..b/c i have been places where the salad bar is full of choices and you will be super full by the time you get to eat any meat..but anyways, you might have thought you been to every brazilian bbq..but you haven't until you come to fogo de chao.. :)
