I got to hang out at the Steamhouse this afternoon with a friend.  Very fun, funky place with good seafood and great drinks.  We started downstairs where I had a cocktail and the shrimp/scallop quesadilla, which I quite enjoyed, and then headed upstairs.  The downstairs is non-smoking and has a small dining area, with what looked like an outdoor patio no one was using, while the upstairs has a bar with a smoking area and a nice, large deck area that overlooks the northern part of downtown.  Fun, unpretentious, homey.  I quite enjoyed my time there this afternoon, and would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good down-home watering hole with some tasty seafood.
