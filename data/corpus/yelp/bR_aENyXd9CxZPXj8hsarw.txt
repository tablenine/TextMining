Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
As far as I can recall, I think this is the original Versailles, they used to have celeb. picture with autograph all over the wall.. Minus one star for limited parking space for lunch, but I think they have valet for dinner. I usually go to their manhattan beach branch, but try to avoid the west LA one if possible.. Recommend #6 the garlic chicken, you can get the lunch portion during weekdays, but I always go for the dinner portion, eat the breast, rice and half of the fired banana and black bean soup. Take the rest home along with an extra order of rice for another meal. yum yum =)
