My friend recommended this place as one of the must-try's.  I was going to be in the area that night, so I decided to try it.. . I'm sure it was probably really good ramen, although I didn't get a chance to try it - my boyfriend practically inhaled it! (Thanks!). . So I probably picked a really bad day to go thus putting me in a bad mood, so I'll probably edit this later and bump it up a star the next time I go back to J-Town.  It was the day of the Prop 8 protests and all the streets were closed and I had to drive around for at least an extra 30 minutes (after an hour in traffic coming from Walnut). You have to park across the street at the mall's (or plaza's) lower-level parking.. . It was a pretty hot day, so I was hoping for air conditioning. Walked in on a Saturday around almost 2ish and had to wait 30 minutes.  When we finally got notified they asked us if booth was okay. I was starving, so I said yes, absolutely!  Bad idea - we sat right in front of the giant boiling pot of soup.  It just wasn't my day.. . So instead of being smart and ordering delicious ramen like my boyfriend and my other friends recommended, I went with the hot weather and ordered a nice, sashimi-style tuna rice bowl.  Tuna was absolutely fresh, but it was just a really big bowl of rice and tuna on top. Nothing special.. . If I'm ever in J-town again, I'll consider coming back here to try the delicious ramen my boyfriend inhaled. (Thanks again for not letting me try it, buddy.). . Only if there's no protests/rallies, it's cold out, and I get a table next time.
