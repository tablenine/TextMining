It's weird how stuffy and demanding the protocol is here re:drink recipes, substitutions, etc. I mean, it's a bar in a mall. At least it's sort of incongruous to how easy-going the staff is. . . My martini was great, and I really wanted to give this place more stars but I think I'm entering an era of post-gastropub introspection.
