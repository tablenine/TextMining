Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
I can think of nothing better than a cup of tea and a good book on a cold winter night inside the Bourgeois Pig. The warm, home-like feel of the place makes me feel physically and mentally a lot better than when I came in. I think the thermostat is adjusted for winter to make this possible, as its a little warmer and a little more comfortable than any other place I can think of.. . Yes, it gets crowded during Depaul study time and the odd hours when regulars seemingly drop in en masse. But seriously, the old Victorian home surroundings, masssive coffee and tea selections, and absolutely fantastic salads and desserts make this place THE complete coffee shop experience. It is everything Starbuck's aspires and fails to be, authentic, charming, and warm.. . The music selection is a solid classic rock and slow indie pop repetoire which always goes well with whatever book, magazine, or crossword puzzle I am focusing on. At the same time, this is my go-to first date location, and probably is for many others.. . Can't say enough good about the place, its the coffee shop I measure all others against in Chicago
