Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I've seen the commercials on ch 4 late at night thinking to myself that actually looks good not to mention the jingle is catchy. One day my friend asks if I ever ate there I said I hadn't so that same night we made the trip out there. It was pretty packed and the food was pretty bomb there were 3 of us and we all got four tacos to the dome not to mention they threw in a huge side of chips and salsa. I think the best thing about titos is the tacos I've tried the burrittos on other occasions and would rather stick to the tacos they use real cheese and don't skimp on the portions. The only thing i don't like about going to titos is leaving and driving by the taco stand directly next door it's so sad and lonely there I might have to try that one day!!! Meh!!!
