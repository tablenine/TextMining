WHAT Y'ALL HAVE?!!? That's what is shouted to you as you hastily place your order so that the cashiers shut up. But I guess Â in my mind that kinda made it fun and made the line move a lot faster. The food is obviously American, like hamburgers, fries etc. But for some reason, Varsity just seems to put the yum in yummy. I ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings and it was pretty darn tasty. There is so much to choose from and really anything you order won't go wrong. I loved the place so much I bought a tee shirt and wear it to remember that delicious party that par took in my mouth!
