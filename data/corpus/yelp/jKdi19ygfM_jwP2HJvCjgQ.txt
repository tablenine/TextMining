Restaurant: Ru San&#39;s
Category: Sushi Bars
My review of this RuSan's is a study in social abuse. . . You know the kind, you find a cool bar/restaurant...have fun, return, have more fun, return even more fun... the laughs never seem to end, you pick up Tech girls, have one on each side, one feeding you drinks, the other feeding you sushi....yadda, yadda, ya.. . Then the thrill is gone. You look down at was once decent rolls and see rolled slop. The cries for "saki bombs" seem like the chant of the unknowing.. The thrill is gone.. . You try it again. But you get there sorta late, and hey, your mate Â gets sick all over the side of your shiny rice burner.. . "We won't be fooled again." Still hope for the Buckhead location...its clientle's is a bit more shiny so their product has to be a bit more up to snuff.. . Better yet ditch the has been sushi house and rediscover "taking a chance."
