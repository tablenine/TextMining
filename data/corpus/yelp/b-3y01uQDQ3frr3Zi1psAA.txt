Having been going here for quite some time.  Always the same consistent service and food.  Great for groups, and the chips/salsa are free!. . This is a nice mix of traditional and nouveau Mexican food.  I have had most of the seafood and meat dishes, and each are good in their own right.  This is quite a large place and it can get busy and crowded, but usually a fun crowd, esp at the bar.  I also like to bring out-of-towners here because they always seem to love it
