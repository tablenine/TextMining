Restaurant: Hae Woon Dae BBQ
Category: Korean
Hae Woon Dae wins for best tasting galbi but most expensive galbi, too - I hate that it's so dang pricey: $22.95 for one order of galbi! Their bulgogi &amp; daeji bulgogi are more expensive compared to other places, too ($18.95!).. . We had about 20 people last Friday, and majority of the party was eating Korean food for the first time. It's interesting that almost the entire right side of the restaurant was all non-Korean customers. I guess b/c this section gives first-timers a more authentic experience: sitting on the floor (with pillows available for comfort) where the tables are low to the ground. Plus no shoes allowed either - leave them on the centralized shoe rack ... so ladies, maybe keep your expensive pair of heels at home to avoid paranoia that someone else may walk home with your shoes. Another note - even though there's a vent system above each BBQ grill, there is still smoke everywhere and your clothes will reek like galbi even after you leave this place. . . Forgetting price, the galbi really was delicious here. Bulgogi &amp; daeji bulgogi were pretty good, too. Banchan selection (side dishes) just average. But in this economy, money does matter - so if getting the best value is more your thing, you might want to go somewhere like Cho-Won Buffet instead.. . Lunch prices though are very fair here - most selections are $6.95. Came last week - Galbi Jim was ok, the Bi Bim Bap was great. Lunch comes with 6 banchan.
