Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
The spicy ramen here is tasty but people really come here more for the novelty of spicy ramen.  They don't serve a tonkatsu ramen here so you really can't compare it to Daikokuya.  They have miso, soy and salt.  It's basically just really salty and spicy and you can ask them to make it even unhealthier by adding ramen and fatty chinese pork.  I can see how you could love this place if you're korean because of the spicy ramen.
