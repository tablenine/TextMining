Restaurant: Top Spice Thai &amp; Malaysian Cuisine
Category: Thai
I'm a huge fan of Thai food.  Two of my favorites in the Atlanta area being Harry and Sons and Surin of Thailand (in Highlands).  So I decided to try Top Spice.. . The atmosphere was very comfortable and clean.  Our server was ok, he offered no recommendations but simply pointed to the menu.  He asked what I wanted for spice level 1-8.  I like it hot, so I said 7; however when it came it was mild at best.  We also had the Tofu, and that was undercooked and mushy.  I found that strange since some of their 'specialities' where vegetarian.  The food itself was good, but not spectacular.  Overall a nice Thai restaurant, I'd give a 3.5
