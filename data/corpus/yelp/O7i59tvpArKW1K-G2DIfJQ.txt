I was here last night with my friend for a birthday dinner since I can't join in on the festivities on Saturday.. . Okay, I'm not sure what the whole hype about this place is and why I had to stand out there for 45 minutes just to get seated for mediocre ramen.  I mean, I'm giving it 3 starts because of their superb service and high energy.  The guys who work there must REALLY LOVE WORKING THERE!  . . So, onward with the food review:. . - Spicy Tuna Rolls: ***** Delicious! You've got to order one of these!. - Ramen: *** It was OK.  The texture was fine.  Not enough ingredients. I love onions, sprouts, bamboo shoots, etc. But I want more! Only 2 pork slices? I've had ramen where they gave me 4-6 slices, elsewhere.  The portion was too much. I got full so fast and I still had almost 1/2 left over.. . So.... if you want to wait in line for 45 minutes - 1 hour, go give it a try.  If not, go somewhere else. Ramen is ramen. I think I cook better, though. :)
