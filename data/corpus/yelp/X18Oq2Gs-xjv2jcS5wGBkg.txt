Being a burger addict (my doc tells me I have low iron that would explain my craving for beef), this place is as good as it gets.. . The burgers and fries and a beer on tap and you're in heaven.. . The burgers are juicy, cooked to your liking, and have an umami taste to it. It also comes with spinach instead of lettuce which is adds a cool new twist.. . The fries are curly and crispy. . and they have tons of beers there...get anyting on tap and you're good to go. . the only knock I have on this place is when I went on a Sat night it was fast-casual service, meaning I had to stand in line and order everything at the bar. Â Not sure if it's like this everytime though.
