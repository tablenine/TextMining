The makis were good and very colorful presentation.  A bit pricey however for what you get, and we went for half price during lunch.. . The fried oysters however were very good.  I am still a bit confused that they served it with ketchup, of all things!. . And my friends ordered these chicken skewers for an appetizer.  From the feedback (I did not have one), they were under impressed by it.. . We did see another table get a huge plate of sushi (almost the same as our, but for two people...I guess they were THAT hungry...lol
