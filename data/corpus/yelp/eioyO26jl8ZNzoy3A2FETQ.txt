Basically, this pizza is effin huge. I split a slice...with a boy...and we were full. Toppings are made to order and they will basically lay pepperoni over every inch of your giant slice for $1.25 extra ($3 for plain). I have no idea how they deliver or even package the jumbo PIE but one day I will sure find out when I have like 20 people over. If you want gourmet, quality pizza - go somewhere else. But if you're just craving a cheap, huge, slice - definitely go here.
