My boyfriend and I decided to go to Flip this afternoon for lunch. I have never been there before and have been super excited to try in out.  We got there around 3:15pm and went inside.  The bartender said he wasn't sure if they were still seating tables as they close at 3pm.  We both work in the restaurant industry and said it was no big deal, we would come back another day.  We were out in the parking lot trying to decide where we would now go for lunch when the manager Dwayne came out and asked us to come back in and have lunch.   We went back inside and Jeff was our server.  We both decided on the lunch special-  cheese burger or turkey burger, fries, and choice of milkshake.  We both got the turkey burger, a nutella/burnt marshmallow and pumpkin milkshake.  The food was beautiful and delicious.  Overall we had an amazing lunch and great service.  I can't wait to go back for dinner in the near future!
