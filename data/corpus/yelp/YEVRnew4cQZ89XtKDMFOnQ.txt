Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
Hands down my favorite bar in Atlanta.  This place has a large selection of various beers (upstairs is all belgian) and the food is really good for a pub.  I love the atmosphere - it's popular but not pretentious and trendy.  The prices are good, and even when crowded, you don't feel claustrophobic inside.  The wait staff is very knowledgeable when it comes to beers.  . . Try the tomato mantrachet.  It's basically marinara topped with goat cheese, along with some toasted bagette slices to slop it all up.  A nice alternative to fries if you're looking to soak up the beer you'll be drinking.
