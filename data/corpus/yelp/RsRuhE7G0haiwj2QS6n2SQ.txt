Restaurant: Las Palmeras
Category: Cuban
What bumps up my rating for Las Palmeras is the cute, neighborhood location and the service. Tucked away on Fifth Street in the middle of the historic homes, Las Palmeras seduces hungry visitors with its unassuming porch, adorned with strings of lights, as well as the smell of drool-inducing Cuban food. I've never sat inside, as the patio offers comfortable chairs and lots of people- and dog-watching. The service always is friendly, although my favorite waitress thus far has been Maria, who took care of my friends and me last night. . . Yesterday evening, I ordered the super Cuban sandwich--probably my least favorite Cuban sandwich I've ever had, but still digestible, topped with a thin layer of sliced pork and a triple-sized layer of shredded lettuce, along with tomato and mildly hot sauce. I prefer for my Cubans to have a thick layer of hot pork, an equally thick layer of melting, piping cheese, and pickle and mustard that are noticeable to my taste buds (like at Papi's).. . I've also had the ropa vieja--which I remember being delicious, rising above the otherwise mediocre fare. The milkshakes are lovely, though; I've slurped the mango and tamarind flavors. Oh, and the flat, buttery, toasted bread that comes in a basket with every meal is pretty addictive.. . In summary, the food is lackluster, the atmosphere is way chill and the service is charming.
