My favorite part is not sitting on the patio or the amazing service, its the music selection. I love that Led Zeppelin is always on in the background. My favorite dish is the VEAL WIENER SCHNITZEL, it was perfect. My mom ordered the veal chop and friend ordered the lamb. The food was cooked to perfection and the flavors were mouth watering. Â . . The servers are attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. I did have a great night as always.
