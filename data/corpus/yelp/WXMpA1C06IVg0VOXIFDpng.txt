Great things: The beer + cheese soup, the fish + chips, and of course the tots!. . Not so great things: Last time I went here (about a month ago) I was sick from food poisoning all night after eating a burger here (but I can't be sure that it was from the burger).  Also, a few years ago, they had a waitress with really long hair and she would inadvertantly dip the ends of her hair into people's drinks.  She's gone now, so you should be safe.
