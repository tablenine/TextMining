Restaurant: Ian&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
This is the perfect late-night, after-hours, walking-home-from-the-bars-or-a-game-with-a-group pizza place.  . . There are tons of choices, large portions, you can easily pay per person, and free water for the taking.  . . The pizza is decent and unique enough that I, sometimes, crave Ian's when it's not 1am on a Saturday morning.
