ive been here twice now and its really a beautiful restaurant. one of the best looking ive been too. i saw 4 stars for the food and an extra for the ambience. the first time, i went with my girls i would have gave it a 4 and now im giving it a 5! my boyfriend and i went for his birthday and everything was perfect, the service, the crab, the garlic noodles, 2 free deserts, and OMG the mussel appetizer! i almost died! best mussels ive ever had in my life. i couldnt get over it and i wouldnt stop talking about it with my boyfriend the entire dinner. haha. i wanted to morph or turn invisible like the secret world of alex mack and go to the kitchen and consume as much mussels as i can. it was not overcooked nor rubbery, just perfect! the service was wonderful as well.
