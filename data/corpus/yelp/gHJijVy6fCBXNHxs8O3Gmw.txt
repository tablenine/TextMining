Trying to get to the restaurant is a task in itself...I honestly wondered to myself if I would make it back down that hill alive.  . . Unless you're Fergie, you ain't getting a decent table within 10 feet of a window for that spectacular view.  And even if you do get a decent table, which we did, but alas, no window even though we had a birthday reservation 2 months in advance, you're probably rubbing elbows with the table next to you...and not in the good way.  The tables are ridiculously close to each other, I think I was eating the table to our left's food.  . . Not that that would have been a treat or anything, food is mediocre; sushi was Kabuki status MAYBE....yet at thrice the price.  Our table had an array of food, from fillet Mignon to CA rolls, all were "meh".  . For being in HollyWierd, you would think their valet would be more efficient...think again.  We had enough time to spy on Dave Navarro taking pictures with a girl that can only be described as violently blonde.
