Very good pizza.  What else is there to say, really?  It's not new york style, so if that's what you're expecting you may be surprised (though probably not disappointed).  It's actually pretty close to pizza in Naples, which is damn good for Atlanta.  The crust is excellent and the toppings vary from standard to creative.  My personal favorites are the Toscana and the Pancetta e Cipolla.  They have a pretty decent, reasonably priced wine list.  I've never tried the desserts because I can't stop eating the pizza.  The service has always been good.
