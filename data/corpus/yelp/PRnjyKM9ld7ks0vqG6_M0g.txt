Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I tried this place after someone recommending the other location in the west loop. I just happened to check their website to see what time they closed and realized there was a location on division, I am really glad I did. Not to say the location on Madison is bad, but it's more of a subway, walk in, get your meal, and leave, also no beer. This location has a great dining room and a decent sized patio for warm weather. We happened to sit inside when we were there and had an excellent server. Like other people have said the menu is huge, but it also allows you to find exactly what you want. No need to say can you leave this off, or can I get it with this. The beer selection is great and they also have quite a few specials that they seem to change daily. . . If you are looking for a good place to eat out and want something a little different, I would definitely recommend this place. You can have a great sandwich, a couple of beers and then head out to one of the other many places to hit in the neighborhood. Jerry really knows what he is doing.
