Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm one of those assholes that drives by and sees that Disneyland line and yells out my window "It's just a HOT DOG!!!" Yeah, sorry about that. Â Been there a couple times, never when the line is really ridiculous though. One time I was there, Andy Dick was force feeding a hot dog to a customer in line. Sick. The fries and hot dogs are good, I'll give them that. But I would much rather have a bacon-wrapped hot dog from the carts near the Santee Alleys downtown than stand in an endless line for a wiener named after Rosie O'Donnell.
