Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
During our lean economic times, I would eat beans and rice Mon to Fri just to indulge myself at Hungry Cat on Saturday. I love sitting at the bar, preferably en route to getting drunk and accompanied by a drunk companion, while watching the staff summon spirits to help guide their food magic. The cocktails made with freshly muddled or squeezed fruit and the salads never seem to disappoint.
