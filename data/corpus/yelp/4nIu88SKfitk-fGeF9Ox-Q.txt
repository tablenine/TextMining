Another good, but not great restaurant in Chicago.  The decor is cool and the food is displayed nicely, but the meats were very fatty and lots of butter was used.  The wait staff was very friendly and informative, and they did have a nice wine selection, but I that's not enough for me.  I don't think I will be back anytime soon.
