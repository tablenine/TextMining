I really enjoyed going here, but be prepared for a pricey meal.  Yellowtail with jalapeno is excellent, along with the spicy tuna on crispy rice and black cod.  Kobe burgers were soft, squishy and super yummy - you can tell they are very careful not to overwork the meat when mixing and forming the burgers.  Skip dessert - the chocolate cake concoction is the worst molten cake I've ever had.
