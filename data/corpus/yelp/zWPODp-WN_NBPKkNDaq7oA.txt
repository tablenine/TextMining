Good but not Great.  . To me this is not worth the cost. The crab is not the freshest available. The seasoning was delicious but the crab was not that fresh.  It had a very slight fishy odor/taste that you would hope to avoid at a cost of $45 per crab (cracked not de-shelled) The garlic noodles ($10 extra) were tasty but under seasoned and average.  $45 for the lobster salad (although it was good) seemed excessive.  The most disappointing aspect was the Hostess.  She seemed inexperienced and unaccommodating for such a restaurant.  The restaurant was beautiful but if you go make sure to sit on the ground floor, near the in-floor aquarium.  For 2 people, about $250 said and done.  I don't mind paying that much for dinner but this was not a meal of that standard.  The drinks and dessert were great and the other staff and ambiance were entertaining.  . Once was enough for me.
