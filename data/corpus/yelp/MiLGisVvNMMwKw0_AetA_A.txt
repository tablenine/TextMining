there's quite a long wait on a monday afternoon at this place. we waited about 20 mins for 3 ppl and ended sitting at the counter. wat a big big mistake. i warn you! yes...if you're a weaksauce like me, don't sit at the counter! i had my lesson. i guess that place is too small, and it's always packed, ac is not strong enough, and when you sit by the counter, you'll just get steamed by the pot of hot soup boiling infront of you, or get smoked by the grill. it gets even hotter when you start slurping on ur ramen. we were all busy wiping our sweat while everyone else sitting in the back was enjoying their food peacefully. if you're one of those that needs to be comfortably seated in order to eat, wait for the big tables or don't eat there.. . food wise, there are not that many options to choose from as for ramen. i think 4 kinds total, but with lots of other options like bento box, rice bowls, appetizers and drinks. i ordered the daikokuya ramen with shredded pork rice bowl combo. the ramen was good, tastes authentic and fresh, but not superb. i like the rice bowl more, it's diced grilled pork with a sweet sauce over rice. it tastes even better with the fresh green onion and pickled ginger. . . btw, i forgot to add that the egg that came with the ramen was great. cooked and marinated perfectly, esp the yolk. . . environment + parking = -1 star. food = 4 stars
