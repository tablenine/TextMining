I don't know what's the big deal about this place.  The sushi is nothing fabulous and the lounge area is nice but nothing special.  I don't think it's a really trendy place but it is a great date place.. . My friends and I sat upstairs and it's a cute area and very dark.  I think I was turned off because our waitress wasn't very nice and she seemed annoyed with us when we asked for things like extra ginger.  I don't know what her problem was but she wasn't the happiest camper.  . . We ordered the typical rolls (negi hamachi, salmon maki, etc) and my friend mentioned that their sashimi is very good but unfortunately I am not a big fan of sashimi.  I need rice.  The rolls were small and not anything great.  I would have been much happier going to Rise or Oysy.. . The drinks are very expensive and not strong.  Ugh.  We got some mojitos and they were tasty but not strong enough.  I even asked the waitress to get the bartender to make it stronger but that obviously didn't happen.  . . It's also annoying that there's one private bathroom.  I would expect that there would be at least 2 stalls but maybe it's normal to have single stalls?  I don't know.  . . I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.
