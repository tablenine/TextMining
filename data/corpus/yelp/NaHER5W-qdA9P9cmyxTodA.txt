Restaurant: Pasta Da Pulcinella
Category: Italian
This was by far the best restaurant I ate at during my visit to Atlanta. I ordered the tortelli di mele (ravioli with apples, sausage, and parmigiano), which was delicious. I am pretty picky about Italian food because I studied abroad there in college, but I have to say that the ravioli here was great. The combination of apples and sausage in the brown butter sauce works really well and the consistency of the pasta shell tasted just right. The tiramisu was good, but a little too sweet (maybe a little more espresso and less mascarpone next time). I liked the ambiance of the restaurant - it had a nice and cozy feel. All of the servers were very friendly (thanks Dane!) and one even helped me find my way to the metro station. Â I would definitely come back to this place if I ever find myself in Atlanta again.
