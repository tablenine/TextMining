Wow, can't believe this place gets even avg reviews!  . . I love thai food, and this place is the pits IMO. . 1.  Settled for the pad thai.  Horrible.  Chicken did not taste fresh and I found the noodles bland and found myself dipping everything into the sauce to cover the taste.  Not good.. . 2.  Waiter had no clue when I asked him about menu options.  My fav dish, kai kra prow which is a sliced chicken breast sauteed w/ onion, basil leaves &amp; chili peppers.... also known as basil chicken or "thai style" chicken or kai kra prow - for you Duck Walk workers who don't have a clue . . 3.  Aside from that service was hurried / unfriendly. . Gotta find a better option close to me in lakeview :)
