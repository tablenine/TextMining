Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
I usually dislike chain restaurants, for high prices on packaged/canned food, however CF is a slight exception.  I didn't want to like it, at first but it has grown on me for its food choices and bread and butter refills.  And it's not that I have been to many Cheesecake Factory Restaurants; it's that I have eaten at 1 or 2 of the stores many, many times.  Tonight, I expanded my repertoire.. . The Chicago CF is on the bottom floor of the John Hancock building.  The color palette is the same as every other CF, but the décor is different.  There is a sexual vibe to it as my CF partner-in-crime/good friend said.  The women's bathroom is especially interesting with ornate door handles and beautiful doors.  Check out the ceiling too.  It looks like rows of dough rising.  . . The food is typical CF-fare with good-sized portions.  I had what seems to be a new addition to the menu: the vegetable chop salad.  I asked for the pomegranate vinaigrette dressing on the side so the salad was fresh and crisp with a lot of 'stuff': beets, tomatoes, cucumbers, edamame, apples, white cheddar.  I added the grilled chicken too.  The salad dressing on the side was a little strange; the salad is mixed with a pom glaze and then a honey-ish, sesame-ish dressing is added.  Since it's fairly involved, ordering it on the side was weird. Overall, the salad was yummy! . . Sidenote: The wait for a table was long, but that is the same at any CF.
