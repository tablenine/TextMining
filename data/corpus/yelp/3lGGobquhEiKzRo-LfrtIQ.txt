I love this place.  The twins who own the place are sweet as pie and insist that everyone who works there looks out for the customer.   Barbie, the fun waitress who has a nice rack and an even sweeter personality, is always silly and attentive.  The food is ok, but the real reason you come here is for the people and setting.  And then there is wade, the awesome bartender who is fun, cute, and always is the cure for the I need a fun night out with my friends.
