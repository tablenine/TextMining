Came here with my girlfriend on Thursday night, and we ordered:. . 1. Pad-se-ew. 2. Trout with mango. 3. Papaya salad with salty crabs. . I definitely thought the trout would be my favorite of the three dishes, but it wasn't! It was good, but not that good. I thought the sauce was a little too sweet = / Pad-se-ew wasn't anything special either, but it was definitely good. BUT THE PAPAYA SALAD WITH SALTY CRAB was my favoorittee. . . Regardless, I was enjoying my meal and it turned 8pm and I did not see Elvis anywhere. 8:30.... still.... nothing. But close to 9pm, I HEARD HIM! I quickly turned my attention to the stage, and there he was, the smallest asian elvis I have ever seen in my life! (I'm pretty short myself, but he was even smaller!) It was AWESOME.
