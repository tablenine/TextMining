+:  The BEST sushi I've ever had in my life!  Like, close your eyes and cry a little good.  Bonus points for not being expensive!. -:  They opened up at 11:30 and was packed with people writing their name on a list by 11:35.  No joke, get here early!. !:  The toro and scallops were my favorite!  I requested a moment of silence from my fellow diners while I ate these, don't laugh, you will too!. ?:  Can't believe I didn't try this place sooner!  Special thanks to my brother Danny for the enlightenment.
