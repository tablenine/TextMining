Restaurant: Crustacean
Category: Vietnamese
This is by far the most beautiful Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to.  All decked out in it's Beverly Hills glory.  The food here is not as good as the original Crustacean in their San Fran location, but I still give it a 5 due to the overall experience.  If you're ever here, do yourself a huge favor and order the Dungeness crabs with garlic noodles...you can thank me later!  Also, celebrities are known to dine here frequently, so be on the lookout!
