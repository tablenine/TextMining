A local foodie gave us this EXCELLENT recommendation!  . . Ratings - Building-4.5 stars, Restaurant interior impact 5 stars, Food presentation - 5 stars, Food quality and preparedness - 5 stars, Wine selection and flexibility - 5 stars, Service - 5 stars (Amy!). . Details - Warehouse setting, lively, great ambiance for visiting with good friends after a long day or beginning the weekend.  Our server, Amy was on the money with recommendations.. . Ordered - Salmon Chips &amp; Lamb Flat Bread as appetizers - loved the Salmon Chips served on a narrow long wooden plank - I think there were 5 or 6 chips loaded generous heaps of salmon on each!  . The spring salad was light enough to cleanse the palate for the excellent entrees we had.   You MUST have someone order the Bronzed Scallops - Huge scallops with gouda grits in a smoked tomato broth with dice tomatoes....be sure to get a taste of scallops with the grits....best I've had.. The Bistro Steak was also very good, if you like you meat cooked more than rare, you better tell them or order the Brisket which also looked very good.. . I really liked the way they serve their wines, you get around 50 choices of white and reds and they are served straight from the barrels.  So, here's the deal, you can order 1/2 glass (3 oz), 6 oz, 9 oz, 16 oz or 32 oz hence allowing you to create fun pairings for each dish you order - the reds are priced from $4 to $60 and the whites from $3 - $50 - A VERY CLEVER CONCEPT!. . Desserts - try the spicy molten chocolate lava cake, cupcakes &amp; ice cream or the nutella white chocolate bread pudding with white russian ice cream.. . Bathrooms are individual unisex.
