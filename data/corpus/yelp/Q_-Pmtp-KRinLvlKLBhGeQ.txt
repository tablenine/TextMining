Wait time for a Sunday morning around 11am was less than thirty minutes.  We ordered the port dumplings, the chicken dumplings, the crab and pork dumplings, and the pork and vegetable dumplings in spicy sauce.. . My favorite, hands down, were the pork and veggie dumplings in the spicy sauce.  They were full of flavor, not too hot, and I could have had just these for lunch.  My second favorite were the chicken (which were slightly bigger and flavorful), then the pork, and lastly the crab and pork.  To be honest, I hated the crab dumplings.  The flavor was off to me, almost like crab meat paste.  Blah.  I wouldn't order this again, and I had to force myself to finish them, because I didn't want them to go to waste.. . I also enjoyed the noodles in the peanut sauce and the red bean dumplings for dessert.  Yum.  :). . Tea was plentiful, I didn't quite understand the ginger in the sauce plates, and I didn't quite like all the spraying of alcohol to disinfect the tables (though it's great they constantly clean them), but it was overall a pleasant experience.
