Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
I like different pizza for different occasions...Papa Johns when watching the Super Bowl on TV, Abbot Kinney Pizza when hosting dinner at my place, and then Pizzeria Mozza when dining out.  The pizza dough at Pizzeria Mozza is very nicely dense.  All the ones that I've tried were good (margherita, squash blossoms, and bianco).  The fried squash blossoms appetizer and the butterscotch dessert was excellent...next time I need to try more appetizers.  The wait is usually very long but it's nice to dine at place that lives up to all the hype.
