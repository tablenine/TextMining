It seems silly to add another review to the 50+ that currently exist... I won't go into all the details you can read the rest prior to this one..... . I had read various reviews about Oinkster and was excited to try the pulled pork sandwich.  I have to say I wasn't impressed with this sandwich, It wasn't very flavorful in terms of bbq and was dry.  THe meat was tender, but unfortunatly all I could taste was the salt from their soy marinade.   My husband had the hamburger and loved it, said it was one of the best he's eaten.  . . Their french fries are out of this world!  I'm willing to go back and try the pastrami and/or hamburger. . . overall, skip the pulled pork unless you apprecaite food that tastes like a salt lick.   . . -1 for cleanlieness, we had to bus the table we were sitting it at, it didn't look like it had been wiped down in quite some time.. -1 super salty pork. +1 French Fries. *1 Hamburger . +Homemade Ketchup
