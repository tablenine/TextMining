Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Okay, a week later and I am still dreaming about their creamed horseradish and that English trifle (and the Yorkshire pudding, and ...) but really those are the only things about Lawry's that I especially enjoyed. I guess I understand why people come here for special occasions, but to me it felt like everything about the place screamed, "we're trying too hard!". . Never mind the stodgy, manufactured atmosphere for a second, let's talk about the food. Yes, prime rib. Yes, bloody cuts of meat. No one's going to argue with that. But other than that:  again, I get that it's a traditional steakhouse, but .... WHY? Why, when all across Los Angeles, chefs are doing bold, creative things with the same ingredients at better restaurants, do people still choose to come to someplace like Lawry's? It boggles the mind (my mind, anyway).. . Bottom line:  if you enjoy even a modicum of excitement with your dining experience, skip this place.
