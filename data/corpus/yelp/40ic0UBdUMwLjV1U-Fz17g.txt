Normally I love Korean BBQ and I love mexican food so it seemed like the fusion of the 2 should be a winner.  Let me preface this with I HATE KIM-CHEE.  . . That being said...I went on the hunt to try this place out in front of the Golden Gopher on a Wednesday night and had the spicy pork taco and the short rib quesadilla.  Here are the problems I had with it: I expected the spicy pork taco to taste like my fave: dae-ji-gogi, but it was full of cabbage and a little bit of meat and didn't taste anything like the spicy pork i'd order from a korean bbq restaurant.  The short rib quesadilla tasted like cabbage the whole way through and then I realized that they mistakenly gave me a kim-chee quesadilla.  Thanks a lot.  Yuck.. . But you know, I figured I'd give it another chance since there's a lot of hype and they made a mistake on my quesadilla and I figured maybe it was an off night.  So on a different Tuesday night, we trekked it on down to when it was parked at The Brig.  This time tried the korean bbq taco, the sliders and the korean bbq hot dog.  Korean bbq taco results: Same as the spicy pork - too much cabbage and not enough flavor.  Korean bbq hot dog: cabbage and a hot dog.  Seriously?  The sliders were the best thing I had but you only get 2 for $5.  Mediocre and worse here folks.. . After 2 taste tests, I'm definitely NOT a fan.  If I want everything to taste like kim-chee and less like korean bbq, this is the place to go.  It would also have been nice if their meats were marinated well cause they are pretty flavorless.. . Honestly i would have been happy if they just took a well marinated and cooked piece of kal-bi and slapped in between a tortilla.   That's it.. . So don't twitter me where it's at cause I don't care.
