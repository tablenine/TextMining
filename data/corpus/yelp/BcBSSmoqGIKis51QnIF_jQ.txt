Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Over rated. Maybe not on yelp, as the average is only 3 stars, but the general reputation of the place and why it receives so much rave is beyond me. I get the whole LA landmark ideal, but when it comes to the actual hot dogs I was not impressed AT ALL. When its 2 AM after a Friday or Saturday night and you've had a sufficient amount of alcohol, things tend to taste better than they would when sober... especially greasy foods. Pink's was not the case. I've given Pink's a second and third chance resulting in no change of my opinion. Their dogs are mediocre and not worth the 1 hr wait.
