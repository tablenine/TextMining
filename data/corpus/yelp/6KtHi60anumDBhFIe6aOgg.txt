3.5! Not QUITE as good as queen of sheeba, but not far behind. i had their veggie sampler and loved all but the two red seemingly tomato based sauces (they do not tell you what is included, which is a bummer). the potato and lentil portions were good, but the cabbage was easily the best (the chickpeas Â was a close second). . . my companion had a beef tibs...sandwhich? and it came on italian-like bread. it was too spicy for my taste but was enjoyed by him. . . i would go back, but my first choice is queen of sheeba.
