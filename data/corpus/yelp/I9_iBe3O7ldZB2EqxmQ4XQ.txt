I didn't go to the Kogi truck.. The Kogi truck came to me. . . There's a crucial point in every night out that can occur anywhere between midnight and 3 a.m. (give or take half an hour). This is the part of the night when one may experience sudden cravings for random, unhealthy eats. . . This was the situation I was in while at the Golden Gopher for a friend's birthday. There isn't much to eat nearby, and taking a walk in the neighborhood in the dead of night is probably not the wisest choice available. And so, when I looked out the door and saw two trucks with "Kogi" written all over, I almost peed my pants. ALMOST.. . I've been wanting to try these tacos forever and not only do the trucks come right to me, but they come to me at this crucial point in the night. The verdict? Hell yes. I'm convinced. The Korean short ribs tacos are AH-mazing. Oh man, such a perfect midnight snack.. . The line wasn't too bad and the food didn't take a long time to prepare. I was one happy lady.. . Drawback? I probably wouldn't drive out of my way if I'm craving one, and I most likely WILL be craving one soon. I like the whole idea of food trucks, I just wish I could summon them to me when I get a major case of the lazies.
