Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
The best hot dogs in the world. They "snap when you bite into them.  been at the same location since 1939, family owned.  A great place to take out of town friends.  Old hollywood atmosphere.  . Any toping you can imagine from chili to guacamole to onion rings and jalapenos you name it they serve it
