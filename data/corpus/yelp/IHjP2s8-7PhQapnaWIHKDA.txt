Good soup, good tuna melts, good deli.  AMAZING pickles.  Sometimes, after an evening at Largo, I'll stop in to pick up a bag of pickles to keep at home.  So-o-o good.  The Kibitz room is a good place for a cocktail.  Skip the desserts.  The bagels are good.  The crowd is eclectic and interesting: old rockers, young hipsters, elderly locals, and the occasional celebrity (I recently saw Jason Alexander).
