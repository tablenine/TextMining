this place is goooood.  my friend and i shared the papaya salad with raw crab, a noodle dish (can't remember it's name, but think pad see ew with orange sauce instead of brown sauce), and fried shrimp cakes.  everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  my mouth is watering as i write this! :d  And the total damage for all that food is around $20.  how can you beat that??. . this may replace torung as my new thai food stomping ground ;)
