So Taqueria's been around for a while now, it's long lines out the door symbolic of a great neighborhood spot.  It's good food at a decent price, but is it worth the wait?  - - - no way.  But I can stand outside and drink beer while I wait all night to simply order?  No thanks.  . . Saturday night, my wife and I pulled into the Howell Mill parking lot at 5:45, and we stood in line for a solid 40 minutes just to order a couple of pieces of chicken and fish wrapped up in smallish tortillas.  It was ready after 10 minutes, but we had to take it all to-go to make it to our 7pm concert down at Lakewood.  . . After this recent wait, we won't go there again if there's any hint of a line.  Employees were standing around with nothing to do, tables were empty, and we all just stood in line and waited.  Great business model, but not a fun customer experience.
