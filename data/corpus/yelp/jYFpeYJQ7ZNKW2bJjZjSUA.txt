I absolutely love love love this place.  I have been a frequent customer for about a year and a half.  The cheese plate is always amazing, the escargot is one of the best I had, and the crepes I've tried have all been mouth-wateringly delicious.  It is also great for a mimosa-filled brunch after a heavy night of Yelping and drinking with Maggie R.  If you go, ask for Jason.  He is an incredibly knowledgeable server, and he's easy on the eyes too!  I am actually on my way there now!
