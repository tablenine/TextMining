Cool vibe outside.  The food was tasty.    Got some oysters, they were great!  They were very small, but did not have a stinky flavor and no sand in em either.  I really liked those.  Then we had one of those flatbread pizzas.  It was good.  A beet salad on the side, because apparently, I have to taste the beet salad everywhere I go.  This one was yummy.  The beets themselves were nice, but there was some strange white cheese on the side.  I always love cheese, but this one had a scary consistency.  I stayed away.  Last but not least, the piece de resistance...banana split.  YUM.  The chocolate ice cream was scrumpdidlyumptious.  Oh yea, I guess it's owned by Indiana Jones's son.  Not that that makes food taste any better.  Just a fun fact.
