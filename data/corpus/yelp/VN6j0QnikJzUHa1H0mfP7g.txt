Hands down the best XLB I've ever had. This place is very popular in Asia. Although it is pricier than most other places, the taste and freshness of the food cannot be beat. I've had XLB at other places, but some tasted like old meat and others would stick and rip when you pick one up.  I also like the wontons with spicy sauce, shrimp fried rice, shanghai rice cakes, and string beans (under seasonal veggies).  If you like seafood, they also have XLB made with crab and pork. . . Unfortunately, the wait is always long on the weekend, but luckily they opened a second location just behind this one. The new one is a shorter wait and it's cleaner (in my opinion).
