Tried for the first time tonight and loved it!  Plentiful parking in the lot out front, relaxing surroundings, nice entryway for if there is ever a wait though tonight we went early and got right in.  . . Started with roti canai and roti murtabak and both were outstanding, though I personally enjoyed the murtabak a bit more as it was just the right combo of sweet and spicy for me, and the roti was perfectly cooked.  Moved on to panang curry with chicken (actually ordered with tofu but it showed up with chicken, c'est la vie) and spicy basil leaves with beef, both of which were outstanding.  . . Finally our server was super sweet, explaining how they make the murtabak and nearly freaking out when she realized that they'd brought me chicken instead of tofu - she would have happily taken it back but I was already well into it at that point and didn't want the interruption.  All in all a solid four or maybe four and a half star experience and I'll definitely be back for takeout if not for dinner!
