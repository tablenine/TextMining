Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
After a late meeting I noticed Pink's was not crowded. I'm not a fan but I was hungry and a 7-11 variety-type hot dog was appropriate and that's exactly what I got, two lackluster chili cheese dogs.. . The chili lacked any kick that I was hoping for, while the cheese was strangely tasteless. The hot dogs had a decent snap, but lacked flavor and tasted more like a bland turkey dog. Overall, the food was borderline horrific but it's my fault, I knew better. I just thought maybe...
