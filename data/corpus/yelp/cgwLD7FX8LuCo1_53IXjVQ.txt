Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
I've been here twice now, and I really like it! I'm not sure who could possibly think the portions are small though. They're not overly huge, but they're a good size. I couldn't even finish my plate the first time I was here, I was too full! . . I've had chicken katsu, BBQ beef, spicy pork, and kalua pork. The kalua pork, wow! It's sooo good! It's slow cooked pork, pulled with cabbage, definitely my favorite at Waikiki. Everything else is very good too, the meat is always very tender and well seasoned. I would skip the curry samosas, they're just dough with curry gravy inside. I'm not a huge fan of Spam in general, but even I'm tempted by the Spam musubi. I'll have to try it next time I'm there!. . The shave ice isn't my thing, but I don't like snow cones at all so that might have something to do with it! That said, the shave ice is much better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream in it. . . If you frequent this area often, I would definitely check it out. It's very affordable, great for lunch, and it's something new that you don't often see outside of Hawaii or the west coast. I would have loved this place as a kid too, very kitschy decor and fun food, so bring the kids!
