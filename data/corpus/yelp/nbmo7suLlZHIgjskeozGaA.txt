Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Well 5 of us descended upon Orochon Ramen, two of which were determined to attempt the infamous Challenge.  The service was okay, not very quick and they forgot our second pitcher of beer.  They rush you out pretty quickly as well, somewhat annoying.  The ramen is darn good, I had the Miso but heard the others are tasty as well.  You get to add extras as well, I went for the pork slice and egg, yum!  The whole meal with drinks came to $20 a head, not too shabby.  . . Now for the challenge, the poor dudes that went for it were in agony not 1/3 into the bowl.  It's not the noodles or even the broth, but rather the absolutely ridiculous amount of green chilies that they slice up and throw in the bowl.  Nobody should consume that many, you will have a GI Blow-out!
