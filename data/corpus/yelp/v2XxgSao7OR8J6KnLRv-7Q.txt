There's a reason why all those little white men in Rosa Mexicana's fountain appear to be swan diving to their death.  I suspect it's because they tried this "Upscale, Authentic Mexican Cuisine" (pardon me while I snort) and they couldn't bear to go on living.  Fortunately I survived to share my tale.. . After the horror that was Geisha House (and despite my extreme loathing for all things Atlantic Station), we headed to Rosa Mexicana for dinner.  Halfway through a pomegranate margarita, I requested spicy guacamole.  The wee man pushing the guacamole cart gave a sinister smirk and hooked our guac up with several large, heaping spoonfuls of fresh jalapeno (seeds and all).  I'm no sissy when it comes to spicy--I thought this kicky green goo was the best part of an otherwise OK tasting meal until..... . dum dum dum DUUUUM!  . . Margarita slapped jalapeno's hand, jalapeno slapped super greasy, sub-par carne asada's hand and Sarah B was tag teamed, effective this a.m.. . As far as work productivity goes, mine is negative 50-million and dropping.  I've accomplished nothing today b/c I've spent most of this glorious Monday swinging my long-ish legs to and fro on what could be the world's tallest handicap toilet.  . . On the positive side, I did manage to beat the previous high score on my cellphone game, Bubblesmile.  And I also managed to put  Rosa Mexicana's food EXACTLY where it belongs.
