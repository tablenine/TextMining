Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
If I had to chose one place to go to lunch for good food and great beer, it would be the Brick Store Pub. The food is good, fresh, and affordable, with fun items on the menu like bavarian pretzels and an artisan cheese tray. The alcohol menu is incredibly extensive, but with help from the staff it is not too intimidating. Letting you sampling the various beers and offering in-depth advice, the waiters are very helpful and attentive to your drinking tastes, and have patience until you find the right beverage. . Decatur is an awesome place to hang out in general, and this place is a must-see. It looks like an old pirate hang out, with dark wood, a maritime feel, menus of leather and wood strung together, great artwork and cool decorations like homemade lamps and stained glass. . Come for the awesome vibe of the place, stay for the great drinks and good/affordable food!
