I've heard raves of this place for a while now but since it's so far, I've never had the chance to try it. I finally made the trek and it was WELL worth it!. . We practically ended up with half of the bakery stuffed into my car to bring home because everything looked so delicious and was SO incredibly cheap and affordable. Honestly, we brought home a car full of food for only about $70 (and that was pretty pastries and a cake too).. . For lunch, the medianoche was amazing and only about $3.00, how can you beat that!!??! The steak sandwich was also really good, super tender, and super flavorful. The best part about the lunch was the plantain chips they serve it with, I had to bring a box home just to snack on!. . Potato balls are a must! Crispy fried mashed potato stuffed with meat, how could you go wrong? Meat pies are awesome as well.. . What they are most famous for is their cheese and guava cheese rolls, we brought 3 dozens home for the family and they disappeared within days! But they keep really well too, the guava ones are like something you've never tried, just creamy, flaky and delicious.. . For desserts, the tiramisu and tres leches were ok, I wouldn't recommend them but their mango mousse cheesecake and mango mouse cake are my absolute favorite!!!!! So fresh and creamy. Italian mascarpone cheesecake was amazing too, almost everything caught my eye here. Have a try for yourself... its a must!. . I have a full description of the goodies here and pretty pictures too, so check it out:. . http://une-deuxsenses.....
