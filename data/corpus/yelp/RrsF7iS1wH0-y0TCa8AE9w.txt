Category: Steakhouses
Can you guess...  I definitely enjoy a good steak now and then....  Though it is located in Beverly Hills, it certainly isn't an intimidating dining experience.  . . RESTAURANT-I have been here now a good handful of times and I have enjoyed the experience each and every time.  It's got an old school feel about it.  If you can dine upstairs it is definitely more lively-with people chattering and the occasional couple groovin' by the piano player.  The tables can be a spaced a little too close for comfort, particularly when you sit next to an annoying high maintenance patron.. . FOOD/DRINK-Love it!  Bone in fillet is really the only thing that I have really ordered.   Hey, it makes me happy and works.  The sides are delicious as well.  The standards are the standards, you can't really go wrong.  But the lobster mash potatoes...definitely has won me over.  The seafood tower is delicious and is great for groups as an appetizer.     As of yet I haven't had any particularly special wine experience.  Though I am a fan of their dirty martini w/ blue cheese stuffed olives-gorgeous!  It is served with the shaker on the side to top off your drink.  Who could be happier?. . SERVICE-The servers are attentive, down to earth and knowledgeable despite the chaos.  . . By the way when I say casual, I mean "LA Casual"  MEN: hip-jeans, a dress shirt (tucked or untucked) and maybe some cool sneakers. LADIES: hip-jeans, blouse, sexy/trendy flats or heels.
