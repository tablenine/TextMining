A great place to eat some great ramen... the long wait is worth it if your craving their great pork broth. Ive had many of the side meals like shredded pork, chicken and egg, etc. The shredded pork is by far the best in my opinion. The atmosphere is very authentic and it definitely gets hot in there. This is the best ramen i've had. (not very experienced though)
