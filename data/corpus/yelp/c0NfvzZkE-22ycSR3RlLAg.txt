#145 review, if you haven't been here yet what are you waiting for?  this is one of my fav. places for a sandwich. the best french dipped anywhere and while you are there try their potato salad or cole slaw.  they also have great soups and chilis and a very good wine list.  very consistent and great little nooks to eat all this food in.  great place to show the out of towners that we do indeed have history here in LA.
