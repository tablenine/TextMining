This place isn't bad. I mean sure, it's trendy and the kind of place you'd only find in a place like LA, but the food is pretty good.. . Basically, it's a $10 salad with sides and stuff. Their greens are fresh and tasty. For meats with the salad, they usually have steak, ahi tuna or chicken. Recommend not the ahi, as it's usually not well seasoned and kind of flavorless unless you're into that.. . The steak is good. For the sides, I opt for grilled vegetables and I dig these: little tomatoes, funny squashes, carrots, zucchini and a bunch of random stuff.. . I don't eat a lot of $10 salads but don't mind a place like this. Be ready for a bit of a long line.
