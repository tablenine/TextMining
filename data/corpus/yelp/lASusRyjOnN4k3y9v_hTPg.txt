Hubs brought me some Kogi home for lunch today.  I thought the concept of Korean Mexican American was good in my head, but when I put it in my mouth, meh.  Pac-man hamburger was cute, tacos were okay and the burrito was probably the best.  . . If the line was 5 minutes, I would get it again...perhaps I'd wait a little longer if I were drunk and I could easily stumble to it.
