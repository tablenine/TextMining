Restaurant: Grindhouse Killer Burgers
Category: Burgers
After orientation at GSU, I decided to head over to Grindhouse because I had been wanting to for ages and never felt like dealing with downtown...so since I was not with a car, that made it far easier. I braved my walk past some stupid tools making comments about me who I wanted to hip check into oblivion, but I kept cool...for once in my life.. When I walked in to the market, I was completely confused because it was just a random combination of things, from produce to ...Pizza Hut? I located the large line for Grindhouse and joined it. This place involves a lot of waiting, even the people who ordered by phone were waiting. . I made the mistake of sitting at the first stool by the cash register, which I thought was not THAT close but apparently I was wrong, so I kept getting knocked into my people who didn't seem to care about personal space.. I ordered a burger Grindhouse style with fries. I was kind of sad that the fries weren't very good and yet there were so many of them. I eventually gave up eating them because it felt like a horror movie where you can't run out of fries that aren't that great.. As for the burger, I can't say I was that impressed. It had lettuce, grilled onion, American cheese, and "grindhouse sauce" on it, which didn't do much for me. It was kind of messy, and it wasn't anything special. I may go back to try something different come August.. They are opening a second location on Piedmont Ave. near Fat Matt's sometime around then, so I may not even have to bother taking a risk to walk past some rude "men." YAY.
