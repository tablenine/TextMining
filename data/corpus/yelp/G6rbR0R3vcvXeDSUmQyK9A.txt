Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
How can good food have such bad service?. . I've been eating here for years now despite the bad service.  One time, I actually had to serve my party our own water!  I keep coming back for the all-you-can-eat Bul Go Gee and Kalbi.  The way they marinate the beef is unlike any other Korean BBQ places I've gone to, and the price is comparable.  Just be sure to go on an empty stomach because the portions are huge.... a guaranteed food coma afterwards.  4 stars because of the not-so-nice service.. . TIP:  Avoid weekend nights (Friday and Saturday nights) since it's their busiest time... unless you don't mind waiting for 2+ hours.
