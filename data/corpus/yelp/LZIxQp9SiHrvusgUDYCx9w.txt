aweful, service was terrible, chicken noodle soup was broth and noodle, no chicken no vegi's altough I could have gotten chicken and carrots added for 3 bucks more I learned afterwards, partrami sandwich was served cold, not by mistake, I've never heard of a cold pastrami sandwich, that's like getting a cold cheeseburger. also it's way over priced.. . I wish I could give 0 stars
