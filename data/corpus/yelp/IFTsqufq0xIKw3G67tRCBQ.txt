This is truly one of my favorite places in Los Angeles...everything I have ever tried is sooooo delish but I usually end up with the Real Food Basic 3 where you can ultimately pick your favorite macro yummies yourself  ;)  The desserts are the best  around (vegan no less) and I love that they serve Teeccino (with steamed rice milk and agave)...that just tops it off for me !!
