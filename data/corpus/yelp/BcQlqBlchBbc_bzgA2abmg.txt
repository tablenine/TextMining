5 is for the sandwich - alone.. . Growing up, I've seen these sandwiches whenever I visit the China town down in Orlando, but for some reason it never appeal to me. One day (like 2 years ago) a friend of mine introduce me to this place's sandwich. It's call the: "Special" sandwich. The first one on the sandwich menu. And then I fell in love with it ever since. I had to have one at least once to twice a month to get my fix. Other than the sandwiches, I wasn't terribly fond of the food. But, hey! That was enough to keep me as a regular! And VERY satisfied regular I might add!
