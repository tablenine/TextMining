Restaurant: Chateau de Saigon
Category: Vietnamese
Normally I would always give Chateau 4-5 stars.  I must say though that I think there has been some changes to the staff and primarily the staff in the kitchen.  Last night we started with 2 items that I order every single time I go; The Papaya Salad with Beef Jerky, and the La Lot Beef.  The salad was amazing as always, the La Lot was good but not as good as usual, the herbs looked a bit old and there was no apples or cucumber.  Then we ordered the Lemon Grass chicken which was fine but nothing to write home about, finally we also had the Shrimp and Scallops with Chinese Broccoli and vegetables, it basically was terrible and straight out of  a Chinese restaurant (AVOID IT).  Normally we always will get an order of Shaken Beef, but since the staff knows me well, the advised me not to get it as the person making it currently is not up to snuff.  I appreciate the honesty but I think we saw the affects in everything we ordered.  I really hope they straighten things out in the kitchen because that is the most important part of that place!
