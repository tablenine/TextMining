My friends have always raved about this place and I had been dying to go. But honestly I do not know what all the hoopla was. I honestly did not care for the upside down pizza. It was ok and this is from someone who loves all pizza. The wait to get seated totally sucks. And the guy who sits you doesn't write down your name. I guess he has been there forever. But I honestly can't believe he actually remembers the order you came in. I think he sat another party before us that came in after us. Not impressed at all, but I might give it another chance but not in the too near future.
