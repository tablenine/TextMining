When here with my BF for lunch today.  I ordered their Mac &amp; Cheese with Wild Mushroom ($9 Mac &amp; Cheese + $6 Wild Mushroom and Truffle Oil).  It was yummy, but the portion was pretty big that it gets overwhelming near the end. . . My BF ordered the Cuban Pulled Pork Sandwich.  The whole fried banana inside the sandwich kind of threw us off in terms of flavor.  Should have known there would be bananas inside when it says Cuban.  Their pickles and homemade chips were yummy.  It's a lovely place to experience.
