Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
There's no such thing as a parking lot and Visa when you step foot into this kitchen.  Indoors is itty bitty and sidewalk seating ain't much better (but they try to keep you cool with mist and fans).  However, despite the lines and inconveniences, I can see why Savoy Kitchen is having a hard time keeping the hoards away.. . Their Yelp-renowned Hainan Chicken is tender and the rice is moist and delicious.  The Baked Seafood Casserole is swimming with seafood.. . I will definitely be back to try the other goodies, but only after a pit stop at the ATM.. . Update: Their escargot is my favorite.. fat and succulent, swimming in a sea of garlic buttery heaven.  Use their flat bread to sop it all up.  Mmm, definitely worth trying!
