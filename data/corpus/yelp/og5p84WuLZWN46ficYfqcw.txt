I've passed this place countless times and am always telling people we need to try it out. And then ask if anyone knows how to properly pronounce the name of the place. . . Finally checked it out for Brunch on a Saturday and thoroughly enjoyed it all. Sat outside with no wait at the peak of brunch.. . The brunch menu is fantastic and not all the same old crap.. Eggs Benedict with artichokes, spinach and Sun Dried Tomato hollandaise? yes please.. Vegetable Fritatta with goat cheese? Â mmmmm For sure! I couldn't decide what to get so I considered getting two plates! I'll have to come back to try all the other options!. . oh and... "it's Americanized so it sounds like a de lease." - Waitress
