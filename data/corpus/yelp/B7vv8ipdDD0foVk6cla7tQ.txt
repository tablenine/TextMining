Restaurant: Electric Lotus
Category: Indian
So what is it with "Electric SOMETHING" being such a (relatively) common name for an Indian restaurants in LA? I don't know if there is a turf war going on, but I gotta say....if you asked me to call the abstract battle between Karma and Lotus? Well, lets just say Lotuses (Loti?) are lovely, but Karma can be downright cruel.. . IF, however, you asked me which my favorite "Electric" Indian restaurant in LA would win the actual, concrete, FOOD war....well, um....the Lotus would lose here as well. This is a great restaurant for a first date, don't get me wrong: interesting cocktails, low-lighting, comfortable seating....but the food is merely mediocre. Not spicy, not salty, not savory, not ANYTHING, really. In fact, writing this review, I can barely remember what it tastes like, other than to say it is not horrible, nor is it delicious. It is sort of like eating Wonder Bread: you're probably getting plenty of vitamins and minerals and junk, but it's not particularly interesting. Electric Wonder!. . Yelp says 3 stars means A-OK, and I'd say that's about right. This is a good place to go if you can walk there, or you need dim lighting to disguise recent surgery and/or the ravages of aging (I feel your pain)....but I can't give it the full throated recommendation I'd like. Good drinks and huge portions can't offset the weird, ever-changing delivery fees and most importantly, the extremely, electrically, mediocre food.
