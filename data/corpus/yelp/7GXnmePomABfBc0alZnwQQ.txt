Great great ceviche (i suggest to get the ceviche and ask for extra limes) and half-price margarita tues/thurs is awesome.  The wait staff is great.  I always get the flank stank (carne asada?) and the tequila lime shrimp, and i'm always very pleased.  For some reason my tab at this place runs up quick, but that is probably my own fault.  I could give this place five stars but pulled one back due to two reasons:. . 1)  i like the flank steak smothered in red sauce from El Jardin a bit more.. 2) my tab is never under $70 (for two).  I eat here about once every two months but would go more if my tab was closer to $50.  Again, this is my fault, as ordering no margaritas would probably solve that.  However, mexican food and $70 tabs don't mix with me for some reason.
