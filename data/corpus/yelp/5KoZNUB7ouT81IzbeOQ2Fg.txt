A perfect take out Asian restaurant. I lived in SF for a number of years, so am pretty darn familar with good Asian food.  This place is one of my favorites in Chicago. Specifically, the Duck, green beans and the broccoli are great!  The restaurant side of it is pretty, well, cafeteriaish (hmm, is this a word?)  but it is about the food, which is great!. . The staff is always friendly, even though you may have to point at something you want as English is not the first language spoken here. But that is part of the whole experience. I love it!
