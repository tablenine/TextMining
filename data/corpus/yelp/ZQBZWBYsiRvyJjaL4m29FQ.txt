Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
The food is pretty good, excellent portions and decent prices.  The place can be crowed at times and everyone is seated at long tables together so it's not a place for those that are looking for an intimate dinner.  The Thai Elvis makes the dinner well worth the crowds.  I love this place and often take friends visiting the city to eat there.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun Thai experience that differs slightly from your more run of the mill establishments.
