Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
Yamashiro is the disneyland of Japanese restaurants.  It is the male counterpart to Madame Wu's which used to be open on Wilshire and hold murder mystery dinners.  The place is beautiful - but the food is god awful, horrible, vomit in my mouth just thinking about it bad.  It is really expensive too.  You go there for the ambience.  It is bad in the way Formosa cafe's food is bad - but it is cool hollywood.  I suggest you go there for drinks walk around and then eat somewhere else.
