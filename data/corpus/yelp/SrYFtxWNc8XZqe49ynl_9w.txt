Like many people, just found this place after it aired on Diner's, Drive In's &amp; Dives.  Get's very very busy and is tiny.  Best bet may be to hit this place slightly off hours or during the day.. . Pastrami - AWESOME.  Great sandwich, the mix of flavors is perfect and you can add your own sauce / mustard whatever you want.  One of the most perfectly flavored pastrami sandwiches I have ever had.  Is not overpowering like some pastrami can be.  Fantastic and worth the drive all by itself.. . Pulled Pork - Big G - Guy Fieri let me down here.  I love my BBQ, this ain't it.  This sandwich was really not anything more than average.  Their home made sauce is very good and flavorful, but the pork itself was just not happening.  Don't go here if you are only interested in a Pulled Pork Sandwich, boat load of other BBQ joints just in the San Gabriel Valley that are far better.. . Hamburgers - these were a huge surprise and very very good.. . All in all, absolutely worth the drive and worth a little wait.  There is a reason the place is packed as it was an on the money hit with DDD.
