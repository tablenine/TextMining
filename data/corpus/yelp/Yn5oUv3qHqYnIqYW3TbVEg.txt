BLUE(berry) VELVET CAKE. oh so good.. . so many fantastic dessert options. the ice cream fridge with the drumsticks looks AMAZING, and the ooey gooey cookies are the best.. . the savory menu is great too, if you want a simple, delicious meal.. . metal chairs and tables are squeaky and loud when they move across the floor.. . overall, great experience and i will come back for that blue velvet cake!!!
