Restaurant: Baoguette Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
Catfish baoguette is the way to go.  The seasoned, grilled catfish arrived with a sweet/sour mustard, pickled red onion, and lots of hot jalapenos on a freshly baked baguette.  The sloppy bao had a nice curry kick to it and was stuffed with plenty of mangos and fixins as well.  We also ordered the sticky rice, which arrived with a heaping mound of BBQ chicken and Chinese sausage.  If you like meat, there's plenty of it on the sticky rice.  The food arrived fast.  The service was friendly.  The baguettes were baking in the oven while we watched from the counter.  . . The downside might be the lack of seating.  Although they have a few tables and counter seating, it's more of a take-out or eat and go kind of place.  I think you'd have a hard time eating there comfortably with more than four people in your group.  Also, some may think that $7+ for banh mi may be overpriced when you can get one for $2-$3 in Chinatown.  But I argue that you're dealing with something else here - the bread is baked on premises and overflowing with fresh, tasty, above average ingredients.  It's worth the premium.
