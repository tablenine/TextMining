Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
You will have to wait to get in this restaurant. We had the luxury of patience and good company, but even with that the hour wait was mind-boggling. I went with a company of four and we had our stomachs ready for one of Los Angeles's most talked-about ramen restaurants.. . When we finally got, we got a nice table in the right side of the restaurant. The decor is awesome! They went for the 1950's Japan look. A lot of old posters, bill boards, and advertisements lined the walls. The vintage Asahi beer girl caught my eye. Elsewhere on the walls is a giant poster that said "tabako", or "smoking". . . Well our food came. We all ordered the Daikoku Ramen special. They were out of settori that night. The ramen is worth the hype. The soup was rich, the noodles tasted fresh, and the cha-shu was tender. My friend thought it was closer to bacon than anything else. Everything came into play, and like many people say, the soft-centered egg was the interesting part. Many ramen places try to do it, but Daikoku-ya did it flawlessly. We ate and ate, and ate some more. We slurped and chomped our way to noodle heaven. I'm definitely coming back to this place again next time I'm in L.A.
