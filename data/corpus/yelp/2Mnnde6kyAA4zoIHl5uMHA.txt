Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Probably the only place where I haven't been able to finish a burrito when I wanted to.  I was at a loss for words the first time I tried a burrito but could not for the life of me eat it all in one sitting.. . Lately (by lately I mean the last three years) I've been particularly enjoying Machaca con huevo, a delightful dish of shredded beef.  . . Be sure to avoid going there on Tuesdays.  I've made the mistake of forgetting which day of the week they were closed to pull into an empty parking lot and feeling an dreadful pit of despair in my stomach for being such a knucklehead.. . Also, try to say hello to Manuel the owner.  He mentioned to me last year that he was passing on the business to his daughter sometime soon.  Wonder if that happened already?  Anyhow, Manuel is great.  Always makes me feel right at home.
