I would have given this place 4 stars but after my visit last night, I had to knock it down one.  I come here ever once in a while after I do some shopping at Water Tower.  Not a place for indecisive people like me, the options are plenty.  This place is kinda pricey but the food is pretty good so I don't mind.  . . However,. . Last night, I was a block away from Water Tower and decided to run in, grab a slice of pizza before meeting up with a friend.  I ordered a slice of cheese pizza and it was the greasiest pizza I ever had.  I'm a dabber.  I dabbed the excess grease off the pizza and basically went through a bunch of napkins.  I do not know where all the grease was coming from and it seemed like there was no end to it so I gave up.  Starting eating the pizza and there was like no pizza sauce.  I was very disappointed withe pizza.  I guess this is what a NY pizza tastes like.. . If you are going to eat at FoodLife, there are plenty of choices and lots of great selections so skip the pizza.
