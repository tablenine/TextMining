i should be spanked for living in this neighborhood for this long and *today* was my first time at Flo.. . Flo made me happy:  it's solid mexican breakfast food (haven't been there for dinner, yet) served with a smile and a really good strong cup of coffee.  i had the chorizo chilaquiles and it reminded me of what i ate living in los angeles (bar none, some of the best mexican food lives there - okay, maybe texas).  folks expecting something resembling 'high cuisine' from chilaquiles need to chill a little bit - it's comfort food traditionally made out of leftovers and the Flo chorizo chilaquiles had flavor, asiago cheese and the requisite soft/crunchy tortilla texture.  my only wish was one more tortilla on the plate to eat with.  (my proof that this was good solid mexican food?  there was a latino family sitting next to us and, from what i could overhear/translate, the mom liked it.  if it's good enough for moms, it's good enough for me!). . the portions are hearty (and i'm a hearty kinda girl) and, according to my friend, the smoked hash was excellent.  (she even ate the zuchinni and she hates the stuff!)  the service was fast, polite and even friendly.. . our wait for seating was 15-20 minutes and once the high brunch hour was past, the flow (heh) inside the restaurant was pretty fast.  i agree with an earlier yelper - get there super early or after 1 pm on weekends if you want to avoid waiting.  i'll try to get here on a weekday to have a more relaxed meal.. . go to Flo and don't be ashamed if you have to unsnap your pants a little when you're walking out.  oof.
