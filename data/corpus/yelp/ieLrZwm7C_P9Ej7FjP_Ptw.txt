I wish I could give half stars. I really wanted to give it four stars but I couldn't in good faith because I didn't enjoy my meal. I went at around 2 PM and I had already had breakfast that morning, so I got a lunch option. I had the ahi tuna melt. It sounded great on the menu. Tuna, gruyere, toasted, etc. Unfortunately, the tuna did not taste like ahi since it was minced like any other tuna and there was so little gruyere that it was hard to actually call this a melt.. . However, my friend got one of the brunch options and it was amazing. She had the eggplant benedict which I tried a bite of and I immediately regretted having the benedict at J. Christopher's earlier that morning. . . The location and decor are also both good. The music was a little strange. They played Michael Jackson non-stop the entire time we were there. It was just an odd choice for the middle of the day.
