great cocktails with interesting concoctions (lychee, mango, etc etc). the restaurant is HUGE, not very intimate. food is good enough. there's nothing spectacular about this place, but it's good if you're hungry and don't feel like waiting. i wouldn't recommend their pho or any of their soup noodles. this place tastes sort of washed out, like they're trying to please everyone without really making anything special. still, cocktails are terrific:)
