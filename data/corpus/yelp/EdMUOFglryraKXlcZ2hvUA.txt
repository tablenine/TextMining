I came here for brunch on a Sunday and it was a mad house. I had the feta cheese sandwhich (it has olive oil and feta with basil and tomatoe on french bread and a dulce de leche latte. It was good, however nothing to write home about. The thing I like about this bakery is it has selection and any place that is this popular must have something going on...but the crowd was too overwhelming to have me make an exciting decision on food. That and this was pre-party to going to the Glendale Gun Show - that of which is hard to overshadow in pure excitement factor!
