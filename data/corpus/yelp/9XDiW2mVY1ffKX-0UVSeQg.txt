Category: Southern
big Roscoe's fan since they were located in Oakland ca near lake Merritt back in the days... more like early 90's, the best way i can describe the taste of the chicken is "THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT !!! AWWWW" OK, wipe your mouth. as for the waffle, it doesn't get any better. it's crunchy and very flavorful.  add butter and maple syrup and your in heaven.  Roscoe, please come back to OAKLAND...  PLEASE !!! now i am crying like a little school girl..
