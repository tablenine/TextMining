I LOVE this place.  I don't know how you can argue with the value you get here.  Amazing food; the best in both sushi and Thai food in a clean cozy place for not much money.  How can you argue with that?. . Their sushi is always wonderful, and thai is off the charts.  They have extra hot sauces that they bring out to make it extra-extra hot.  Sometimes their service is a little slow, but it might be because we go with large groups on a Friday or Saturday night.. . Bottom line is if you haven't tried this place, try it if you like sushi and/or thai.  If you have tried it, then you know what I'm talking about.  Cheers.
