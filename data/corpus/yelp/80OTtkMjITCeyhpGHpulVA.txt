Not too bad for a chain restaurant.  The decor is actually a pretty neat throwback to the turn of the century.  I do love the fact that bison is prevalent on the menu.  So much healthier than beef.  Other good choices are the beer can chicken and the meatloaf.  You must try the onion rings - delish!. . Definitely a meat and potatoes kind of place.  I find the powdered soap in the restrooms cute but annoying.  Good attentive service (the manager frequently checks on patrons in the dining room).
