Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I am not sure I will be able to eat anywhere else (although my pocketbook can't sustain such a life) now that I have tasted the divine food at Bacchanalia.  I truly do believe it is one of the best meals I have had.  . . First, let me just say that the chef was in a good mood because we received several items complements of the chef last evening.  It started with a yummy puff pastry filled will out of this world cheese.  It was then an amazing corn chowder.  Then there were two dessert (a sampling of cookies, truffles and Madelaines).  I am going to spare my general blow by blow description of the evening because it was all amazing.  The lamb and the kimchee shrimp were the highlight of the evening, by far!  The cheese course was also amazing.  I had the beet salad with a creemy toome chese that was to die for.  The pairing of the cheese with the beets was excellent.. . If you want a truly special evening, please put this on your list.  It is really a meal not to be missed.  I did want to point out that while the food was out of this world, the waiter was just so-so.  For this level of a restaurant, I expected an amazing server.  I did not find him to be so.  His knowledge of the wines was not good at all...to the point that I asked for a suggestion and he showed me the wine list and left me to poke my way through the list with little assistance.  He was not very knowledgeable about the menu and just did not meet my expectations.  But, for this picky one, even with this issue, I still give the place five starts.  . . Loved, loved, loved it!
