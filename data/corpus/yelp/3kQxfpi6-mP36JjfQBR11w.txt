Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
I actually stumbled upon this place by accident after driving around Melrose. Seeing the letters "Milk" on the building, I remembered that this spot was bookmarked from the last time I checked the Yelp LA hot list. That, and the fact that a 15-year old girl in our group started shrieking, "Oh my gosh! I saw this place on The Hills!" Alrighty then, I guess we're going in.. . Upon entering, I couldn't help but notice how gigantic the menu was, and how high it was placed up. Maybe I'm just getting old, but I was starting to get neck cramps and vertigo looking at it. It's just a mind-boggling, vast selection of desserts and sweets. Malts, shakes, cakes, ice cream sandwiches, cookies... just about everything is on display both behind the counter and out in the open. My head was spinning, it was sweet sensory overload.. . We simply got a chocolate covered coconut macaroon and a Jasmine iced tea. The macaroon was tasty, and not too sweet. Although I'm not that big a fan of coconut, I actually enjoyed eating it. The Jasmine iced tea was very refreshing, and you could tell it was brewed properly with tea leaves, and not just from some powder or syrup. I wouldn't mind trying some of their other desserts the next time I'm up in LA.
