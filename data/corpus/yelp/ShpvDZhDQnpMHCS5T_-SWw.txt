Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
I love the Cheesecake Factory. I've eaten here about a dozen times, and they never cease to impress me with a wonderful meal. I religiously ordered the Shrimp Scampi with the Mac and Cheese Balls as an appetizer. I just recently tried the fish tacos, which satisfied me as well. Always remember to order a lemonade for your drink because they cover the rim of the cup in pure sugar. A refreshing treat. The staff is very cordial, the food comes out quickly, but make sure to be ready to order as soon as your waiter or waitress comes to your table for the first time. They might never come back.
