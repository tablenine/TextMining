Wow.  This place is awesome.. . Blu Jam has crazy good food.  It's quaint, the restaurant is comfortable and the people are great.  The food is wonderful here, and worth trying.  I bet I could eat here daily and never get tired of it.  I love their french toast with orange caramel sauce because it has a bite to it but it's still nicely sweet with fruit.  Their turkey fennel sausage is herby and yummy!  My husband died and went to heaven after eating the Old World there.. . Love it and I will eat here every time I come back to LA.!
