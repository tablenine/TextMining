Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
Porto's is the bomb! I go all the time, it helps that I live close by.. . Favorites:. Potato Balls. Papa Preparada(Potato ball sandwich). Spinach/Feta Croissant. Fruit Tart. Strawberry Smoothie. Cheese Rolls. . I think there's something for everyone here. I don't know a person that doesn't love this place. That's why it's always so crowded. Parking is kind of a pain, too. If you go early, it's not as packed and when I say early, I mean before 8 or 9am.
