I loved Geisha House! Of course, I came on a Monday night with reservations, a good friend,  and they do half-off everything on Mondays, so things were already looking up before I walked in the door.. . I had never been before, and when I walked in the door,  I was immediately impressed. Great decor, atmosphere. Low red lights, nice tables, great music in the background. Hostess was very friendly, server came immediately and took us through the menu, came back often but not obsequiously often. I ordered teriyaki salmon with white rice and my friend ordered a vegetarian roll dish and miso soup-- altogether it cost me $18. The food was amazing. Teriyaki salmon was so soft and perfectly cooked, rice was also sticky and good. We didn't order drinks  but I did notice they were ridiculously priced. I am not made of money Geisha House!. . And that is why going on Mondays is a darn good thing. The End.
