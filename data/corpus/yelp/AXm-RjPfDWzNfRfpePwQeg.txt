Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
This place is totally overrated!  The dumplings are just ok -- I thought the outside was too doughy, the meat was too hard and not all that tasty, and they are small!  And the steamed dumplings are served on wax paper, which is totally weird.  They should on napa cabbage of course!   You can see the kitchen thru their large windows and NONE of the people making the dumplings are Chinese!  I much prefer the dumplings at Happy Cafe in San Mateo.  We also got the chicken soup w/noodles, and was not impressed.  Average soup, bland noodles.  Why are there such lines for this place?  We arrived Friday nite at 9pm.  Waited about 1/2 hour for a table.
