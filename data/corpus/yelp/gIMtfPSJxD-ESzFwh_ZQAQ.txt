I'm sorry, but forcing people to circle around tables like vultures because of the lazy Â "seat yourself" policy is unacceptable. I don't like hovering over people who are trying to enjoy their meal, and I sure as hell don't enjoy having it done to me. Kicking people out for bringing ketchup?! Get over yourself. Your burger is great, but this is L.A. and great burgers are a dime a dozen.
