Me: "How long is the wait?". Restaurant: "30 minutes". Me: "Okay, that's fine". Restaurant: "You're number 30 please". . ...waits 30 minutes.... . Restaurant: NUM-BAH DIRTY.... NUM-BAAAH THIRTY. . Me: Wait what?. . Well besides the standing around and hunting around for a spot to eat, I don't advise anyone coming in between 6-7:30 since it's usually an hour wait... If you do, good luck on parking. If you're the owner start a valet service please.... . I paid $70 with food, taxes, and tip included for a party of four and we were stuffed. We ordered the food set that was around $40 with two additional dishes and it was plenty. Portions were huge, food had a nice flavor to it and service was snappy.
