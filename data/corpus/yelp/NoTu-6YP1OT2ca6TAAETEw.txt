I'd go to Kopi anytime for the coffee.  For food, I'd probably rather head somewhere else.  I've had lunch there a couple of times and both time I thought it was just ok.  It took a long time to get it and the seating isn't terribly comfortable.. . The coffee, though, was excellent.  I can't pass by without getting an Americano.  If their sidewalk furniture's out, I'll definitely hang out and watch the Andersenvillians pass by.
