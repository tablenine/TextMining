I for one do not eat ramen that much, Top Ramen was probably the only ramen in my vocabulary.  The only other ramen place I've been to would be Shin Sen Gumi, and that was good.. . There was a maybe 15 minute wait, I was there maybe at 11pm last night. Not bad.. . I was extremely hungry and I ordered the ramen combination with the sashimi bowl.. . The sashimi bowl was good, the rice was sushi rice, it was fairly good. But I am sick, so maybe my taste buds were slightly impaired.  So I wait for the ramen, and it came in this huge bowl.  I don't care if I was sick or not, I know what good tasting food is.  The ramen wasn't too oily and it the soup was just right.  I am not sure if I could have asked for my noodles to be a little bit harder, that's how I like mine.. . I would come back here again most definitely, I decided to join yelp just to review this place.
