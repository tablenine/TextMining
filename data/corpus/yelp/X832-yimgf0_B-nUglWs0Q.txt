Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Hands down BEST Tonkotsu Ramen in LA! . . Lots of parking, no hour long wait at all hours, great service, tasty food, nice prices. . . Try the Hakata Ramen and Karaage (regular or sweet and sour). I recommend getting the rich or "kotteri" soup base for a more rich and savory ramen. I liked the spicy miso topping as well, it added just the right amount of spice and brought the soup to another level.. . There are so many kinds of ramen, if you like tonkotsu, Shin Sen Gumi is the place to go in LA! Sure there's a Gardena location and yes, it's slightly better but this is about 1 hour closer and the difference is minute. It's no Ippudo but it's good enough ramen to satisfy my craving in between trips to Japan.. . If you're a patron of Daikokuya (popular again why?), I urge you to try this place. The noodles at Shin Sen Gumi are just vastly superior than the cheap egg noodles served at Daikokuya. If I had a choice between popular and tasty, I'd go with tasty, but that's just me.
