Yeah.  Okay.  I love sushi.  So what!  . This place in my favorite in the city if I am looking for traditional sushi in a traditional atmosphere.  I think it is my favorite place for a great sushi lunch if I want a quiet, relaxing, and attentive service atmosphere.  If you like sashimi as much as I do, you will feel like you have gone to sushi heaven----just thinking of it makes me want to cancel our reservations for dinner tonight (Italian) and do this instead.  Like butter!  The sashimi will literally melt in your mouth.  Oh yeah baby!
