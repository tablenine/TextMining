Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
I'm going to keep this simple.  Some of the best Mexican food I have had in Chicago.  Everyone working there was great and friendly.  The Cemitas and Chalupas, taco's arabes phenomenal.   The only complain I have, is that they are not in my neighborhood.
