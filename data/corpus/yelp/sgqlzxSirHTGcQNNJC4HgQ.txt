I've been going to this place for years, and I have enjoyed a nice majority of my experiences here. You get excellent, freshly-prepared food, with herbs from their garden, and in limited quantities of their specials.. . While some people have shared their thoughts on the service being a bit rude, I would say to them that the chiding and the mocjing is really part of their charm. For a place named after a John Waters character titled "The Filthiest Person in the World", the kitsch and relaxed atmosphere of the place, peppered with Divine memorabilia makes the place dear to my heart.. . On weekdays, this is my secret place to have a satisfying lunch without going to a bustling restaurant with lots of din. On the weekends, I jump at the opportunity to have brunch with friends here. Just remember to get there before 3pm!
