Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I did a little research on chicken and waffles, and here's what I found out.. The dish was invented in Harlem, NY in 1938 at a restaurant called "Wells." All the jazz musicians after their gigs would go there to eat around 4AM and could never make up their minds as to whether they wanted dinner or breakfast, so the chef at Wells combined them and the musicians LOVED it. Later in the '40s many NY musicians moved to LA (Central Ave) and wanted the same dish out here, so it jumped coasts. So it's got possibly nothing to do with the South (except the origins of fried chicken). So, it's a New York thing.
