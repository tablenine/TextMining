Delicious selection of meats--my favorites were the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and the picanha. The salad bar was also pretty good--with some nice cured meats and chees--but I was determined to eat strategically so I focused 90% of my appetite on the meat. They also make great caipirinhas. We topped the evening off with an oaky port and some tres leches--one of the best I've had. Definitely a good meal. Since we sat near the salad bar, it was tough to ignore the pre-Area crowd which included at least a dozen scantily clad escorts prancing around in 6 inch heels. Take a sip, look around, and you might just think you're in Rio...
