Restaurant: Hub 51
Category: American (New)
I try to experience a new restaurant every weekend, and was very excited to try Hub 51. Knowing the family history and loving every Lettuce restaurant I have ever dined at, I had high hopes. We arrived twenty minutes early to enjoy a drink and get a feel for the bar and restaurant atmosphere. The first problem was they didn't carry my drink of choice, which is Captain Morgan rum. The waitress suggested a alternative called Sailor Jerry which I had never heard of and didn't do the trick. We were seated promptly at our reservation time and ordered the recommended chicken nachos appetizer. The nachos arrived cold and hard and were as good as you would find on an all you can eat football buffet at any corner bar. Three bites into the appetizer the entree arrived, the flavorless Salmon my wife ordered was only seared and raw on the inside, not charred grilled as described. Both meals were sent back to the kitchen to be held warm until we finished the nachos. When the food returned it was dry from being held under warming lights and a real disappointment. The Manager arrived at our table unrequested to apologize for the problems and offered a carrot cake to take home. The carrot cake was the best part of the meal. The overall experience was a real let down for our sweetest day dinner. This being a nice location and having a decent atmosphere could have been a great experience but will now be on the do not return list.
