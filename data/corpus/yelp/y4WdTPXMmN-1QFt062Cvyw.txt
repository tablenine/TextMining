If you are a young professional and entertaining older-school clients, bring em here.  It's classy, low-key and they make a damn good martini.  The bartenders are attentive and adept.  And they have a great selection of high-end vodkas (ciroc, grey goose, etc.), which is very important for a vodka martini gal like me.. . If you are a young professional looking to party it up or blow off steam after a hard day, don't go here.  They'll likely kick you out before you get to the olive.
