if you like garlic, you will love versailles.  i've tried several things on their menu, and always go back to any of the options that come with garlic sauce.  i don't like picking bones out of my chicken, so i tend to stick with the chicken bistec with garlic sauce rather than their famous #1.  with the chicken, they saute onions in the garlic sauce itself or, if you choose pork, they put raw onions on top.  both are yummy, but offer slightly different flavors (pork is saltier).  the portions are large (and come with rice, beans, and plantains), so you will definitely have leftovers.. . i'm also a fan of the buttery garlic bread they serve as an app, as well as their cheap sangria by the pitcher.  the only downside to versailles is that the food is on the greasy side, but so tasty.
