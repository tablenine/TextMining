Snagged a last minute cancellation reservation for last night, which I guess is a rarity given some of the reviews I've read on here. Had no problem with the hostess and were seated pretty promptly. Yes, the tables are a little close together, but it's manageable. . . Ended up ordering the bone marrow appetizer, which, while good, was seriously lacking the marrow. Only one of the three bones would contain what I would call a reasonable amount of marrow. Probably could have complained, but didn't. The dog ended up going to town on the bones later that night, which I think helped to temper my disappointment. . . Clam pizza was pretty good, but I was more impressed with the pizza dough than the toppings. Wished I had tried another one, but overall was still quite tasty. . . The real star of the meal was the caramel/marshmallow/peanut dessert. I get the feeling a lot of people find the desserts to be the best part of the meal. It all sounded good, it was tough to choose. . . Service by the busboy/backwaiter was very attentive and friendly, service by the waitress not so much. I know it's tight in there, but I don't really appreciate an elbow in my face for 45 seconds while you struggle to open a bottle of wine for the table next to us. Also surprisingly slow/lumpy at times, waiting for change for the meal took about 10 minutes, but the pizza showed up about 2 minutes after the piping hot marrow, allowing it to get cold while we ate the app. Basic timing mistake that should not be found in a restaurant with this reputation. . . Overall, good food, but some other quirks will probably keep me from going back. . . The dog gave it 5 stars though...
