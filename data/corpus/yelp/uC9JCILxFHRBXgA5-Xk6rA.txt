This is my favourite pizza place in Chicago.  I've been coming here since it first opened and although they've switched up the menu a bit as well as get a liquor license(bye bye BYO), I really enjoy their stuff.  Their New Haven style rocks my thin crust world!  Good sauce and quality toppings to boot.  They're slightly less expensive than the other thin crust places, ahem, you know who you are...and they're friendlier and more convenient if you're on the west side.  Oh and it won Time Out's Best Pizza and lots of mentions in Chicago Magazine, if that counts for anything.  Yes, it's not going to provide you with leftovers for days like a usual pizza place, I admit I can finish an entire pizza by myself easily, but it's awesome.  My favourite is the Margherita for its simplicity and the Prosciutto for the salty meatiness.  Street parking can be spotty due to the neighborhood and they don't take reservations.  It can get quite busy so if it's cold like it was today, you're stuck waiting in your cold car or huddled in the middle of the restaurant hovering over other people's pizzas.
