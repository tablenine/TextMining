Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
4.5*. . touted as los angeles's best burger around, i knew i had to check out the office's burger for myself.  having heard so much about the mayhem that ensues once the santa monica location opens its doors, my friend and i were thrilled to check out the new culver city location.  . . our choices: the warm duck confit salad (served with toasted hazelnuts, figs, citrus vinagrette) for $12.50, the office burger at $12, sweet potato fries at $6.50, and our respective beers ($8)- a hitachino white ale for me, a heifeweizen for my galpal.. . - the duck confit salad (a special menu item): the duck (and skin!) was extremely moist- all that delicious fat-, and the texture of the nuts and figs matched well with the protein.  . . - the burger (cooked to medium), was excellent- i love the sweetness of the carmelized onions.  however,i would have liked a slightly thinner patty, and thinner buns.. . - SWEET POTATO FRIES- a sexy menu item it seems.. were phenomenal.  served in the uber cute mini shopping cart and brown bag, the fries were perfectly crisp, sprinkled with a bit of parsley, and served with a great garlic aoili.  . . rundown+ father's office definitely lived up to the hype i've been hearing from folks, and the cool, casual atmosphere of the restaurant is extremely inviting.
