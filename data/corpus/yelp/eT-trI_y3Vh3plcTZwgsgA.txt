Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Recommended by Rachel Ray for a REASON. My absolute favorite spot in Â the Lincoln Park area. This cafe is always packed so if you want to get seating outside, good luck. Bourgeois Pig Cafe is adorable inside with two floors and old fashion furnishings. The staff has always been pleasant and efficient which makes the food even better. Everything on the menu is extremely fresh and tasty. Their cookies alone are worth stopping by for. I cannot explain how amazing everything is. Favorite place for a reason!
