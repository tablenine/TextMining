Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I'm not a crunchy taco girl.  But I believe there's a time and place for everything.  Especially on a date.  The boy was so cute to take me to his "favorite tacos place in the whole world."  It was his parents' favorite place and it got passed on to the kids.  Who am I to argue about fond memories? . . So, I get two tacos and a drink.  I dab my chips politely in the salsa.  Bleh!  No thank you.. . The tacos with the mound of thickly shredded cheese were...um, good? I mean, there's lots of meat.  Lots of cheese.  Some things I think are lettuce.  Okay, so they were.  And uh, grease.  Yeah, things that would make a good taco.  Okay, where's the real salsa?. . I really shouldn't have eaten the second taco.  But the boy paid for two and damn, I didn't want to waste his couple of bucks. . . Five stars for the date.  But let's get real, the tacos kind of sucked.
