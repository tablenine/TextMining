Yes yes, the XLB is amazing here. Juicy pork is exactly that - juicy! How they get the dumpling wrapper to be both thin and firm/chewy is a food mystery.. . However, the most memorable part of my meal here was the red bean dumplings!! The perfect end to the meal. Warm red bean paste wrapped in that magical dumpling wrapper and steamed. They are so freaking good, especially to a dessert fanatic like myself. And this is one dessert that won't make you feel too guilty after eating it... well, unless you ate the whole tray of dumplings. ;)
