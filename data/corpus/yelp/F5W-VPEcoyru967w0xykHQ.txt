A line out the door and many raves from my friend, we had to stop here on our movie/shopping outing.  I had no idea what to order, so I told her to surprise me and pick some things out.  . . Potato Balls . Guava/Cheese Strudels. Cheese Rolls. Raspberry Cheesecake. Tres Leches. Media Noche Sandwich. . What a great combination of food.  The Potato Balls were amazing...the great flavors that are inside were a nice surprise, the Guava &amp; Cheese Strudel, Raspberry Cheesecake and Tres Leches definitely satisfied my sweet tooth.  It's a good thing that we walked home, I'd probably be in a food coma otherwise!  I'd come back and wait in line for the food and great prices.  It's a good thing that I don't live close enough to go back on a weekly basis, a good chunk of my paychecks would probably be deposited here!. . Now I just have to wait to visit my friends again...
