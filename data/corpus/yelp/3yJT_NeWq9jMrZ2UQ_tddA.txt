Restaurant: Medici On 57th
Category: Bakeries
The food is pretty terrible, but bearable when you are a student at University of Chicago. I enjoyed the Kimba salad well enough on numerous occasions. I'll give the restaurant 2 stars and the bakery and pizzas 3 stars. Note: It's all about the spinach and goat cheese pizza.
