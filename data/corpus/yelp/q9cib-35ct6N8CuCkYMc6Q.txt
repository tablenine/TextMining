Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
This institution has stood the test of time under the watchful eye and palate of 1998 Food &amp; Wine Best New Chef, Lee Hefter.  Nothing more classic LA, than spending a Friday afternoon on the patio of Spago.  And maybe if you are lucky you can secure one of their signature spicy tuna tartare cones.
