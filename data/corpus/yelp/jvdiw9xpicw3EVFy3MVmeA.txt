My friends love this place. They take pretty much everyone who visits them in town here and they have befriended the staff and chef. After months of telling me how great it was, we finally had a chance to go.. . Its pretty good. I had the ribs and they were well made, falling off the bone. The presentation was kind of lacking as it came out as a stack of meat. I never feel self conscious about eating my ribs, but tearing into the pile was an odd experience. It also didn't come with any sides, which was a little disappointing. Especially given the ribs are not typical BBQ but a milk and honey inspiration. Don't get me wrong, I liked the way they tasted, but I could have used a complimentary flavor on my plate to give my taste buds a break.. . I had a few bites of my friends meals and they all seemed ok as well. My buddies favorite dish is here is basically a giant plate of seafood. I think part of the appeal for him is a big bowl of meat and no fear of carbs.. . The first bottle of wine we had was very good and even their house cab was a good quality. The wait staff new their stuff and did a great job.. . Its hard to say why I can't bring myself to give more than 3 stars. On the outside looking in, I had a great dining experience. I am probably going to need to go back again and figure it out. Right now this seems like the Italian place people fall in love with because it was the first one they tried that wasn't Olive Garden.
