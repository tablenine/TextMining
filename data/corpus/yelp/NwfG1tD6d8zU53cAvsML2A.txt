So i was down here to visit some fam and they ended up bringing me here so i can try it. We had gone on a sunday so what do u expect on the weekends, the long wait. Service was ok. I ordered the whole snapper and gosh that thing was huge, a lil dry. But no prob just put alot of lemon juice and salsa and ur good to go. The pina colada was delicious. My uncle was not satisfied with his langostinos he said they looked like tarantulas so he did not eat them. My aunt and cousins were just like oh well, we got to go out.
