Restaurant: Taqueria del Sol
Category: Tex-Mex
Probably my least favorite location in comparison to Howell Mill &amp; Decatur, but still the same long wait, the same stroooooong margaritas, and the same great tasting food that keeps me coming back for more. . . My favorite dishes that you can't miss out on.... Brisket Enchiladas with red chili sauce. Shrimp Corn Chowder. Almost any of the Blue Plate Specials. Queso Dip . Fish Tacos . . If you live in Buckhead/Brookhaven/North Druid Hills area, this is your Taqueria...Enjoy it. Eat @ it. Regularly.
