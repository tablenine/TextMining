I've been here twice. the first time i was amazed and would've given it 5 stars. but the last time i came (which was a couple years later) i was so disappointed. first off why are the plates 700 degrees? just bring my food out after it's cooked, i don't need my food steaming into my face while i wait 10 minutes before i can eat. finally when i think it's safe, i spoon a mouthful of corn into my mouth and of course, burn my tongue. great, still hungry and my tongue is burned. . . i had the porterhouse which again, used to be amazing but now, is just ok. . . the creamed corn is good. . but the tuna tartar was the worst thing. so gross and unimaginative. there was so much avocado that the tuna became creamy. . . the best thing here is the bread. . this is a classic LA restaurant but there are much better places to eat and spend your money.
