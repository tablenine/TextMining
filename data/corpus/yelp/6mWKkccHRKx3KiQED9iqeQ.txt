LOVE LOVE LOVE at first visit.  I could not be happier to have finally found a place like this in my neighborhood.. . I went on a Tuesday night to study from about 7:30 till 10.  When I arrived it was about half full, with people spread out on the patio, first, and second floor.  It's definitely one of those places where things work in a very unique way, and the staff is going to know immediately that you've never been there before.  But everyone I interacted with was very nice and helpful.  I started by ordering the Merchant of Venice, which I requested to add giardinera to (which they did, sparingly, but at no additional charge).  I picked this one partly because it came in half or full sized, and I only wanted half.  About 1/3 of their sandwiches come in half size, I guess based on ingredients and cooking methods.. . After you order, you go sit down and they bring it to you.  So I found a cozy seat upstairs and got situated with my study materials, and before I knew it my sandwich had arrived.  It was fabulous.  Every bite scrumptious.  They use Boar Head meats, which is a major plus.  And the sandwich came with a pickle on the side.. . Later in my study session I went back down to peruse the extensive tea selection and wound up with a fabulous cup of black tea, in a variety I had never seen before.  And I couldn't pass up a cookie, which was absurdly sugary, soft, and huge.  I had to throw away half of it to stop myself from gaining 10 pounds on the spot.. . And as others mentioned with extreme accuracy, the fellow patrons are uber friendly and will likely chat you up if you make eye contact.  Also, the music is much quiter than the typical commercial cafe, which is fab for studying or reading.  . . I'm so happy to have found a place that might actually give me motivation to study!
