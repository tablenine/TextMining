Restaurant: Dante&#39;s Down the Hatch
Category: Fondue
Dante's is by far one of the coolest restaurant experiences that I have ever had, but the place is ridiculously expensive (at least on the college student budget.)  . . I personally think that they should give a discount on the food because the portions are rather small and you do have to cook your own food.  Isn't there a labor fee that goes into your meals preparation? I think it is 30% off of the original price.  I am going to bring that up the next time I am here.. . Lots of meat and cheese here too that you can cook in the boiling fondue bucket.   . . Either way, the experience at Dante's is something that may actually be worth the money.  A small pirate ship to eat your food on surrounded by alligators is not an environment too many other restaurants offer.
