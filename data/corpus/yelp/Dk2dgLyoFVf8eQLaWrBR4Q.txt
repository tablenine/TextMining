Category: Seafood
never had anything there that's not good! everything there is delish~~~!!. great place to go with friends~ you will have a lot of fun! . the seafood comes with great flavor!! it's addicted!!! my boyfriend and i think about it once in a while and we'll go!!!!. The shrimp r cheap, but if you order other things list kind crab legs, then its gonna cost a little bit more. But I'll say it's worth it. . Try oyster!! Their oysters are sooooo fresh! really great quality!. and try their sweet potato fries!! it's cheap and comes with great portion. Delish of course!!!. the only con is that you can either go there super early, or you got to wait quite a long time!! the place is always packed! and the parking is not really easy to find either. I've waited for 2 hours before!!! ya,,,you can tell how addicted i am to those shrimps!
