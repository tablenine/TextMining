So now this is apparently the third time they've re-decorated since I've been going here (used to go when it was a dump), and the food tastes the same as always - incrediblissimo!  (THAT'S RIGHT! I made up a word!). . Maybe it's because they've never updated (i.e. cleaned!) the kitchen.  Whatever, the food was fantastic today for lunch.. . A few years ago I saw a minivan with the standard three snotty kids with the blond Moe haircuts unloading, I thought, "there goes this place, the suburbanites think it's "city cool" to go to ...". . But nope, despite some (good!) upgrades (the beer menu mostly) this place has stayed true to the food.. . Chicken burrito - six flags!. Side of fries with all the little extra potato crunchy bits - six flags!. Side of their housemaid BBQ sauce - six flags!. Burger and BM (bloody mary) for Flowers - six flags!. . What else can you say about a place with over 150 reviews and a 4/5 star average?. . Six flags - more flags, more fun!
