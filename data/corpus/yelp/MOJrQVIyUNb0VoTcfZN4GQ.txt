Restaurant: Taqueria del Sol
Category: Tex-Mex
It is truly a stretch for me rate and write this review as I truly love the food at Taqueria del Sol (specifically the Cheshire Bridge lcoation).  I freqent the restaurant and hope someone who can influence the attitudes of the employees will read.  . . Over the last couple of years it has continually bothered me that the employees just seem unfriendly.  As if you are doing them a favor for eating there.  I have multiple examples of poor customer service including locking the doors 5 minutes early during lunch telling me come back later, being rude about what seats to take at the bar, etc. However, here is the reason why I am taking the time to Yelp.  Yesterday I took my mother to lunch at Taqueria.  My mom has Multiple Sclerosis and a ruptured disk in her back (one of the many lovely side effects of MS is loss of balance) from a recent fall.  As typical the line was long and she was hurting.  I asked her to go sit down and I would order for her.  The person i believe to be the manager walked over to her and reprimanded her in a VERY unfriendly manner for sitting down before ordering. Her response was she was having back issues and needed to sit down.  His charming response was to ask where I was in line to determine if she could stay and that next time she should sit on the bench in area directly in front of the doors where people were standing making that impossible.  . . I get the importance to the business of not sitting until ordering, but this was not called for at all.  He was rude enough and my mom was having a bad enough day where she almost cried.  . . Good job Taqueria del Sol!  I hope more customers realize that good food does not mean you can mistreat your patrons.  When service is this bad you just can't get a "balanced score".
