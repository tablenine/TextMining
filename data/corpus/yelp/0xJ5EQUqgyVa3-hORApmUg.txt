This place gets crazy busy at night. You might have to wait a little while to get your food ordered and even longer to find a seat. If you manage to have patience for both, you are in luck as the food is delicious and filling. The prices are pretty good. However, for the same amount of money you could find a bigger menu and better service at few other Indian food restaurants down the street.
