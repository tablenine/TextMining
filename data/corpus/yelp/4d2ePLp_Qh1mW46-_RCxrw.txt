Pretty good place to get some Chinese-type food.  Order up some Sake and you will be feeling nice and warm inside.  The food was good enough but it is nothing to write home about.  . . Dear Mom, . . I went to Doc Chey's... it was pretty good, it was a little cramped inside, they had some cool tea to drink before I got my meal, I had a couple sakes, and the chicken and veggies I ordered were pretty delicious.  My whole group of friends seemed to like what they ordered!  We will most likely visit again.... . Love,. . Jon
