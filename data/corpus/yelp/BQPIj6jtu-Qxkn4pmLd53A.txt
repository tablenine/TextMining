How does this place have three and a half stars on here? . . So they've got an odd service setup. I, for one, can find my own table and walk to the bar to order my party's meal. I can pull off these amazing feats because I have legs, a brain, vocal cords, and I'm not a self-important jackass. . . The food is unreal. Is it the best burger in LA? No. Is it in the top five? Yes. That means it's really effing good. I don't remember eating something here that was anything less than delicious. . . And the beer? The beer selection is overwhelming, but the 'tenders know what they're talking about. I've been turned on to several of my favorites by eating at this place. . . Bottom line, this place is fantastic. The only thing missing is an attached hotel, so I could drink myself into a stupor, pass out in a room, wake up the next morning and do it all over again.
