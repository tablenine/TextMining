Restaurant: New Wave Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
The sign on the outside window (as of this writing).... . New . Wave. Coffee. Is . Open-Ish. . . "Open-ish" and it has 16 reviews!? Jeepers creepers, Logan Square DID need a coffee shop BADLY! . . Admittedly, I don't come to this neighborhood all that often...but make special trips to check stuff out. Loving free wifi, the area, new coffeeshops, Metropolis (yeeee, giddy), and bathrooms with real graffiti art...it was a must-see. . . The hipster ratio is high, ain't no lie. However, I do not find this to be a bad thing. In fact, I enjoyed quite much. Â It could potentially double as a Macbook store, there are so many of them in here. Many bike/messenger bags. Pop art that is ironic, yet strangely comfortable. Pink/black tiled floors. Shiny tables. All the hipster love, but very much missing the pretension. Awesome, I like my coffee with real cream, splenda and a bit of reality...thankyoumuch.. . Oh, yeah...tables! Hardly to be found, this place was jammed on a Wednesday at 3pm...insanity! But, like a good insanity, because they need to live long and prosper. They were booking in new tables for the expansive space as I worked. Good call, very good call. . . Metropolis coffee: be still my little caffeine-joltin' heart. . . Smallish food menu. Sandwiches with cool names like "Flash Dance." I giggled each time the counter guy had to wander around yelling out..."Flash Dance, anyone have a Flash Dance!?" I so wanted to say yes, and break it down...but alas...I was working, ok!? I did enjoy a bowl of the tomato feta soup, perfect to ward off the chilly day. . . Long and short of it: This place is pretty stellar in terms of coffee shops. I can only imagine they'll get better when they are really, officially and completely "OPEN-real.". . Well done. I'll be back. . . Metered parking is fairly easy, as is street parking (during the day).
