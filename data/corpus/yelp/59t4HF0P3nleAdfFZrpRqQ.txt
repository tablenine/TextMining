During our short stay in Atlanta, we really wanted to try some good ole southern food, so we picked this place due to all the raving reviews.   Not much more I can add to everything else that's been said.  I loved the side dishes, esp my cheese potato ham casserole.  Then there's the size of the meal in itself.  I could easily have split it into 2-3 meals.  One look at the size of the fried chicken breast (which looked about the size of my head) and I was already stuffed.  We also got the Arnold Palmer to quench our thirst - it was a tad too sweet, but still delicious.  Thank god we don't live near here cuz I wouldn't live a year due to my poor clogged up arteries.
