I took off a star because I don't like to wait.. Even if it is for a droolingly delicious breakfast packing every amazing ingredient.. . I'd eat here more often if not for the issue of timing.  It's in my neighborhood.  I do sometimes bring out of town guests.  You know how mere proximity to the Director's Guild.. . Sadly, after a film screening, when you would actually like the Griddle to be open for that wonderful French press coffee and a huge sharable dessert, they are closed.  We have to get in the car and drive to Sunset Plaza, or Cheebo, because Bean &amp; Leaf is already out of any decent pastries at that hour, when we should just be able to stroll next door to the Griddle.  Now I'm getting all riled up ..  and I may deduct another star, but I'm a nice person, so I'm not going to do that.
