Had two business lunches here this week.  Both experiences were very good.  Over the course of the two meals we tried the Chinese Five Spice ribs and the black tie sesame shrimp.  Both were great.  I had the fish special which was a smaller portion of cod that was lightly breaded fried.  I also was able to sample the Crisp Chicken #87 which so good that I ordered it on the second visit!  Service was decent and dining al fresco was nice....I'll be back here to try more off of this menu.
