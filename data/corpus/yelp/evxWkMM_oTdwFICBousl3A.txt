Restaurant: Shorty&#39;s
Category: Pizza
I stopped by Shorty's because everyone on yelp raved about how good it was. I grabbed a seat outside since it was a beautiful day and sipped some good ole' sweet tea. I decided to order two slices (pictured) pepperoni and chicken, and pepperoni and olives. The slices were ok. Its not one of the pizza places on my list that I would frequent. Its just ok. Service was ok. Parking is plentiful. Just nothing out of the ordinary to really grab my taste buds. :(
