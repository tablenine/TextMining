I want to give this place 3.5 stars.  The first time I came here, I absolutely loved it!  Came here with a bunch of coworkers so we were able to sample a good chunk of the menu.  I ordered the pork chops and I thought they were absolutely delicious - cooked just right with no frills - you really just get the three pork chops on a plate without all that other junk that's just there to sit and look pretty.  We also tried the calimari, portabello fries, chicken milanese, sausage pizza, penne gambler, and one other dish I can't remember.  I was so happy that I even ordered a chocolate souffle for dessert, which was also good.  . . My only gripe was that the place was so loud that I could barely hear what the waitress, not to mention my friend sitting right next to me, was saying.  But nonetheless, I liked it so much that I brought my roommates a month later.. . The 2nd time definitely wasn't as good... the service was lacking, and we got seated near the entrance to the dining area - we added a 3rd chair to a 2 person table so people kept walking by and bumping me.  My throat hurt by the end of dinner from having to shout in order to talk, and the food was just OK.  I'm hoping that was a fluke so I'm sticking with the bonus star for now.. . Oh yeah, and the delicious looking cupcakes and fruit tarts in the front?  They're just OK. (hm.. this is looking more and more like a 3 star review..)
