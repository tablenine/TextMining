Such a great idea!  Had the highest hopes, and the food was way beyond my expectations.  Just the right amount of heat in the dishes.. . The people that run Kogi are wonderful, down-to-earth type people doing this because they want to bring good food to the people.. . PLEASE SUPPORT THEM!  Good people who make good food deserve all the love they can get!
