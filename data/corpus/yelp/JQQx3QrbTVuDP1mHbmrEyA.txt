Dinner on a Saturday night:. . I was the envy on the group.  Two words: duck confit.  And let me tell you, had no one been there with me, I would have licked my plate.  It was really that good.  . . The bread and butter with dinner was contagious...we could not stop eating it.  Totally went into carboholic mode.  Everyone was happy with their dinners, though my friend had to send back her pork as it was a little too tough.  Not sure what that was all about, but I never heard another peep when her plate returned.. . My ONLY gripe was that our seats were right next to a step and my chair was literally an inch from falling off the step.  It was a little freaky.. . Otherwise, go and check this place out if you haven't.  It's not overly pricey, snooty or the anything else negative.
