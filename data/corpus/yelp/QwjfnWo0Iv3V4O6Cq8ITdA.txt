Restaurant: Andie&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Caterers
when i lived in ravenswood, i used to go to the andie's on montrose all the time.  the food was delicious and beautifully presented, as well as affordable.  for those reasons, among others, i cannot fathom why the owners would decide to open up another location, omit all the good qualities and hire sub-par servers and amateur cooks.  . . the hostess asked us if we wanted to be sat in the back of the restaurant while sort of implying that that was the only spot available - no big deal.  the table sucked as it was right in front of the exposed restaurant line, which would've been fine, but there were other and better seating options.  the server took our order and brought us our drinks.  he never came back to refill water or otherwise check up.  about 35 minutes later, i flagged him down and, before i could even open my mouth to ask for another glass of wine, he started apologizing  for the delay in the food. . . we finally got our meals nearly 50 minutes after being sat, and they were cold.  i don't know if they were just sitting on the line forever or if they were sincerely that backed up, but i saw a full staff in the kitchen cooking as well as another table of six who were also visibly waiting for their food.. . one of the owners came by towards the end of the night to refill our water and the hostess was giving away $5 gift certificates on the out,  maybe they were just having a bad night for whatever reason but, even though it possesses a much more sterile ambiance, the andie's on montrose is far superior in service, quality of food and price.
