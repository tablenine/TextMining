I was there a few weeks ago for my birthday dinner with some girlfriends.  And it was one of the best presents I have ever gotten!  Not only was I in great company, but the sushi was delicious - some of the best I have ever had.  . . Now not all of my friends liked sushi (I forgot about that when making the reservation, oops!), but there was so much more on the menu then sushi, that it worked out perfectly.  And from their reactions after dinner, they loved their meals just as much as I did.. . I love how it is a small place, but not too small.  It still had a good Saturday night vibe going on.  The staff was kind and courteous, which is always a plus!. . I would have given it 5 stars, but we were kicked out at the end of the night.  Now I understand it is a small place and people make reservations, but clearly we were not done with our dinner/wine.  People were hovering over us, which I thought was rude.  And it did take some time to get some of our wine opened.. . Overall it is one of my favorite BYOB places in the city and tops my list on sushi as well.  Oh, and the best, Best, BEST part is the price -- group of 12 girls, they each paid $20 (I didn't pay, it was my bday) -- amazing price for such good sushi!!!
