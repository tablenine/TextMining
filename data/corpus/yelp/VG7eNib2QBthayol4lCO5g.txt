Don't be put off by the long lines; they move quickly and the wait is worth it.  Oh my god: the french dip beef sandwich!  Nirvana on a bun!  This LA landmark has been here for over a hundred years, and for good reason.  The sawdust on the floor and the long, communal, family-style tables keep the atmosphere relaxed and friendly.  . . The only reason I am not giving five stars is because the coleslaw was somewhat mediocre.
