I got lured by the "tatchos", but there's not much more than your garden variety pub here.  Basically a good place to meet and have a drink or two, but I'd move on elsewhere to have dinner, you know?. . The Cajun totchos had shrimp, andouille sausage, and peppers and a cheesy white "sauce".  Still not sure what that was.  Tasty, but after a few bites I had enough.  I guess it's one of those things that sounds better than it actually ends up being.  We also got the smoked wings, but the sauce was sickingly sweet and I couldn't finish more than two.  . . I've never been a fan of this location (went here when it was the P.O.W), as it's nearly impossible to get a street spot when driving, and when walking I'm usually over on the other side of the park.
