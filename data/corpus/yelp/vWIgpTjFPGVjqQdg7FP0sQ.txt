This place feels like a high end fine dining restaurant, but the Italian food seemed pretty regular.  We went here for lunch and once seated, there were like 5 waiters standing around us ready to serve us.  The place looks phenomenal.  Large dining area, no separation.  It got pretty loud once the lunch rush was settled in.. . We got pizza and few side dishes.  It was all pretty good.  The pizza was a traditional thin crust that was crispy.  The Portobello fries, which nearly everybody on this Yelp page recommends, is very good.  The mushroom strips are battered, fried, and served with a creamy sauce. . . In the end, we were all impressed by the service and atmosphere more than the food.  The food was good, but not particularly creative or amazing.
