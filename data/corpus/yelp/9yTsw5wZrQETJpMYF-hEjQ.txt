Best pizza-by-the-slice I have had in the city.  Huge slice at a great price.  (NY style pizza) . . Don't expect much from the staff or the decor, just grab a slice and sit down -- you will not be disappointed.. . [They are open till 3am on Saturdays, so if you find yourself in Wicker Park and you are intoxicated...]. . Must try dishes: Sausage Pizza (I think they use cumin seed in the sausage)
