I don't know what happened with some of you when you went, but when I was there, I had absolutely no problems, and had a swell time. I was just visiting the city, and had found this place by searching online - and decided to wing it. I did not act like a "hidden yelper", "tech geek" , "cautious reviewer for a magazine somewhere" or anything like that--. . Here is what I found: The service was super professional, courteous and prompt. The ambiance, architecture, design, functionality: just perfect. It was clean, modern, visually comfortable on the eyes and comfortable, subtle, everything good. The food: was super good for the price: great appetizers- had the Tuna Tartare and the Asparagus. Their  Bellini champagne cocktail was just perfect, champagne of a good quality and well made. The portion was fantastic, not morsels of food, nor sloppy huge and disgusting. Loved the presentation.. . All in all, it was a perfect weekend late afternoon after walking around and  hanging out in the Village. The vibe was low key, not touristy or stressful or snobby. Absolutely enjoyed this place. A++
