An affordable alternative to the Food Life food court upstairs (which i like to think as Food Rip-off). A friend and I had EXACTLY the right amount of change in our pockets to get one bao each, and I had the mongolian beef. Â It was underdone, and pretty poor in the range of bao's i've had in my life. The filling was spicy, but other than that it was just a jumble of beef stuff that wasn't too amazing. . Fast service, pretty affordable for the Mag Mile, but I'd consider these mostly just as fuel.
