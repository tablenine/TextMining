A San Franciscan at heart, I recently made the move to So Cal. I was desperate to find a place that equals the chill atmosphere and tasty/organic food of the Grove, and the creative/ thoughtful/delicious presentation of Blue Bottle Coffee, and I think I've found it in La Mill Coffee. . At 5'2" I was a little disturbed when I sank into the booth seat and the table came up to my chin! I guess it's so coffee lovers like me could easily inhale the aroma of the coffee. The overall décor of the joint is chic, mixing vintage and modern.. The menu is a novel, but expresses knowledge and love of coffee that I appreciate.  I was excited to try the "Siphon" coffee, but decided against it since it was late in the evening. The cafe' o' lait had to do, which was mixed tableside and complemented my milk-chocolate coffee panna cotta dessert perfectly. . The dessert was amazing; a bit of chocolate crunch mixed with the creamy panna cotta and cool sweetness of the bailey's ice cream. Yum. The yolk-shaped coconut "ravioli" was also a creative addition.  . The prices were steep, but nothing out of the ordinary for quality products. I was use to paying those prices in SF.. I will definitely return to La Mill Coffee and try more tasty concoctions!
