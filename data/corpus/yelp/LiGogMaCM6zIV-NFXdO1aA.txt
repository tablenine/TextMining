I've given this place one too many tries and have been disappointed every time. I've purchased several different cakes here (tres leches, mango mousse, chocolate raspberry, pineapple custard, etc..) and they're all waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too sweet and just gross. I guess you really do get what you pay for since these cakes are super cheap (ranging from $13-$25). I'm never buying a cake from this terrible place again. I don't even know why I gave them as many chances as I did.. Their pastries aren't Â bad though, like the guava cheese one. The potato balls are pretty good too.. Just spare yourself the horrendous experience of tasting their terrible cakes.
