N wanted to have a birthday dinner here. . . I was apprehensive, because I thought this was be some trendy place where everyone repeated everyone's sentiments (smoke blowing in a certain direction), because they didn't want to be uncool and not like it. However, this place has it's own vibe and I'm hoping it sticks around for a long time. First, anything downtown with fresh carbs (bread) is going to be like catnip for me. Â . . The crowd was a mix of artsy, edgy, suburbanite, wannabe New Yorkers, Cashmere Mafia and women that think Sex and the City was a to-do list. Curiously, it works. . . The staff-I cannot say enough nice things about the staff. They were so amazing. We had a party of 7 and they made sure they did as much as they could to make Miss N's birthday special. . . The food-I had to try to portabello fries. They reminded me a little of fried chicken gizzards, but in a good way. Look, I haven't eaten organ meats in over a decade, but I had a love/hate relationship with gizzards. The portobello fries have the earthiness of fried gizzards without that the icky, organ-y texture. . . Did I lose any of you? No. Good. . . I ordered chicken parmesan and haricot verts. I like to mess up my eating habits on the weekends. I'm finding, though, eating this perfectly tender dish was made even better, because there was no pesky pasta. I love pasta but after eating it, I'm lethargic. This was perfect with the haricot verts, although, the sauce was a little salty. . . Everyone in the group, loved their food and apparently, the bartenders mix a mean drink. . . This is a wonderful, lively, eclectic place that will likely soothe anyone's savage epicurean beast. Alright, alright, it's a nice place with good food.
