I'm of the humble personal opinion that the more you pay for Vietnamese food,  the less satisfaction in the end. Some of the best pho I've had cost well under five dollars. Don't get me wrong, this place is okay, but the smart money doesn't go near it. I don't need all the hipness, I just wanna eat, then go home and have sex like any other red blooded Asian American male. . . On the mediocre service, well....small tips usually get the message across pretty damn quick. Like substantially less than 10%? If I was a waiter, enough of those and I'd get polite REAL quick.   . . By the way, I've often thought about opening a restaurant called "Pho Kyuu." That way I can surreptitiously insult obnoxious people and get away with it. "You hungry? I know this place called Pho Kyuu."
