Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
My bff and I decided to head to Culver City to hangout before we attended the Micheal Buble concert at the Staples Center a couple of weeks ago. Orignally we wanted to try Ugo wine bar but when we got there the place was closed for a private party...boo!!! What a disappointment. Was totally looking forward to trying the wine bar. But the hostess was kind and he suggested for us to try their cafe. . . Food wise, I would have to say that everything we ordered was alright, just mediocre. Nothing that really stood out. Â We ordered the caprese, calamari, a mini pizza, a meat ball dish and a rasberry mouse dessert. As for drinks we ordered the white sangria which was quite tasty. . . Service was pretty good. Our server was attentive and was helpful in helping us decide what to order. Overall it was an ok dining experience. Total was about $30 bucks per person.
