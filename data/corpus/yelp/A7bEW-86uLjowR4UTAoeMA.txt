Just hosted a party in the basement of Stanleys. Their staff was off the charts good. Great Bartenders who poured strong drinks and the food has gotten better over the last 6 months with new menu items. We had 40 guests and they let us play our music as well as decorate the place. Would Â HIGHLY reccommend this place for a medium size gathering!
