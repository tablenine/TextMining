Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
I am a total red velvet cake snob.  I've tried dozens of them and thought I found the winner at Doughboy's, except BOTH of them closed.  How sad!!!  Fortunately, the Alcove's cake is not only vibrant with the brightest shade of red imaginable but it tastes perfect.  The texture and amount of moistness is almost too good to be true.  How on earth did they concoct a red velvet so sinfully good?  I got a slice for my mom's birthday but fortunately for me she was getting over a cold and "made" me eat all of it.. . My BFF and I shared the chocolate crepes and steak benedict (I was thrilled to find something offered on the menu that would satisfy both my dinner and bfast cravings!).  We were very shocked that the steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  You'd think they wouldn't care to since it's bathing in all that creme fraiche and egg.  But NO.  They delivered.  A big kudos to them!
