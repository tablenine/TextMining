Food was not bad. Had the number 1, which is the pork special I think. We ordered To Go and it was an order large enough for 2 of us to share. I think it's a little expensive if you could eat the thing by yourself. (Also, my vegetarian friend basically ordered rice, beans, and plantains and that cost over $10). The plantains and mojo rice was good. The sauce on the pork was very citrus-y, which I'm not sure if that is how it's supposed to be. Food came out pretty quickly.
