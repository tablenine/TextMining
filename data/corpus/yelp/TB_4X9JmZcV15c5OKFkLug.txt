Went on a Sat. night..maybe not the best night..but people were standing around on the dance floor and NOT dancing..to pretty decent music..hmmmm..something wrong with that..just stay home. The actual place is pretty nice, like the outdoor area and decor inside.. . No cover, no wait for our group so I can't complain that much...
