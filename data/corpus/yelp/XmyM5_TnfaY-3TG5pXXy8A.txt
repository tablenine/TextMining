Restaurant: Blu Jam Caf√©
Category: American (New)
i find myself going out for "sunday brunch" a lot these days and let me just say BLU JAM is a great place to get it!. . its at the end of the main shops on Melrose and it gets packed! but we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a seat.. at first we were going to get the yelp recommended roma via paris and something else.. BUT we decided to ask our really nice waiter for advice.. and he said.. hands down Kamil's breakfast was the best!.. AND their french toast was the best he's had.. better than griddle cafe. . considering the owner is Kamil.. the waiter was right.. THAT MACARONI fried with egg, cheese, bacon, and green onions is soooo enjoyable especially those random crispy pieces of bacon and macaroni!!. . ON THE OTHER HAND.. i still think griddle cafe's french toast is better!!.. yeah this one comes w/ fresh LEGIT fruit.. bananas , blueberries, blackberry (yes singular haha) .. BUT.. it lacks that crunch on the outside that i enjoy so much.. but not bad... . super cute place.. I'LL BE BACK.. i love me some breakfast food.. and its served ALL DAY
