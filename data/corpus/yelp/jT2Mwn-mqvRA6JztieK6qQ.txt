i'm a huge fan of this place ever since i came here to watch the ucla vs. tennessee game (go bruins)! there are tons of monitors, friendly service, and the atmosphere is perfect for a psuedo-bar/restaurant. also, if you can make it, it's really worth hitting up the happy hour, otherwise the food is priced at $$.
