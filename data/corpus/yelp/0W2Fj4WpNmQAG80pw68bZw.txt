OH MY GOD! I can't believe it has taken me this long to review this place seeing as how I love it so much!!!! I've been coming here since I was 4 years old! I remember watching the guys make tortillas and it swirling down the glass case oven and before I went back to my table, they would always give a little ball of dough to play with. . . I must agree with most of the yelpers on this one, that this is NOT the most authentic Mexican food...far from it. I've ventured out and tried their enchiladas, tacos, and more which were all so so, Â BUT, there is only 1 item on the menu that will always please me, which is the Carne Asada. Yum yum, this steak is served medium-rare and comes out on a sizzling hot plate with an onion ring and a jalapeno on the side. I love eating this with their fresh hot, homemade tortillas. I make my "taquito" in the following order, tortilla, guacamole, pico de gallo, beans, onion, rice and sliced steak. I'm salivating just writing it out.. . For dessert, try the regular flan or the chocolate flan it's to die for.. . So, if you decide to take a chance and go there despite the mediocre reviews, please do your tastebuds a huge favor and get the carne asada, I highly doubt you will be disappointed and thank me in the end.. . Enjoy!!!
