1)  The Burger: . Overrated and a little expensive for what it is.  Maybe it's because I was expecting an amazing out of this world burger based on the rave reviews, but I think there are several places with better burgers.. . 2)  The Sweet Potato Fries:. These were awesome!  The garlic/aioli dip goes SO well with these, it's amazing crunch and tang when you eat them.. . 3)  Beers:. Got a nice and light "Yellowtail Pale Ale" (per bar's recommendation).  Crisp, easy to drink, and very good.  I'm not a beer person but from all the other reviews, this is definitely more a beer place than anything else.. . Other stuff... easy parking, nice environment, cool place to hang out.... . 4 burgers, 2 orders of sweet potato fries, one beer = $71.  Yikes.  But to be fair, I guess this is a beer bar above all, so for that, it's great.  Foodwise... I have mixed feelings.  It's not that it's not good, but it's just not outta this world amazing.  Definitely not the "best burger ever".
