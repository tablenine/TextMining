I can only say what was said before....Great Steak House and the perfect location for a night on the town.  I really can't even decided what my favorite entry is here, but each of them are soooo cooked to perfection, (The twice baked potato's are yummy too) You must try the chocolate cake here, even if you don't like deserts you will LOVE the cake.  Like I said great location, right in the heart of Chicago's "Gold Coast".  Take your date out for some steak at Gibson's then check out one of the many lounges or clubs in the area. A+++ service too!  Good times always here =)
