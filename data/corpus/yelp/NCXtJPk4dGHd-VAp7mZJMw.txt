Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I don't mean to offend anyone, as I am a religious man myself...... . That being said, the best way to describe the Pinks phenomenon is to liken it to belief in heaven:. . The only way to get to heaven, is to first believe in heaven, realizing how you have to live to get there, and then doing what is necessary to get there..... . .....The only way to get a Pink's hot dog is to believe they are that good, Â deciding that they are good enough to be worth waiting in line for an hour, and then going through with it.. . The atheist would say that the glimpses of heaven are self-induging delusions...... . ...Just as the Pink's naysayer would argue that the mere fact that you WAITED FOR AN HOUR pretty much guarantees that you will perceive the hot dog as delicious.. . And, just like the only way we know anything first-hand about the afterlife is from miraculous accounts from people having survived near-death experiences, many of whom are a little wacky..... . ......The only way to know if Pink's hot dogs really are delicious would be to ask someone who got one WITHOUT waiting for one, and, well, the only folks who do that are celebrities, who are usually equally wacky.. . That being said, I defer to my own version of Pascal's Wager : Even though the existence of heaven/deliciousness of Pink's Hot Dogs cannot be determined through reason, a person should wager as though heaven does exist/Pink's Hot Dogs are delicious, because so living has everything to gain, and nothing to lose.. . In summary: Eat at Pinks. Whether or not it really is delicious, after an hour-long wait, you will think it is.
