I'd been hearing about Watershed's fried chicken for quite some time.  My roommate went there on a regular night (not a Tuesday, i.e., not a fried chicken night) and apparently they were filming a segment for Good Morning America highlighting the fried chicken.  So I just had to try it.. . I could only get reservations for a Tuesday at 5:45.  By 6:15 the place was packed, almost everyone ordering the chicken.  I must admit, it was quite tasty.  Very juicy, the skin was crispy and carmelized (which makes me think they don't cook it all in a big deep fryer, but rather individually in iron skillets.)  It came with biscuits, mashed potatoes and green beans (the beans cooked to perfection.). . I'm only giving it 3 stars, however, because it just didn't meet my high expectations.  Although good, it's not something I would go out of my way to eat again.  . . I've been there for brunch as well - the grits are the best I've ever had, the french toast mediocre, but they make a great bloody mary.. . Ambience is chic, but not to trendy.  Would dine there again without a doubt, but will probably order different dishes.
