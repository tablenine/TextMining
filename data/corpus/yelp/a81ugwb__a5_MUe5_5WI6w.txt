GREAT FOOD, FANTASTIC SERVICE, AMAZING VIEW! . . Going up the hill... trying to find the restaurant... we were getting amazed on how beautiful the view was. Finally there... we went in and noticed the professionalism of the staff, very organized and highly decorated atmosphere. . . We ordered a bottle of wine, sushi, oysters, salads, soups, Mouth Watering Tender Filet Mignon entree + Salmon entree and ending it off with desert. I have to say that this is a VERY PRICEY restaurant. . . We ended up paying around $335.00 for just two people... do note we did order a lot of food and a bottle of wine. . . I do remember one other thing that was quite amazing for me... going towards the restroom (to freshen up). I noticed a Garden Like enclosure within the restaurant's middle... with beautiful decorations of Asian Culture. Continuing towards the restroom... headed down the stairs... was also very decorated and very clean. . . Overall, I highly recommend coming here during special occasions... but don't forget to bring couple hundreds, since they are really pricey. . . Oh yeah, THE VIEW! After we were finished, we headed outside... and just looked at the Spectacular view of LA! Amazing! . . A+ . 5 Stars
