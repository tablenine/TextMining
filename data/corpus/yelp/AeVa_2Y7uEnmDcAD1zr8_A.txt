Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
The Majestic's slogan is "Food that Pleases." Well, it's definitely... food. I guess.. . There are only two reasons to eat here: . 1. You're a tourist, and want to eat somewhere iconic in Atlanta. (Fair enough.). 2. The bars have closed, it's 3am, and you're starving.. . The last time I ate here, we sat at the bar and our cook had a BAD case of plumber's crack. My hash browns arrived and for some reason my appetite had vanished... Hmmm.... . Of course, when you're drunk, the food tastes freaking delicious. However, when you're drunk you also think the coked out hipster you met at MJQ is actually a hottie.
