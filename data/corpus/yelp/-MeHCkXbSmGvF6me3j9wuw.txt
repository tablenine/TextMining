I've been here four times.  Each time with different people.  Every time has been incredible.  You will find great service and delicate, thought-out combinations of flavors.  The squash ravioli is one of my top 5 meals ever, sadly it's seasonal but enjoy it when you find it!  Listen to the specials- they can be really tasty.  . . This place lives up to its reputation, and is worth going to for special occasions.  I wouldn't go every week;  the dishes are very particular and you don't want to really enjoy them when you do head over.
