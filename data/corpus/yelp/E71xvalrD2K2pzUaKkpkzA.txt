I always love it here...cud not stop eating even though I was full.... . came to celebrate my birthday so of course i got to wear the (too small) garlic hat &amp; they took my photo w/my FREE ice cream!!! . . start you off with FREE bread which you must have with the raw garlic at the table.... Garlic Roasted Prime Rib...good . Baked Portobello Mushroom...eh. Garlic Encrusted Baby Back Ribs...delish! . Custard flavored pudding w/strawberry sauce...delicious! . Garlic Ice Cream...didn't taste the garlic till the end...interesting...i loved it but none of my friends did. . Always have a good time here!
