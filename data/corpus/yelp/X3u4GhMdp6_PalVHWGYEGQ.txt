The thing about Katsu-Ya is it's good.. That's it.  That's it's biggest weakness for me.. It's just good.. I constantly hear about how wonderful it is and whatnot, but in my experience "which admittedly is limited to only two visits" it isn't all that.. . Creamy rock shrimp tempura was on point, and everything else was pretty good "love spicy tuna almost anywhere, don't know how u can mess that up".... . I guess my issue was the hour long wait at around 1pm on a weekday and the waitress having a bad attitude.. . You know, I have to say at this juncture that in all honesty, food tastes better when it is served by pleasant people.  Does that make sense?  No?  Am I the only one?  it's possible :) lol. . Anyway, I think everyone should try it because the reviews are pretty mixed and I could have just gone on the wrong day twice :). . Still, they will get away with a 4 star because I can see the potential and I keep beautiful company, so the lunch wasn't a total bust lol :). . For the quality and amount of food we got, we didn't think it was worth the price ($100 with tax &amp; tip).  Plus the long wait and bad service didn't help much.  Katsu-Ya used to be one of BF's favorite sushi spot (the other one is Hide).  But both of us were quite disappointed with this visit.  We probably won't be back to Katsu-Ya anytime soon.
