The food was great, and the service was really speedy as well.  I thought they may have tried to pack too many tables into the place the night we went, because we couldn't even get the chairs out at the table we were initially sat at.  After requesting a move though, we were given a little more room, but you could still hear every conversation going on in the room.  I also enjoyed going across the street to their bar for drinks post-dinner.  I can't remember the name of the drink I ordered, but it comes in a "clay" bowl, quite tasty and very full of booze...
