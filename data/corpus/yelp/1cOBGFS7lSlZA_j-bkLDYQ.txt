Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
This place is so good! I've been here a few times already and the only complaints I have are that it is not in my area and there's only one Cemitas Puebla. . . I've had the steak but my favorite was the milanesa, breaded pork chop. It comes in a big sandwich bun with lots of cheese and some kind of delicious avocado spread.. . The owner is a nice guy and he had a pretty sweet mustache back in the day because the walls are covered with his pictures.
