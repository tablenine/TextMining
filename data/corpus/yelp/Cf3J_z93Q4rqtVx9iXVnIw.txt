Restaurant: Chops
Category: Seafood
Another of the Buckhead Life Group restaurants, Chops is positioned as one of the fine steakhouses of Atlanta.  And it is.  Though pricey, my experience with the cuisine, waitstaff and dim lighting and dark wood was quite agreeable.. . Is it mindblowing?  No.. . Was the Kobe steak I had cooked in a fashion to maximally release its flavour and essence... nope.. . But it was quite good.  My favourite steak experience remains at a Chili's in north Texas.  Scary, eh?
