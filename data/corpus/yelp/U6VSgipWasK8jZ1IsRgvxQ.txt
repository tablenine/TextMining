Check out the Happy Hour menu!  You cannot beat 1lb lobsters at cost.!  I have been here many times and the lobster is AMAZING.  The most I have ever paid for a lobster is $12!  I have also paid $10.50!  . . I you love seafood, you have to come here.  Great menu, reasonably priced menu and great service. If you like oysters, they are amazingly fresh!
