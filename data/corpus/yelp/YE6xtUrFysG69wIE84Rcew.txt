a friend and i decided to check this place out. i've been driving past it regularly and was curious as to what was going on under the blue line. . . we shared the kim chii and the brussel sprouts. i don't eat pork but this was good, tried to eat around the chorizo but it's everywhere. i had the quinoa salad and the chicken soup. these were great. the salad is light but satisfying and the soup is perfect on a chilly day. the hominy and the tortilla strips added some great texture and there's enough spice to give it flavor. we also had some desserts - the blond brownie was so delicious, my friend said it even tasted smoky. he had the chocolate chip bacon which he liked too. the soft serve that comes with it is fine, nothing outstanding, but not really connected to the korean/puerto rican-ness of the other dishes. . . the space is also really interesting to look at and has a very industrial, diy feeling. as mentioned by others, it does feel a bit like it wants to be new york and there is very little reference to the korean/latino flavors in the decorations. the bathrooms are also a bit odd with high tech light switches and odd music playing. my only real complaint is the seating. there are only stools to sit at and while they are funky to look at, for someone with a back problem like me, they can be awkward for long periods of time. a few chairs please? . . overall i'd say go check it out, try some new flavors, and enjoy a different ambiance.
