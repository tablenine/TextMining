Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I know it's a LA institution so before you start sending me nasty emails please understand that I can't justify standing in line for 45 minutes on a weekday mid-afternoon while the people slinging the dogs seemed to care more about socializing than getting the food to the masses.  . . I can't justify getting my bacon-chili-cheese dog almost an hour later and having trouble finding the actual hot dog in the mess that is the heap of chili and bacon on a bun. (And really that's all I tasted)  The toppings should be an addition to the flavor of the dog, not hide it completely. (poor little thing). . I can't justify being really really full STILL, five hours later. That just can't be good for your digestive system.. . Sorry, it may be history and I will treat it with the reverence it deserves but I won't eat there again unless guests want to go there.
