Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Growing up on processed suburbanite pizza my entire life I was never a true fan of Neapolitan style gourmet pizza but wow Mozza is good stuff! We had 4 pizzas and an assortment of appetizers and they were all amazing. In order of best to worst I'd say I loved the funghi pizza, the salami with fresno chiles, the speck jalapeno pineapple (alla benno), and finally my goat cheese onions garlic bacon pizza (the cheese didn't quite work). The crust on these pizzas is amazing, light airy and very crispy. Something this good doesn't last and sure enough it tasted awful eaten cold the next day. . . Appetizers were equally amazing, the mozza caprese was soft rich and fresh with whole tomatoes bursting with flavor. I am sure they brought this over from next door in the Osteria's homemade mozza bar? White bean pate on crostata was incredibly smooth and delicious and the fried squash blossoms were perfectly cooked. . . The only downside was ordering dessert wines at the end which were pretty bad. Cheap moscatos were the only option and one drier wine had a lovely nose but tasted like petroleum. Disappointing but not a dealbreaker.
