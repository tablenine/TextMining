Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes. . That's really all you need to know.. . Culver City has needed a few more restaurant alternatives.  Situated next door to Ford's Filling Station, Tender Greens offers a much lower-key option.  The simple menu and informal atmosphere are perfect for a healthy lunch.  The hot plates are consistently good and the salads are standouts.
