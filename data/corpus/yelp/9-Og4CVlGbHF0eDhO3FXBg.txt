i absolutely love this place, the whole idea of it makes me tingle inside and out. I love garlic and enjoy almost everything in the resurtant, i've had a few bad dishes but not to many. The 40 clove chicken was a bit dry the time I had it. I love there seafood, just make sure they don't over cook it. Mention that and they make sure your food comes out perfect. Plus they are garlic ice cream!!!!!!!!
