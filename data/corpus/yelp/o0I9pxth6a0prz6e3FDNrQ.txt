Oh my. What a great experience. We tried this place on a whim, but we were so happy we did. The waiter was very nice and the service prompt. . . Our first courses were simply amazing. I had a pig trotter and spinach salad. It was served with a poached egg and brioche croutons. It was stunning. Everything tasted marvelous. The lamb for the entree was perfectly cooked and the cassoulet that it was served on was heavenly. The desert was a take on s'mores with a chocolate mousse and Italian meringue, it was fantastic. . . I will definitely add this place to the rotation. I am so happy we went there.
