Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
i'm really pretty mixed about sticky rice.  when i was pregnant, we ate there like twice a week.  the bright yellow walls and slick red benches cheered me up when i was feeling all fat and grumpy.. . since the baby, we've been calling for delivery, and the pad thai has been tasting...well, just bad.  it's like they forgot the sauce or something.  i've noticed a weird, unappetizing aftertaste/aroma.  maybe they're burning the eggs?  never enough lime wedges either.  what is it gonna take for me to get good noodles there again... another pregnancy?
