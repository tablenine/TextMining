Noodle. . This is another one of my weekly musts. I go here so often, everything on the menu is just that good. I know all of my friend's orders and can expect just about anything to be well balanced between spicy and sweet. . . The tofu Chinese Lo-Mein Noodle dish is my recent crave. The tofu is marinated is some sweetened sauce and grilled to a consistent but firm state that goes perfect with the cooked noodles and fresh mushrooms and carrots.. . The pad Thai with chicken is another favorite with crushed peanuts drizzled on top.. . The dumplings make great appetizers and are not the sticky, rubbery ones you get at most neighborhood Chinese joints (blah). . . The lettuce wraps are okay, I've had better elsewhere.. . I once ordered wonton soup, hold the wonton, and even that was tasty. Seriously!. . The atmosphere is great as well. The best part is that it's in the heart of midtown Atlanta off Peachtree Street and you can sit outside on the long picnic tables or at the high standing bar tables and watch the cars drive buy or dream about owning one of the high rise condos across the street. Occasionally I sit inside when it's cold and play with the fiber optic cable lights dangling in my face. . . They also have daily drink specials and desserts, however, I would rather spend my money on the appetizer and entre. Although, nothing is too pricey and I'm sure if I had a big enough belly to hold it all in, I would splurge on the whole package, but unfortunately I'm only so big. It only means that I have to come here often to try it all eventually, which I do, so there. Perfect!
