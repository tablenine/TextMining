You cannot go wrong with the garlic chicken. Don't plan on sharing this because it won't happen. You definitely want this for yourself. . . Yes, the bread basket isn't something amazing but no one comes here for the bread. Since I've never been disappointed with the garlic chicken, I decided to venture off and try something new. The garlic shrimp is very tasty as well, but if you're looking for something filling, go back to the chicken. . . DO NOT GET ANYTHING WITH GROUND BEEF. I had serious food poisoning from the Picadillo a la Criolla (Ground Beef Cuban Style) and while it was delicious, I had a serious headache and was vomiting two hours later. I've heard the same story from a co-worker from one of his friends. Don't chance it and stick with the garlic chicken! . . Black beans are great and so are the plantains! I gotta buy the garlic sauce...
