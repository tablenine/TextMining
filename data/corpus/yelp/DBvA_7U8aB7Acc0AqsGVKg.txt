Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
This was officially my first prime rib from a restaurant that specializes in prime rib (rather than it being offered in a buffet line) and I must say.. I'm a FAN!. . My mouth still waters thinking about the succulent meat on my plate yesterday night. You basically come to this restaurant to eat meat (or seafood, but what for?). If you're one of the unlucky vegetarians dragged here by your carnivorous friends, there is ONE plate that is the spun salad... but honestly I think that's only on the menu as a joke.. . In any case, I ordered the English cut prime rib, which was essentially 3 thin slices lathered in anju with a glob of mashed potatoes. The Yoshire pudding was sooo tasty, perfect for sopping up the anju and gravy. . . Oh yeah, $6 valet parking only.
