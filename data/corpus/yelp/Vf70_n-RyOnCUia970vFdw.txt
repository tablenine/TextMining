Restaurant: Roasters
Category: Southern
Everyone kept telling me this was th best place for Southern food.  The menu looked great - all my Southern favorites including country fried steak, fried okra, casserole. etc. But anyone who's ever eaten at the chain restaurant Black Eyed Pea will probably like that place better. The menus are identicle, but Roaster's is just one step down from Black Eyed Pea. Meaning the rolls and cornbread aren't as moist, the baked potato casserole was burnt on the bottom ,and the gravy wasn't as thick.  OH, and not to mention the knat that flew right into my mashed potatoes.  (I promise! Ask my dinner date!)   It was indeed Southern food but I don't think they got it quite right.  The service was great , though and very friendly.  Oh, and it's the only casual place that I know of in Buckhead that's not fast food.
