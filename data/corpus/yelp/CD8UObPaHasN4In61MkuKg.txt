Good god this is expensive and pretentious.  Greatly dislike it.  It's like a supermodel of coffee-drinker-ies.  Total showoff.  Full of really young, hotties, so that's interesting.  Very LA, if that's what you want.  It's like five dollar cookies that no one is eating because they are all on the cleanse. Boo.
