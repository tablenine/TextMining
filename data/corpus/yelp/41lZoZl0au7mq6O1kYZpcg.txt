This is the BEST bakery around and we are from NorCal!  This is a must stop when we any where around SoCal.  Haven't been to the Glendale location since the Burbank spot opened up but either one, you can't go wrong!  I only wish that they would consider opening up a place in NorCal!. . On our last stop here, I didn't know how I was going to bring everything back on the plane but I did.  My son and his girlfriend brought home probably half as much each.  I was thinking I could bribe the TSA person if they gave me a hard time.  I brought home 7 dozen pastries plus chicken empanadas and potato balls.. . I think one trip down by car, we went there for breakfast every day, lunch twice and of course, another stop for the family up north.  A must for us is the cheese rolls, guava cheese rolls, potato balls, chicken empanadas, pastrami and cubano sandwich, red velvet cupcakes, chocolate croissants and carrot cake.  My niece ordered her beautiful wedding cake here and it was carrot cake - very yummy!  I've brought the beautiful fruit tart to my uncle's in Long Beach for our dessert. . . You can't go wrong with anything here!  The lines look really long but they go quick, choose either side because you can get anything in either line.
