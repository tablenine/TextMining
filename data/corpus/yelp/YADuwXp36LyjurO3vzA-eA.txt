Honestly, the wait is insane. Yeah, the SHRIMP is good but is it worth the 2 hour wait? No.... . It's a fun place to go with friends. And be ready to get dirty.. . Take outs take way less time, so if you don't mind your house getting trashed with the sauce, do it. My best friend is so crazy about its shrimp that she and her boyfriend take them to go. That's when I tag along and get my Boiling Crab fix :P
