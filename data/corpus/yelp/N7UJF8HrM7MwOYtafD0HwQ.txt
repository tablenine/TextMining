Girlfriend took me here for my birthday. The food and service were great. I lived in Old 4th Ward for years, so I'm happy to see quality restaurants (2 Urban Licks is in O4W as well) popping up in the 'hood. Try the truffled deviled eggs on the bar menu. I had the 3 Little Pigs as my entree, and it blew my house down - by that I mean it was really good.
