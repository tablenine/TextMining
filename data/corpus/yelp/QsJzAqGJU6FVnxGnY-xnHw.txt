Oh , the wonderful aroma of the Chinese Oven! Even if you aren't hungry, you will be once you get a wiff of this.... Trader Vic's takes me straight back to the seventies, and their food is simply delicious. I don't even feel like I am in Atlanta when I am here, and that is definitely nice sometimes. And the drinks....to die for! But be careful, they aren't as innocent as they look!. Yum!
