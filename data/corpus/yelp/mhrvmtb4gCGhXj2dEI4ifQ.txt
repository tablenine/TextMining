Good Sushi. I am from southern california, so i LOVE sushi. I had the lobster box, which was good, but i think a sauce on top would have been better. . . The ambiance was just beautiful! Very LA actually. . . The service was pretty good too. No complaints. I am visiting atlanta again next wek and am going to try Sushi House Hayakawa based on Yelp Reviews!! I'll let you know how it goes!
