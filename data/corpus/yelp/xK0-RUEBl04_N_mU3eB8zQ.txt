i went here on a monday night for my birthday and the place with packed.  on a monday night.  who are these people?  do they have jobs?  amazing.. . this is a really beautiful and so-over-done space (topped off with a giant buddha in the back of the space).  as one of my friends accurately described:  the space makes you feel like a giant orgy is waiting to break out at any second.   unfortunately, it must have happened after we left.. . i just had a beer so can't comment on drinks / food.
