Restaurant: Doc Chey&#39;s Noodle House
Category: Asian Fusion
Doc Chey's is a middle-of-the-road "fasian" (faux asian) restaurant.  I call it that because they're another one of those identity confused places where they serve all manner of asian cuisine where they do an OK job at most of their dishes (I've tried both noodle and rice dishes there), but as a result, none of them are particularly spectacular either.  The price is at least reasonable, so from a price:performance perspective, they're acceptable for an occasional visit when I want something asian-ish but am too lazy to drive up Buford Hwy.
