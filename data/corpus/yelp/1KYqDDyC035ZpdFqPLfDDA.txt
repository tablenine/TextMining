*Review in Regards to Desert Only*. I work in Downtown L.A. and dropped by this place for desert after lunch. In their To-Go Bakery/Desert Section has small Pies/Tarts for $4-4.75 and skinny Eclairs for $2.00. Their portions are small so I expected the quality to be amazing for the price. Unfortunately, it was average. My co-workers and I bought a Key-Lime Pie (it's small like 4-5 inch diameter pie) and Chocolate Eclairs. We weren't wowed at all. In conclusion, over-priced deserts, I'd rather have Portos anytime. . . Pros. + Friendly Service. + Clean and visually pleasing interior and exterior design. + They make to-go sandwhiches. . Cons. - Over Priced. - To-Go Bakery Deserts has only 4 Choices but with each choice (3 diff styles). - Bland deserts
