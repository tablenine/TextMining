Restaurant: Fellini&#39;s Pizza
Category: Pizza
Best pizza in Atlanta. Great food, atmosphere, music, and hot tattooed cashiers/servers.. . To those who say there is no good pizza in Atlanta, screw yourself ... and go to the Fellini's on Ponce or Howell Mill.. . My favorite is the self-titled "Subcontinental special" - two slices with just jalapenos, parmesan and crushed red pepper.
