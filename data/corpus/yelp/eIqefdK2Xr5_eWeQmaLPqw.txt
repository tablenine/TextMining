Greatest thing about this place is its 24 hours. People like me need 24 hour places. Food is decently good. Most of the time you have to wait for a table and its first come first serve. I go a lot so I should probably give it a better rating, but I just can't. Its a 3 star place to me. Oh and parking can be a pain in the ass. But I do like it and I will continue late night dining at Fred 62 when needed.
