Mind-blowing Northern Thai. Clear broth-based curries served with a sprig of whole fresh peppercorns! Anything fish-related is great. I wish I went here more. Never did get to try the ant egg omelet ... . . Def one of the best Thai restaurants in the country. . . Whatever your persuasion - "Vanilla Thai", Adventuresome Foodie, or Thai Expat - you will not be disappointed!
