AMAZING. . . The food is incredible. The meat is unbelievably tender. My favorites were the filet mignon and the picanha. They also have the best caesar dressing I've ever had in my life and the mash potatoes are very tasty. Another bonus is the amazing service. . . I went here for lunch because it's a little cheaper but the selection is the same I believe and it's nice because Â it wasn't nearly as crowded as I'm sure it is for dinner.
