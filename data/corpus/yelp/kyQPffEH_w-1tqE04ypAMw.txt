Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
There's nearly 600 reviews now for Pizzeria Mozza, so I'm not sure how big of an impact my post will have on you, but here it goes!. . The pizza...delicious. My partner in crime and I shared the Nancy's Chopped Salad and two pizzas: (1) Coach farm goat cheese, leeks, scallions &amp; bacon and (2) Speck, bufala mozzarella, olive tapanade &amp; oregano. Both pizzas were very good, and as some have said already, the dough makes it totally worth it. The crust is light and thin and doesn't overshadow the pizza, rather it adds to the fresh, divine toppings. . . The prices were spot on too. I mean lets face it, a decent pizza at California Pizza Kitchen will run you at least $12, so $15 dollars for a gourmet pizza is pretty awesome. . . I did not give the restaurant 5-stars because of the crowd and wait. When you are forced to make a reservation for 9:15 and then have to wait an addition 20-30 minutes, it gets obnoxious having to eat dinner at 10:00. There is also no real area to wait for your table, so you constantly feel as though you are in the way of the staff and patrons. . . Other than that, the food was amazing and would definitely visit again.
