Mr. Mario Batali, I love your restaurant.  Yes, getting a reservation can be a bit of a headache, most of the time I still end up waiting for a table, the place is way too small, and it's an absurd $7.50/$10 to valet here, but once I take my first bite, it only serves to remind me why I it's all worth it.. . The Mozza Caprese is the best I have had anywhere yet.  The mozzarella is deliciously fluffy and fresh, and the presentation is as impressive as the taste by laying a branch of baby tomatoes on top a bed of cheese drizzled in pesto.. . The other must have appetizer for me and my group is always fried squash blossoms.  Lightly fried to a crisp but with no greasy taste, they're also stuffed with a little ricotta.. . Every pizza has been a smash hit, ranging from their version of the meatlover to prosciutto and arugula to funghi mushroom.  I doubt there is any pizza on the menu that isn't good, as I always end up picking at random whenever here.. . The famous Butterscotch Budino is the dessert that everyone comes here for, but the gelato, caramel copetta, and all others have been a fantastic end to a meal.  The best is to bring friends and share everything, but probably no more than 6 at best.. . I would suggest coming in the afternoon, between lunch and dinner.  Not only will reservations be easiest to get, but parking on the street will be much easier to save the valet fee.  If you have to wait for your table, go next door to the bar at the Osteria Mozza and grab a quartino of wine while you wait.  It's spacious and nicer than the bar at Pizzeria.  Eating here makes me want to try Osteria, but that will have to wait for another day.
