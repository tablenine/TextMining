Restaurant: Spitz
Category: Sandwiches
Spitz is great business with a good sandwich. Fits perfectly in Eagle rock and fills me up just fine.. . I have to say, it's not the doner you'll find overseas, but it's probably better not to get food poisoning for 3 euro across the street from a train station in Prague.
