Restaurant: The Porter Beer Bar
Category: American (New)
Promising Little Five Points addition that is typical L5P bullshit. . . My biggest complaint is of course the staff.  Its a "Beer Bar", boasting hundreds of different exotic beers, but our waiter was so effin dense, we had to eventually just pick something out on the menu randomly since he couldn't tell us a damn thing about any of the beers on the menu, and cringed when we asked questions to which he had no answer for. . One of the ladies in our party asked what their fruit beers were and he flat out said "I don't know."  No suggestions, no explanation, just attitude.  . . This is not what happens when you go to Brickstore or even the Bookhouse.  I would like to remind everyone that both of these "gastropubs" have good looking "edgy" staff- it is possible  to find people who look the part and have a brain!  It can be done!  . . Now the best part by far was the Ginger Lemonade with a splash of Vodka.  It should be pushed in the absence of a beer suggestion.. . Enough said about the retarded nature of picking out a beer at The Porter and lets talk about the food.   The menu is small.  This is normally a good thing in my opinion because it shows that restaurants have decided to master some choice flavors instead of attempting to bring the whole international food community to the table and failing.  Warning, you best be prepared to put down some deep fried something because there is nary a vegetable option on this typical faux British fare menu    At the table there were fries with cheese that were good.  Shrimp and Grits also delicious- Fish and Chips, once again totally yum, though heavy with the oil.. . In the end, if you are looking for a healthy amount of  deep friend dinner, a large drink menu with little guidance and the added hassle. of finding parking.
