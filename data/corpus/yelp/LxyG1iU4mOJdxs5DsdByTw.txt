Restaurant: Cypress Street Pint &amp; Plate
Category: American (New)
Let me start off by saying I love this place, I guess Im a little bias at this point in my life since if you have cheap drinks, are open late, and your lighting is dark as hell thats all I really need. I wish Cypress would drop the lounge part in their name its really just an open style bar with a bad ass patio. Its the most chill relaxed late night spot since Ive found since I moved to this city from New Orleans. I truly enjoy the late night atmosphere.. . Its a mixture of locals, industry people, and just late night booze hounds such as myself. If your in midtown and want a great place to wind down look no further. Brett is one of the best bartenders in the city drop in and say hello.
