Restaurant: Joy&#39;s Noodles and Rice
Category: Thai
Joy's is a nice, casual, inexpensive pan-Asian place within walking distance of my house. Is it the best, most authentic Thai in Chicago? No. But the service is good, they're BYOB, and in the summer, they open the floor-to-ceiling windows and let the glorious breeze blow in (which also facilitates excellent people-watching). It's one of those places that has take-out quality food, but is pleasant enough to actually dine in at. They're a lazy weeknight go-to.
