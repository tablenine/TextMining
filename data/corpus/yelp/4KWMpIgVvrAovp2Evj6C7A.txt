I love almost everything that they listed on their "special" menu board. What I like the most about this place is their creativity/uniqueness in their dishes on top of the freshness, priced reasonably. My must have items are the spicy tuna on crispy rice, the $22 foie gras w/ scallop &amp; Â asparagus (a bit high for only 3 pieces each, but it's worth it).. . I have to take 1 star out because they seem a bit inconsistent lately. Also, I strongly dislike the valet parkers that they hired/contracted to manage their lot.. . BTW, there's always a long line for this place. I walked in once at dinnertime, I had to wait for 2.5 hrs to get seated. Actually, they politely suggested that we should find another place to eat - but we insisted we wanted to stay. I never come without a reservation again afterwards.
