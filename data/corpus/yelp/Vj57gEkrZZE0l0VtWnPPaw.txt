Ah, to eat as an American.  To have multiple types of meet and 30 different carbs on one plate.. . Yum.. . Thus, Stanley's can help you with your intense craving to eat a lot of food on days when you really just need to do so.  I have only been to Stanley's twice-- and both on buffet days.. . While I certainly can't do it all the time (once every few months maybe?), Stanley's should be applauded for an array of buffet items that are not just plentiful-- they're damn good.  . . At the brunch buffet today, there was a fine selection of breakfast foods, complete with waffle boats and fresh fruit, biscuits and gravy, eggs, bagels, muffins, breads... the list goes on.  Delicious.  On the lunchier side of things, we found fried chicken (delish!) mashed potatoes, Caesar salad, mac-and-cheese, etc. etc.. . AND! the buffet was only $13.  Great deal!
