Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Ramen!. . Can you find a better place that makes ramen like this in the 626? Ajisen is nothing like this place. I don't think it can even come close! Great food, great service, great restaurant. They always greet you in Japanese every time you go in. It seems like they are screaming at you in Japanese, but they are just showing you respect and thanking you for eating in their restaurant.. . You can get your ramen any way you like. Soft, medium, or firm. You can get the soup base any way you want as well: light, medium, or heavy. You can also add as many toppings as you want, but beware all the toppings will add up and can make the cost to be $10 or more. You can also get more ramen for about a buck. I always have to get a second round of ramen. You can also treat the staff members in a round of beer. I believe this is a traditional thing they do in Japan. I have seen a few customers do that. I enjoy the environment.. . This is the place to go for ramen! However, this place can be crowded. So you have to be patient to get your ramen especially on the weekends!
