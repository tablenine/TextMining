The brunch here is delish and that is an understatement.  We had "Addicted to Noisella."  It's a french toast stuffed with hazelnut spread (or nutella) dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate.  It is seriously a party in your mouth!!!  We also had Omelette Pomodoro which had garlic tomatoes, basil, parmesan and we added turkey sausage and jack cheese.  It is served with potatoes and 2 garlic toasts.  The wait was about 40 minutes today.  We arrived at 11:30a.  Parking is behind the restaurant.  My friend got the french pressed coffee (w/unlimited refills) and she said it was really good.
