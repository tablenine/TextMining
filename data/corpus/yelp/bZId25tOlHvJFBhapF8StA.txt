Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I feel bad trashing this place because not only is this place legendary, but also the lady behind the counter and I bonder about her son who didn't eat meat. It reminds me of old LA. And it's surrounded by restaurants of similar fame. But the food just wasn't up to snuff. Maybe because I was sober. The clientele was all over the place, from teens sipping energy drinks to suited middle-aged Mexicans sporting buttons of their favorite politician's face. I'm glad I went, but I secretly feel guilty that the food at Cinco De Mayos might have a little more bang for the drunks and vegetarians. Come for the people watching and Ms Pac Man, but the food is not necessary for a good night with Tito.
