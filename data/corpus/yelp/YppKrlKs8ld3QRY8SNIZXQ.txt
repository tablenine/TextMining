I came here to redeem my first experience in which I was TRICKED into thinking a level 2 ramen was NOT spicy. How wrong I was. . . The pain. It still haunts me.. . So. Just to be safe, this time I ordered a level 7 which is zero spiciness (miso soup plus corn, char shu, bean sprouts and green onion). I didn't want to risk it. My mentee had the chicken and rice.. . To be honest, both were okay with the exception of the noodles in the ramen. I have to stop eating so much MSG but it makes everything taste so dang good! The soup was probably blasted with that crack because I had to drink a lot of water to finish the meal. The char shu (pork) IS pretty disappointing. A lot of my pieces were fatty or half slices. Slivers, rather.. . I like how the soup becomes a swamp of bamboo, bean sprouts and onion by the time you're done with the noodles. It was the noodles that won me over because of their INCREDIBLE chewiness and flavor. Those noodles made a distinct mark on my non-discriminatory palate. Trust me, that means a lot.. . I gave some of the noodles to my kid who refuses to try anything new. Even she liked them. And she is Mexican and has never had Japanese food. Ever. . . Her chicken was okay, a little dry. Neither of us were fans of the dressing on the salad that came with her meal - a salty and tart-ish vinaigrette-type dressing.. . Service is fast and friendly. Parking is a cinch if you go to the Weller beneath the plaza.
