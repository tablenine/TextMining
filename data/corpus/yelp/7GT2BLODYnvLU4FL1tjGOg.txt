Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The process of ordering food is stressful, due to the general snottiness of the staff, but once the order has been filled, Milk &amp; Honey glows with delicious.  It's basically like Weiner's Circle, but manned by eye-rolling hipster transplants in lieu of black swearing Chicago natives.  If you can get past the counter without suffering a bad-attitude-related nervous breakdown, highly recommended.
