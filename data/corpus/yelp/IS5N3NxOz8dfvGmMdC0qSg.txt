Came here on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Lazy enough that only 3 people were in line in front of me. Score!. . Ordered the Oinkster pastrami, Piggy fries, and a freshly brewed iced tea.  Tried the chipotle ketsup, hot mustard, and bbq sauce. Didn't feel like paying for the garlic aioli ($.50). The guy that took my order punched in my order as a combo so that it's cheaper. That was nice of him. Although I got more fries than I can finish , and the total still dropped my jaw a bit.. . First downside to this experience. The guy forgot to give me my drink cup. I thought ok I guess maybe it came with the food order, but no didn't come then either. I had to ask the guy dropping off the food AND the guy in the back to get my cup.. . The pastrami sandwich was pretty good. More on the soggy side which made the sandwich tough to hold/eat. Meat was tender and very tasty.  I could do w/o the cabbage though. I get all the crunch I needed from the fries. The Piggy was great.  The toppings were a good addition to the fries, and dipping it in the hot honey mustard sauce after made it even better. The tangy bbq sauce didn't wow me....too watery. The iced tea wasn't all that. It actually tasted a little weird to me..maybe sat in the holder for too long.. . So as you can tell some ups and downs from my experience, but in the end it's the food that mattered. It's definitely a place I want to share with my friends and family, but not a place I'd go very often.
