The tuna tuna salmon roll, gyu maki (kobe beef wrapped around asparagus...awesome!) and kani nigiri (baked king crab) are phenomenal. They also offer fresh selections of premium fish on the specials menu and the blue fin (medium fatty) tuna sashimi was exquisitely fresh. I always sit upstairs, it's more intimate with tables, a full bar and lounge seating. The downstairs is too bright. Yes it's more expensive than the average sushi place, but it's also very good. This is one of my favorite sushi places.
