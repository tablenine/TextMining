I've been here many times over the past year while working in the north Loop, and it's definitely a top pick for lunch at work. Three stars for a few problems that keep coming up, however. The dessert baos (right now Coconut Custard and Chocolate-Ginger-Coconut) consistently are soggy on at least one side, which is quite unappetizing - though when you scrape off the offending area, it's still delicious! I also keep wanting the drinks to be better, but they inevitably come down to a syrupy add-in.. . Positives, though, and there are many! The Thai Curry Chicken is still superb (or so my friend confirms, I haven't had one since I went vegan), as is the Whole Wheat Edamame. I am not even an edamame girl and I love those. And the filling in the Chocolate-Ginger bao is just heavenly -- just the right balance between the flavors.. Overall, definitely stop by and check them out.
