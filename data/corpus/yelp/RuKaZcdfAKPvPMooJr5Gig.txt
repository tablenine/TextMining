Went last night and it was GREAT! They have a $29 three course option where you get an app/desert, a salad and an entree. Great deal! We did the arctichoke fritters which were really yummy. Crispy with a lemon taste. Next we each had the mixed greens salad. Dressing is really good and they have figs and nuts in the salad. I had the Chicken Confit with Snert. I did not know what snert was and it is a way of cooking peas. The chicken was so tender and it fell off the bone. My friend had the trout and enjoyed hers as well. This is a brand new menu for them and we ended with a pastry with berries. Our server was awesome and everything was delicious! I will definitely be back!
