I have to give this place 5 stars for one thing on their menu:  GARLIC NOODLES.  The Dungeness Crab is pretty good too.  They are both off the "secret kitchen" menu.  I can't tell you about much else about the place because I always get the same thing.  But they don't "do" take-out.  And the place is pricey.  But those noodles are totally worth it.
