Not that this place needs another great review, but here it goes.. . The pancakes are very different....kinda eggy and fluffy.  Not my mom's but it impossible not to keep coming back for more. Yum!  The sausages are not spicy, so I tend to go with bacon or ham.. . My boyfriend is a vegetarian and he loves how many choices he has when he comes here.  He is a huge fan of the vegetarian biscuits and gravy.  He also loves the grits with white cheddar and the country fried tempeh.. . We would come more often if it weren't for the super long wait, but I guess that is also part of Ria's charm....the knowledge that you came, you waited and you are eating the very best!
