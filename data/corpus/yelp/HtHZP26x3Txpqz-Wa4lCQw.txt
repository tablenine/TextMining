Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Ugh.  Kitsch'n disappoints.. . One of my girlfriends and I settled on Kitsch'n for our Memorial Day hungover brunch.  She'd been here several times before, while I'd only been here one other time.  She liked it; I found it a tad overpriced and meh worthy.  But after today I won't be going back.. . Sure, it's Memorial Day, and sure, I expected kids.  But when we arrived we had to stand awkwardly in the doorway for 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged.  This gnarly beast of a woman gets an attitude, clearly upset that we were waiting politely in the doorway to check on availability rather than walk THROUGH THE RESTAURANT to the counter to accost her.. . "How many?  What?  Ugh!  Are you going to come up here or not?". . Just downhill from there.  After being crammed in the back, it took about 30 minutes for our food (tuna melt and a breakfast burrito) and I had to flag my server for a soda refill.  She didn't even offer for my friend the scant two times we saw her.. . And that tuna melt?  I'd prefer there be tuna to go with my raw onions.  Ick.. . Slow dismal service.  Overcrowded.  Children.  Expensive for what you get and not that great.. . I'm going to stick with the less chi-chi breakfast places and go back to my middle class mainstays where an egg is an egg and the service is actually decent.
