Can I just say Wow! Everyone was right about this place! The Hainan chicken is absolutely delicious. I can't wait to go back! At first when the BF told me about this place I was thinking "Ehhh..." but now I am totally in love. :). . -Hainan chicken: first of all, love that it's boneless. it's super juicy and tender and goes perfect with any of the three dipping sauces: soy sauce, chili, or ginger. I personally like dipping it in the chili and the ginger. You can ask the waiter for refills if you run out! The rice is also very moist too. The best Hainan chicken I've ever had!. . - Baked sole(?) in cream sauce with rice/spaghetti: this is good but probably something we could make at home. the sauce was very creamy and thick, and the sole was nicely fried on the outside and tender on the inside. It went perfectly with the rice, but somehow, it still felt like something was missing.... . - Shrimp eggrolls: these were yummy! Fresh shrimp wrapped and lightly fried! They weren't anything special but the quality was top-notch.. . I'll be coming back soon for Hainan chicken!!!
