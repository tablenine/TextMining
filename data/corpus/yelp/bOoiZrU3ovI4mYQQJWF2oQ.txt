I love this place, any time I go to Atlanta I always stop here. I have never had a bad meal here, and up until this past trip everyone in my family could say that. My father was pretty unhappy with his, but our server was very accommodating. The outside patio area was full and looked like a very busy section for a nice evening dinner or even a drink at the bar. Inside is a combination of a southwestern museum and restaurant. The food was excellent from the Jack Cheese Fritters (took the yelp advise this time) to my dinner, the Pork 2 ways. Fantastic! My Girlfriend had steak, and even with me not being a huge steak fan I liked hers too. If you can, save room for the Banana Enchiladas. THEY ARE TO DIE FOR!!!!!! Well maybe not that extreme, but they are really, really good. Great place in my opinion for a nice night out.
