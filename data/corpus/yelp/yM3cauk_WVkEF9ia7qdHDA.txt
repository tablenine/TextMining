same taste less hassle than the hollywood venue.  the staff is so sweet and courteous.  if you don't mind the oil, try the spicy tuna on top of the fried rice.  it's topped with a slice of jalapeno and is delicious.  after about 4 though, it starts tasting like balls of oil.  ewwww. . the baked scallops was nice crusted with almonds was also a very plesant experience.  A OK sushi is so easy to find in Los Angeles.  Good is very hard to find.  My test?  I order a spicy tuna roll.  no fusses, no frills.  they gotta get the simple stuff down pat or else who gives a damn about the tortilla stuffed cream cheese battered pickle roll?  . . Here's a sorta scene-y place that stands on its own too feet, humble and dignified.
