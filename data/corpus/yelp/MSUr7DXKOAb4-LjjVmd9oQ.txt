2 stars for customer service and dirty table lamps.  Same girl who served us a month ago.  Long blondish dreads.  No smile... same grumpiness.. . When we appeared to be done with our lunch she put our check on the table and walked away.  She did not ask if we wanted dessert or coffee.  My boyfriend and I got caught up in a conversation forgetting the bill for a few minutes.  Blondish dreads walks up to our check book-slams it open...sees there is no money/credit card-slams it shut and walks away.  My boyfriend gave her over a 20% tip.  I begged him not too.  He said it might make her happy.  I really doubt it.  . . Food was really good.  I had a breakfast burrito.  Boyfriend had tomato dill soup.  Mocha was good too.  The place was a bit dirty but we did go around 2pm and the seats were full.  A month ago it was dirty too and there were only 4 other customers.  We had dessert and mochas.  All very good.. . Just wish the service was better.  Maybe Blondish dreads is the owner?
