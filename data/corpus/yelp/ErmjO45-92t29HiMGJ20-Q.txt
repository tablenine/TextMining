this place is one of those places that I want to love. I really do. I'm already a big fan of thier bubble teas- they are so damn good. I love the color, the vibe, the set-up. The menu- not so much- so I took a star off for that. It's like a children's book. Every entree has a picture- sure I'm sure some people love this because they can see what their food is going to look like, but I find it rather annoying. Since they have such a huge selection it takes that much longer to look through. I would much rather see the words than the pictures. Sometimes the description looks a lot better than the plate. The food is good I haven't yet found that one entree that makes my eyes roll back in ecstacy and that's a must for my 5 stars. I also asked our server if my selection was spicy- he lied and said NO! No for you, but yes for me.
