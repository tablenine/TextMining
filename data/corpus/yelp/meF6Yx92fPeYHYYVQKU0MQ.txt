Restaurant: The Bagel Restaurant &amp; Deli
Category: Bakeries
I've been here probably 3 or 4 times, for breakfast only, and probably another half dozen to stop in for a bagel on the way to work.  This place serves good food with huge portions for breakfast.  Their omelets are ridiculously large, well worth the $8 price.  On top of that, they are definitely very generous with the meat they put in their omelets.  I love the corn beef omelet and will generally have them add swiss cheese to get a truly killer omelet.. . A couple negatives, as others have pointed out, is the service.  I drink a ton of water in a meal and really don't enjoy waiting repeatedly for refills.  I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt UNLESS it is a repeated problem.  On Saturday, it was a repeated problem.  I wasn't too happy about that.  Not to mention that our waiter wasn't exactly what I'd call "attentive".  Maybe this is a new-found problem, but in the past I've been more or less pleased with how quickly I've been seated (almost immediately all the time) and the service at the restaurant.. . On top of that, a couple other minor nits is the cream cheese that is served with breakfast.  When you stop in to order, they serve real cream cheese out of their deli case for a bagel; however, when you order breakfast in the morning, they give you two Philly Cream cheese packets.  Really?  Well that wasn't overly impressive.. . Overall, this is a good place to grab brunch and probably even better for other traditional Jewish meals.  Don't come there expecting diverse fair or creative seasoning, etc., but if you are looking for a delicious savory omelet, this is a damn good place to start.
