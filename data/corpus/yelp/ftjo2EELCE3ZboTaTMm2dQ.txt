Restaurant: Grindhouse Killer Burgers
Category: Burgers
I could see that this might one day be the Ben's Chili Bowl of Atlanta.. . Ultra-hidden inside of the Sweet Auburn Market, the easiest/safest path is to park in the lot directly in front of the market and get validated parking from the folks at Grindhouse.. . Super simple ordering process, which for me, looked like this:. . Step 1:  House made turkey burger. Step 2:  Single patty (with options for a double, or sliders). Step 3:  Topped with bleu cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, and bacon.  With a side of the Grindhouse sauce* on the side. Combo-ed up with giant crunchy onion rings and a lemonade.. . Have patience.  You can watch into the tiny little kitchen as they put together your meal.  There's only a person or two back there, and it doesn't appear to have space for any more than that, anyway.  Alternatively, park yourself at the counter and enjoy the random silent flick projected on the wall - in our case it was old school King Kong.  Awesome.  This is -way- better than a drive-in.. . During the lunchtime rush, I can imagine the wait being easily twenty or thirty minutes to obtain your food.  It was at least ten or fifteen when we went, and it wasn't busy.  But, hey, you can wander around and stock up on other delicious market goodies like fresh seafood and plump, delicious-looking sausages while you wait!. . * I never actually got to try this, since it never came out with my order.  But I decided that the bleu cheese and juicy well-seasoned turkey meat didn't really require any additional flavoring anyway, so I didn't make a thing out of it.
