Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Went to Coalfire on a suggestion of a friend, who raved about their thin crust pizza. Since I'm a continual quest to find the best thin crust in the city, this seemed like a great choice. After completing the meal, well...my quest continues. . Good Points: . 1) Good ambiance . 2) Half price wine night!! Stumbled in on that night and enjoyed their selection. Not a wine connoisseur, but half price anything bumps up the "complex medley of oak, juniper, and touch of rose petals dipped in honey" flavors . 3)Friendly waitstaff . 4)Proscuitto pizza. . . Bad Points . 1) Nothing special about their crust. After reading about the coal oven running at 800 degrees ...well just expected something different. But the crust is just seemed like a thin version of hand tossed pizza. . 2)Remaining pizzas, besides prosciutto, were also just okay in terms of flavor. My tastes run towards the pizza's with only small amounts of tomato sauce and cheese accentuated by some strong herbs. There sausage pizza just came out a oily mess with the Margherita slightly better . 3)High prices. Each of these pizzas which you could definitely eat on your own, costs about 15 bucks at minimum. For something different and special, that is fine but not for an OK pizza. . . but that is just my two cents
