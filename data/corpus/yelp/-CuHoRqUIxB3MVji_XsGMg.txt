I don't know jack about Indian food so ignore everything after this sentence.. . I hit this place up with some friends a while back.  Since I had no idea what I was doing I just pointed out one thing that sounded good (nihari) and then we got an assortment of other things (butter chicken, vegetable korma, samosas, a ton of naan, and mango laasis).  We ended up getting everything to-go as the table situation seemed pretty cutthroat.  . . I really have no frame of reference for how good the food is so I can't compare it to other places but I'll throw in my $0.02 anyway.  The nihari was a mixed bag - I liked the meat and it was deliciously spicy, but it was a too oily and the portion of meat was very small for the price ($6-7 for a small "meatball").  Not sure I'd order it again since it seems to be a bit of a rip-off.  The butter chicken was pretty good - it seemed to be a safe, but solid choice.  I didn't think I'd like the korma, but it was actually pretty decent.  The samosas were good.  The naan was quite delicious and probably the star of the meal.  Our mango laasis were good, but definitely a bit warm and liquidy (probably the drive home's fault).  . . Overall, it was good, but it seemed slightly expensive for the amount and quality of food that we got.  But all of this is still new to me so until I learn a little more and have some more experiences with Indian food.... . 3
