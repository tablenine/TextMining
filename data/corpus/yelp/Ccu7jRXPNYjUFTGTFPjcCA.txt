This is a great place to take a date or to impress a girl. The original owners built a Japanese home on top of Hollywood hills where one can come to enjoy the view of LA and West LA.There is also a Japanese garden and pond for ones enjoyment. If you want to come just for a cocktail, there is a bar where you can relax in. The food is average but just the whole atmosphere makes it worth going.
