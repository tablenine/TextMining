Just moved to LA and got word about this place from a friend that used to live here...that friend is gonna get a nice holiday card this year!. . Did the Sunday brunch thing and left extremely satisfied. Incredibly fresh ingredients, thoughtful preparation, very courteous service...all made for an excellent start to the day and no regrets for spending a bit more than one has to for a basic breakfast of eggs, bacon, 'tatos, toast and coffee.
