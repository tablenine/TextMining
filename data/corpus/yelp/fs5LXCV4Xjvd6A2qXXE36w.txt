Wish I could give a 5 star but I can't because they were out of cheese plates or any food at all by 10pm.  They were apparently so busy that they had to force their kitchen to close early.. . Um. sure.. . Stopped in anyway to have some wine - good wine on a cold night - perfect at Bin Cafe because they have pretty good flights.  The lighting is dim and noise level is excellent if you're looking to have conversation.  . . Our waitress was so great!  I didn't catch her name, but a pretty redhead with great knowledge on how to select a wine off the menu.  I wasn't sure that any of the flights suited my taste so she suggested a glass of D&amp;S and it was great!  . . Would like to come back for the food.  Maybe brunch - but I looked at the brunch menu and nothing really perked my interest - however, the bloody mary flight sounds interesting!
