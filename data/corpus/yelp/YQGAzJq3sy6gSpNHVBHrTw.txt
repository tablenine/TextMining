Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
Note: This review is only for the burger.. . After camping for a few days I came home and my roommate suggested we go out and get the Comme ca burger. He'd been raving about it forever and since the food wasn't exactly great in the desert I jumped on it. Wow, the burger is perfect. In a lot of ways it's a very simple burger but the flavors are complex and great. I got it rare and I'd suggest you do the same. The other amazing thing about it is you won't be hungry for 24 hours. Not only was I not hungry after, I was in a meat daze. If you haven't been in a meat daze before I highly suggest it.
