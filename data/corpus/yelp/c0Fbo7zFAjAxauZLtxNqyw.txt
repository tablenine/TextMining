5 stars because it was free and i didn't have to wait at all.  My office building downtown rented the Kogi trucks for our Halloween get together.  I was really excited because I had heard a lot about the Kogi truck.  I had the tofu tacos since I am a veggie.  They were really tasty.  Would it have been as good if I'd had to wait in line for an hour like most people do and actually pay for it?  hmmm...that's tough to say since everything is always better if it's free.  But really, they are tasty!
