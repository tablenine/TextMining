Restaurant: Bite Cafe
Category: American (New)
I had high hopes for Bite. The warm, earthy, hip interior appealed to me. The price was right and I liked the look of the menu, with it's updated American classics. . . But, we made the mistake of going there recently on a freezing cold Friday night. The hostess told us that they could seat us in 1/2 hour and that we could wait next door in the Empty Bottle bar and have a drink. This sounded acceptable, so we were led to the Empty Bottle via a side door that connects one business to the other. . . The bartenders at the bar told us that they weren't serving. They were closed while setting up for a concert. When we said (nicely) that we were waiting for a table next door and that we wouldn't be seated for a 1/2 hour, the hard-ass bartender chic said we could wait outside if we didn't like it. So, we sat without drinks on a ratty couch in the chilly bar, trying not to get hit in the face with the butt ends of people's pool ques as the 1/2 hour wait turned into an hour. . The bar eventually opened just before we finally got our table. We were able to carry our drinks next door with us. They were the only drinks we had that night, because Bite alcohol comes from the Empty Bottle and the bar stops serving restaurant customers at 8PM, or something. It's a very confusing alcohol system. The table next to us was also having trouble figuring it out why they were being cut off mid meal. . . All of this would have been OK if a friendly server had greeted us at our table and said " Thanks for being so patient.", or something, but instead, we were greeted by a tired and cynical waiter who was apparently more miserable than we were. . . I won't make the mistake of going to Bite again.. . Oh, ......the food was fine.
