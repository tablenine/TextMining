Restaurant: Houston&#39;s Restaurant
Category: American (New)
I am a long time Houston's fan. From my childhood in Chicago to pigging out after spinning class in NYC, I give mad props to this high-end chain restaurant that is ALWAYS CONSISTENT in the great quality of the food and quick, friendly service. (Though sometimes too quick...the place is always packed and so they like to turn their tables over FAST). . . Best things to get:. - Spinach and artichoke dip - perfectly creamy and rich every time with hot, crispy tortilla chips...I drool just thinking about it. - Hickory burger . - Chicken salad. - Thai jungle steak salad. - Sushi is surprisingly delicious. . I rarely eat ribs, but I totally agree with the other reviewers that you can't go wrong with them here.. . Only downside with the Century City location is that there is always a wait - even on weeknights - that can be up to an hour long. (My rule is never to wait longer than 20-30 minutes to sit down anywhere...unless it's Pizzeria Mozza). They don't take reservations, but you can get the full menu at the bar. I love me some Houston's!!
