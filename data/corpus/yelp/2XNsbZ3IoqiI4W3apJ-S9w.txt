Restaurant: Nacional 27
Category: Latin American
Nacional 27 brings back pleasant memories - my first foray into Latin cuisine, my best mojito experience, and the first time I made it to a second date and craved for more!. . I loved the trendy and tastefully elegant interior - the bar has a nice mix of high and low seating, and some cosy corner couches, while inside, is a nice open dining area, which opens out as the dance floor on weekends. The glass center pieces and decorations, lend a semi-formal ambiance without the associated pretention. . . I loved my mint mojito and even better the pomegranite-lemon-ginger mojito,but was more pleasantly surprised by the profusion of vegetarian options. We picked a few tapas - Boniato and Plaintain croqueta,pumpkin and goat cheese croqueta and I had a couple of sides - spicy green rice and sweet potato, which were all fantastic. . . Overall a great dining experience, and I would love to go back here.
