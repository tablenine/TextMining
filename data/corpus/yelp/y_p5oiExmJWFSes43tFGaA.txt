I love this place and it is a perfect date night to go and sit at the bar. Either bar is great, and it is worth the wait with a nice dirty martini before you get seated. I would much rather do that then to get a table reservation- it looks a little impersonal and stuffy. Our favorite order is the Mozzarella Fresca di Basilica for starters which is served with amazing bread. It is a huge hunk of fresh mozzarella and is to die for. Then we split the Orecchiette with sausage &amp; Swiss chard  and the spiral pasta with the spicy tomato sauce and pancetta ( I  can't find the name of it), and nice glass of red wine. That is usually a perfect amount of food for both of us and we are always so happy that we are still craving it.. You also can't go wrong with the octopus and tripe and anything else from the mozzarella bar.
