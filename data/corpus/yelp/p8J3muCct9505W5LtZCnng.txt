Seriously the waitress was so horrible. However the Mahi was really good considering I'm int he middle of L5P without an ocean near me. my friends got some mini corn dogs which were really good too. The food was great which is why EAYC is getting 2 stars and not one. I have never had worse service. My friends were drinking beer and a good 45 minutes would pass before she would even offer them another one. Thing is the table next to us seemed to be getting wonderful service. Which ticked me off even more. I normally don't give horrible reviews but I have been a waitress before and knowing how expensive drinks are means you should try harder to keep people drinking. Also at the end of the night we asked that we could have separate checks. I understand if you don't do separate checks but please don't bring us your chicken scratch hand written check and say "here just figure it out" and walk away. It made me so upset I don't think I will go back there are plenty of other places in L5P I don't have to go to EAYC not to mention East Atlanta Village isn't too far away.
