i give this place 3 stars because the first time i went the food was great but the second time i almost got into a fight with some punk ass muthafucka standin outside in the parking lot with his homeboys tryin to showboat but instead of showboatin for his homeboys he almost got his ass whipped.. now that i am finished with that part of the story lets step past the parking lot and into the restaurant  .                THE GOOD:. 1. the service was good. 2. the food was good . .                THE BAD:. 1. after eating i started to sweat and feel a little sick. 2. on the way out i had to see that same chump from earlier. .                THE UGLY:. 1. once in the car i was still feeling sick. 2. on the start of our long trip back to San Francisco i threw up in the car... it was a very ugly scene.....
