Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
This place should be one of your top choices when you decide to go out to eat Shabu Shabu.  Their prices are very fair compared with many other Japanese Shabu Shabu restaurants around the area.  . . This place is PACKED pretty much EVERYDAY, especially weekends.  Their seating capacity is very limited, which only exacerbates the crowded condition.  Going in at dinner time, you can expect to wait an hour at the very MINIMUM.  . . The reason for their popularity is that you get a decent amount of food (not too much, not too little, however it might just be a bit too little for my palate), for a fair price of around $15.00.  You also get many tasty sauces to complement your meat.  . . If not for the crowded seating situation, where you are almost always faced with a greater than 1 hour waiting time, I would have given this place 5 stars.  However, if you dont mind going there early (at least 5pm), you can probably get seated right away.
