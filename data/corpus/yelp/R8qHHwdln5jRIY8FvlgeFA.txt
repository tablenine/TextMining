I should have known to check here first. Yelp is like a good, trusted friend; honest when you need it to be. . . After seeing some of the recent posts, this clearly isn't the restaurant that it used to be. Friends noted that the menu had completely changed and the items that they liked were no longer available and in its place a SHORT list of uninspired mess. . . I'll start off by saying the reservationist gave us a hard time when we tried to increase our reservation to add 2 more people. We were about 15 minutes away from our reservation and the place was practically empty, only 2 small tables were occupied. What was he waiting for, a flood of people to suddenly amass in front of this little storefront? . . I'll keep the rest short as I rather not be reminded of my time here. Eggplant was a bland puree that looked like yak. Steak was cooked well but otherwise flavorless. Everything else was a little bit of a sweet mess, and I'm not saying sweet in any endearing way. Some of the items are a little heavy handed with their sauces. I can't quite figure this place out. Maybe if you mixed everything together you'll get a decent balance. Not to mention certain items that we ordered never made it out, but we were in no rush to remind them. Some of us were saying how we should just head over to Pinks and get a proper meal.
