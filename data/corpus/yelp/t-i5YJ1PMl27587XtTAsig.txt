Work landed me in the Windy City a few weeks back and let me tell ya I can't wait to get back to Sweet Home Chicago. . All I can say it....bone in rib eye...sign me up.  Fantastic vibe right in the heart of the Viagra triangle.    Great eye candy, fantastic steaks, and a solid wine list.  . . Our meal went something like this:. Split a Cesar. Turley Old Vine Zin. Bone in Ribeyes. Spinach and Vegi sides. . What else is there?  Its not cheap, but neither are you so giddy up. . Don't miss a few pre-game cocktails across the street at Tavern on Rush.
