We went here for an impromptu celebratory dinner.  We were able to make a reservation the night of.  The food was fantastic.  The service was fantastic.  It is BOYB with a $20 corkage fee, which was reasonable compared to standard wine lists at a restaurant like this.  Our server knew the answers and then some to each question we asked.  It wasn't overly crowded even though it was valentine's weekend, and it wasn't overly noisy.  The tables were spacious, but the lighting was a bit harsh for the atmosphere.  We were not offended, I just typically expect more subtle lighting at a nice restaurant.  Everything we ate was delicous, and they brought out a plate that said "congratulations" on it in honor of our celebratory dinner.  Very thoughtful and nice.  We will definitely be back.  Go to . http://www.restaurants....  for a coupon and you can save a little....but even if you don't do that, it is a must-try kind of place.
