I've been here several times for brunch and it doesn't disappoint.  The tables are a tad small for 2, but other than that, I've been pleased.  The service is always good and it's pretty fast.  Last time I was there I had the curry chicken salad.  I am on a chicken salad kick and this was really good! I definitely recommend this place for brunch (though you will probably have to wait in line on the weekend) and/or lunch.  Try the chicken salad :).
