Ate here once. It was overpriced and the food was not worth the money. I also walk past the place everyday. Does anyone else know why they are so overstaffed? At any one time, there are around 5 waitstaff persons mulling around waiting to pounce on someone. . . Anyway, you can be a Mark's on Halsted in 5 minutes if you want better, cheaper food.
