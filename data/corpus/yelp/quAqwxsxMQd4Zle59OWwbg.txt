Had to wait 45 minutes to get my order of 2 sausages and small fries.  Actually was told they looked around but did not find me.  Then there was a computer glitch that backed the orders up.  Yeah right.  That aside, awesomest fries I've had.  Will go back just for those.  Tried the mango-jalapeno, austin blues, and brawt.  Of those the austin tasted best while the 2 others were meh.  Great quality but the service can be better.
