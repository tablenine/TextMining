This review has nothing to do with the phenomenon involving the drunk douche-drinker asshats who come in here late at night to yell racial slurs and at the women who work here. . . I got the char-dog and cheese fries. I didn't really see what was so special about the hot dog. There are just so many better places to get a great Chicago dog (ie: Flub A Dub Chub's, Hot Dougs, etc..). The fries were pretty good but what the hell is that weird crap they call cheese!?!?!? Seriously, I don't think there is actually any dairy in there. It tastes so weird and chalky and it Â literally transforms from a liquid to a pure solid once it comes into contact with wind. Mind you there is only outdoor seating and this is the Windy City!!! Gross.
