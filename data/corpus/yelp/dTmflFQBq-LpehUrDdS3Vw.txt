review for DINNER.... i swear everything on the menu comes straight from costco and onto your plate.  the falafel and mixed greens side were just that... and they somehow messed up heating it up.  i hated paying for (and barely eating) mushy falafel and rotting greens served messily on a dirty plastic plate.  the only good part - the tzaziki - which i think was only "good" because i was starving.   the prices are obnoxious for poor quality, out of the freezer food.  i had brunch here years ago and thought it was decent but now i fear ever coming back.  i feel robbed.
