Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
My rule is that when I go to a place like Mastro's, I go all out. Don't go here and order a salad. Please. If you do, I will know when it happens and I might die a little inside.. . The bone-in fliet was EXCELLENT. I always thought the bone didn't really matter for a filet since it's so flavorful to begin with, but it makes a difference. As I suggested above, we went all out. We started with the seafood tower which was excellent: all chilled jumbo shrimp, oysters and petite lobster tails. Along with our steaks, we tried one of each side. I felt like the mashed potatoes were sort of an unnecessary indulgence. I'd much rather have the lobster as a garnish to my steak!. . Our waiter was awesome, good music, excellent wine list, I can't say enough good things about this place. I only wish it fit into my budget on a regular basis. The portions were so big that we took home two full shopping bags of food! Get ready to shell out some money for this place.. . We went on a Tuesday night and it was PACKED. Reservations a must.
