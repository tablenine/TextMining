Best sushi place. Ever.  Everyone I bring here is spoiled for life.  Yes, some dishes can be expensive, but the regular cut rolls (ie. Spicy Scallop, Tuna) are incredibly reasonable.  Favorites are Crispy Tuna, Baked Crab Hand Roll and 4 1/2 Roll, spicy tuna w/soy w/ shrimp tempura--delicious!!  Only hesitation in writing this positive review is that I am making the wait longer.  Side Tip--put your name in, go to Firefly for a drink and come back for for food. ;)
