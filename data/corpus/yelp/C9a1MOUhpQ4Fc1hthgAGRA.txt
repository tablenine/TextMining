mmmm, i love LA for being so vegan friendly.... GREAT veggie burger,. and their El Bur~~~ whatever thingy is sooo good,. it was basically a wrap. LOTS OF VEGGIES. ohso much,. the bitter kind that tastes of good health... THAT STUFF.. tastytastytasty.. but a bit overpriced i must say. hm.. could've been perfect if it were a bit cheaper,. but eh, it's all good. support local businesses!. but OH!. one star definitely knocked off for not having any kind of vegan dessert. dawww, i love my baked sugar fix.
