I hate to write this, because I don't want to have to wait longer than we did today, but this just catapulted into my new favorite breakfast place. . . Got the orange juice with berries whipped into it, and the eggs over potatoes and chorizo with guacamole on top. It was so perfectly integrated with flavor, i polished the whole plate off. Well done.
