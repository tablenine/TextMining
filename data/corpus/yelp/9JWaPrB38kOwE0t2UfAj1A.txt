Got the #19. Without a doubt the pastrami is top notch, however.... . 1. While the rye bread is really good the outside crust is too hard.. . 2. The coleslaw on the #19 I feel distracts from the quality of the meat. . . If I was to go there again I would just get a regular pastrami and swiss on rye sans the crust. Also $17 (incl. tip) for a sandwich is pretty pricey.
