When the sun goes down, you'll find me here.  Flo Restaurant is an intimate, friendly restaurant that has great food and awesome drinks.  They recently put in a new bar and it is unexplainably comfortable. I never liked sitting at the bar at a restaurant but LOVE Flo's bar. Relax with a drink from Anita and enjoy!
