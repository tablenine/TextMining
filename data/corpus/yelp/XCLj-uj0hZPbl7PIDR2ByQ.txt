Restaurant: Tin Drum Asia Cafe
Category: Thai
Tin Drum is a better than average, fast serving, Americanized Chinese Bistro. . . Guests order their food at the front counter with one of the many sulky Georgia Tech students working here. The menu is a selection of spring rolls and pasta and rice dishes. You choose what type of protein you want in your dish (chicken or tofu) and how spicy you want your dish (the owner always suggests taking it one notch below what you normally prefer) and such modifications like no carrots can be made to your Penang curry chicken dish. The metal square tables and wooden round tables offer a sleek look but the place almost always feels empty amongst the brightly painted loft size walls and wall sized windows. There are also tables outside if you prefer to be blinded by the sun. By the time you sit down, a waiter will be calling your name and offering you chopsticks to chow down on your Pad Thai. Expect to keep getting up to refill your glass or to grab a fork and knife, they don't offer anymore table service than to bringing you your food and picking up your dish when you are through. Overall, this place is a good lunch spot if you beat the crowd and in the area, and for the price, the food is tasty and filling. So if you are in the mood for a noodle bistro, it's definitely one of the better options as far as taste and price.
