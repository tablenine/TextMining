Restaurant: El Barco
Category: Mexican
I fought with every ounce, or shall I say pound in my body to like El Barco, but my experience left me desiring so much more.  Maybe El Barco is not the perfect place to have a large party meet up.  The tables are small and there are barriers for condiment trays every few feet on the table.  Our table of 10 only got two menus to look at, making ordering very difficult.  Not to mention the lack of descriptions and the confusion of the the wait staff.  "What's the difference between these 4 different tacos?" All I got was a shrug.  When the food came out, the plates were so big we had to create double decker strategy to fit everyone's food on the table.  My fish tacos were very bland and the fish was in giant chunks making it impossible to eat.  The fish itself tasted like it had been caught in the Chicago River.  Sorry just not my cup of margarita.  The vibe was great with lots of colors, festivities and action, but if you want food that tastes good go somewhere else.
