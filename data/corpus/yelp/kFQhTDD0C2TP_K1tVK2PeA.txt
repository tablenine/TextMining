My friend had a discount card for Nava, so we had dinner there again last night.  Unfortunately, our dinner experience wasn't all it could have been.. . We started off with the queso fundido with corn salsa and smoked shrimp.  It was yummy (it's hard to mess up cheese, right?) although it only contained 3 little shrimps.  Still, yummy melted cheese is yummy.. . For my entree, I had the scallops over red chile grits.  It was good, but I've had better seafood and grits at other places.  The presentation was beautiful, though.  My friend had the key lime chicken.  She said the rice side that came with it was so salty that she could barely eat it, and that overall, the dish was disappointing.  She felt like she could have ordered something just as good at Chili's and it would have been 10 dollars cheaper.. . For dessert, we split the chocolate peanut butter bar.  It was really delicious, and we came to the conclusion that if we ever go back to Nava, we will skip the entrees and just order appetizers and desserts instead.. . Our service was good, and the sangria was pretty nice, too.  It wasn't a bad meal, but for this price point there are so many better dining options (even at other Buckhead Life restaurants) in Atlanta.
