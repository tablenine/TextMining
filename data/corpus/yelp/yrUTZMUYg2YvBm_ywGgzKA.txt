A great place with a diverse list of food to eat. From meatloaf to burgers to chili - this place has some excellent food. They have a wide assortment of side dishes and bring you fresh cornbread and rolls when you sit down.. . No server has really stood out, but that's mainly because I've never once had bad service.. . They have plenty of parking and a great covered outdoor patio. You'll see several flat screen TVs along the walls with various channels on. This place is a big fan of American Idol, so whatever night that show is on you'll not miss out on an episode.. . This is a short review, but really I've never had a bad dining experience here.
