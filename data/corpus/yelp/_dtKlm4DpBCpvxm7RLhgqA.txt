Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
So, we stumbled upon this place when moving to Logan Square and it is fantastic.  It is not the greasy previously frozen ingredients that I have grown to know as Chinese food (and secretly sometimes crave).  Friendship has fresh veggies and great food.  Their prices are a little high, but so worth it.
