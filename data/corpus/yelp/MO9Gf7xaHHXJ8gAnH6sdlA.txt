So I've been dying to check this place out, all the reviews had me buzzing. Since I knew it was only open late, I had to wait for a good (but not to crowded evening). A friend and I were going to see the MJ movie, and were in the area so I told her about FO. I knew about the rules, although when we got there, no one asked to see ID at the door. It was pretty busy, I spent a good few minutes looking for a table, hit the ladies room and when I came back, some people were leaving so I got lucky. I ordered the burger and sweet potato fries, and my friend got the burger and reg fries. I took her rec' on a beer, and we sat and waited. Now I was hoping for knock my socks off burger, but it was just good. Not bad, but definitely wanted something more savory. I did however need to remove most of the foliage and while they were tasty in a BBQ type of way, I liked my burger better without the sweet onions. I love a salty-esque burger, so the blue cheese is always a fav of mine. All in all, the scene was good, LOVE the fries and aoili dip, but I will be trying other burgers. Not bad.
