This place rocks.  Not expensive and a good variety of seafood.  I usually get the lobster bisque and tuna melt combo.  However, I have also gotten their oysters and fish fish platter.  The fish platter or plate is a ton of food good for more than one person.  They have an outside terrace perfect for spring of fall.  There used to be a huge tree for shade, but I'm guessing it got crusty and had to be chopped down.  Beer and oysters.  How can you go wrong?
