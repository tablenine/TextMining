Restaurant: Rose Angelis
Category: Italian
This quaint store-front restaurant could be easily missed on Wrightwood, but make sure you find it: you won't be disappointed.  The dimly lit restaurant is a cozy setting for a date, yet welcoming enough for a large party; the downside is it can be rather noisy indoors.  The outdoor patio is fantastic and reminiscent of Italian cafes.  The food is delicious and very reasonably priced, with most entrees running between $9 and $15.  Do not skip dessert -- the tiramisu is phenomenal!
