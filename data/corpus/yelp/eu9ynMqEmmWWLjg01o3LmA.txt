Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I agree with barry w.. I don't get why people stand in that ridiculously long line to eat a hot dog!!. I heard Pink's is now on the list of 'must go to' places for tourists... WHY!!!!!!???. It's way overpriced, line's too long, it's dirty, and it's just a hot dog!. There's really nothing special about this place... except that so many celebrities came by and left their autographs!!. bleh~
