Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
A good friend dragged me to Pinks and I don't get it. Overpriced boiled dogs, chili was so so. Could not believe almost an hour wait to get these dogs. I would never go back there again... give me a Der Wienerschnitzel drive thru any day. . . Soon after this I gave up on his choices of restaurants. In fact for him if a restaurant sign reads "World's Best" or something of that nature he is eating there. Could be Worlds Best Guano on a bun, and he would pay top dollar.
