I LOVE this place! I've been coming here for the past 2 years and it has never let me down.  The boyfriend usually orders the #1 combo and I just like anything with spam in it... luckily that's just about half of the menu :)  The owner is very friendly and always makes sure to say hello to us when we're visiting.  On top of that, the place itself is not very big and it's rarely ever crowded so you've got a good chance at getting a booth if you want it.  Basically you have try this place if you haven't already... I don't want to see it closing anytime soon so please go!
