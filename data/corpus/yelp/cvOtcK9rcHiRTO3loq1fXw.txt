amazing gourmet burgers, special fries, tempura onion rings (that melt in your mouth), and assorted pickle trays.  The service was great, and we ate outside with our own beer.. We all had amazing burgers, which are a nice smaller size, with the freshest meat.  I had a truffle cheese burger with truffle spread, and the pickle tray included amazing watermelon rind, okra, and hearts of palm.  The portions are small but the highest quality, and they also offer ice cream from MILK.
