Restaurant: Tender Greens
Category: American (New)
I went to Tender Greens a long time ago, and I didn't care for it at all.  On my recent visit, I had a much better experience.  Tender Greens is an order-at-the-counter place that focuses on salads.  The menu is pretty simple--you can get a simple salad with meat, a special salad, a meat plate, or a sandwich--each $10.50.  You can also get a "simple salad" (without meat) for $5.50.. . I went with one of the simple salads with meat.  My salad consisted of baby spinach, goat cheese, hazelnuts, chicken, and cabernet vinaigrette (an oversized crouton was also served).  At first, I thought they were a little stingy with the goat cheese and hazelnuts.  But after eating more and more of the salad, I realized that it was just not that well tossed.. . The salad was fine.  The goat cheese was kind of boring.  They should have just used smaller croutons instead of one large one.  The other problem was that the vinaigrette was very light (you couldn't really identify it).  I prefer my salads underdressed as opposed to overdressed, but it was pretty bland.. . The chicken was very good.  They give you a substantial portion, and it was surprisingly moist.  If I came back, I would go for the tuna, which looked good.. . There was quite a long line so you do have to wait.  The seating area was nice.  The inside dining area was a little crammed; plus, it became quite loud with very lively patrons.  I did like the outdoor dining area.  Even though it is a small restaurant, they do have a good number of tables.  Parking is free for 2 hours in the nearby structure.. . While I did not think my salad here was anything great, it was good enough that I would come back and give one of their other offerings a chance.
