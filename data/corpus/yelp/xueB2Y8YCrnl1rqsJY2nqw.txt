Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Brazilian
I've reviewed Fogo de Chao previously and gave one star.  Then one day, I looked and read all the reviews by the fellow Yelpers and thought, "Why am I the only one with one-star review?"  Usually, when a majority agrees that a certain restaurant is excellent, it means the restaurant does it right.  So this gave me a reasonable doubt.  What if I was the wrong one - and not the restaurant?. . To see if I'm right, I went back.  I went on a week night, so the restaurant wasn't too busy.  Although I didn't have a reservation, I got seated promptly and was immediately greeted by our attentive waiters.  The meat was a bit salty for my liking, but since salt is the only form of seasoning they use, I couldn't really argue.. . Although meat often gets all the attention, I want to focus more on the side items.  The Fried Plantains: Without these, I wouldn't have survived Fogo.  Everytime I was about to get sick of their meat, I took a small bite of the plantain, which surprisingly helped me.  Of course, who can forget about the Papaya Cream dessert?  Papaya fruit naturally produces enzymes that specifically breaks down high-protein food, like all that meat you just engulfed.  So I know you are about to burst, but do order the Papaya Cream.  It will aid you in digestion.. . Answer?  I was the bad apple.  How could I be so wrong?  How could I have rewarded such a fine dining destination one star?  The food, the service.. everything was flawless!  But as the proverb says, "Even monkeys fall out of trees."  Everyone is susceptible of making mistakes and I'm glad that I had the chance to correct my incorrect evaluation.
