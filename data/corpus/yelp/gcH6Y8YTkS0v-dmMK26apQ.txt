Restaurant: Crust
Category: Pizza
I'm done with Crust. Went there on a Friday night at 8:30 pm- there was a small child running around and being loud and obnoxious. Since when was that a family restaurant or a time to bring a toddler out to dinner? No thanks. That was the first offense, though not the fault of Crust.. . The music was the next offense- literally blasting horrible old Jay-Z. I love Jay Z but don't need to hear "Hard Knock Life" and other really bad hip hop/top 40 type music from about 1999. Did not fit the vibe I thought they were going for. . . Then the pizza- it's just not that good. The combos are a little odd, if you can't make a perfect Margherita as a pizza place you have problems. I'm not going back to Crust anytime soon.
