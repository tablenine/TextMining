I went to Tank last night with my boyfriend on the last day of his Groupon offer.  We failed to make a reservation but they take walk ins so we went right after work.  We arrived at 6:15 and the place was PACKED and we were slapped with a 2 hour wait.  YOW!  But we were determined to make good on our money.  We gave them our digits and headed over to Bad Dog across the street for a small appetizer (split a delicious california burger!).  Almost 2 hours later on the dime, the phone rang and we ran over for dinner #2.. . We were seated right away and offered drinks.  Brian got a beer and I had a pear &amp; ginger iced tea. It was delicious and quite plentiful in a huge bottle!  Then we ordered one of their specials where the chef chooses 9 pieces and a roll.  It was delicious - the fish was perfect taste, temperature and flavor.  Watch out though, if you're like me and cannot tolerate spice, the pieces had a dollup of wasabi hidden in the middle which sure added quite the ZING!  After we figured this out, I simply took it out on my next pieces.  Our roll with the order was some sort of salmon roll wrapped in the seaweed and was also quite pleasing.  Then we ordered the Alaskan Night under the "Signature Maki" list (salmon, rock crab meat, avocado, covered with black tobiko, sesame seeds).  It also greatly pleased the senses.. . All in all, I give Tank a huge thumbs up.  It was worth the wait.  The food was delicious.  The price was decent.  The atmosphere was great.  I would definitely go back or even order take out.  Thanks Brian and Groupon for a great experience!
