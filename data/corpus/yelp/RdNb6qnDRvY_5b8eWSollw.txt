Category: Bakeries
Canters was originally located in Boyle Heights until the Jewish exodus of the '50's took them to the promised land of Fairfax and beyond (there is a Canters in Vegas now.)  It remains L.A.'s signature Jewish deli.. . Walking into Canters gives you an aromatic whiff of Kosher-style cuisine.  The pickles, corn beef, pastrami, tongue, and herring combined harken back to the days of Delancy and Hester streets in old New York.. . I love their corned beef and pastrami.  They make a fair Matzoh Ball soup (Katella Deli's in Los Al is better).  They have a large selection of sandwiches and meals (many of which are named after old movie stars and comedians) that will send you home stuffed and with left-overs.. . If you stop by the deli counter, pick yourself up some of their delicious whipped cream cheese.  It is the best I have ever tasted.  Then stop by the bakery for some of their tasty yiddishah baked goods (rugulah, bagels, challah, danish, bagels, and of course a black and white cookie).. . No matter what the hour (and they are open all 24), Canters will take you back to the days when Jewish L.A. made this the place to ess and fress.. . Now eat and enjoy!!
