This place is amazing. I am still learning the sushi world and had to streatch myself in trying different things at this place. If you sit at the bar (which I recommend) do NOT ask for a roll. The Chef looks at you funny and will have someone in the back make you the roll. The Chef's are artist. They want to make you try new things and cut you fine pieces of fresh fish. . . Loved my time here and hope that my fiance takes me back ASAP.
