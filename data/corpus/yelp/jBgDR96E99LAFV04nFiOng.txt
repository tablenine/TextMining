Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
I first of all, I love Thai food and this place did not disappoint. The staff was super nice and the food was great! Even the Valet was amazing! I was a bit lost and they took time out to draw me a map and help me get to where i was headed after dinner! It really topped off the night and my experience. Highly recommended and If you need directions or local recommendations don't even botherwith the restaurant, just go for the valet!
