I defy anyone out there to dislike this place.  The concept is so simple--take a tasty assortment of indulgent sausages ranging from the ever-so-normal polish all the way to more exotic fare like rabbit and alligator, mix well with a huge collection of Belgian and German beers, and serve well.. . I love the food here.  I love the atmosphere here.  And I love the fact that I have yet to meet an individual among my collection of friends who dislikes this place.  If you love good food with your good time, then this is the place to be.. . About the only thing I dislike about this place is the fact you have to order your food outside and wait in line for upwards of fifteen minutes.  It's a small, yet annoying, facet of this wonderful place.  My suggestion is to send someone to lay on the grenade and order for your whole party, while the rest of you stake your claim at a table (or two).  That way, everyone can be rearing to go with drinks in hand once the food does arrive.
