This is probably my favorite sushi place in the city, and I love coming here.  They have the best sushi and their menu items- like steak and seafood dishes are fantastic as well.  I love their crispy shrimp rolls, and they have excellent tuna rolls.  It's reasonably priced too- we had 4 people there and our bill was $80 with 2 drinks/person.  Not bad!
