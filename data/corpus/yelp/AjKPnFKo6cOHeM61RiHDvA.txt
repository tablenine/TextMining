Me?  Eating SALAD at a BBQ spot!?  WTH!?!. . Yes.  I did indeed eat at their salad bar.  It was DELICIOUS and super duper fresh and I am not one bit ashamed!. . The beef here was delicious.  Some were too salty for my taste but majority of the meats were 2 thumbs up.  . . They have great customer service.  I spilled something on my shirt and the waitress came with a chlorox bleach wipe =). . I ate until my tummy said no more.. . Must go back again =). . It was my birthday dinner so I don't know the price *smile*  but I'm guessing it was expensive since it's a fancy shmancy spot.
