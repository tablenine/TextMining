I love their pho, love their dry noodle dish, love their spring rolls. All in all, the food is yummy in my tummy. The only thing I don't love is the OMG-I'm too-full feeling afterwards, but life is tough, eh? . They have the tastiest limeade to date, which is great on a warm day, and sipping their chrysanthemum tea on a chilly night is also a pleasant experience. I kinda want some now.... I happen to love the interior and the lighting. Being seated uber close to other people is fine by me, also. But as I know this isn't everyone's idea of comfy dining, take heed, you will be practically elbow to elbow with the other patrons. . The parking is a pain in the butt and that takes away a star.
