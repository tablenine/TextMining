Overall, it's not a bad spot.  I am somewhat concerned about the Friday night crowd and their perception game.  You know what I mean..........create a line outside although there's no one inside.  I think the charging a cover for a restaurant is ridiculous and I will only patronize this establishment when it is chosen by other members of my party.  Certainly not my first choice.  I am somewhat confused by the menu - they serve anything from a cheeseburger to chilean sea bass.  There's no theme or consistency.  Is it a restaurant, bar or nightclub - no focus.  I don't expect it to last long.
