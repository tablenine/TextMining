Hands down...my most fav sushi place in L.A.  Yes, I know they're cash only.  And yes I know there's no parking and the wait could be an hour or more...but the quality/price ratio is well worth it.. . Fresh!  Fresh!  Fresh!. . Only place I know of that let's you order Ankimo nigiri...their Ankimo (monk fish liver) is fresh, buttery, and decadent.  Amaebi (sweet shrimp) are huge and the heads come fried.  Toro, Hirame, Sake and Hamachi are irresistable.. . Bottle of cold sake to wash it all down...not much more I could ask for from a sushi joint.
