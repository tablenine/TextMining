Among all the burger places I got pretty excited about eating here.  With that being said.  I had their famous burger and both fries.  The price was as expected.  After that, things began to go down hill.  I was expecting one of the best burgers in the world.  . . The burger it self was served as asked, which was nice because there are few places that cook it mid rare.  The burger patty was very moist and tasty.  The options on the burger were very limited so you kinda need to take it as is.  So for those who don't like onions then be aware.  . The over all burger was quite flavorful.. . The fries were good.  I've never been a huge fan of shoe string fries but they were cooked well.    They provided  2 different dipping sauces a garlic one and a blue cheese style one.  of the 2 sauces i preferred the garlic one. This is where i got annoyed by not providing any ketchup or ranch.  . . The pear cider was very good.  Just like drinking cider for the holidays.  but over all the place was a disappointment.  It might have been due to overyhyped of the place combined with the fact that I actually drove out of my way to eat here but if I'm ever in the area again I wouldn't mind stopping in for a drink.
