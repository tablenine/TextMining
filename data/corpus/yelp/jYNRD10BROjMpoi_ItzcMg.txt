Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
My review starts with a disclaimer:  I saw and sat very close to Ryan Reynolds while waiting for my order to be ready.  He is stunningly gorgeous so, it is possible that I am actually giving Joan's an extra star because I was so excited about my celebrity sighting!  . . Seriously though, the food from Joan's was great.  I got an egg salad on wheat bread with lettuce and cheese.  I loved the egg salad except it could have used some herbs or spices.  The wheat bread was good, it had nuts in it!  It was enjoyable to bite into the sandwich and then you got a taste of the nuts mixed into the bread.  That was a treat!  . . I also got two side dishes:  fruit and curried chick peas.  The fruit was great...fresh, crisp, and there was a nice variety of fruit.  There was lots of berries, melons, grapefruit, peaches and other good stuff.  What I loved the most though was the curried chick peas.  WOW, that was delicious!  It was spicy and tangy, I loved how it had a kick to it.  So very good.. . I got Paul a muffaletta and he didn't really like his sandwich all that much.  He had a muffaletta a few days prior from a different place that was much better.  So, that was a bummer because Joan's is expensive!  He thought it was kind of boring.  He did love both of the side dishes though and he tasted my sandwich and said that was great too.. . I loved everything I got so....five stars!  :)  The menu is pretty big, they have a wide range of tasty items to choose from.  The side dishes alone are overwhelming.   Oh and they give a KCRW discount.  Very cool.  Good times!!!!!!!  Good food!!!!!!!!  And Ryan Reynolds is HOT!
