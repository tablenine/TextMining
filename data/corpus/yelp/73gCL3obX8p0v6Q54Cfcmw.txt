Just so happened, the bf and I had eaten meat + meat at Korean BBQ the night before, so we decided an all veggie meal was in order. We called ahead and put our name in for 7 (they don't technically take reservations, but they say it helps to call). The place is TINY (20 seats or so), so I don't recommend going at prime time, but we were seated promptly at a cozy all wooden table. The decor is warm and well designed. Minimal, clean, modern. They have a cute patio area in the summer too.. . Their menu is spectacular because you can order a small or large portion of any dish. We opted for tapas style and got three small dishes + two mushroom sliders. YUM! Smorgasbord of tastes and a full tummy too. My recommendations: mana chili, sliders and tomato pumpkin ravioli.. . Another star because the prices are pretty great for the high quality. The small dishes are filling. You can actually be full for $40 doing tapas style, whereas at some places you can pay $15 for a perfectly presented tiny morsel of kale. Get what I'm saying?. . Only con is their dessert menu is a little lacking. The chocolate cheesecake is good, but nothing else sounded great. And they only have "french vanilla coffee." That makes me think it's from a little powder pouch. Invest in a coffee maker and get that Intelligentsia brewin!. . Parking isn't too bad on side streets. Cabs plentiful on Division.
