I used to drive, over 100 miles round trip, from Riverside to the OC for this place.. . I've always found it to be worth the pilgrimage. Sometimes, dare I admit, in college I've thought of missing class to go to the OC. Now it is local to me, I've moved since, lol.. . The food is still amazing, and the quality is consistently good. I'm not a fan of their oysters though, it lacks depth and I don't hints of the sea in them. My only suggestion in terms of food: get better oysters.. . the wait.  still waiting... wait.. Is long. Reaaaaalllly long.  Come here early or have a snack before.  Wait can be over 2 hrs on busy nights, which seems like every night. Also, their parking sucks! Street parking is hard to find on busy nights as well.. . But their food is always good.
