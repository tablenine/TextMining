Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Brazilian
My favorite restaurant in Atlanta! Â My favorite part about visiting Brazil was the delicious food and Fogo keeps it true to its roots. The service is exceptional and the quality of the meat is wonderful. I enjoy going for lunch because its a tad cheaper but either way, you can't go wrong!
