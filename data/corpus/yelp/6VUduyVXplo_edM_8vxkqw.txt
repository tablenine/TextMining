I can't not give this place 5 stars.  It was so good.  The prices are tooo too much, but when they delivered on everything, I guess it's worth it.. . I agaonized over what I wanted, cause I wanted the goat chz pesto art. dip more than anything, but I know that I cannot be happy with just an app, and it's pretty expensive for a couple of actors..but eventually I said to hell with it and ordered.. . We shared the dip. O my Mazing.  Of course it was, I love all the stuff in it, but it was tasty and beautifully presented, as was eveything else.. . My southern bf ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf, and I got the duck duo.  I've never had duck before, but as I told my guy "Lots of people like duck, why shouldn't I?". . And I do.  It was great.  I just ate some leftovers.  delish.  Both were great.  It's not "meatloaf served w a bottle of ketchup" which will forever be my bf's favorite, but for the fancy stuff, it was right on.. . Now if only they could lower their prices...
