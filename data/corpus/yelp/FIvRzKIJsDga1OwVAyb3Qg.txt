Went here last night, and had a great time. . The decor is very nice, kudos to the ID! Only problem i had with the decor was that i arrived before the rest of my party so i sat up at the bar...some advise to those with junk in the trunk, DONT SIT AT THE BAR! the seats are small and the backs of the seats push you forward... it is hard to stay seated and the last thing you want to be reminded of before a mael is that you have a big ass! BUTT it might not have been just me bc i noticed the bar top kept moving and i think everyone seated at the bar was pushing down on it, trying to schhotch their rumps back to position. onto the food.... Went with a group, so i was able to sample some of theirs too... ended up trying Jaiba, Fish tacos, Shrimp tacos, Torta Cubana.... All good. The shrimp tacos were my favorite, big fried shrimp good slaw and mayo. The fish tacos were packed with fish, but a little bland (Taquria del sol is my fish taco control group and so far they are still #1) Portions are huge! The margs were eh... and a friend had the sangria, said muddeled fruit good, too much club soda bad. Chips and salsa average. It was a very loud place, pretty full and our table ended up playing a game of conversational telephone, poor robert at the end, was more or less dining alone. also, there was a light show and disco ball, note to management, this is not needed. cant wait till nice weather, when i can utilize the patio. Also, dogs allowed on the patio (always a plus) Service... strange, all the girls look the same??? my whole party noticed. . My final review: good taquria style food in a good atmosphere, just dont expect to have a conversation. Stick with beer, and share everything, the portions are huge and its a nice way to keep your tab low and your belly full.
