as if this place needs another 5 star review.. i have only tried five items, although i have been there twice. i am reordering them and stuffing myself senseless before getting around trying something new.. heres the five:. potato balls-to die for, my all time fav. guava&amp;cheese pastry: favorite pastries. meat pie: cuban pastry version of meat filled mooncake. meat empanada-i especially like the filling in this one. cheese rolls-sweet and nom.. haha i am a n00b to cuban pastries so i was pleasantly surprised that they make pastries with guava. i am a huge fan of guava, i have 2 guava trees in the backyard, and i love the smell of it,like a sweet version of my boyfriend's BO.im kidding, sorta,fresh guavas do smell faintly of bo though. =D believe it its very pleasant delicious. guava jam and cheese is a match made in heaven. definitely a must for pastries
