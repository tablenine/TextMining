Happy Vegan.  Two words that would seemingly never go together (at least for a cheese lover like me, no offense), but the Happy Vegan really lives up to its name.  . . The food here is fresh, organic and well priced (most things run around $10.)  They mostly serve simpl yet delicious salads, although they do also have steak and chicken entrees.. . I would say this is primarily a lunch spot and the line get s REALLY long from 12:00 - 1:30.  There isn't any table service; You have to stand in line to order your salad and then pay at the register.  If you work nearby and eat here often, you will soon realize that they sometimes serve the same soup "special" for weeks on end... . . You can call in your order and they bypass the line to pick up, which I totally recommend.
