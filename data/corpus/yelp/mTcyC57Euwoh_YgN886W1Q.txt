My boyfriend and I had a delightful lunch experience here.  The interior, service, and food was impeccable.  . . Our waiters were friendly and offered great suggestions without being overly attentive.. . However, even if it were thrown at us from the back of a truck, the food makes this place.  . . We ordered the friend chicken appetizer, two different noodle bowls, and two desserts (I never want dessert but didn't want to leave and was thankful we got them).  . . The meal was outstanding.  I can't wait to go back.
