Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
this is one of the better ramen places in the SGV area. it's much better than ajisen ramen, which is not considered authentic at all. -_- . . i only came here to eat during their anniversaries, when they have the $3 ramen and 99c refill. reg price is about $7 and you can add all kinds of stuff to it. the flavored bamboo and spicy miso is good with the ramen. for 1 50 they give u a blob of spicy miso paste for u to mix with the soup urself. it makes it so good =]
