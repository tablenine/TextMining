Oh Philipee how I love you so much !!. This is as Los Angeles as you can get. If your near Chinatown, Olvera Street, or the Union Station, I highly, highly recommend this place.. . The French dip is what their known for. Ask for a single/double/triple dip, so the staff can dip the roast beef in the au jus for a little more flavor. The custards are very good, and the macaroni salad is not bad either.. . The service is very quick and efficient, although it can get very congested Â  in the restaurant during weekday lunch hours. . . The prices are very affordable, although the prices slowly creep up every few years or so. Either way, the sandwiches are well worth it !
