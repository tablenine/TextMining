I had dinner last week and all in all it was a good experience.  The food was very fresh and delicious.  It was a bit noisy but once I sat down it wasn't as bothersome as I thought it would be.  The service was great especially for a place that's so big.  There were servers, waitresses, hostesses, and other staff visible everywhere.  Our waitress Taylor was extremely helpful and accommodating.  Her dessert recommendation, Semi Fredo, was one of the best desserts I've ever had, ever (thanks Taylor!!).  I'll be back for sure :)
