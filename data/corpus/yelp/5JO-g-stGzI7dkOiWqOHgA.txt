Restaurant: Cleos Bar &amp; Grill
Category: Bars
I've always liked Cleo's. What I didn't realize is that they totally deck it out in holiday decorations for the season. Well done! It's always a chill vibe and they play good music (for the most part...there were some 90's songs that snuck into the rotation that I could have done without). They have a free food buffet on the weekends with the purchase of a drink - whether it's alcoholic or not. Who wouldn't like that? It's not gourmet but if you're hungry and don't have money then it's great. The regular menu is pretty extensive for a bar and looked better than I remembered so I'd recommend ordering from it. They serve food until 1:00 AM.
