Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
I go to the best Jewish Deli in all of Los Angeles and what do I get?  A cheeseburger.  But it's a goddamn GOOD cheeseburger, and the fries are the best I've had in ages.. . One of my friends had the pastrami which is absolutely fantastic and has the give and texture of butter as you sink your teeth deep into its juicy goodness.  . . They take care of you at Canter's...you get more food than you could possibly hope to finish and should you dine in, then you have the pleasure of enjoying your meal in a restaurant with personality that has withstood the test of time.. . Our waitress was a cute older lady who was so nice and friendly that we couldn't help but want to do shots with her at the Kibitz Room nextdoor.  It was especially cute when she explained to me what a cherry phosphate was.  (Sorry, I grew up in the era of Cherry Coke).  It wound up tasting not unlike a cherry Tums.. . The menu is huge and diverse--go with a group so everyone can sample eachothers' dishes.  How could you not want to?. . In conclusion--this place is far more awesome than my little five star review can convey.  Shit, I'm starting to like Los Angeles.
