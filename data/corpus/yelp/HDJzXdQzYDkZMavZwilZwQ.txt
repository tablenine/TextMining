Not the place to come if you're vegetarian. My poor husband had one entree option, and that was whatever the "greens and grains" special was that day. In the end, he liked it, but what if you hate brussel sprouts (which it mainly consisted of)? Well, then you're stuck with a tiny $12 salad and some artichoke fritters. Even the onion soup had bacon in it.. . Anyway, moving on.. . The food was good. I thought it was over-priced for the portions you got, but it was GOOD. We did get the artichoke fritters to start, and while I wasn't fond of the dipping sauces, I was a huge fan of the fritters themselves.. . I got the salmon entree, and I loved it. The ginger glaze was perfection and the puree and green beans complimented it just fine. They even asked me how I wanted my salmon cooked! I said, "medium?" and I guess that's what I got? I don't really know. I've never been asked how I want my salmon.. . We ended our meal with the cookie plate, and they were good, not amazing. They served us a green tea cookie, which tasted like a regular sugar cookie to me, and three other varieties including a really good chocolate coconut one and a chocolate chip macadamia nut. I can't remember the other kind.. . Our service was attentive, but our waiter was kind of snobby. Although, all the other waiters seemed to be super friendly, so I t hink we just got a bad one.. . The kicker of the evening? When we looked down at our flatware and saw it was from IKEA. Awesome!. . Sola is expensive. Is it worth it? I think so. Am I certain it's worth it? Maybe, maybe not. But I know I definitely enjoyed it.
