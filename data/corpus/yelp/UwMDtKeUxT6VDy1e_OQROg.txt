Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
You know what I like about this place?  The simple menu, and here it is:. . Fish Tacos $1.50. Shrimp Tacos $2.00. Drink  $1.00. . Ok the drinks aren't deep friend though that would be interesting.  If you like your taco's small and deep fried, you'll love it here.  Actually everything on the menu is pretty much deep fried. . . Parking is easy.  It reminded me downtown Ensenada.  More like a tire shop in downtown Ensenada.  Somewhere where I could eat tacos with the local hipsters and get my tires rotated....oh the gentrification of Ensenada..... . Seriously though the tacos are really good, but probably not very healthy for you.  I'd recommend the shrimp.  It tasted far superior to the fish.  If you have a small appetite, get two tacos; if you have a normal appetite get three tacos....if you go to taco trucks late night, get at least a half dozen.  They aren't open for late night runs.. . They also have an excellent selection of Salsas, ranging from.  fruity mango, to mild, to my favorite: mouth burning hot.  They also have shredded cabbage for the taking.. . ps.  Recycle your bottles and cans on your way out.
