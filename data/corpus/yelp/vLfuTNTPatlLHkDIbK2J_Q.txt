Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I liked their banchan, and how they had pa jeon. The meat was very fresh and tasted pretty good. A bit pricey though $22 per serving for joomoolluk (minimum of 2 servings), but I guess a lot of Krn BBQ places are around that price range. . I don't eat a lot so 2 servings was definitely enough for me and my gf. Good service overall, and nice clean place. not too crowded. . I'll just remember to bring more people next time so we can get different kinds of meat.
