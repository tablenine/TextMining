Came here with a friend to try their late-night dinner. I'm surprised the kitchen is open as late as it is yet the dining area was empty around 10pm.. . The place itself is very lounge-y, with a pool table, two bars, lots of seating and good music. Parking can be a bit tight, but if you're lucky or don't mind valet parking it shouldn't be that much of a problem. Â The doorman was asking if we were on some kind of list, so we gave him a weird look and told him we had dinner reservations. He let us walk right in, so I'm not sure why the doorman has a list in the first place.... . The martinis here were delicious though! I had a caramel apple martini and star f*cker martini which were both good. My friend had a pear martini which tasted more like pure alcohol than a good mixed drink. Each martini is $10 on a weeknight, so if I come back it'll definitely be to either only drink or only eat.. . The food was okay, we had calamari and split two different pasta dishes. In total, we wracked up a bill of $80 for two people, and we both only had 2 drinks, one appetizer, two main meals, and a side dish. So definitely be selective in your pickings. BUT the sweet potato fries were good!. . A great place to chill with a few friends or come out on a date night. I wouldn't bring a large group though unless you reserve an area, even though there's a lot of seating, space can get tight pretty quickly. Next time I'll try to bring a larger group to enjoy the place, it looks like it can be very fun or very dull depending on your crowd.
