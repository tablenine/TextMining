had never even heard of this place when my family went two weeks ago to celebrate my brother's birthday. To my amusement, everything on the menu looked so great, I had no idea what to order. Luckily, there were six of us, so I got to try most things. I opted for the pre fixe, which, at $50, might be the best buy and best pre fixe in southern california. They gave us an amuse bouche of a wonderful yellotail tuna, which really did get my tastebuds going. I started with a wonderful mushroom soup. Blended and creamy and yummy. hen I had the "Grilled Beef Ribeye steak in a black peppercorn sauce with gratin potatoes". Dee-lish. The steak was tender and flavorful, the sauce wonderfully complimented it and was pepery without being overpowering. The gratin potatoes (a comfort food to me) were a delicate gourmet version of sorts, sliced think and stacked elegantly and creamily on the plate. I was in hog heaven. I tasted the fois gras, which was the best I've EVER had, and tasted like steak but melted like butter on the tongue. I also tasted the asparagus soup, which was delicious and made with a vegetable stock. The miso marintaed chilean sea bass (Akira's signature dish) was good, and my bro's wagyu (kobe style) beef was out of this world. The desserts were great, too. I had a lavender creme brullee, and next time would opt for it without the lavender (it was good, but sometimes I'm a purist with these sorts of things). All in all, the dinner was great! An expensive night out for 6, but frankly, if you're looking for a special night, the pre fixe is a great deal. The restaurant itself is also warm, inviting, off the beaten track, and not at all pretentious. It's a little bit like my beloved Inn Of The Seventh Ray, but a little more gourmet, and French, and less hippy. You know...
