Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
This place is pretty awesome with only 3 items on their menu.  The food was fresh and good.  Try to stay away from the "hot" sauce if you can't handle spicy.. . The place is clean, staff was friendly.  They even had some nice looking paintings for sale on their walls.  Pretty nice place to kick back and enjoy some cheap and delicious food.
