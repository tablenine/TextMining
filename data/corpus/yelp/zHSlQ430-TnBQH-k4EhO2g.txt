I use to live in Italy and once I left, I have traveled the US to find anything similar to real authentic Italian pizza.  This is the place!  The sauce and dough reminds me of every Italian restarante my Mom and I would go to, with the Mozzarella di Bufala on top!  I usually get their basic pizza's cause, the experimental ones are bit out there for me.  Dried arugula completely covering the pizza on top?  Don't think a salad on top of my marinara and cheese is necessary, but to each it's own.  Their caprese salad is yummy, but when I get it to go, I always have to put some balsamic vinegar on it.  They have a great wine selection.  Their pasta's range from rustic to eclectic and they're marvelous!  The bartender's are always nice and informative.  . I have finally found my pizza.. Mangia, mangia!
