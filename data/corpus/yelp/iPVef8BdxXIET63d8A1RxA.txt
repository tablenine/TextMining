Don't believe the hype!!. . Don't get me wrong it's a good burger but not a great burger.  I still don't get what all the fuss us about regarding this place.  It doesn't cure cancer, eliminate homelessness or bring about world peace..its just a burger.  They must have a great PR firm because its really nothing special.  I tried the Port and Stilton burger with the tempura onion rings, and while the burger was good it was nothing special.  The rings had a great texture with a good crunch but were unfortunately bland and tasteless.. . Check it out just to say you have been here but be prepared to be let down.
