Wow. I so enjoy this restaurant. Such a foody delight. Order one dish more than you think you need as they are smaller and less filling than at most places. Romantic, not overly dressy but not too casual, healthy gourmet. I'd go here all the time if it wouldn't ruin a good thing. Once or twce a year makes it fun.
