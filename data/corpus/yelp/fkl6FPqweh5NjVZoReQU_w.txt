I'm sorry, I really wanted to love this place. I even gave it two chances, but I think it is just ok.. The first visit, I tried the chicken and black bean tacos and a side of potatoes.  The potatoes were typical breakfast potatoes, pan fried, kind of mushy and very flavorful.  They were pretty good. Sadly, my chicken taco's were very salty and I could not finish them. . Since this place gets such high ranking with other Yelpers, I figured that I should give it another try. My theory was that I went wrong by not ordering breakfast food, so this time I ordered the eggs and grits plate, with a side of bacon.  I was sad to hear that they do not poach eggs, so I ordered Sunny-side up.  The eggs were good, but my grits were flavorless and didn't have as smooth of texture, as I like. This will sound so stupid, but they were just too "grit'y".  Still, the grits were not that big of deal to me. It was the bacon that was disappointing.  I like my bacon crisp and I was pleased to see that the bacon was not only crisp, but it was thick and crisp. The only problem was that it tasted like it had been cooked in bad oil.  I know, bacon isn't cooked in oil...but I think this was cooked in oil. I guess I would describe my breakfast as not horrible, but definitely lackluster.. The funny thing is that despite my disappointment with the food, I really like this place.  It is a very old time, divey, diner and has a lot of character. Like the others, I think the best seat in the house is at the bar. I am sure I will be back.
