A group of mine hosted a meet up here that went from 6 confirmed to a full-blown party in a matter of an hour. Most restaurants would flip out when your table of 6 suddenly needs to steal every table in a 12 mile radius just to host all the friends who decide to show up last minute, but not here. The bartenders were every bit as attentive and would alert us to opening seats at the bar (it was too cold and wet to sit at the tables outside - thank you Atlanta Januarys!). Sandwiches weren't entirely quick, but there was only one bartender working on both drinks and sandwich orders, and considering most sandwiches went on the hot press it was somewhat understandable. For all it's worth, the bartender/cook never forgot an order and was always able to match it back up to the face. For a dark bar late at night, I was shocked! Most restaurants can't even do that for two people during daylight hours, so kudos to that bartender!. . If you like beer, there's a pretty nice selection going on here. If you an honest person, there's a plastic cup with your name on it and a random keg in the corner. Just pay at the end for whatever you drank! Not feeling honest? Probably best to order from the bar, then, and spare yourself the drama with the cops.. . Good sandwiches, good beer selection, but super tiny with hard to find parking. Lunch may be different, but late at night this is a fun little spot to visit after a game or if you just happen to be in the area. Sure beats Taco Mac!
