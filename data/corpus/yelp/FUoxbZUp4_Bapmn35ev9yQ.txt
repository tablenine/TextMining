OK you LA breakfast fans....  This place needs to be visited at least once.  What a cool spot and you will leave here with a doggy bag or a lot left on your plate.  It can get VERY packed but it's great people watching and slamming food.. . I'd say it's a mix of "The Pantry" and "Duke's" on Sunset all mixed together and then some..... . . BTW  Coffee lovers, every table gets fresh pressed coffee....
