To say I stumbled upon this place by accident would be a supreme understatement.  Having just driven to Atlanta from Augusta I was stuck in no-man's land - hungry and a little tired yet in town before the friends housing me asked I arrive.  What to do?  Well after a brief drive-by just to make sure I was in the right part of town it was time for technology to take over.  The trusty GPS device listed names of nearby food and then Yelp on the iPhone provided a strong review and within minutes I was in the door.. . Oh how I wish a restaurant like this existed right around the corner from where I live.  The place is totally casual, the people are entirely friendly, and the food is incredibly tasty!  There was a great selection of soups, each made available for tasting, and sandwiches/salads all of which seemed very fresh.  I had some sort of Thai chicken soup that had coconut milk and peanut butter and a bunch of other stuff I am not recalling.  The flavors blended together very well.  I also tasted and really liked the Gazpacho.  Last but not least, the web site is very cool and updated daily.. . If I'm ever in the area again I will definitely return!  And this time I will even bus my table (sorry for that, I looked around but didn't see the trash area).
