Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
I have discovered the best time to patronize Casa Bianca, a time that involves NO WAITING.  Yes, indeed that time is Halloween Night. . . Immediately seated.  Waitresses in costume.  I do the same thing everytime: Order a bowl of what tastes like homemade minestrone soup as I wait for my pizza to come up. Sop up the dregs of the soup with hot bread smeared with packets of butter.  Then, out comes the large pie with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom (canned, not fresh).  Crust, perfectly crispy.  Everything a tad salty so down lots of water or soda. . . Casa Bianca is one of my top 5 pizza places in all of LA.  Excellent.
