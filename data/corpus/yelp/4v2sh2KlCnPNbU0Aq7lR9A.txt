Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Went to Tank on a Monday for a late lunch with friends.  We enjoyed sitting outside in their small shaded eating area, sipping our $5 martinis and sharing a delicious variety of 1/2 price maki.  Hard to pick a favorite because all of their sushi tastes as good as it looks.  Larry, our waiter, was also the best!  He never made us feel the need to rush even though lunch was ending at 2:30. Take advantage of their specials and you won't be disappointed!
