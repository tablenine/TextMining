Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
I've eaten here dozens of times over the past four years and have tried everything on the menu except for their brunch specials which are only available Saturday and Sunday mornings.  Everything here is good.  Most things are great.  And the prices are incredibly reasonable.  Seriously, the only thing that I got that was a bit disappointing was the pizzadilla.  But if you steer clear of that oddity then you're sure to find success with your taste buds.  Plus, they've got the best french toast in the city, hands down.  Pick Me Up is great.  The end.
