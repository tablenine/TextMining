Ok ok ok.......... I pass by the TBC all the time and see all these people waiting outside. Just don't understand what's all the commotions are about, until I went yesterday to get it to-go. The shrimps and craw fish are soooo good. I love The Whole Shabang sauce that they used. . . Two things I would like to complain are:. 1). the shrimps are not that fresh.. texture is abit powdery and some of the shrimp heads are black (signs of not fresh).. 2). it should come with some bread, maybe french bread for dipping the sauce. Hate to see the sauce goes to a waste. . . Other than that..... I would definitely go back.
