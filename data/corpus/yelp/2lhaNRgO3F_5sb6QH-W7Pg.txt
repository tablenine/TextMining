Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Convenient valet parking. The prime rib and service were solid. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes and Lawry's own salt and pepper. Next time I may pass on the shrimp cocktail and opt for the popular Lawry's standard cut instead of the three thin English slices of prime rib. For dessert I had a typical good hot fudge sundae with nuts. I like that the salad and prime rib were prepared at my Â table. I walked in at 7pm on a Tuesday and got fast service. Large but a bit of an older decor.
