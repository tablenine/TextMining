Truly a case of twitter bugs blowing something out of proportion. The food is pretty good. But its not chase down truck, wait in line for an hour or more, ride the bus to flavor town good. . . If you like K BBQ go to a K BBQ, if you like tacos and burritos go to a mexican taco truck.. . In any normal case this trendy truck would loose its luster quick in the real world. But the areas it frequents are full of yuppie larva working at some .com, studio or living with mommy &amp; daddy who think they know Â good food, so it will last little longer.
