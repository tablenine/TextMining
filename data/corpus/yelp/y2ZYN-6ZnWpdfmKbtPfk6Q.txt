There are certain types of abuse I unleash on my body. . . 1.  6-8 hours of practice, well.. because I have to.. 2. Running everyday for at least 2 miles... Or I will. go apeshit at a postal office. . 3. Sit ups, crunches, leg lifts. Because I'm too cheap to buy new pants.   . . 4. (no longer viable at my age). . overeating and overdrinking. . It's been fun friends, but I'm so tired of hanging my head out the window, unleashing some unheard of projectile vomit. . . Coming here for Mike K's birthday, I had no idea this was an all you can eat till you die buffet. Though I must commend the restaurant on it's quality of meats. Filet mignon, lamb ribs, and bacon wrapped chicken were my favorite. The help is extremely efficient, and they will even help you track down a specific meat for you. . . Make sure to flip the card over to green if you want more meat! . . As mentioned by other yelpers, this is a vegetarian friendly place.  The salad bar alone can feed an army. A vast array of radishes, beets, lettuce, prosciutto, artichoke hearts, everything! If I were to. come again, I might just have the salad bar only. . . We were lucky to be in time for the dine la promotion, which was 44 a person (which included dessert- 10$ value). There were three desserts to. choose from. The flan was divine, rich and thick. We ordered the chocolate lava cake for the birthday boy, and we were not disappointed. The tres leches cake was drenched in something too fatty to. mention, but we were lovin it.. . Another reason why I'll try to avoid the place- their CRACK cheese bread. I have no idea how they baked the cheese in the bread?! WTF! . I bet they save millions in meat just becase of that little piece of cheesy cheese. Ugh. We ate 9 baskets I think. I know. I'm disgusted just writing it. . . And though I promised to never abuse my body like this ever again.... You know. Life's short blah blah. Im sure I'll. be back..
