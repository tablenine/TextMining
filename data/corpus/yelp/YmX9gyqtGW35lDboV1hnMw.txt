Awesome ambiance, food, drinks and an even more amazing waiter named Wayne. Wayne, if you're reading this, I hope you get all the tips you are entitled to and more, sir.. . We came here for a girlfriend's bachlorette party dinner and they were super cool about letting me decorate our table. Our reservation was for pretty early, 6p on a Saturday night and worked out well for us. It was still pretty mellow at that time so we were able to do our games and chit chat in semi-privacy til around 8p when the restaurant started to really fill up. . . We felt really well taken care of and Wayne made sure to make it an amazing night for us and especially for the bachlorette. We can't thank Lola's and their staff enough!
