Went here to eat and have a beer. The selection of sausages is pretty good. I tried the alligator, rattlesnake and duck. They were all really good. I guess I don't have the sophisticated pallet to taste the differences, but I wouldn't be able to tell the differences between any of them. The toppings (peppers, onions, saurkraut) were all really good. We also had fries and it came with a choice of 2 dipping sauces. We had the thai peanut and the aioli. . . The beer was pretty standard, regular domestic and belgian beers. Prices were about $8 a beer. . . This was in the art district near little tokyo. not a lot of parking, but you will find some.
