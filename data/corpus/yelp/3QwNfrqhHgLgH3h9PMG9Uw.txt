The only reason I would ever eat here is a combination of early-morning hours (because nothing else is open in the area), a drunken stupor (because that's how I roll) and peer pressure.. . The food definitely hits you the next day, and hits you HARD.  Makes you question life and God and if the sanitation department actually did its job.. . But I guess at 4 am, it does the trick.  You'll just have to wait half an hour for your food.
