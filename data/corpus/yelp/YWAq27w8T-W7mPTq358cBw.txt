I've had Kogi twice in the last week. I have to say, when I first heard the words "Korean taco truck" I had mixed feelings. I'm not a huge kimchee fan (it's a garnish and not a meal!) and so I was hesitant to try this. When I heard about the long lines, I was even less enthusiastic to track down one of their trucks. After trying some of their tacos, I am now a Kogi addict. I LOVE their Korean short rib taco!!! This is fantastic, and darn cheap ($2). It's not really kimchee that they put with the tacos, but a really fresh tasting slaw-like concoction. It's not fermented, but green and crisp. Being a self-proclaimed green onion hater, my friends think it is weird that I eat the "green stuff" in the tacos, since it has green onions and I think cilantro. I eat it because the flavor of the slaw is so delicious and matches the short rib perfectly! The chicken taco I had was just OK, it was a bit light for my taste, but then again, I'm usually not in the mood for a chicken taco- too light. I'd probably give them 5 stars if the lines weren't so long, but I guess that's the price you pay for having cheap, delicious food.
