OMG the biggest rip-off!  If you have plenty of money to throw out in this recession, then go and get your $12 burger and $7 fries here.. . I've only been to the Culver City location and it's full of BS young kids trying to look cool.  You gotta fetch for yourself and get your own table.  Good luck at this busy location.  More like you'll be standing around for a good 20 minutes.. . They only have one burger and you can't modify it.  It's so gross and too meaty for a girl like me.  I like more variety on my burger than just the caramelized onions, cheese, 3 snippets of arugula and a one inch thick meat patty.  I want my onions, tomato, and other goodies....not just meat, onion, and cheese that have only one flavor to it.  The taste is not complex enough...you'll soon get sick of the taste in your mouth.  Perhaps the first 3 bites were good.  I'll give it that.  Then it went boring from there on out.. . I'll take my In-N-Out any day....if i want to splurge, i'd rather go to Counter where they have better variety, and the wait staff actually seat you.
