Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
I didn't try the Thai food here but had 3 of the sushi rolls (Spider, Crunchy Spicy Tuna and one more I can't remember). They were all pretty good. Not out of this world good but tasty. We also had the crab rangoon app which I really liked. The thing I liked most about this place was that it has a really good atmosphere for a BYOB place. It gets pretty busy. I actually ate here on a Tuesday night and got a table without a reservation, but had tried once before to come on a Friday and couldn't get a table. With all the sushi and bringing our own wine, the bill came to $40 including tip. Can't beat that!
