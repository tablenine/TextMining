i just moved nearby to this place and thought this was gonna be a good spot...im sorry but i have to say "horrible service" i got there...the girl taking my order had the biggest attitude problem...i couldnt understand why...she made me want to make a scene and complain to the manager but i just wanted to enjoy a sandwhich with my friends...which i think she made extra small...overpriced...what a shame...so much potential here
