Restaurant: La Tavola Trattoria
Category: Italian
This restaurant is definitely cozy and quaint.  Their antipasto platter is definitely worth a try!  Their roasted garlic and marinated veggies are delish!  My guy and I tried both the Pennoni with Rabbit baked tube pasta stuffed with rabbit sausage and Swiss chard-bechamel and the Zuppa di Pesce which is a platter filled with clams, shrimp, calamari, fish,spicy tomato-lobster brodetto, herbs all on top of grilled bread.  . . The service was great and the food was good enough.  My boyfriend and I agree that the selections at Ecco are far tastier but if you're going to visit "La Tavola" you should definitely get the antipasto platter for starters!
