Went with a customer here for lunch.. . I got the cuban sandwich , its was good but ive had better. They have a alot of sanchwiches id like to try. So i will be back.. We ordered a potato ball and a meat pie. You have to like the cuban flavor or you wont like them. The meat pie i liked because of the sweet taste. The cakes look amazing and will have to try next time.
