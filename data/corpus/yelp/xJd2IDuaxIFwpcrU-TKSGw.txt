The service was horrible! The host told us that they were busy and to make sure we ordered right away. After ordering appetizers, the waitress "told on us" to the host and he came back saying he thought we were going to order right away, and continued to rudely suggest that we order our main courses... WHAT!? Needless to say we felt unwanted.. . The food was pretty good, but very expensive.. . Won't be going back to this small, cramped restaurant.
