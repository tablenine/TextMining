This is a great place to take your date. My boyfriend and I usually order one soy/salt flavored ramen bowl with cha-shu pork slice and extra noodles. This is enough to fulfill our hunger and we have enough room to get dessert elsewhere. Bon appetite folks! . . PS The "Special Number Two" bowl of noodles is worth a try for fun. It's ramen with a bunch of jalapenos.
