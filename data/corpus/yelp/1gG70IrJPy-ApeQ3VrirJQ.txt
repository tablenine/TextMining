Its very difficult for me to let my guard down and give a restaurant 5 BIG ONES, but this brazilian steakhouse takes the cake! I mean steak! I mean... whatever its just too good. Very expensive so bring the benjis. They price by the person, not by what you order. Lunch is cheaper, dinner is about $50 a head. So this is how your night will go...When you come in(hopefully with a reservation) they will seat you and take your drink order. While they're getting your drink feel free to get up and head over to the salad buffet. They have 40+ selections at the buffet but dont fill up! Your here for the MEAT!!! Once you sit down you will notice a tiny card on the table. One side green the other side red. Green means Go, I want you to pile me high with meat and red, means stop, I am eating. Be careful, if you forget to flip your card over to red, the waitors will keep coming over with their meat skewers. Also, besides the meat, they keep you stocked with platanos maduros(fried plantains) and mashed potatoes. COME HUNGRY. Oh I forgot, the service was great. All male waiting team. I dropped a fork and they picked it up and gave me a new one in 2 seconds(not an exaggeration people:). They do keep a keen eye on you so don't make this confession time with your table mates. I hope this review was helpful to all, Its worth the money.....
