Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
- Locale destination -. Actually this is a favorite place for my dad in Japan. He took me here..  Inside is Grand, Ritchy...you name it. It's in the middle of Beverly Hills. We did not make a reservation, so we had to wait. There is a cool bar in front of dining area.. . - Gluttony expedition -. Your server will spin your salad bowl in front of you to make an ordinary salad to extra fun salad. And you will get a gigantic potato, and a huge and thick prime rib.... We ordered Lawry's-Cut, of course. It was very pink and thick.. . It was very tender and tasty but what kind of person who can eat that much of foods by yourself????? Of course, we all had to have a doggy bag.... At least this place was memorable thanks to the spinning salad bowl and enormous amount of foods over prime rib, though the prime rib was good.... . . - Conqueror's deduction -. It's not cheap, but good experience and decent prime rib. You need to go there with a big hunger and big pocket $ :)
