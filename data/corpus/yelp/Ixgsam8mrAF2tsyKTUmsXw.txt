Sat Morning 4/11/09. For as long as I've been in Atlanta this has been my first introduction to Cabbagetown. Drove out of my way to get there after reviewing some of the other posts about this place, it reminds me of the funky little spots in the village (NYC). . . Strolled in for breakfast and the wait staff was very attentive and the portions were huge. My girlfriend and I couldn't finish everything.  We are waiting for the weather to warm up a bit to hang out there outside. I highly recommend it as a cool, laid back place with good food.
