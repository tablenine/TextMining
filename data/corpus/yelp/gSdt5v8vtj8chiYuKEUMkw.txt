Decent food with prices a little higher than average.  A friend turned me on to the a few months ago and I was impressed.  Delivery took about 45 minutes and the food what steaming hot upon arrival.  I had the spicy garlic shrimp while my girlfriend had the kung pao shrimp, both were super tasty and each had a large serving (including rice).  . . The second time we ordered delivery it. Took an hour and 10 minutes to arrive.  The food was warm and my spicy shrimp was alright but not as good as the time before.  My girlfriend had the honey walnut shrimp which I thought was disgusting.  It tasted and looked like shrimp coated in mayonaise.  I will give it another try since it was so good the first time.
