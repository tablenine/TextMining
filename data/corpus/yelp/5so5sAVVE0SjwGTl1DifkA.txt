I went here for brunch on Sunday and wasn't all that impressed. There was nothing wrong with our meal, it just wasn't all that memorable. It's cute on the inside, but a bit small and cramped. The food was decent, but the portions were pretty small -- I finished my meal in what felt like 5 minutes. I did really like the biscuit with homemade strawberry butter that came with my omelet, but all in all I think there are much better places for breakfast/brunch in the area, especially for the price range - $5 for a glass of orange juice? Puh-lease.
