Yes, I'm a fan. Been there twice with the girls both times. Unfortunately, the first time we thought we were going to hear the band, not. But, the food and drinks were good; and so was the company. The second time was so fun! We were seated in the front. Our party got there about 10 pm, band started at 12 pm and we ate, drank and grooved to the music.. . The only things I don't like is the parking situation. Even though that area is trying to come up, the parking needs to be better. And, when you make a reservation, they over book, only allowing for two hours. Key make reservations late if you want to enjoy the band on Friday or Saturday night.. . Otherwise, nice environment, laid back, great food and drinks. Recommend for small parties of 5 or less. Great time!!!
