You know I really want to give this place 3 and half but I'll let it slide with four. . . I went and waited close to an hour and half on a Saturday night have the "BEST BBQ" in the city.  So you know they warned us on the wait and they were within the time frame they gave us.  So that's a downside that the turnover of the tables is slow and its a small place.  . . They have a lot of good and unique beer choices along side some really good barbecue. The service was ok nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about.  There was a band setting up when we left so maybe the night life is the way to go. . . Overall I'd say go for take out...
