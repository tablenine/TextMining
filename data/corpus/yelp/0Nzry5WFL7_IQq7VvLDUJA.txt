I finally made it to the legendary Moody's last night, and I must say, it lived up to its reputation.. . It was indeed very dark, but in a cool way - we sat by the fire, and it felt like we were outside at a campfire.  The service was just fine, if not actually friendly - but, it was a pretty-quiet tuesday evening.. . I had a sloppy joe which was very tasty.  The fries were pretty good, but I only nibbled at them.. . Pitchers of beer are on the cheap side - $9.50 for Anchor Steam!. . And let me tell you, after spending a couple hours in there, the cold, crisp, fresh winter air feels amazing.  It's a bit greasy and warm inside Moody's... but in a comfortable way!
