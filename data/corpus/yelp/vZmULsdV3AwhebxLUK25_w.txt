Well, I'm number 186 to review this joint. If you've bothered to wade through the other 185 to find me here's my two cents: It's so yummy. Nothing you order will disappoint. The pizzas maybe, dare I say, the best in LA? California? Don't miss the pane bianco - it's stupid good and the tri colore. In the dozen or so times I've eaten here I progressively fall more and more in love.
