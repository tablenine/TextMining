Restaurant: Pasta Da Pulcinella
Category: Italian
this place has great pasta but i went there back in the 90's when it was on peachtree next to club anytime ... its has upscaled itself to much in my opinion .. i liked it when it was like a dirty fellini's pizza ... which ,by the way,  i think the same people that own fellini's  own or owned this place too !!!
