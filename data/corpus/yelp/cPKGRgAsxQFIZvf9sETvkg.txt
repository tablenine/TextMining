Perfectly average, although you wouldn't know it by the long lines outside on the weekend.  I guess as one of the few breakfast specialty joints, they have an edge on weekend mornings.  The atmosphere is kinda funky in a kitschy sort of way, the tables are close but not too close, and the inside-outside option is nice if you have a choice.  The waitstaff is eh, ok, not rude but does not particularly pleased about working here, so the service can be a tad slow.. . The tofu scramble is fine, with a shot of hot sauce, and the biscuit to me is just a biscuit.  I've also had the black bean quesadilla  which is passable but no great shakes.  Whatever they give you to put on the biscuit (strawberry-apple-butter-esque) is good, but they don't give you very much.  I thought the coffee was terrible. Prices are average.. . Overall its not worth waiting for, unless you have to have breakfast, and you have no other choice.  If there is no wait, and you have a hankering, its fine.  It is on a corner with a lot of drama, so you do get an occasional scene unfolding that involves lots of head bobbing and finger snapping, and it is quite easy to "accidentally" overhear stories of drama and debauchery unfolding at neighboring tables, which makes things a little more interesting if you're having a slow day (or month).
