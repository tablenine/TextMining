Restaurant: El Tesoro
Category: Mexican
I've been to El Tesoro twice - my first visit was phenomenal, and my second was all right.  LOVE the tacos - my favorite is the duck, and I think the price for the a la carte is fair.  My super favorite was the spinach and goat cheese empanada.  The second time that I went to El Tesoro, it was specifically to satisfy an empanada craving, so I was pretty heartbroken when our waiter came back and told me they were out.  From now on I'll be sure to call ahead.  In fact, the service the second time around was pretty distant.  However, my waitress on the first visit was so sweet and helpful!. I quite like the quirky house and kid-friendly front yard.  I don't have kids but the only place that I really don't like them is on airplanes :P. I've had the flan for dessert and it's great!
