Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
From the couple of hours I spent at here for the Yelp Elite event last month, I learned all I needed to know about Yamashiro.. . Come for the view, not for the food.. (Definitely don't come for the food.). . The decor of the place is pretty amazing. Their garden area is beautiful and serene - it gives off that Japanese vibe the restaurant tries so hard to convey. The restaurant as a whole, or at least the wings that I saw of it, are nice but not as great as the garden area. But, from those areas, you get a great view of Los Angeles, which is probably what you're there for in the first place.. . The view is breathtaking, I'll give it that. It was pouring outside the day I arrived, yet I could still tell that it had potential. Yamashiro is up on the top of a hill (which is a pain to drive up btw!), so if it didn't have a good view, I'd be pretty annoyed. I only wish it was clear night when I was there - I would probably have been gazing out the window instead of gazing towards the empty food trays. . . If the food they served during the Elite event was representative of the food they serve in general, eat elsewhere. They had these tiny caprese skewers that had no flavor to them. The little hor d'oeuvres they were passing out filled my stomach but didn't live up to the ambiance of the restaurant. I don't remember eating any sushi so I'm not sure how the fish quality is here.. . I used to have a friend who called Yamashiro his "date deal-sealer". Now, I don't think it's a deal sealer, but you'll definitely get some bonus points for the view if you take a girl here (just make sure she's not a foodie!).
