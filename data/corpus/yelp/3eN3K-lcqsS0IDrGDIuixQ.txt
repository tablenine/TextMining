Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
My parents were meeting my boyfriends parents and my parents thought that Palm's would be the best place to do it. It suppositively had decent food (not as good as some other hole in the walls) and the thai elvis was suppose to be pretty good). When we got there, it was pretty easy to locate and there was valet parking for ~2 dollars. When we saw that the restaurant got an A-health rating, we knew that this was not going to be good authentic thai food~ The restaurant wasn't so full at 6pm on a Sunday so that was good. We were promptly seated at a large table and given menus. We ordered a ton of food at least 15 dishes for 7 people. The only half decent dish was the papaya salad, but I've had much better at Wat Thai. The veggies we ordered were abnormally sweet. The fish was mushy and tastless, the beef was very dry, the fish cake was plane, the bbq chicken was bland etc... the list went on. Also when the Thai Elvis played we could barely hear him :( We were disappointed over all with Palm. The only good part of the evening is that the meeting went well. I would stick to hole in the walls with C-health ratings if you want real thai food.
