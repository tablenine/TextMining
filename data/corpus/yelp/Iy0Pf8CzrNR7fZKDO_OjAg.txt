One of the few things that made my dinner here worth it was the company I went with.  The other thing, which probably earned them an extra star, was the service.  . . The service was horrible, and yes I did say it *earned* them an extra star.  The waitress seemed flustered, and she messed every course except for dessert up.  We came during Yelp's restaurant week with the Yelp Eats menu.  So, the options were limited too.  Nonetheless, she got 2/3 appetizers right.  I ordered salad, but she accidentally brought soup.  I said it was okay and that I would just have the soup she brought, but she felt bad, so she brought the salad anyways, and just gave me both soup AND salad.  That was so nice and unnecessary, but she really wanted to keep us satisfied.  Then came dinner, and she only got 1/3 of the entrees right.  Poor girl.  She reentered the orders and a short wait later, the other two dinners came.  . . Finally came dessert and she got everything right.  The food was all good, but nothing was special except the two friends I was with and the waitress.  Unfortunately, the food counts for a lot, especially at this price.
