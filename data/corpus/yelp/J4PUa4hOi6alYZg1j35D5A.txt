I was so....certain....this was going to be the meal that got me back into the LA food scene. So certain that I delayed my birthday celebration a month to wait for them to re-open. . . So certain it wouldn't be another Providence, Melisse, AOC, Little Door, Violet, Wilshire, Michael's, (the list goes on) letdown. . . The contemporary American food scene in LA is now officially dead to me. Even Phoenix and Chicago are better. I'm ready to jump off a bridge. For the foreseeable future its only good ethnic meals and food trucks. . . Open to other opinions or people who can cheer me up, but unless you've lived in SF or New York, save it as I don't trust anyone anymore. . . Atmosphere of the new space is very sheik in a minimalist way. Nothing was bad or off with the food, but nothing spectacular. No more Mr. Nice guy...at $300 for 2, average doesn't cut it....2 stars and lucky to get that. . . Thank god for Newport Tan Cang for reminding me what food is special in LA. Â Gung hei faat coi everyone!
