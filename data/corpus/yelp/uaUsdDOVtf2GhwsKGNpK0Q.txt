My girlfriends and I took our friend who is getting married here for Happy Hour festivities as we tried out a bunch of different places in Culver City. Food was excellent - we snacked on truffle potato chips, flatbread and shrimp. Great drinks and excellent service - Kim was our server. She was really fun. I would definitely come back here and try the full menu. Great ambiance.
