Restaurant: The Real Chow Baby
Category: Asian Fusion
If you're unfamiliar with Mongolian BBQ, then you might like Chow Baby.  The novelty, the suggested combinations, the general prettiness of the space. . . If, however, you're familiar with Mongolian BBQ, then you'd best stay away.  . . The basic concept is the same, load your bowl full of all the veggies, starches, meats, and sauces that you like, and the person you hand it to will cook everything on a large griddle.  Repeat.  Rinse. . . Chow Baby's execution, however, leaves much to be desired.  Chow Baby dresses up the restaurant space with a fancy bar to make everything a little trendier, thus inviting more people to crowd the line.  Couple this with either smaller cooking stations or basically-skilled cooks, and you'll find the line backs up significantly when the restaurant is crowded.  . . I don't know if this is by accident, where the owners didn't think they'd attract such crowds, or by design, where the restaurateurs potentially sought to minimize the number of return trips to the buffet. Either way, you should temper your expectations for all-you-can-eat food here.
