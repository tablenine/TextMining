Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
FInally made my way to Cemitas after constantly hearing how great it is from a few friends. I shared a Milanesa Cemita with my friend and absolutely enjoyed it. We also had tacos which are very tasty. . Will definitely be going back since it's not too far from my house.
