before I get dissed for the 2 stars. all i can say that the food was good. i've ate here several of times, i try to limit myself from going here to at least 5-10 times a year, before i develop a massive coronary.  the place is always packed, there were times when the wait was worth it, and there were a few times when the food was mediocre, sometimes making KFC quite the delectable one.  I'd still go here once every blue moon, but I would have to agree with my friend, when he said it's over rated.
