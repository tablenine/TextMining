Well let me start off with saying I was one of the 5 people in Sam's Boot camp gang and I am F******KING pissed off. 5 of us waited in line for a little over a hour and a half and we did not get served and the crazy part about it was they did not run out of food and there was only 7 people left at the end of the line to serve. . . They just decide to shut down with no warning. I know they are suppose to be open from 12-4pm but common sense should have told them to send someone out an hour before closing to the end of the line to let people know that no one after this person will be serve. . . This is a very basic customer service solution to enact in a situation like this. I even told one of the older employees or owner this when he was trying to calm down the mini riot that had started (some people had started arguing and cursing the establishment). Oh and by the way one of the younger employee was very rude and disrespectful to us that did not get serves as Sam explained in his post.. . I own and run a couple of businesses for almost 10 years and I can tell you this is not good customer service in anyway or form. I can't even tell you how the taco I did eat tasted, (thanks to a couple of the people in our group who share theirs with the rest of us) because my disappointment and anger spoiled the flavor. . . I have no plans to ever stand in line again for this company or eat there again and although I do not like to suggest people boycott this place. I think you might want to consider all of this before you leave your car to get in line because you just might not get served!. . PS: I think giving them 1 star is F****KING to much!
