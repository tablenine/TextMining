NOT for delivery, I discovered.   Holy hixinjiàng (hoison) sauce !  WAY too expensive for what you get... and for the food to arrive cold (it's not even that cold outside today) is unacceptable.   I ordered an order of Orange Chicken (just ok), the PingPong Chicken (slightly better), and for myself, the Cashew Tofu (blah and extra blah cashews that were drenched), with rice + spring rolls and dumplings.   $59.35  + tip!     . Now, if the food had been amazing and not cold, then totally worth it.   But it wasn't.  Clearly, they weren't too busy, because the food arrived in less than 45 minutes, so what's the deal I say ?  No deal.  No slice, no chop, no block, side drive, or lob.   Never again.  Get a grip Ping Pong, your drop shot is suffering.
