Category: Steakhouses
I have to say the service is as good as everyone gives it. Definitely an upscale restaurant to go to. It wasn't that packed on a sunday night, but we did go kind of early. I got the bone in filet and other's ordered sea bass and new york strip. The steak is good I have to say and so is the size. I can't believe there's 24 oz steaks.. I think I would have given it 5 stars since it is a good place for steak in CA. BUT compared with Trautman steaks...it is not comparable. Trautman steaks literally melts in your mouth but you can only get it in NE (mail order is an option). If I never had Trautman steaks, this would have received 5 stars. The dessert was alright, I've had better. The cheesecake was eh, I still prefer cheesecake factory ones over this. The chocolate cake was good b/c of the truffles inside and it was dry, but it was too coarse for my liking. Caviar was GOOD! Good place to get caviar if your into that kind of stuff.
