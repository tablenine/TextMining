Category: Pizza
Update: After numerous visits over several months, I can safely say that their food (except the meatloaf from the deli take-out counter, the pizzas, and the portabello fries) is mediocre at best. Â Their pastries and their customer service, however, remain above par, and are the reason I am taking away only one star from my original review.
