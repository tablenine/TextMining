I love this place, don't get me wrong.  One of my top choices for my last meal on earth would be for their "Sassy Eggs,"  and I come here LITERALLY ever time I come back into town from Philadelphia.  The only thing that drops me down a star is their goddamn host, and I have never sworn on yelp before.  . . She has the nerve to take your name and kick out into the FREEZING cold of Chicago while there is PLENTY of space in the back of their restaurant for you to wait.  Or if not you would think they could make room for their CUSTOMERS.  She also has the nerve to tell you to go wait in a coffee shop next door which would mean that you would have to SPEND MORE MONEY in another business.  . . If my reviews were based on first impressions alone I would have walked out of their and given this place 1 star.  It's a good thing I got addicted to this place in the summertime.  Otherwise, this place is the best.
