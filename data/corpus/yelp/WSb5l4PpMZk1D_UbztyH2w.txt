The burger was pretty tasty but nothing so amazing that I'd go back to deal with valet parking, the poor service and wait times and the price.  It's still a burger after all -  I'd be just as happy spending 1/3 of the money on IN-N-OUT.. . PS:  I got the onion rings and they were greasy as hell -  and don't roll your eyes because yes, I know that they are deep fried - but there's deep fried and crispy and there's soggy greasy mush - mine was the latter.
