Great meal at Desta on Friday - the place was busy but we got there just as several tables were getting up.  It's a great little space on Briarcliff.  Haven't had Ethiopian food in a while so we ordered the veggie combo and the meat combo so we could try a little bit of everything.. . Loved the lentils and collard greens and the chicken tibs the best.  Will definitely be back to try the tilapia and some of the appetizers.. . Service was friendly and fast - we never had to ask for anything - waters (a few spicy dishes on the table!) and injera were refilled as needed.
