YES YES YES YES YES! This place is great! Not only do they have amazing baked goods and ice cream, they also have fantastic food. I have been here for lunch many times, and I have tried the Cold Soba Noodles with shrimp, and the TBLT. Oh wow. The noodles were light and refreshing, satisfying without being too filling. I would recommend this on a hot day when you know you should eat but are kind of too hot to think about it. The TBLT is a symphony in your mouth! It's a panini-style sandwich with melted cheddar, bacon, and sliced turkey and tomato. It is finished with a light spread of meyer lemon mayo. SO GOOD. It sounds like it could be a greasy mess, but even when I ordered it as take-away the bread was perfect. . . When I left I tried the coffee toffee bon bon, and a mint chip bon bon. REAL MINT was in the ice cream...does it need more explanation? no. Milk is a YESSSSSSSS.
