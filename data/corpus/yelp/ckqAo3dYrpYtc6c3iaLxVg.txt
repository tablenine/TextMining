Two of their medium pizzas fed 5 very hungry florists on Valentine's Day ... and the best part?  We only had to wait 20 minutes for takeout, we were so happy to hear that since we were starving at 11:30 and were worried we'd have to wait awhile due to the lunch rush.. . We ordered the thin crust pizza, one plain cheese, the other had pepperoni and onions.  There was enough for all of us, even a couple slices leftover for the staff that came for the afternoon rush.  Everyone gave the pizza rave reviews.  It was piping hot and extremely tasty.
