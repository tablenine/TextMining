This is a great place to go with a group of friends for some light dishes. Tapas style restaurant, you can order a variety of izakaya - style dishes. Nice to wash down with beer or other drinks. The menu has a good variety of dishes although some may be out of season/stock. The only problem I have with this place is that it's usually crowded, and you may have to wait...a while to get a table.
