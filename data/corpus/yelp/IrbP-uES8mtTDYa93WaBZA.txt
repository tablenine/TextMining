Most of my reviews aren't very useful and are an excuse for me to blog ever since I realized I'm not 18 any more and deleted my Xanga. So I'll   save you all time and skip the story.. . Food: (+3) stars- The chicken thigh and wings are Good, but not subarashi! . . Price: (+1) star - I ordered a large Asahi, chicken thigh and gyutan taki + tax and tip = $21. Not bad. . . Wait and Service:( -1) star -  The waits are normally 30min. I can deal with that. It gets crowded I understand. However, this has some implications on the service. It took forever to get some new orders as well as the final check. . . Atmosphere: (+1) star - I think I go out to eat to enjoy the company more then the food. To be frank I'm as happy eating 10cent instant ramen as I am some gold sprinkled sushi at one of Nobu's joints. So I like this place for its vernacular feel. A place I can order some biiru and light munchies with some pals and palettes. . . Tip: To expedite getting your check . . Politely smile and say "O-kanjou onegaishimasu"
