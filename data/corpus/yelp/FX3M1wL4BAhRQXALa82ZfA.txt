I'd never heard of Canter's the first time I went, although everybody told me I should have. And being a Guns N Roses fan, Canter's told I should have heard of them, too. Well, I hadn't and aside from the little signs that inform you that Axl, Slash and the boys practically grew up there, I still am not totally sure what makes this place so famous. Movie stars, perhaps?. . Nevertheless, the food alone could pass along their reputation. I've never had anything there that wasn't exactly how I wanted it to be. Nor have I been accompanied by anyone that didn't touch their food to their lips and have the moment immediately followed by a "Oh my god." . . It's delicious.. . My favorites so far have been the turkey philly, the cheese to veggie ratio was downright perfect and the turkey was that just-this-side-of-dry that you need in a chopped meat sandwich. Most recently I went for the roast turkey open faced sandwich. It's pretty much Thanksgiving on a plate. They also have complimentary spiced pickles that will have you asking for a second plate before your meal even arrives.. . The one star subtraction has to do with the price. Get a salad, a soup, two sandwiches and two beers and you'll easily have a $60 bill. But I guess if you're famous, you can charge what you want. Whatever. I go here when I feel like splurging. It's good food. The decor and the crowd are enough to keep you coming back. I'm sold.
