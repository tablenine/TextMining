Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
It's pretty ironic that this place is called "Filling Station" as some people in our party were left hungry after ordering an entree with a bit/side.. . We were seated in the outside area of the restaurant that overlooked the street. It was a nice place to be sitting. The only problem was that the heat lamp didn't work that night but at least the staff offered our party some blankets . . I ordered the cut noodles ($16) (that had pieces of bacon in it and what looked like pieces of brussel sprouts) and the soup the day ($7) which was a split pea with ham hock. I was sorely disappointed in both. The noodles lacked any flavor and I would have added salt to my dish if it was made available on the table. The split pea was thick in consistency, very baby food like and I felt like for only 3 bucks, I could have gotten a better version of it at the diner down the street from my house. I got to try a little bit of the polenta cakes and the people that got that were pleased even though the portions were a bit on the skimpy side. The mac and cheese would have been great if just added with the meal, but to order it separately didn't seem to add to the overall experience.. . The wait staff that night was a little all over the place. I got my soup about 5 minutes after my entree even though it's listed as a starter. I had to ask for my order of sprite as they forgot the first time around. And it took me a good while to flag someone down for a refill. . . To me, it felt like a pretentious LA spot that charges $25+ for like $5 quality food. The service was a bit off the night I came, though it was crowded the night we came. The waitress smiled the entire time so it was easy to overlook her mistakes. . . All in all, I would have preferred paying Father's Office a visit down the street. Probably won't see myself coming here again.
