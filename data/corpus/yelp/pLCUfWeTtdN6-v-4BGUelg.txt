Daikokuya; possibly a teensy weensy bit over-rated.. Okay, so I've only been to this hot spot once, and tried the noodles. Uh.. not a lot of variety in terms of choices of noodles, but we tried them. Isn't it what made the place famous? . . It was..adequate.. . Okay, so I've only been once, but I'm judgemental and for now I say "no!" especially given you have to stand like an idiot for XXX hrs before you get seated. But I'll give it another try some other time.
