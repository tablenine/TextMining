Went here on a Friday for a celebratory lunch.  I was surprised, the food was affordable.  The salmon sandwich and the grilled blue cheese sandwich (both $8) were fantastic.  The chocolate fondue was yummy and the flourless chocolate mousse cake with bananas anglaise and peanut butter puree was a flavorgasm.  Our servers were nice and helpful with helping us pick out different bottles (of which we had many) as we lazed about on the couches.  Great way to spend an afternoon.  . The jazz club downstairs looked cute, I hope to go back and check it out in action.. . 8/24/07 update: was there last night.  Jazz club was quaint, but music sounded like a wedding a little to me.  Came here for lunch again today, and let me add asparagus tempura to the list of yummies.  The prawns were a little overcooked and the sauce was bland, so I don't think I would order those again.  Again, the mousse cake was superrichly awesome.. . oh, and Andy, our fellp yelper, always takes great care of us.  He is awesome.
