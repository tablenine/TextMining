If you want exceptional service, consistently excellent food and a lovely patio, this is it. The best Beverly Hills has to offer. Every time I've been here, the food has been incredible. The service is unobtrusive but good, although the last time I went we waited a bit too long for the soups and food. It wasn't terribly busy, either. The waiter was fine but he seemed slightly disinterested, maybe an off day. . . The butternut squash soup more than made up for that though. Wow. Just incredible that something so simple could be so complex and perfectly balanced. I could taste about 10 different things going on with the textures of the garnishes and the stock he uses. Great.. . I'd come back any time but I love this place for lunch, the patio is such a nice calm oasis in bustling Beverly Hills.
