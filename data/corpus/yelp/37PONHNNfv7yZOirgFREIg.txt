Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
Want some island-style Hawaiian Asian food?. . This place offers, among other things, Hawaiian BBQ beef, pork, chicken as well as some distinct Japanese and Korean food (Udon and sushi) - all at a surprisingly inexpensive price. With each order (you pay for drinks, but they have free refills), you'll get a couple of cups of rice, and a small macaroni salad. You can take it to go or sit inside and watch the TVs.. . This place is situated on La Vista and Briarcliff, along side the Catus Car Wash and across the street from Starbucks. Parking is not a problem (in fact, it never seems to be a problem. . . I'm worried about them).. . Overall, if you live in the area (or passing by), try this place out. The people are quite nice and frankly. . . I think they need the business. :/
