Restaurant: Wurstk√ºche
Category: Hot Dogs
I had heard many stories of this hidden restaurant: crazy sausages...line of german beers...assortment of mustards...more crazy sausages....I just had to make it one of my stops on my tour through Southern California.. . Now by "hidden restaurant", I mean a place that you could literally walk right past and have no idea it was there...exactly what I almost did! . . Looking at the menu, I knew that I had to go big or go home...after all...I was here to try new foods right? So I ordered a duck and bacon sausage...and an alligator and pork one for the hell of it. The only thing we have up in NorCal is a Top Dog. They have a huge assortment...but nothing like this!. . We also ordered a side of the french fries with truffle oil on top...WHICH WERE DELICIOUS!!! I have no idea what it was they did to those fries to make them so good...and addictive! Was it the truffle oil? Special salt? Cocaine? Who knows!??! Holy Moly!!. . I had no idea that dining area was in backside of the restaurant...so it was kinda cool walking into this sorta secret lair w/ a full bar haha. . Now we got the sausages, and I dug right in. I swear the duck did not taste like duck! And I eat duck a lot! But it was really good nonetheless. The alligator on the other hand tasted like...fish. I have no idea what people are thinking when they say its like chicken. I mean it's an animal that sits in the water for 95% percent of the day...oh well. It was very delicious...a weird addition to my palette. . . Eating at Wurstkuche wasn't really the Wurst...it was really fun! I can brag to all my friends that I ate an alligator hot dog...AN ALLIGATOR HOT DOG! It was a really fun experience...and I hope that I can come back later to try out the rattlesnake! Now remember! Go big...or go home!. . Also remember to order the fries :)
