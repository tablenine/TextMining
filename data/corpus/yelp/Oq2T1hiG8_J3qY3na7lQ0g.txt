We got here at around 10pm and the wait was about 15 mins for party of 5. We ordered some appetizers, and the signature daikoku ramen. I ordered the half size since the bowls were huge. They messed up my order and brought me out a big bowl, so they gave me a big bowl for the price of a half size. I shared my portion with Â my husband. The broth is very tasty filled with tons of flavor, the egg was cooked to perfection where the yolk was nicely soften inside. The slices of black pork was very tender and melts in your mouth. I was not too big on the appetizers, we ordered some tuna rolls and tuna sashimi. But again, this a ramen house so it still deserves my 4 stars rating.
