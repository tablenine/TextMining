One day, driving by we decided to actually go in instead of saying, "We should try it out one of these days!"  With the curious urge satisfied, we never have to wonder again.... . Yep yep, chicken and waffles and fruit punch!  You get exactly what you ask for.  Three stars for an enjoyable if completely predictable experience.  . . It's KFC plus!  (But without the tasty biscuits.)  Put some jelly on the waffles...it's good.
