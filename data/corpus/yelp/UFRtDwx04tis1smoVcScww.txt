Yes, the wait is long especially during prime time.  The wait might be shorter if the servers didn't lag so hard with bringing the bill.  And I am pretty sure the ramen wouldn't be such a rockstar if he didn't contain those delicious strips of pork belly that totally "burst with flavor" and just "melt in your mouth."  It's pretty awesome.  The broth is also excellent and rich and the noodles are just normal ramen Sun Noodles, but super comforting.  . . I order the half-size ramen bowl so I can get an appetizer as well and I end up with the perfect amount of food.  I love the gyoza because they are stuffed with the crazy pork and taste wonderful with a tall Sapporo.  So I always order those two guys together.  It is actually worth the wait and not bad for a hangover.. . The fried tuna appetizer is fried with a shiso leaf, which is an interesting taste.. . Ignore the MSG label.
