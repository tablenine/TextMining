WOW. I really enjoyed myself. From the moment I walked in it was an event to watch. We had a seat at the bar and the host who adored us sent us bubbly on the house. Mind you I did have a reservation but... 2 hours on the beautiful freeway. However considering that I was 30 minutes late. They were sweet as can be. Mind you i did call 2 times to be in communication. We were really enjoying ourselves at the bar so by the time are table was ready we decided to just have dinner at the bar. Loved my Bartender. As for the Boutique wine collection ita well priced and a good selection. The plates we great. Flavor was outstanding. So once the pizza cam it was magic on my palate. Desserts were very interesting part sweet and part sour in everyone. If Â you want a table than either wait 2 hours or call 3 weeks in advance and go during the week its worth the wait. So go my friend have a glass of vino and some mind blowing pizza.
