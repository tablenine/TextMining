Restaurant: Market
Category: American (New)
When I started reading some of these poor reviews, it blew my mind! Market has the best views of the city, fantastic food and an extremely friendly wait staff. They are generous with the booze too!. I have never had to wait for a table, and have always been welcomed with a smile. I have even been greeted by the GM on several occasions, and she was friendly and extremely accommodating.. This place is amazing and has become my favorite bar stop in Chicago.
