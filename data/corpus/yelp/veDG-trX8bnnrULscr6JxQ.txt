Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
If you're going to recommend a tourist-friendly pizzeria, Malnati's has got to be at the top of your list.  . . I think it's the crust that sets Malnati's apart.  A thing of beauty; a work of art.  Thick but not too bready, crispy but not crumbly, buttery but not overly sweet.  In fact, they should make a crust pizza.  Little kids would fucking hate it, but I'd be all over it.  . . Just a couple of slices and you're set.  I suggest not ordering a large, because you'll inevitably have leftovers, and I've never found a deep dish pizza that reheats well.  . . Abuse this place and you won't make 50.
