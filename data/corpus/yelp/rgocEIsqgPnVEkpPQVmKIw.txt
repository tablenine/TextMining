Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
My husband had tried many Hainan chicken rice from different places and he likes this the best. Even though we live far, far away in Riverside, whenever he feels like having chicken rice, off we go to Savoy Kitchen. He always go for chicken breast with no skin, and lots of sauce! Usually chicken breast is drier than other parts of the chicken, but my husband said Savoy just did it perfectly, very moist. The curry sounds promising, might try it one day. Bit troublesome on the parking matter, and the one girl taking order indoor has a deadpan expression, but who cares, let's eat.
