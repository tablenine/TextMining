Restaurant: The Bluebird
Category: Wine Bars
Went to Bluebird on a Friday night around 11PM with some friends. I liked the atmosphere, dark and candlelit, and kind of reminded me of a loft with the high ceilings and brick walls. We ordered two bottles of wine, the Cabernet Franc &amp; Moscato along with the cheese platter. The cheese platter was good, but was very surprised there was only a couple of different cheeses. The service was a little slow but everyone was very nice. Overall, if you are looking for a good time with friends this is a good place. Two words for Bluebird - intimate and classy :)
