Restaurant: Bhojanic
Category: Indian
The first thing I noticed when I walked into Bhojanic was the lack of Indian patrons (i guess they don't eat here).  I ordered the talapia, it  tasted OK but for the remainder of the night I had this odd burning in the pit of my stomach. But a large glass of Spite at the Highlander cured that.  The leftover  food was actually quite tasty at work the next so it wasn't a total loss.. . The service was ODD...something like rudeness with a smile. I asked for lemons for my tea and she brought me lemon slices wrapped in a napkin...HUH!?  You are asking people to pay $15-18 for an entree and u can be bothered the waste a saucer for lemon slices??? ODD
