What a great deal for lunch!  A whole roasted chicken with 4 sides for $30!  This easily fed our hungry table of 4.  Almost unheard of for a "sit-down-and-be-served" lunch on the Upper East Side.. . Only complaints:  it was the coldest day of winter so far in Manhattan, and Pio Pio wasn't prepared:  it was a meat locker in there.  Also, my Cusqueno beer was flat.  But we'll all be back.
