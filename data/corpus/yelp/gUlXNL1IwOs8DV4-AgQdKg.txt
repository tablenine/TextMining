Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
I recently visited this restaurant based on the hype and reviews and don't understand all the hype. The actual sushi was pretty good (i.e. straight fish like albacore, yellowtail, salmon etc), but all the rolls were horrible, too cold, with way too much rice (and bad rice at that). Didn't try the other specialties, so maybe that's the draw....Or, maybe it's the z-list celebrities - a girl from Top Model who didn't win and James Van Derbeek (eh, from Dawson's Creek) were there. . . At least we didn't have to wait to be seated. I managed to get reservations 3 days before, after calling several times and getting the busy signal each time. The prices were actually not bad at all, which was a surprise. Hama Restaurant in Venice is about double the price (for better sushi though). Â My local favorite sushi spot, Yoshi's, however is still cheaper and has much better rolls. And I wouldn't say this place had a great atmosphere. It's small and tables are very close together.
