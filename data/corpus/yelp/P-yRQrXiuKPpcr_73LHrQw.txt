I've only gone for dessert which is delicious.  Everything tastes fresh and like it's made with natural ingredients.  The ice cream sandwiches were a little mushy but that wasn't a big deal.  The sundae I ordered was huge but I had no problem finishing because it was so good. The whipped cream was amazing.  You could tell it didn't come out of a can. Definitely worth trying.
