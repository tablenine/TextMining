BYOB. Awesome food. Down home cookin'. Corn casserole, mashed sweet potatoes...Quiet patio out back for outdoor dining. You and your sweetie can bring your own beer and stuff yourselves for $20. Free jukebox. Chicken paraphenalia galore. What more could a diner ask for? Probably not the place to bring a first date since it is "down home" but a cool neighborhood eatery.
