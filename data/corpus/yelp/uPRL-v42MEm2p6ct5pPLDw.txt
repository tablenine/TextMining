Zyka rates somewhere in the middle of my Indian food experiences in Atlanta.. . We went for Saturday dinner, and the place was a zoo. There were tons of Indian families there, which is certainly a good sign. You get in line to order at the front, and then try to find a table while you wait for your name to be called. . . One thing that really bothered me was that all the food is served on styrofoam plates and bowls. The amount of unrecyclable waste this place produces per hour boggles my mind. That alone is a reason for me to think twice about returning. . . The food was good, but not mindblowing. Pretty much standard tasty Indian food. They also have homemade kulfi (ice cream), which was quite good.
