Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
I love love love Boiling Crab!. I always order the crawfish and occasionally the shrimps and crab legs.. but to me, the crawfish is a sure winner because I like to suck on their heads! I know it sounds funny, but it taste great! I would have given them 5 stars but I hate how the spicyness of the "whole shabang" changes. I normally order very spicy and it will either not be spicy enough or toooo spicy. I guess if you are into spicy food, its best to just go with spicy.. because when its too spicy it is killer! Also, the hot wings.. beware.. they are HOTT! Gumbo is only so-so..... All in all.. you will enjoy! Even I keep coming back and I bring more and more people with me!
