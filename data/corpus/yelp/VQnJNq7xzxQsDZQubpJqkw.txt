Pupusas! Finally! The ones I had here were yummy, not too oily. I ordered a Loroco (cheese and herb) and Revuelta (pork and cheese). Too bad they messed up my order and I ended up with a bean and cheese pupusa instead of the loroco. =( The pupusa plates are very reasonable and filling ($8). The Salvadoran special comes with one pupusa and delicious green corn tamales. Don't miss the tamales! I'm definitely coming back to try other dishes.... . Loved the cozy atmosphere. The waiters are nice and Gloria is very sweet. The patrons are also awesome...someone bought my friend and I flan for dessert, but Â left before we could thank him. So...thank you whoever you are!
