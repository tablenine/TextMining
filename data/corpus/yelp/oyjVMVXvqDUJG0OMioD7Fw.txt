dunno. parked across the street cuz u know how the peeps love to make restaurants w/ 2 parking spots in their back lot.  1 1/2  hr wait on saturday after boarding @ bear... um 730 we put our name in.  732, we left and drove down to crabulous down a ways.  . take 2:  theresa and i went to meet to have dinner there, we waited bout 1 hr  on thrusday @ 6.  really not a fan.  chix wings were aite.  seafood comes in a bag filled w/ GARLICY hot sauce... the garlic. omg, that shit gets in between ur nails, and u smell liek that the next morning no matter how hard u scrub (or brush)... stuff is KICKin.  and not in a good way.  it aint the hype for sure.... but then, im not really a seafood fan, unless its plain and dunked in butter.  the sauce is good, but... again, aint worth the hype its given.
