There's a shitload of these kind of cafes up and down Melrose and after browsing the menu outside (and also because it was the closest one) we decided to give it a try. The staff was super friendly, a pleasant surprise being in West Hollywood. I knew we were in the right place when they served us house water (scoff all you want) from a pitcher full of mint leaves. . . I ordered the Chicken Curry sandwich and while the description mentioned raisins - a combo I've never had in a sandwich - it turned out to be really good. It's lightness caught me off guard and was the perfect meal before blowing my life savings on clothes. . . Come here and sit outside if it's a sunny day. All windows stay open so they use very minimal lighting, which is always a cool look and I guess makes them somewhat "green."
