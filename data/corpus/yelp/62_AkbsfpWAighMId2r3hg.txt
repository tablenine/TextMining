Restaurant: Dante&#39;s Down the Hatch
Category: Fondue
I lived in Atlanta for ten years, and this is my favorite restaurant there. . Yes, it's cheesy, but how many places on yelp get scathing reviews because of their lack of decor? Not exactly a problem at Dante's. I've spent many a bday and NYE meal here. Lots of great memories. . . To anyone who has reviewed that the food is better at the Melting Pot--hahahahahahahahahaha! That could not be further from the truth. The Melting Pot is a shitty chain (we have 'em up here in Chicago, too, and we ignore them), and Dante's is a unique spot. . . The service is always fantastic; the servers are trained as hell. . I don't know why someone had to hate on Dante. He was known as the unofficial mayor of Underground Atl back in the day, and he didn't get that moniker from "pretending" to like his customers. . . The cheese app fondue and Mandarin entree fondue are your best bet. And yes, TMP has more sauces. Who cares? If McDonald's had 8 kinds of condiments to put on their McNuggets, would you go there more often? As someone else said, each of DDTH's sauces are better than the next, and each is really great on a certain meat. . . If you're a first-timer, pay the stupid cover, sit on the ship and enjoy. If you've been before, don't bother. It's something you need only do once (but when you do, it's enjoyable). I like the booths on the ship. Off of the ship, I try to snag one of the cupola-like tables or one of the tables that look down on the gators. . . All in all, an experience to remember.
