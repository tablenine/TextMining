Restaurant: Panahar Bangladeshi Cuisine
Category: Restaurants
Nice atmosphere and good food. You can tell the owner is a business nerd - he has all these ideas like giving first-timers a 25% off coupon for their next meal. The waiters are a little pushy and will try to talk you into ordering way more than you wanted, but they're friendly nonetheless.. . I got talked into getting a mango lassi (good, mild and yogurty rather than overly sweet like at some other places), garlic naan, fish bhuna maang-sho (not amazing, but good) and chicken makhani (good). Kind of a bummer that they charge you for chutney/achhar, rather than serving it as a condiment with your meal. I've noticed that at some other South Asian places in Atlanta - what's the deal? Overall, though, while it was a little expensive, it was worth it.. . Comment to the other Yelpers who referred to this place as "Indian" in their reviews: Bangladesh is not India, dude. You wouldn't review a Southern barbecue restaurant and call it "British food," would you?
