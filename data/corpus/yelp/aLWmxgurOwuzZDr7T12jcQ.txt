Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
Hacienda was one of my favorite places to go to but I must say I am so disappointed in them now. The chips use to be so fresh and lite now they are heavy and full of oil. My tacos had no flavor...what happen Uncle Julio??? Don't think I will be back to visit you anytime soon
