Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's is my weakness when I'm driving down La Brea around lunchtime. It's their chili cheese fries that substitute for my Thanksgiving dinner when it's not Thanksgiving. I've only tried a few of their hot dogs offerings, but they were always good. . This reveiw would be 5 stars if not for the perennial long line, but Pink's is worth the wait. Not to be missed.
