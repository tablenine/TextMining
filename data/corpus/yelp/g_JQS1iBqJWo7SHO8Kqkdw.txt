Some top choices from a long and varied menu: . .  Lamb Dip, Beef Dip, Cole Slaw, Pickled Eggs, Potato Salad +.  Baked Apple is a great dessert ( and healthy yet ! ). . Good coffee is still a dime !  They have a separate counter line for coffee only, so you can have it hot at the end of your meal without  waiting.. . We buy several jars of their special hot mustard to use at home in making  potato salad, egg salad and deviled eggs !  Just not right without it !. . Open 6am to 10 pm.  Cash only.  . . A fun place to be !
