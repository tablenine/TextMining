When I first came here a few years back, I remember stepping into the place and thinking, Gosh, this reminds me alot of the Cheesecake Factory...especially the menu...and come to realized, it's owned by the same people...Though not a big fan of their decor, I've eaten here many times (actually...alot!)  for the abundance of items on the menu and I always thought it tasted pretty good.  Yeah their parking sucks (in the Beverly Center parking lot) but I love their salads (they're huge!!) like the southwestern salad, their patty melt is real good...never fails to make me feel like I have a heart attack, their garlic ranch dressing is a must for my fries (MMMM...dont' know anywhere else that makes the dressing like that) and their molten chocolate cake and hot beignets are divine...though the price becomes pretty pricey, I overlook the empty pockets to satisfy my cravings..
