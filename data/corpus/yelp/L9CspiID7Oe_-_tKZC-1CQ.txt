THIS IS NOT FOR THE RESTAURANT!!!  . . We came here on a Thursday night at the suggestion of someone that lives there.  There was a nice crowd there but not really that packed.  That's to be expected on a Thursday.  However, the people that were there WERE LAME!!!  LAME LAME LAME!!  . . There is no real dance floor...so as we are walking by  to get to the bar, we have to squeeze past a bunch of chicks in Spandex and lycra blend Rainbow/Wet Seal/Body Central club fits on, all dancing with each other and one random dude in the middle.  TAKE AWAY ONE STAR FOR THAT!. . We get to the bar and I order 3 Washington Apples.  THE BARTENDER TAKES DOWN 3 MOUTHWASH SIZED WAX DIXIE CUPS...*I was thinking to myself, he must be giving me a sample*  When he set them shots in front of me and SAID 33 DOLLARS!  for washington apple's in a wax mouthwash cup?  When I woke up from fainting...I made sure that I told him a place with this reputation should not be serving drinks in wax cups!!!  The most fun we had was taking pictures in the globe chairs they have!  HORRIBLE!!!  WE SHOULD'VE WENT TO 10 PINS!!!. . GEISHA HOUSE GETS A HUGE FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
