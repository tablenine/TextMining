Category: Steakhouses
Very good meal last night. Missed one star for the service, which should have been much better (1 example: we brought a bottle of vino--$25 corkage fee--that's listed for $225 on the menu and the waitress didn't decant it). But we had an amazing table of food: sauteed shrimp, bone-in ribeyes, Mastro's mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, and creamed corn. The steak was perfectly cooked with thick lines of delicious fat embedded in the meat. It was juicy, tender, and spectacular. The wines were outrageous. Topped off the three hour meal with a moist warm butter cake--big enough for three of us. Overall an incredibly satisfying experience. Hope to give five stars next time.
