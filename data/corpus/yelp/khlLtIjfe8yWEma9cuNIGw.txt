How often have you been downtown and craving frozen hibiscus tea?  I know, a LOT, right?  Happens to me all the time!  Thank heavens for the $1.50 paletas (which the store also calls "Ice-Pops").  One of these days I'd love to try their $4.75 batidos, but I'll have to wait until the paychecks are coming in regularly.  I might -- mind you, I said might -- try the cachitos con huevo y queso, which promises to be worth $2 as a replacement for drive-through egg-and-cheese sandwiches.  This morning around 11, they were out of eggs.
