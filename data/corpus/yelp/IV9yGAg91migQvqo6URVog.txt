Ok, so in the past 6 months pizza specifically Italian style pizza, has become a big part of my life. Nothing makes my boy happier than eating pizza, he even wants to start a pizza club where we go and try new spots and rate them. Anyways, on Sunday I suggested going to this spot. It's not a bad drive, but not very central either. When we arrive the aromas are great, and we have high hopes. The menu looks nice, however, the appetizers are not translated, so you don't really know what to order, unless you are familiar with these dishes. Our waiter can't wait to get off work, he takes our order and leaves before we can even finish asking him questions. Not good. Then we get our first course, which is very good and super fresh. Later we get our pizzas. First of all, since the waiter didn't really listen he got the order wrong. Second, the mushrooms were out of a can. Not good at all... So, what can I say, this place is ok, not great. I suggest that if you are going to work somewhere you take the time to listen to the customers request. Also, fresh mushrooms are not that expensive, especially if they are a big part of the menu...
