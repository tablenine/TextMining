wow.  The food is fabulous.  Don't go unless you are really hungry, you have to eat when you go here.  It is pretty pricey, but you can definately get your money's worth.  . . You get a little chip when you go here, red on one side and green on the other.  Each time you want more meat then you just flip it over to green, and when you are taking a minute to rest from scarfing all that meat down then you flip it to red.  . . If you are on the adkins diet, this is your heaven.  If you are a vegetarian or vegan--skip it.
