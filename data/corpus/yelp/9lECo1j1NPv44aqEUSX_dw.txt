Restaurant: 90 Miles Cuban Café
Category: Cuban
Alright, 90 Miles, I'm ready to add that fourth star.    I *did* get my cubano this time and it was great.  Plus, my boyfriend absolutely LOVED the sandwich, and when the boyfriend gets geeked out over food, I get happy.  Yucca frita with the garlic oil was also delish, even though I'm still tasting it!  Empanada was still good, and so were the papas fritas.  I think after this last visit, we will become more regular customers.  Good work, 90 Miles.  Four stars for you!
