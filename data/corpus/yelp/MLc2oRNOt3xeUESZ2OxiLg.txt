I came here after dinner for some dessert and coffee.. . It is nearly impossible to find street parking so if you don't see an open spot while driving here just valet.  The valet charges $3.50.  I love it when valet service charge has cents attached.  They will never give your change and most people won't ask for the change so they make an extra 50 cents but they also get no tip from me.. . I just had regular coffee and a slice of banana something pie.  The coffee was good, better than Starbucks.  The banana something pie was really good but I like banana anything pie.. . You order and pick up everything at the counter.  I just wished they would have let us know when the food came out.  We stepped away from the counter to not get in the way of other customers but no one let us know our order was ready.  This is what we get for trying to be polite.. . The outside patio is very nice.  Even on a cold evening, the outdoor heaters keep the place nice and warm. Some spots are stuffed with way too many tables &amp; chairs.   It can be a little too much during busy hours.. . It is located across the Church of Scientology center.  You might encounter weirdos.
