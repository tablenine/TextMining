I wanted to try this place for a long time since I saw it on Yelp. We got there Wednesday 8PM, and drove around the block for 5 minutes looking for parking. We had to sign our names on the waiting list by the door, and the wait was about 10 minutes, not bad. We sat inside in that crowded dining area instead of sidwalk because we took first table available. . . We ordered 2 Hainan Chicken, a Baked seafood casserole and 2 iced tea. The food came out very quick. Hainan chicken was very good. The first bite of the chicken amazed me, it was so tender and soft, not mushy, light and simple but full of flavor, nicely sliced in perfect size and deboned, the rice was also flavored to give you a perfect balance between the two. I swear this chicken was so good that there is no way this is the same chicken we buy from the store. I am guessing cage-free chicken.. . Well, now the seafood casserole. I got only one thing to say. "Don't even bother." If I am going back here again, I won't waste my time and money on anything but Hainan Chicken.. . By the way, the service was excellent, not like most busy places that they couldn't care less about you. The waitress even gives you lids and refill for your iced tea so you can take them with you.
