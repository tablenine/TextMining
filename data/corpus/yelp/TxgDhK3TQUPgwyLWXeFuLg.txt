I honestly don't understand what everyone was raving about.  Came in on a Tuesday night and sat at the bar.  The bartenders are extremely friendly and attentive.  I took the advice of fellow yelpers and we ordered: the Squash blossoms, tomato &amp; burrata and fennel sausage, panna, red onion &amp; scallions pizza.  For antipasta, we ordered baby peppers with tuna .  The antipasta was DELICIOUS.  No complaints there.  Then the pizzas came.  Because of the burrata, the squash pizza tasted cold.  Lacking much flavor, I felt like I was eating a piece of cold soggy bread with cheese.  The crust was decent though.  Then, the sausage pizza arrived.  Disappointed with the first pizza, my friend and I had high hopes for the second one...and we were disappointed again.  After smashing the sausages as our bartender suggested, our pizza did not improve.  This one too, was lacking flavor.  At the end, we piled on the crushed peppers and ate what we could (we didnt finish the pizzas).  I know everyone suggested the desserts at this place, but my friend and I could not handle another disappointment.  Right then and there, we decided to cut our losses and call it a night.  I will not be coming back here again.
