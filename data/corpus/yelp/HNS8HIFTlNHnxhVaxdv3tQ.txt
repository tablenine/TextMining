I know I should talk about the pizza first, but I've got to talk about dessert.. . Butterscotch Budino, you're beautiful. Those luscious spoonfuls of creamy, salty and sweet. It never gets old, that tantalizing combination. . . OK, back to the pizza. Solid. Margherita is my go-to, I love a simple pie. Perfectly charred with a crispy crackly crust that shatters in your mouth with each bite. Dang. They were a bit slow with bringing out my pie since I asked for a well-done crust so they brought out a complimentary little dish of eggplant tapenade that was rather tasty, and very nice. . . The chopped salad packed a lot of tang &amp; saltiness (sodium-phobes need not apply). Something else that hasn't gotten old for me is prosciutto di Parma. Those paper-thin slices of salty cured meat with the texture of velvet, sigh. The platter was a generous serving for $12, great for sharing.. . Service was excellent. But for some reason, I enjoyed the pies we got from Mozza-2-Go better. I want to come back to try the Sunday Lasagna dinners, since we heard from a chef friend that it was a must-try!
