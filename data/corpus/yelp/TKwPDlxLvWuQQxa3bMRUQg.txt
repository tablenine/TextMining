Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
True Story:  So I order the smothered chicken because if you are already eating fried chicken with waffles, butter, syrup, with a Sunset, you might as well pour gravy over said chicken and enjoy.  . . Well, under that delicious, yet thick gravy it seems 2 out of 4 pieces of chicken didn't fit the breast/wing/leg/thigh paradigm.  I felt so swindled that they snuck in their mystery pieces under that gravy that I have held a grudge.  . . It is fine because now that I only order un-smothered chicken I realize the chicken is average at best.  There lots of places to get great fried chicken.  OTOH the waffles are off the meter.  So are the biscuits.  I even like the t#5 omelet.  . . So I hate to be a hater but Roscoe's is for out of towners and studio gangstas.  Luckily, I am friends with (or did I used to be?) both so I hit it up every few months or so because it is fun to tell people that haven't been that you had chicken and waffles yesterday afternoon.
