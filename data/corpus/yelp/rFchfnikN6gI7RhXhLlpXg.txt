Restaurant: Ok Cafe
Category: Diners
Whenever I see the name of this place, I can't help but wonder if there's a Mediocre Cafe or Average Cafe somewhere in the world. But I digress.... . OK Cafe is definitely not average or mediocre, or even simply OK. It's much better. The menu has lots of diner staples with a Southern twist. Give the sweet potato chips with Maytag blue cheese a try if you're there for lunch. I could eat those things every day of the week until my heart explodes.... . Also, make sure you save room for dessert. They have some awesome pies to choose from. Mmmmmm, pie.
