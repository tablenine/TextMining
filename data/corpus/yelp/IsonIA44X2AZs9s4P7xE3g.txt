The food is good, service is fantastic, and the prices are great. Its a great feel, like a Japanese dive bar if that makes sense. There's such a wide range of customers, especially late night! The napkins drawing are a nice touch. But back to the food, I've never had a bad meal here. Flavors tend to be on the light side, but I like it that way.
