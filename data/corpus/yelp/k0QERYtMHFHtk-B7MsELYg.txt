Did not leave the restaurant happy!. . My reasons:. . One. They took forever to seat us even though we made reservations in advance. When we asked what was the hold up, they said they were setting up the tables...the restaurant was practically empty!!. . Two. The food was just so-so for the price. Nothing to write home about...N-O-T-H-I-N-G!!. . Three. They stole MY birthday cake!! They said they served the entire cake to us, but there were only 8 of us. No way could that have been my entire cake because the slices weren't that big! Plus they charged us a cake fee.. . I don't think I would've given them only 2 star if it wasn't for the cake incident. At the most 3 for the less than mediocre food and nice atmosphere.
