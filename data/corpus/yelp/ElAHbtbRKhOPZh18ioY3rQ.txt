I tried this restaurant after reading the reviews here on yelp.  I was not disappointed.  The ambiance is lovely.  It is very romantic.  We went on a Sunday night, and it wasn't very crowded, just enough people to make it cozy but not overly loud.  We ordered crab cakes for appetizer (very good) and the filet mignon, the ahi tuna, and the scallop for the entree (all delicious and perfectly cooked).  After the dessert and a glass of wine, the bill came out to be around $200 including tax and tip.  The service was good, but nothing spectacular.  All in all, I really enjoyed my dinner here and would recommend this place for a romantic dinner.  Valet parking was $7.50.  We tried to look for street parking, but couldn't find one.
