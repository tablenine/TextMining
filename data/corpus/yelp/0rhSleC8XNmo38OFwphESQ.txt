Love their Expresso Chocolate Panna Cotta.  It's a must try.  I could care less for everything else on the menu.  I'm not a coffee nut (and seroiusly don't want to be), so I'm not quite qualified to rate this place.. However, I do love that expresso dessert so much that I'm compelled to write about it.  Seriously, go try it.  If you don't like it, well, you can spit on them.
