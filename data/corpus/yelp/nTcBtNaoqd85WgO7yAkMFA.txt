We were actually at Indian waiting for a table... there was a Lakers game on and about 20 people (and I'm not even exaggerating) ahead of us on the list.  Plus, it was already 8pm and there was no way we'd get a seat before 10pm.  We had already waited 1/2 hour and in that time, only one name was called.  Ridiculous.  There is no food good enough to wait like that.. . So we headed over to Sinbala, which is only like a 5 minute drive away from Indian.  There was a slight wait, but definitely not as crazy as Indian.. . The waiter gave us a menu and took our orders as our table was being cleared us inside, and the second we sat down, our food arrived.. . We ordered:. Mi Fun Tang (rice noodle soup). Chicken Soup. You Fan (oiled rice). Duck with Vermicelli. Udon Noodle soup. Crispy Chicken. Oyster Pancake. . Everything was really, really, really good.  And authentic, which is most important.. . They ran out of rou zhong and fried fishcakes though; we were really disappointed with that.. . Our bill came out to about $40; definitely really cheap for 4 people's worth of food.. . We would definitely come back here again!
