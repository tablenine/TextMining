Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
We were driving around looking for Scoops Ice Cream - couldn't find it due to wrong directions and inadvertently bumped into Pink's Hot Dogs.  I remember seeing this on the Food Network and got all excited.. . There was a long line around the stand and we lined up thinking that it would take 20 minutes or so until we got to order.  Wrong....we waited 45 minutes....thank goodness we were able to peruse the menu during our wait. I knew that I was going to eat Pinkberry (we passed by it on our way to Pink's) and fried chicken later on that night so I had to pace myself.. . I decided on a regular hot dog with onions, tomatoes and relish. I know it's a bit on the boring side but I couldn't take anything heavier than that. Hot dog was good - it had the snap when I bit into it and the bun was soft - steamed just right.  . . Christopher had Planet Hollywood - spicy Polish dog with onions, mushrooms, cheese and bacon. I love big strips of crispy, fatty goodness. I think Elin had the chili cheese dog with bacon and that also looked soooo good!   Their fries were delicious - crispy, light and seasoning that reminded me of curly fries. . . I'll definitely be back for the chilli cheese dog as ONE meal, not part one of a three part gorgefest.
