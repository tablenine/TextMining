Jane K mentioned the Kogi truck to me....and I was like WTH is a Kogi Truck?  She proceeds to tell me they can be found on twitter.  I'm like what the heck is twitter?  (I guess it's a site where you can find out where they will be located...www.twitter.com ) Then she tells me its really good and that she would drives miles to eat their stuff.  Light bulb goes off....note to self:  Gotta try this place.. . Then about a week later I find out that I'll be in LA and that the group was planning to go to the Kogi Truck.  I'm like Score!  . . It's around midnight...and we're getting a little hungry..so we roll out to find the Kogi truck.  A few miles down we find it...we find parking and walk up to a small crowd swarming around the truck.. . I've been to taco trucks before but ... this is no ordinary taco truck...this is the Kogi BBQ Taco Truck.  The menu items are unique...so there was 4 of us, so we just got a couple of the beef tacos, pork tacos, kimchi quesadilla (yes KIMCHI!)...and even a hot dog.  Add some sriracha...and you're good to go!   BTW!!!!  that was my first taste of sriracha...and it was pretty good.  (i don't know where i've been! LOL).  . . I liked all of them...hot dog was good, tacos were good, quesadilla was good too!  and i'm not even a kimchi fan!  . . This was pretty good...it can be a little pricey for a taco truck but hey you get what you pay for in this city.
