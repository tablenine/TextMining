Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
I really wanted to try this place.  So, I brought my cousin here for her birthday.  The decor is nice, but more Asian than Hawaiian.  Our server was nice, and service overall from the host to busboy was decent.  It really was the food that didn't quite do it for us.  The restaurant week $32 menu was extended for one more week, so we ordered 1 prix-fix meal from there and then one more $35 prix-fix meal from their winter menu to share.  We figured this way we would get to try more things.  . . From the restaurant week menu:. Starter:  Sampler (1 pcs. tempura shrimp, 1 pcs. glazed rib, 1 pcs. spicy tuna sushi) all were way too salty.. Entree:  Mahi Mahi w/fried rice was just okay with a little bit of spice, not that interesting. Dessert:  Kona Creme Brulee, sounds a lot better than it tasted.  The sugar layer was too thick and hard.  It was also a little too burnt making it overly bitter.. . Winter menu:. Starter:  Vietnamese Lumpia &amp; Bibb Lettuce Wrap, was decent. Entree:  Tender Braised Beef Short Ribs, very tender, good but nothing spectacular.. Dessert:  Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé, this was way too sweet, so sweet that we each took one bite and left it alone.. . The food portions were good, and value was there.  The presentation was nice too, but too bad they didn't taste as good as they looked.. . I really wanted to like this place because I have been craving Mama's Fish House in Maui for a long time now, and I was hoping this would scratch the itch.  Unfortunately, I am left disappointed.
