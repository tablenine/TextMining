Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Ken D, were we sitting next to you last night at Tank?. . What a rotten worthless experience. I will never go to Tank again. After we waited TWO HOURS for our sushi, we complained to the almost shockingly rude manager who offered a very snotty, "I'm sorry, but it's New Year's Eve." by way of apology. Really? I hadn't noticed. . . Our waitress never checked on us, never asked if we wanted additional drinks after our first round (let alone additional appetizers siince our meal wasn't coming out, and our belated sushi appeared as skimpy little rolls that tasted every bit as good as Dominicks' finest?. . Tank, you and your staff suck.
