Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
I know some other Yelpers have said the customer service (especially table service) is less than stellar. . . My experience has been that the cashiers have always been more than pleasant and helpful. I personally don't expect table service, the same way I would from a restaurant that seats you, then has a server take and bring your order. It's like McDonald's - your order, get a number, you find a place to sit... why would I think they'd give me full table service???. . Service (or lack thereof) aside, I really do love Joan's. YES, it's a bit pricey... I have a problem paying $12 for a sandwich that doesn't even come with a hint of a side. I guess those pickles are supposed to make due.. . I LOVE the cupcakes. The vanilla cupcake is one of the best I've had - perfectly dense with the right amount of crumb. However, sometimes you get a less-than-moist one which sucks. The raspberry cupcakes is less than awesome and I wouldn't even bother. . . I agree, it IS a bit overpriced (like the ridic price for OATMEAL and YOGURT)... but WORST part are the freaking sodas. $1.50 for a can of Diet Coke. You devils, you. Â I usually give places benefit of the doubt for somewhat higher prices like this (maybe the ingredients cost more) but at $1.50 for a can of Coke, there's some serious inflation there... which leads me to think, what other prices are they padding here?. . I still think the food (aside from the price) is tasty, fresh and definitely perfect for a lunch or afternoon picnic. It's just very "LA" and something I've grown to accept.
