Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
Cocktails are a great way to start a meal and The Hungry Cat has a few good ones.  Fresh pressed citrus (the press is mounted to the bar for all to see) goes a long way in making any cocktail good.  The space is modern and chic, but casual and a bit noisy.  The Hungry Cat has a focus on seafood, but the pug burger and a few other options kept my seafood-averse companions at the table.  The food is fine (although my sea bass was undercooked and slimy toward the middle) and the service is businesslike.
