I don't get it.  I went based on the stellar reviews and I was less than impressed.. . I had the red velvet pancakes, which was really like having cake for breakfast.  Imagine pouring maple syrup on a piece of cake.  I also had the pepper parmesan grits, which was lacking in both pepper and parmesan.  The coffee was not "literally perfect" as one reviewer wrote...it was just plain old diner coffee.. . Renea had the vegetarian biscuits and gravy with soysage.  I sampled the biscuit and I have to say, the gravy had a nice tang to it.  We couldn't figure out what the flavor was...tarragon, maybe.  Anyway, it was good.  She tells me the soysage was good.  I require that my breakfast meat contain meat, so I didn't try it.. . Service was good enough and the atmosphere was pleasant.  I don't remember what we spent...less than $10 each, I believe  In all, I wouldn't not go back, but there are plenty of better alternatives in the price range.
