Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Had brunch here on Sunday, 2/22.  There was about a 20 minute wait at 1:30pm, which was a bit surprising, but the restaurant itself is not too big. My friend and I ordered two dishes-- the French toast with bananas, and then the Southwest scramble.  Both dishes were OK-- nothing was too impressive, and I probably won't come back here again.  Fresh squeezed OJ was just fine.  Service was a bit on the slow side, which gives this place a mediocre 3 stars.  I would recommend somewhere else for brunch, as you could get this brunch food anywhere.. . Valet parking is $5 dollars on the side of the restaurant.. . I still think BLD is my favorite place for brunch so far in LA... but the search continues!
