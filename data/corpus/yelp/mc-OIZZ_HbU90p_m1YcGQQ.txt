This place is  for the nouveau riche... Plainly and simply the most pretentious excuse for dining I've ever experienced.  I'm not quite sure what all the raving over this place is about... is it a status thing, to say that you've dined there?  The only thing I really enjoyed about the experience was the service and the atmosphere.  Yes, the preparation and presentation of the dishes are creative and unique, but I'm still missing something, something I really don't care all that much to get.
