The Loves: . . Fried lentils - Tangy, sweet, crunchy. Yum.. . Socca cakes with honey and goat cheese - Delish!. . Skirt steak cooked medium - Perfect shade of red, crispy around the edges. Great texture and flavour. . Sweet potato fries - Addicting to munch on, but wouldn't recommend to have before you really dig in because they're so filling. . Churros - They're actually really good but I think it tastes better w/o the chocoloate sauce . . Risotta - I forgot what kind it was but it was very flavourful and not too heavy .  Â . The Eh's: . . My only complaint is the seating. I wish there was some breathing room between your arm and the next person's arm. The situation can be a real butt adjuster if you're sitting along the wall.
