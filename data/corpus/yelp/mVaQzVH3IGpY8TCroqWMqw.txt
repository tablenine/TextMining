I wonder (after reading the captain m's review) if the Bad First Date Handbook suggests Barney's Beanery as a great place to really dazzle the girl in question?. . I too had, by far, one of the worst blind(if only a had been blind) dates ever at the BB. Long story short, he was obsessed with pirates, wore light blue tapered jeans ( in 2005 mind you, does this man have no friends to show him the error of his fashion ways), had a dog named Wondermutt and wanted to get an arch nemesis for her and name it Dr. Dogglesworth. Oh and even the best therapy around won't let me forget the closer of the "date" when he slipped me the oh so undesireable tongue at the valet stand (In front of my favorite comedian Lewis Black, grrrrr) when i wasn't expecting it. So Klassy! *as she reaches for the mouth wash again*. . As for the place itself, the drinks are good(as in very strong) and if you don't mind sticking to the floor, your seat and the bar itself, then it's a wonderful place. It may just be a great idea for Mother's Day...that's if your mom is either a frat guy or a Harley biker babe, but hey who am I to judge, it's your mom. It's also good for drunken nights and unsober taste buds, but beyond that, I give it a big ole "meh". . You'd be better off just heading over to the Rainbow on Sunset instead. They at least have rocker dudes who still think zebra spandex is cool and the cheese cubes there are yumtastic! . . Plus, can anyone ever really get enough "Pour Some Sugar On ME"? (Don't answer that, haha)
