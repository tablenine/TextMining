WOW...  I dunno what the point of writing a review is since there are already 170+ reviews, but I'm going to do it anyway!  I kept hearing good things about this place - esp from my friend Cindy D.. . I LOVED it here!. . Parking - easy metered street parking.  Seemed plentiful.. . Ambiance - beautiful.  I'm not sure why they choose to put brown butcher paper over their nice white tablecloths...I think that takes away from the "nice" restaurant feel, but I guess it's easier to clean and maintain.  :P  It would be nicer if they got rid of it.  They have a lot of nice outdoor seating as well (no dogs allowed in the outdoor seating area.). . Service:  Great!. . Food - delicious!  Everything we ordered was awesome.  . Appetizers:  Like everyone says, the truffled parmesan fries are delicious - YUM!!!  The Kahlua Potstickers were also good - very meaty.  . (complimentary) Amuse Bouche (sp?):  yum - also loved it!  When we went, it was a bit of gazpacho.  . Entrees:  We ordered scallops, the wagyu steak, tuna, salmon, and pork chops.  All awesome.  I don't even like seafood - and I always try it whenever we're out and I still don't like it - but I LOVED the Tuna!  I was in shock that I liked seafood!  Amazing.  . Dessert:  Awesome sorbet flight and chocolate molten cake.  Plus, since it was my birthday, they also gave a complimentary dish with 3 orange chocolate truffles!  Very nice of them.  :). . Moola - entrees are around $25-$35...  so I'd say about $40-$50 per person.  Definitely worth it!. . I will be back again!  This is definitely up there as one of my new fave restaurants!  :)
