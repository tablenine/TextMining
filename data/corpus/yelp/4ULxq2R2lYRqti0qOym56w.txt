Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
One of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles, Katsu-Ya combines friendly, fast service with incredible japanese fare that far surpasses any other location I have tried in the area.  From traditional favorites to creative new concepts, Katsu-Ya offers something for everyone, from the sushi connoisseur to the cautious newcomer.  Just make sure to make a reservation since there is always a crowd, but with a reservation I have never had to wait for a table - but even if I had to, the food is good enough to warrant it.  An excellent dining experience every time!
