Summary:. --good for solo dining. --much better quality than the local alternatives . --not cheap. --valet parking. --reservation through . http://www.opentable.com. . . I've generally been coming here for dinner one evening when traveling through the area on business. Â It's fine for solo dining and the staff seems to go out of their way to put you in a place in the dining room where you'll be comfortable with enough light to read a book, say.. . If there's a tasting menu offered with wine pairings, that would be my choice.
