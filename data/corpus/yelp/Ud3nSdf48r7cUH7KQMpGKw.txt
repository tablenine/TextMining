Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
Had dinner last night out at one of the street tables.  The standard De Cero margarita was tasty, so much so I was ordering #2 before I new it.  The mango-habanero guacamole that was on special was great; spicy... sweet.... avocado-ey (is that a word?)  . . My wife got several different tacos that she was kind enough to share with me; all were tasty and had their own different twists.  I think though if I have the choice, give me the standard pastor or cecina tacos from a hole in the wall tacoquira.  I had the carne asada.  the steak was cooked well and the rice and beans were yummy.  I could have gone without the bacon in the pintos - I'm sure that sounds like sacrilege but seriously; sometimes I really don't need bacon in everything.. . Overall a good experience; will definitely be back!
