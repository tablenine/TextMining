Rooftop deck and many beers on tap, but the food and service not so hot.  . . Raw oysters are a decent deal at under $10 for a fresh dozen.  The best stuff I had here was the taco combo with one each of catfish, shrimp, and calamari, quite tasty although now I live close to Buford Highway three tacos for $11 seems like robbery.  Seafood stew comes in a gigantic bowl, contains generous amount of cod but less shellfish.  The broth narrowly escapes being bad enough to piss me off...the flavors are not infused or balanced, the large amount of tomatoes chunky and not cooked through, in sum a flat and very spicy broth that barely tastes better than Cambells canned soup.  Boiled shrimp platter was ordered by my hapless friend, oh my for $20 you get what seems to me like an inadequate amount of paltry and mostly spicy but not tasty shrimp, a bit of sausages (not bad), and some boiled potatoes nobody wants to eat.  Did you know you can spend $5 more and gorge yourself on great seafood all you want at Nori Nori?  Sides again are mostly spicy and mediocre, though the hush puppies stand out as being especially bad.  . . I've never been here during the day, but I imagine the view probably isn't better or worse than at night, and I was not exactly impressed by the night view which I would describe as underwhelming.  Service wise, I thought the servers try hard, but overall not very professional and I had to wait forever to get a menu and then forever for beers to arrive, not cool.  . . Never been to the cemetery location.  At this point, probably won't try.
