Category: Pizza
Tasty white garlic, olive oil and mozzarella pizza- thin crust that's not too thin, chewy &amp; crispy in the right places, sweet chopped fresh garlic, just the right amount of cheese and not burnt (you'd be surprised how many pizza places screw this up and burn the cheese). Â And this place is a block from home...good enough for me.
