I am a lunch customer who doesn't get to Fat Matt's as often as he would like.  I typically order a pulled pork sandwich with sauce on it, with a side of baked beans and potato chips and a coke.  Brunswick stew is also a good choice.  Sauce is slightly vinegary, which I like.  They also catered a Memorial Day supper for us once when we had guests over for supper tastily and affordably (though I had to pick up).. . The space is tight, and  there is usually a line out the door on busy days.. Counter service is a little brusque, or to look at it different, "efficient."  Outdoor seating is fun on a nice day.
