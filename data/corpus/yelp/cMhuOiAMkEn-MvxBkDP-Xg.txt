Decent. Went here for a business dinner after a second day of day-long meetings. I don't think anyone was in the mood for another starched-shirt restaurant, and this fit the bill nicely. Everyone at the dinner had nothing but positives to report about the food and overall dining experience. The efficiency and reasonable prices were much appreciated, as was the guidance through the menu and wine list, both of which offered something for everyone, even the vegetarians and 'particular' eaters in our party.
