I'm not a small dude. When I'm not hungry, I can eat a 2-month-old. When starving, sheep and poultry line up to battle for who will be eaten by me. . . If you have an appetight and not appewide (i know, lame!), you may eat at Furaibo.. . Hence, here comes a summary of Furaibo and its missing stars:. . One star was fired because 75% of cars in the backlot are double-parked behind each other. Inconvenient!. One star was stolen by Roman Polanski due to the small, cute food portions and unattentive staff.. One star shot itself because Furaibo is vegetarian-unfriendly.. . Two stars stayed because Furaibo's cheap and because if you are a little person who is friends with little people who like bland small dishes (excluding the eggplant = all two pieced of it = amazing).. FIN.
