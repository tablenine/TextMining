Restaurant: Holy Taco
Category: Mexican
There are a lot of things to like about Holy Taco--the Ecuadorian salsa, the organic margaritas, the tongue taco (insanely tender and flavorful), and the laid back vibe.  However, the beers are a bit overpriced, and the chips are consistently greasy.  Service is inconsistent and ranges from courteous and attentive to downright invisible.  When I'm craving Tex-Mex, Holy Taco is a good nearby option, but there's always room for improvement.
