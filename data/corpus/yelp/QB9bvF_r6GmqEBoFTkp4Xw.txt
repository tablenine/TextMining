I was expecting Fat Cat to have more of a swanky, lounge-y atmosphere.  While the logo's font may be retro, the interior just feels like any other bar, and isn't particularly comfortable or inviting.  The multiple TVs don't help.. . Menu: I wasn't in the mood for a burger when I was there, so my options were somewhat limited by the Fat Cat's relatively small menu.  Fortunately, they have Abita Amber on tap, so my taste buds were happy even though my turkey sandwich (with apple slices...?) was a little bit... meh.. . Service: Just OK.  When I first walked in, I wasn't sure if I should order at the bar or have a seat at a table.  When I finally sat down, it took over five minutes to be acknowledged by one of the servers.  Once our server finally came over, though, she was attentive.. . It's easy to get to the Fat Cat from the Red Line, and you could certainly do worse.  But I can't say that it's worth a trip out of your way.
