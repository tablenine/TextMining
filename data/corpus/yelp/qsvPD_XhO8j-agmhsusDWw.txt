This place was down right DELICIOUS. My boyfriend and I ventured here on a Saturday afternoon (around 3ish) and had absolutely no wait, we were seated right away.. . We of course ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings, Chicken Dumplings, and the Chicken Fried Rice.. . The service was pretty quick, we did feel sort of rushed, but they were very polite. We stayed even after we had paid and were finishing up and talking and they didnt kick us out or anything. . . The rice is the most tasty fried rice i've ever eaten, EVER. It was moist and flavorful, not salty or crusty. . . The juicy pork dumplings were magic in my mouth. Of course they come out hot, so just be sure to blow on them a little before you pop them in your mouth. Again, it wasnt salty or off-putting at all, it was very mild and flavorful.. . Our bill came to $22 for the 3 dishes, which isnt bad. We'll DEFINITELY be returning.
