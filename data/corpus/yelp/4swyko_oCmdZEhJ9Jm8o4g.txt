Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Joan's needs to be on Curb Appeal! I completely passed over this place for breakfast because it just didn't seem special. I decided to pop in to confirm my initial judgement and I was completely wrong! So clean and spot on inside! Gorgeous pastry display. They did a good job with the small amount of space they have and just have a nice and cozy space.  Tried about 6 different pastries and everything was excellent!  Great place to grab breakfast or lunch or food to take home. . Good job!
