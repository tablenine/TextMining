ok ok ok... i love brunch and this place is the BESTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT. . . Walked up there and there were lots of ppl waiting.. which is a good and bad thing. Good that a lot of people like to eat there but bad that there will be a wait. Went on a Sunday around 1230pm. Waited about 30 minutes to sit down.. . We were looking at the menu while waiting so the we immediately ordered once we sat down. We both got fresh squeezed apple juice and it came in a decent sized cup. Not too shabby but Not the Best either.  . . I ordered the GOURMET BENEDICT.. omgah...... it had salmon on a normal benedict and it was DELICIOUS. I would strictly come back here for this. Best Eggs Benedict that I've ever had. (even beats Griddle's benedict). The salmon added the best flavor to the meal. I got a side of potatoes which topped it all off.. . A great menu too. I would def come here again to try out the menu. . . Service kinda stank, needs more service. But got little mini cookies for dessert for free. eh...
