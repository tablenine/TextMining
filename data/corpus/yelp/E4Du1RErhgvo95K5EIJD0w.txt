Restaurant: Taqueria Del Sol - Decatur
Category: Tex-Mex
Taqueria del Sol utilizes the assembly line mechanics that make venues like In-and-Out  (or Bodo's in C'ville!) able to deal with long lines with alacrity.  With a limited menu selection, there're only certain raw materials needed on a day to day basis, and given the massive number of customers, they're able to clear inventory on a frequent basis, ensuring rather fresh food at all times.  Great model.  You just have to make sure you've got a sufficient customer base.. . Authentic?  Probably not.  But like certain forms of fusion food (American-ish Italian, Japanese-ish Chinese food, etc), it can still be delightful.  And it is.  Tasty, inexpensive and quick... grab a beer and have a great conversation.. . There's very little to complain about aside from occasionally brusque behaviour.... . Of the 3 locations, I prefer Taqueria on Cheshire Bridge Rd.  Decatur is my runner up.  ;). . It is however, right next to me...
