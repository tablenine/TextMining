heart attack central!!! and boy is it worth it, hahaha. as a los angeles native, well, valley girl, you'd expect me to have been to this wonderfulicious establishment many a many times. but no, just once actually. i know, it's blasphemy!. . anyways, my friend learns that i've never been there, so she takes me one summer day. luckily the line was only a 15 minute wait. i guess that was the reason why i never went. when i'm hungry, and i get hungry like a mofo, i don't want to wait in a line for an hour plus for a hot dog, and the smell of others' food, that just makes it worse.. . well, i order the rosie special with onions, chili, sauerkraut and mustard. it was delish!!! i mean, you really can't go wrong with chili on a dog, and the other toppings were like a cherry on top of ice cream. it only makes it better. and i of course get some fries to go with this. and i dipped those fries in the chili, which made them better.. . i guess my only complaints about this place is parking and the lines, but i lucked out on the latter. that's why it gets 3 instead of 4 stars. but i guess one can argue that it's all a part of the experience too. my suggestion: try it once at least, then go from there. fair warning: stomachs may not feel in the best shape after a couple of hours or so, hahaha.
