Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
The only reason it gets a star is because of the Magic and the whole fabulousness of the Castle itself. If I was going off just the food I wouldn't give it any. You could get better food at a Chili's and you don't have to pay a cover charge to eat there. If you go, only go for the Magic and drinks. DO NOT go for the food. It was not worth it. I went there last year and the food was much better. Don't know why they decided to change the menu. Our server was sloppy and the whole restaurant section seemed to be a little messy and unorganized. Was not impressed. My suggestion is to go to Yamashiro first and then go to the castle for the show. Yamashiro is just up the hill and the food and atmosphere is much better. I mean you have to dress formal to even get in there and yet they serve you food meant for Chili's or TGIFridays. Yuck.
