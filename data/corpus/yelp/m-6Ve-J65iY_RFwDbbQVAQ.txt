The best Osso Bucco I've had in LA!!  But I did have a very strange creepy waiter who did/said things that made me go 'huh'??  I hope he doesn't wait on my table ever again coz judging from the other reviews the service should be tip-top phenomenal!  Definitely sit in the garden patio... the back room is supposed to be romantic with the fireplace but the chairs in that room are super rickety and the decor is too old school for me.
