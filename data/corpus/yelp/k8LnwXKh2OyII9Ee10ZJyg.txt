Make sure whichever location you visit you get the Cinnamon rolls. . . If driving down Belmont look south for the sign in an alley midway down the block, there's parking in the rear. Once you pay for your meal, get your ticket stamped for parking verification.. Even if you call ahead, you MUST have your entire party there to be seated.  There isn't a real waiting area, so, the whole front area gets crowded as hell, which is the most disorganized BS.  When its raining or snowing, its the pits.. Breakfast is great, no idea what lunch or dinner menu items are like.
