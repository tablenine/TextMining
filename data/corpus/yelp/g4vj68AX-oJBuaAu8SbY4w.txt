This hit the spot!  I've been wanting to go vegan, but have been too busy to make the switch.  . . There was more gristle, cartilage, knuckle meat and bone in my burrito than chicken meat!  Awesome for people trying to stop eating meat.  The Chef spread the refried beans on with his bare hands.  I gargled with hydrogen peroxide for an hour when I got home, but still feel like I probably have toilet AIDS mouth, from Flash Taco!  . . Thanksdudes!  I took away one star, because this is the worse poop smeared grub on the planet.
