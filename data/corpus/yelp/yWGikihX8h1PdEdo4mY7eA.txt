I had ordered the lunch special "falafel pita" for lunch.  I was not sure why others got their food before me when they ordered the SAME thing after me, but anyways..... . The pita was bland and looked/tasted undercooked.  The falafel was yummy and served with tzakiki sauce and pickles, lettuce and tomato.  It was yummy, but VERY messy and required a fork.  . . I was so happy to see that they had ample parking at this location because the one in the highlands has such limited parking.  I also like the layout of the store better.  . . The dessert looked yummy too, but I did not want to spend a lot on lunch.  . . Would I go back, yes!
