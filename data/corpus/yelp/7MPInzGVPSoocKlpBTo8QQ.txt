Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
This place is great if you want to get lit up and eat good quality, low price tacos.. . the good. outdoor seating and they don't care if you drink your face off all day.. fast and friendly service. . great tacos with an outstanding self-serve salsa bar.. . the bad. terrible decor. outside not much prettier. terrible cheap furniture.. the guy that's always running the place might make you wait for long periods of time in line as he talks to all the girls in front of you. I don't know if the ladies are enjoying this but I'm not.
