I was very impressed with this place.  We went at about 7pm on a bright and sunny Friday.  We had later reservations but got there a bit early and had no problem getting a seat.  It's a small restaurant, but I'm guessing it gets very crowded later.. . There's an $8 corkage fee, which is a little steep.  The food is all extremely tasty.  For three people, we ordered 5 things: the caper and tomato risotto (delicious and creamy), the asparagus with a balsamic glaze and cheese, the burrata in a jar (amazing!!  rich and creamy and so tasty with the olive oil brushed grilled bread), the fried chicken with potato salad (crispy and well cooked, but watch out for the spicy red peppers on top!  the accompanying light potato salad was flavorful, too), and the chickpea cakes with honey and goat cheese (my least favorite, but still tasty).. . I would definitely return here, particularly to try the mussels and the desserts!  Honestly, everything was pretty tasty, and the servings were actually quite large for tapas.  Just watch out when you're ordering: those little plates can add up to big $ pretty quickly!. . Service was friendly, although we got abandoned for about a half hour at the end of our meal - but maybe our waiter thought we were just finishing our wine and didn't want to rush us.
