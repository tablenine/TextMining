Who do you want to have breakfast with? is it your buddy, your parents? or a picture of Tom Waits draped in Mardi Gras beads? only a picture to be sure, but one that reminds you the night before will wear off. .   .   It seems like a lot of people are slamming this place for a lot of reasons.  in my experience (about a year of living around the corner, and drinking a shit-load of coffee) the food was excellent and the service was tip worthy.  I've brought visiting relatives and friends from around the city, all to rave reviews.  It's slammed on the weekends though, which is more a testament to it's quality than a detraction. . .   Moreover, i think the place -which is awesome- is catching a bunch of shit for being in the loop, which, to be sure, is an irksome quality.  But, if I had to be there I'd try be at 11.
