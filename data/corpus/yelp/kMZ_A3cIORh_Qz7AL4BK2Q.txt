A friend of mine was hungry &amp; wanted to try this place. I wasn't hungry at all but decided to go any way. I told myself that I'd buy something &amp; just save it for later. I decided to try thier pastrami sandwich. I have to say that was the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. I wasn't hungry at all but ended up eating all of it. It was that good. I will be back for sure to try out the rest of their menu.
