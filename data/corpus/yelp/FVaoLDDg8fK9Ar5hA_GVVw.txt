Amazing Chinese seafood place. The crab was the highlight, brimming with awesome flavors. Absolutely delightful. The slightly sweet glaze, paired with spicy savory garnish was a treat. The other dishes; Kung pao chicken and ckicken chopsuey were above par as well. Also, the various juices on the menu were refreshing. Especially the jackfruit juice and fresh lime soda. Overall a great place for group lunch/dinner.
