Wait, why is this place always packed?!? That's what I've often wondered driving or walking by on a weekend.  Well folks, it ain't because the food is exceptional or because the drinks are all that great.  And it's definitely not because you get the luxury of paying $7 for some dude to "valet" your car in the lot and drive it a whopping 3 feet away from where you left it.  So, I've concluded it's busy all the time because people don't know any better.  Seriously, that's the only rationale.  For it to be a Mexican restaurant, the margaritas are kinda sucky. The bartenders aren't all that friendly either.  The servers are good, but the food is very underwhelming.  Not gross, but there's better Mexican food to be had in a 5 block radius of this joint.  It's really the epitome of a chain restaurant.  I really haven't the foggiest idea how it's done so well in Chicago.  There's a few dozen just like it or better in any suburb.  But, they do have that nifty tortilla machine...so that's gotta be what's bringing people in.  Ya see, it's the little things.
