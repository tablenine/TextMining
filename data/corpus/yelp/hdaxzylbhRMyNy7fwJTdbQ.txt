the food here is so delicious. fresh, beautiful, well-prepared. and even reasonably priced. the service is really good. . . but GOD DAMN it is so loud in here. the restaurant is essentially nothing but marble. it's stunning to look at and makes for a grand impression upon entering but it also means that every single sound is bouncing all over the place and it's just LOUD. it's like dining in grand central station. . . with that said-- come at an off hour like 4:30 pm when the restaurant is not full and enjoy a really delightful meal.
