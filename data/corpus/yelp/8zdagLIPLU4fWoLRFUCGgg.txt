Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Kopi is a place that is nothing less than nostalgic. it's book and map lined walls give you a sense of a National Geographic research guild with nic nacks for sale lining the back.. The rotation of coffee tends to be pretty static, holding the same flavors for the last couple of years..
