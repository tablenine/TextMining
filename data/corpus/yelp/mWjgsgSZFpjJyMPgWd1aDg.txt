I really had a good experience here. The service was pretty good. I can't speak to the wait, as I went alone and nabbed a seat at the bar. For those complaining that the food isn't anything extraordinary-I knew it would be simple because I checked out the menu before I went. I wanted a simple Belgian waffle and they provided it. For simple, basic breakfast food in a great location (and pretty reasonable price), you should try Yolk.
