Fun spot.  Limited menu but great for a light snack.  The sandwiches are awesome and the fruit cups introduce you to fruits you probably haven't heard of.  The little imploded popcorn seeds are really good, if she recommends you try something, try it - she's a Fruitologist, you have to trust her.  Great spot to take someone that's visiting for Atlanta for a weekend, close to other tourist spots.
