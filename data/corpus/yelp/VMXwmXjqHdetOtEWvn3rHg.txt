Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Let me put it this way, some of the staff members know me at Joan's.. . It's a place I always fall back on especially when I can't think of any other places to eat at. To quote my friend from New York, "Joan's is a better version of a Dean &amp; Deluca". . . I'm a huge fan of the Chinese Chicken Salad. The portion is large and its pretty filling. You also can't go wrong with any of the desserts but some are definitely better than others. The apricot cream hazelnut meringue cake is one of my favorite desserts there so if you like a dessert on the lighter side try this. Â . . It's most crowded during brunch on Saturday and Sunday so its probably best to come after the rush if you want to eat in peace.
