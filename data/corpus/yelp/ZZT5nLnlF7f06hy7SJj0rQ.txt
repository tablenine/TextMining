first of all, DO NOT get the pesto pasta.  it is just a bowl of noodles drenched in oil.  if you want it hot, they just stick in in the microwave and expect it to be good.  my friend ended up ordering the tuna melt which she was given the option to order fries with it or potato chips.  she asked for chips, yet they ended up giving her fries.   instead of sending the food back so they could get rid of the fries and give her chips, she just accepted it.  the fries were disgusting.  there was no potato flavor whatsoever. they tatsted like plain oil.  the tuna melt was not very good either.  all you could really taste was the rye bread which overpowered any flavor of a tuna melt.  when we were done with our meals, we decided to be nice and ask for a doggie bag to save the nice waiter some embarrassment. 5 minutes later, we saw a  homeless woman on the street and gave her our meals.
