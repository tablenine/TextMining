Category: Japanese
I tried this place for the very first time three years ago and have been a fan of their maki since then.  Their prices are very very reasonable (much cheaper than their neighbors - Sushi Wabi, Mirai, Japonais) and the fish is very fresh.. . I order it to go more often than dining in.  In fact, I have probably only dined there twice because it is often packed in like sardines (the BYOB atmosphere makes this an attractive place!). . I love their spicy crunchy tuna roll - they really do make it the best in Chicago.  I also love their godzilla roll, even though I normally don't like cream cheese in my sushi - but it is a fun and inventive roll (well, used to be inventive) and HUGE!. . Presentation is nice but service could use improvement.  This place gets four stars because it is my "go-to" place and enjoy ordering from them!
