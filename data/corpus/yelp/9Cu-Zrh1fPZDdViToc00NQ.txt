What can I say about Porto's that hasn't been said?  Clearly a favorite at both locations, I went for lunch in Glendale.  The line was much less scary than it looked.  I was all over the cuban sandwich, I even went with the swiss cheese instead of requesting a change (I'm a cheese slut, but swiss is no me gusta) and I was veeerryyy happy with it. I had a nice quick lunch and took some potato balls to go, making my husband a happy man.  Someday I'll get around to trying some of the  pastries that look so spectacular.
