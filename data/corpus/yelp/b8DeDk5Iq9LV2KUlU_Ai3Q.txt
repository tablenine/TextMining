Last year (07) for Christmas we went to Spago and I fell in Love with Wolfgang.  So this year for Christmas (08) my DH and I joined our best friends for dinner at CUT to carry on the Wolfgang Holiday tradition.  I have to say the breads and appetizer salads were amazing, I found a love for Voss Sparking water that night and still lust after their mac &amp; cheese.  But the steaks just didn't knock my socks off.  My favorite fine dining meal is a steak, hands down!  But I just didn't taste the quality enough to make me want to go back. I wanted to so badly! I savored every bite...but it just wasn't there.  We had 4 different steaks between us, I had the US Kobe (I think it was the NY Cut), My DH had the Nebraska Ribeye, My Buddy had the US Kobe Ribeye and his wife had the cheapest Cornfed Filet.  I have to say Hers was the best.  Mine was supposed to be medium well and came out rare, sent it back and came back less rare...but I gave up and just ate it. My steak at Spago with the calvados reduction from 07 is still my favorite.  . Sorry Wolfgang, CUT just didn't cut it for us.
