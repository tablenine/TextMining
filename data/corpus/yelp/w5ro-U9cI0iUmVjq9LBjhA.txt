Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Minus the touchy-feely waiter, this place has yummy food.  I especially enjoyed the pizza and penne arribata.  Very rarely do Italian restaurants actually make the penne arribata spicy as the description indicates.  This is a cute addition to the new and improved downtown Culver City.  Overall, Cafe Ugo has good service accompanied by great atmosphere.  I would definitely come back again for lunch.. . Update:  I actually went back today for lunch, and the penne arribata was a bit more "al dente" than normal.  Unlike the last two visits, I went after the lunch rush.  Maybe that's why the pasta was not as good as I had remembered.  Also, my coworker and I both had upset stomachs.
