They've lost one star because I can never get comfortable there. Either the heater is too hot, or I'm sitting too close to the fountain and get splashed with water all night, or my arse is sliding half out of the open back chairs.  . . Once I get past all that discomfort and I order their appetizer, you know the one -- it's chicken wrapped in bacon swimming in cream sauce -- then all is well with the world.  . . Go with friends, get tons of appetizers and enjoy how fat you are about to get.  . . Sometimes -- actually, more often than not -- the service is shoty, so minus another star.
