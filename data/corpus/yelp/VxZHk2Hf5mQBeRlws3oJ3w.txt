I went here for my birthday and it was pretty good, but not as good as I expected. Some things were prepared too traditional to really qualify as "new American".. Here's a rundown;. . No amuse- bouche...(seriously???). First course. Frisee salad with smoked marcana almonds and truffle vinigrette. Excellent, but my friend thought it too salty. Sweetbreads with damson plums. Excellent. Entree . Sturgeon wrapped in proscuitto. Very good. Short ribs. eh..OK tasted like something you could get at any English pub. No twist, no "New American" take on a traditional standard, just short ribs, who cares?. Side. Lobster risotto . eh, couldn't taste the lobster, it was OK. Dessert. Yuzu sorbet with huckleberry almond Â shortbread. TERRIBLE- really this was a spoon of blueberry ice cream, a spoon of almost inedible yuzu sorbet, (tasted like dish soap) and a cookie.. Cream cheese ice cream. very good.. . Dinner for two was $160.00 with tip, (I think).... I would try it again, but expect some pitfalls and stick with fresh ingredients and communicate with the waiter, tell him what you like and expect. The dessert waiter was sorta douchie- no good feedback or suggestions.
