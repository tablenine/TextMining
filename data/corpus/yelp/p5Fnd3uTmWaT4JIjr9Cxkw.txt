If 4.5 stars was an option, I would use it.. . There is a lot going right at this restaurant.  To start, the food is fantastic.  Entrees are solidly in the mid $20s, but are hearty, well prepared and worth it.  . . The interior is a bit minimalistic and relaxed, which I appreciate.  Background music is very nice.  The chairs are quite comfortable, and the outdoor seating is nicely set up on the side street.n  Tables are well-spaced.. . I made reservation for myself and out of town guests, not having eaten here before, which was a little ballsy.  It all worked out fine, except thsy the service just was not up to the standard of the rest of the experience.  Had very minimal and spotty contact with our server, and if anyone was coordinating what is going on on the floor, I certainly did not witness it.  Food was delivered from kitchen by staff other than the server.  Once someone takes control of the front of the house, this place will be top notch.. . Went on a Monday, which was not crowded at all.  In considering the other yelp reviews, this was likely a significant blessing.  The crazy sounding Unagi Timbale actually worked really well, despite having banana in it.  The pork was unbelievably tasty, but quite rare.  Like bloody rare.  My friends cod entree was fantastic.. . Desserts were solid, if not memorable.. . For some reasons, this place really reminds me of Spring.. . Will definitely return, but only if it is not crowded.
