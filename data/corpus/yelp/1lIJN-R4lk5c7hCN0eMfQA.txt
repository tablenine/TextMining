Category: Sushi Bars
I love this place. As another person commented, the decor is lacking, but this place guarantees a good time. The bartenders, waiters, and waitresses are attractive and fun. The sake bombs, dancing on chairs (sometimes with strangers), sushi, dance show, and eye candy are the best parts. I find myself looking for excuses and occasions to plan a party there. I have been there at least 10 times and haven't had one complaint yet. Love it love it love it.. you need to go! Trust me.
