Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
Hands down my favorite restaurant in LA.  I know that is a bold statement, but I am sticking to it!  . . Men, if you want to score some points with your date you have to take her ...................or him there.  It not only has amazing food and service, but it is so romantic.  Every section of this place is charming.  . . This is the first place in LA that I have never felt rushed.  The waiters let you enjoy the experience and let you finish your meal before they take the plate away.
