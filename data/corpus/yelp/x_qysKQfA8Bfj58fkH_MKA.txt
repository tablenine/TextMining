Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I love meat! This is an all-you-can-eat restaurant that serves lunch and dinner for under $20 per person.. . Ambience: Most of the seating is a covered outdoor patio. It's almost picnic-style. Good for family and big groups. If you're going to another event after eating here, bring a change of clothes or Fabreze!! If you don't, you'll smell like Korean bbq! Don't wear your nice shoes - the floor is greasy and you'll ruin them! Dress down and wear your hair up so it won't smell like smoke (from the food and people smoking).. . Service: Awful!!!! When you order, make sure you talk fast and order it all at once. The server is usually walking away from you before you can place your order. When this place is busy, the server takes a while to come back. The big plus is that there is a doorbell on your table that you can push if you need additional items. If you're going with a group, you will not be seated unless everyone is present. Try to go at least one hour before they close. You will be rushed out of there once the restaurant closes and it's not fun to get the bill before you can start eating.. . Drinks: beer, generic wines, and a small selection of sojus.. . Food: Meat, meat, meat! You can order outsdie of the buffet menu. They have various marinated meats and pork. Your meal comes with about seven different side dishes, soup, and salad. The quality of the meat is average but i like the marinade they use. You have a grill in the middle of your table so you cook your own food - or bring a friend to cook for you! You can ask for as much meat as you want as long as you finish it!. . I'm a regular and most friends that we've brought here enjoyed the place.
