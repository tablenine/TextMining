Cool venue... great space and sexy-time lighting.  Kind of sucks that the specialty drinks are only served at the front bar but they're pretty tasty.  It's a little pricey, but they make em strong.  I prefer everything with tequila, so I was happy they had more options on the menu than your average cocktail lounge.
