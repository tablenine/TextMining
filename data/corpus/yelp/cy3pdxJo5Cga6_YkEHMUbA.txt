2 words...Let Down! We thought for sure with it being on Triple D it would be an amazing meal, but it was far from it. Myself and a friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and both of them were lacking any flavor at all. My wife ordered the Oinkster Pastrami and, Wow what a lame excuse for a pastrami sandwich. I could have gone to any burger joint and brought back a real one. . . Dont go. You wont find parking anyways.
