We had to try this place while in the city. It didn't disappoint! The small deep dish pizza was huge. Fortunately we went for a VERY long walk after lunch, otherwise we probably would have had heart attacks after lunch. There is a LOT of cheese in these pizzas. Tasty though. Highly recommended Chicago experience.
