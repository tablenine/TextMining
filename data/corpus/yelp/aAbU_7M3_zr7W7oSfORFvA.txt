One of the first places I ever ate at in this city.. . My dad and I went here and were impressed we didn't have to wait long, considering the place was pretty full for lunch. I got a tasty chicken sandwich with an insanely delicious spicy mayo that I swear had to have crack in it because I still get a craving for it to this day. My dad went for steak and loved it.. . Our server was nice and explained to us some great spots to go in the city. The ambiance was great and for being in the Gold Coast, it wasn't that expensive. I keep on coming back here when I show my friends around the city.
