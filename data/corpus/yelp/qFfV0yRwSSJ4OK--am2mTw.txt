Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Din Tai Fung is the West Coasts Claim to fame for Xiao Long Bao.  I've been fortunate enough to eat here a couple times.  There is always a long wait but the food is worth it.  The dumplings come out quickly and the xiao long bao are tiny and delicious.  They dont have the savory juicy flavor that Joe's Shanghai in NYC has but they are nonetheless amazing.  Bite size and delicious!  And the fun part is you get to make your own dipping sauce, i love mine with extra ginger and extra vinegar.. Ive had every other dumpling they offer and all are good as well.  I adore the dessert red bean dumplings the most.  I've never had or seen these anywhere else but they sure hit the spot at the end of the meal.  Perfect sweet red bean taste!. . Four stars only because of the wait to be seated everytime but the wait never stops me from coming back! Great atmosphere Great service AWESOME FOOD!
