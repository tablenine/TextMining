Living in OC (where Kogi visits are far &amp; few between) one can often be tempted to go to the Rowland stops (which are far closer than the regular LA haunts).. . *Don't*.. . While it makes no (rational) sense to drive further to Abbot Kinney (in Venice), do it. There will be no line, &amp; you'll be home (full of Kogi I might add) before you'd have received your taco had you gone to Rowland.. . While the tacos certainly are "different" and the idea novel, Kogi starts to wear after your 4th visit (or maybe its those long drives...). Still, props for the awesome idea.
