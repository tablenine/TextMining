Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Great place with Good Eats, but beware of the wait. Luckily we came during a weekday, so their was no wait until the late crowd came along. . . I suggest you come here with a big appetite. Come to the Griddle Cafe starving because the servings are HUGE!!!  . . OMG...we are a family of four and we ordered the following:. . The Goldend Ticket - Banana, Walnut, Streusel, Caramel, and Whip Cream pancake. Yummy yummy in the Tummy delish!!!. Now mind you this was a 3 stack pancake that literally covered the plate. My eyes were not deceiving me. I was only able to eat a pizza slice worth and the passed it on to my husband. . . The Breakfast Burrito - This was also huge and came with a side of tortilla chips, sour cream, and slices of Avacado. Husband was only able to eat  a 1/4 of the burrito. This too was delish!. . The Original Griddle pancake - My boys ordered this plain and mind you this was for a 10 year old and a 5 year old and there eyes opened wide once they saw how big they were. They very much enjoyed it.. . I also enjoyed the coffee - fresh pressed coffee nice and hot.. . We definitley plan on coming back to try other items on the menu. . . GRIDDLE CAFE definitley will not dissapoint.
