Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Waffles... fried chicken... sounds great for breakfast, and a great dinner or lunch, but eating the two together? They combined a great great menu item. I absolutely love fried foods, especially being Asian, they tend to seem to not hesitate to throw random things into vats of oil. Anyway... the chicken is crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside and the meat is well flavored all the way through to the bone. I love their fried chicken gizzards as well. . . The waffles are crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Paired with some breakfast syrup everything is OH SO GOOD! I love the gravy that they have here also. . . If waffles and chicken could combine and give you a heart attack, please serve me up one!. . Recommend: WAFFLES AND CHICKEN! gizzards, cornbread. Stay away from: collard greens, unless its your thing... just don't have the stomach for it.
