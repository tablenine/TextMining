A lot of people complained that this place was extremely pricey. I thought the opposite. We had reservations for a Saturday night a couple weeks ago. We were seated right away. Â I heard the portions were big so we skipped appetizers. My fiance and I shared the double-cut porterhouse and I'm glad that it was only $70, because it was under-seasoned. The char was very nice, though. . . The sides were disappointing. The potatoes au gratin lacked seasoning and so did the spinach. . . Come to think of it ... everything was under-seasoned.. . The butter cake was very good. The homemade whipped cream was the best part. . . Honestly, Craftsteak is way better, and they seem to take their patrons a little more seriously.. . Update: I forgot to mention that the service here was wonderful and our server was awesome. Unfortunately i was unimpressed by the fact that they had salt and pepper shakers on the table, which proved useful for the bland food. Craftsteak seems to take a little more pride in seasoning their food and not underestimating their guests' palates. For me, a little salt and pepper can make or break a dish.
