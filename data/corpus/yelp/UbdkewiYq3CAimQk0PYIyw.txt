I liked the open atmosphere of this place but I did not particularly like my gyro sandwich.  It was extremely salty and greasy.  Maybe next time I will get the shish kabob because I'm definitely not into the gyro's.  I did enjoy the delicious handmade cookies however, the little butter ones with jelly in the middle, they were excellent!  I also liked browsing through the small store and checking out all the Greek faire.  I would recommend it and would go again.
