place was packed when we got there around 11 on a wednesday night.  they were showing the giants/dodgers game on the tv.  i noticed the nice selection of microbreweries they had on tap, and then i saw barry on tv smoke one over the left field wall.  being from sf, i cheered, forgetting i was in lala land.  . . i slowly made my way to the exit...
