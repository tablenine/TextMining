After living in Chicago for 6 years, we'd never been to Chinatown.  We went to for some TCM and had to get some Chinese!  We'll be back.. . Good:  We got the beef dumplings which were outstanding.  Also got the lemongrass spicy chicken which was pretty tasty and not too spicy.. THE BEST was the bubble tea.  I got the plain green tea w/ bubbles and LOVED it!  We'll try other places too, but this was good.. . Bad:  We looked at a menu for a few minutes, went up to the counter to order when the "cashier" was speaking to a waitress.  We patiently waited, and then they both just walked away.  At least 5 different people came up to the cash reg area and no one even looked at us.  Finally I asked a waiter and he graciously took our order.  Perhaps this is a cultural issue, but there's nothing I hate more than bad customer service.. . Good to the bad:  our order came quickly!!
