Love this place, love the space, feel like I can concentrate here....like that it's slightly off the main drag....great burger, nice salads, kicking mac and cheese.....staff is super sweet if slightly cool for school which is par for the course cos it's Wburg. . . I have kicked it there on my lonesome and have rolled up with a group of like 15 people, and they're always welcoming. . . Yup I dig this beautiful place, would give it 5 if they had truly killer desserts. Which they don't. Otherwise a fantastic, home away from home kinda spot.
