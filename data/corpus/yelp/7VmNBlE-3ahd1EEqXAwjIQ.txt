Restaurant: Green Zebra
Category: Vegetarian
For highbrow vegetarian cooking, this place can't be beat.  The menu is is entirely small plate, and it's encouraged that diners select a plate from each of the appetizer, soup, salad, and entree choices.  While the offerings are flavorful and inventive, the price is really where Green Zebra loses a star.  As delicious as the plates are, it's hard to justify $15 for a half cup of mushroom risotto.
