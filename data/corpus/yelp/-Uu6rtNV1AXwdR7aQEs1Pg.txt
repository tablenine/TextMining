Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Orochon Ramen is the shiznittlebingbang (the shit)!!! I got the #2 with the soy broth and extra noodles, it was spicy but not too spicy! Huge portions! I couldn't even finish my bowl even though I wanted to. It is a little hard to find the first time you go but after that it's really easy to get there. Get your parking validated!!! I love this place and am going back at the end of the week!
