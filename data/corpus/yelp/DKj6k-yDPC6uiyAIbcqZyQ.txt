Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
This is THE place to get pastrami or corned beef sandwiches. The fries are amazing and the pickles to die for. I can't even think about it without drooling. OMG. Pickles. I always get the corned beef sandwich on a french roll. When I lived in Huntington Beach, we would drive to Johnnie's just for the sandwich. The restaurant is small with a few tables inside and two outside patios with big fire rings to keep the patrons warm. My favorite part is that each table has a mini juke box to select songs on it - 9 times out of 10 you'll hear your songs before you leave, which is always a bonus to paying the 25 cents to select them.
