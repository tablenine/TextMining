Restaurant: Los Nopales
Category: Mexican
I'm jumping on the Los Nopales bandwagen too  It is really good.  My companion and I are Guac Connoisseurs and we get it everywhere.  I'd definitely put it in my top 5.  It's VERY good.  The chips were fresh and the salsa is also great - yum.. . My steak dinner special was VERY good.  Nicely spiced and just the right amount of heat.  The rice and beans were good too.. . Even better it's a few blocks from my place.   I don't have to travel to Pilsen anymore when I need a quick Mexican fix.  . . The staff is quite friendly as well and helped us pick out some really good items on the menu.  This place is a gem in Lincoln Square...YAY!
