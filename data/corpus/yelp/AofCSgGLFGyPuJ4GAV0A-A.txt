Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
Yes, I did it.  I woke up 2:00 o clock in the morning just to go to "The Wiener's Circle" and get harassed by their crew.  Along with an attitude, I got a great char-dog and fries.  The entertainment value was also superb!  I believe the one lady who works their might be the mother of all the girls.  Anyways, I saw her trying to secretly smoke a joint behind the place.  No lie.  This plus the dozen or so drunk customers add to the adult-oriented fun of "The Wiener's Circle.".
