Two stars for the food, one for the atmosphere and effort on innovative dishes, such as the portobello fries (so-so). The place is so cavernous it had to have been either a bank or a theater at some point, which also means that in this incarnation, the acoustics make it far too noisy for amiable chitchat. Service was attentive, and the proprietor even stopped by to offer his card and say that, if I called him ahead, I wouldn't have to wait next time. Nice touch, but why not just offer reservations?. . The pizza is supposed to be top notch, but I was unimpressed, but perhaps that was because I'd just had the divine pies at Mozza a week earlier. Then again, Damiano's was better than this place. It all tasted overly bland, with little imagination in the ingredients. I wouldn't balk at coming here again, but I wouldn't choose to on purpose, especially not with the multitude of other downtown hot spots these days.
