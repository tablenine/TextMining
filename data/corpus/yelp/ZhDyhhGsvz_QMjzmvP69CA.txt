I visited Fred 62's at 2 am on New Years morning. It was quite packed and we were forced to wait outside in the more than chilly weather next to the outdoor heater. This place must be popular!. . I ordered an Arnold Palmer (half lemonade, half tea), and a no animal burger. The no animal burger is delicious. This place was recommended to me by my dear friend Marilyn C. who has written a review of how she is madly in love with this place.. . The service was very fast considering how many people were in the place. The staff is friendly.. . The inside has interesting decor, and the "Love Table" is Â a nice addition that I have never seen in a restaurant before. The "Love Table" is a table that is near the door. It has red velvet curtains, and a cool looking lamp hanging over it. The curtains enclose the table completely so that you have your own small private area. I'm half afraid of it, and half want to try it!
