Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I've been fortunate enough to have tried four different Din Tai Fungs all over the world.  Props to Mr. Yang on his success!  It's true that the one in Taipei is by far the best and has more variety, but since I don't live in Taiwan, I'll take the one we Angelenos so very fortunately have in Arcadia!  Take and enjoy what you can get, people!  They have the best xiao long bao in all of LA.  I've tried so many other places around MP and RH - they can't compare.  The bao everywhere else seem too big, too small, too oily...  Get the ones with crab meat...dipped in fresh ginger and black vinegar...yum!  The noodles (beef), fried rice, vegetables (get the green beans), and soup are all delicious as well.  . . I will say that wait time has gotten better since they extended weekend hours and opened up the second location right around the corner...  however, I've noticed that the eating experience has become more hectic since so many more people have started trying this place out.  They used to serve you your dishes in a timed manner so that you wouldn't be overwhelmed - now it's kind of a rush to the finish.  Service and attention to freshness are still impeccable, though.
