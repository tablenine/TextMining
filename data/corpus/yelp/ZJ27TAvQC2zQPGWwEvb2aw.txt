Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm really trying to find something redeeming about Pink's to increase my rating . . . but it just isn't happening.  When I went, the line was far too long, and from what I understand, that's fairly routine.  Fine by me.  The long line indicated to me that I was in for a treat.  And from the variety on the menu, there was no reason to think otherwise.. . I finally get my two different hot dogs, one of which was called "Lord of the Rings."  What an utter disappointment!  Seriously, I waited over an hour in line for boiled hot dogs with onion rings placed on top?  Is this a joke played on first-time patrons?. . I'm fairly sure I can go to Vons tonight, buy some frozen hot dogs, and they'd still taste far superior to what I got at Pink's.  . . Now, I've gotten into some heated debates on the quality of Pink's.  I've been told if I didn't have the chili dog, I just missed out on the Pink's experience.  The problem is, I don't dig on swine and I suspect the chili took some pork to make.  So, if you're going here for the first time and you don't share my aversion to pigs, then maybe you'll want to try the boiled hot dog with chili.. . But that's the most I can say about it.  I'm still pounding my brain for something that redeems Pink's.  Maybe the feeling of accomplishment between getting your food one hour plus after you get there and the moment you take your first bite of your crappy hot dog?
