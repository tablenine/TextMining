Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I actually liked the place despite how crowded it was and how cold it was outside. This was my first time going to Father's Office, though I had heard a lot of good things about it. Well, the beer was good. I had the peach (something) and I tried a sip of my friend's Alaskan (something). I'm not a huge beer fan but found both beers to be very good. Due to the limited vegetarian options I just had the fries (both and yes I shared.) I had never had sweet potato fries and was pleasantly surprised and garlic fries were delicious!. . Since my friend had been before he made it a point that we arrived no more than an hour after it opened (especially since we were also meeting a friend who didn't get off work until 6pm and it opens at 5pm on weekdays). I think we got there around 5:45ish and we were able to get a table for ourselves outside. (Thursday evening by the way!)The ambiance was very relaxed and we enjoyed ourselves. We were there for a few hours and we ended up letting 2 people sit at our table since we were going to be leaving soon and we had the room (we actually left after they did!) . . Service was pretty good, though my friend kept trying to get some sort of tomato sauce from the servers (ketchup, chili, peppers, something!) with no success!. . I'll definitely be going back again!. . Things to consider: . No ketchup (sneak some in if you absolutely need to have it with your fries!). Can get very crowed (mind sharing a table or do you need elbow room). No waiter, you have to order at the bar.. Very few vegetarian options, I feel safe in saying that there may be no vegan options.
