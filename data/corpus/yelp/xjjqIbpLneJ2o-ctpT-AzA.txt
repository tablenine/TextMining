Restaurant: Overland Café
Category: American (New)
I am from NY.  This means that I drink on Sunday mornings.. . Luckily for me, Overland Cafe is just down the street from my apartment.  It's a quaint restaurant with a diner feel and an extensive menu of tasty brunch items.  I have no complaints whatsoever about the food, but nothing is really memorable.  The UNLIMITED Champagne (okay, its just cheap California sparkling wine) on the other hand, is simply fabulous and costs only an additional $4.99.  So, 4 stars for the free flowing Champs.. . The place is always crowded and lively, which is exciting and adds to the cool vibe of the place, but also means that the service is just so-so.  I made reservations for 2 tables of 8 on a Sunday morning.  We arrived at 11:30am for our 12pm reservation, and didn't get seated until 12:55pm!  There was obviously no point in making the reservation.  The hostesses were unapologetic and simply did not care.  Not cool, Overland.  Good thing you have cheap Champagne to numb people's irritability with your service.
