Meh describes it.  The dishes were kind of bland but well presented.  The quantities are large although the prices are not especially cheap.  They are trying to do all types of Asian cuisine, they should focus on one or two.  Particularly this location, which is in the heart of Chinatown, and is surrounded by many better and more authentic restaurants.
