Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Step aside traditional blugogi and kalbi, say hello to brisket, short ribs, sirloin, and pork neck. When you walk in, the aroma of korean bbq fills the air...that's how you know you've walked into a great place for korean bbq. You don't smell grease, you don't smell burnt meat, and you don't smell anything fishy...you smell heaven!. . By far one of the tastiest Korean BBQ I've had in a long long time. We pretty much ordered all the different types of marinated beef on the menu with a party of 15 people. Since they use real charcoal, all the meats taste even better. Their combonations are a great way to start if you want to have a taste of all the different types of bbq Soowon has to offer for 1st timers (and they throw in a bottle of Soju).. . The service is A+ since they actually put the meat on the skillet and cook it for you, staff is very hospitable, and you feel right at home since everyone is so attentive. (they also constantly change the skillet which is also important unless you like the taste of burnt pulverized ashy meat residue). . $25 / person including tip for 15 very stuffed people is always good in my opinion for a korean bbq place...so all of my friends and I will be coming back soon the next time we're craving korean bbq.
