I have to say that those truffle fries rock. Combine them with the Soft Shell Crab sandwich and that's a great Saturday lunch. Finish with a Lemon donuts with Espresso Ice Cream and that's a sure fire recipe for a nap. My friend had a Bloody Mary with the Shrimp and Grits. Judging from her reaction they were both a hit.. . We went back to enjoy the Bar at JCT and found it to be quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, the valet seems to have quite the attitude. I think they need to reevaluate which direction the money flows. I'll chose to spend my money somewhere else next time and take a star away because of this experience.. . I returned to have a couple desserts and cocktails with a friend to kick off her birthday celebration. The banana pudding and deep fried peach pie were outstanding. We sat at the bar and the service was very good.
