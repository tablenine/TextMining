This is my first post at yelp.  I am glad that my first experience was pretty positive.  We went to Blu Jam Cafe because of Yelp reviews hehehe.  So let me start at the beginning.  We parked at the street, meter.  The place was nice, paintings were a lil odd but nice.  The waitress was nice also.  It didnt take long before we got our food.  We had high expectations because the rating were pretty good and when we saw our food it was impressive.  For $7.50ish forget exactly the cents the food looked like it was worth more than $10.  My plate was Blu Jam Benedict it was simple and looked yummy.  But my girls she ordered  Eggwich which was about $10 had a side of fruit and I was just amazed at how it was presented they sliced apple and shaped like a fan.  I was just thinking of the effort put to make it look good.  The taste was YUMMY.  The Blu Jam Benedict is soo yummy I will go back and try the other two eggs benedict that they had in the menu.  My girls Eggwhich is pretty good too I like how the creamy egg yok breaks when you bite and the crispy bacon hmmm and how it all melds together with the pesto.  The side of fruit look good and it taste good *smiles*.  I would go back.  Service, food and place are pretty good. Have a good one y'll!
