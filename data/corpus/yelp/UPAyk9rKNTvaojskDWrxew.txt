If you love cajun and seafood, this is surely the spot for you!! The first time I tried their food I was in love, the sauce was sooo finger-lickin good and the seafood seemed cooked to perfection! But these days I feel the taste and quality of their food has been fading... I don't know maybe I've eaten here way too many times in a short time frame or something but it's not as yummy as the first time I've had their shrimp.(of course with the whole sha-bang style). We even tried the garlic butter sauce but that was even bland (!!) how can it be bland?? I have no clue but it was... The wait staff are very friendly and I have never had a problem with the service. It's a fun place that has a fun atmosphere and although I gave it a 3 star I definitely think it's a must try experience!
