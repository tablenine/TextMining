Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
I love Fogo de Chao.. I think I have been to almost all in the US through business trips. I love this place.. it is great for groups or just for couples. Even though it may seem like a meat lovers haven (and it is), the salad bar is not just carrots and lettuce! Sushi, cheese, palenta, artichoke hearts, all sorts of veggies.. everything basically. And the lamb was my favourite of the meats brought ought. Drinks a overpriced IMO, but hey this is a place you go every now and again so who cares. It is way better than other Brazilian BBQs I have been to.
