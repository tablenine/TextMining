Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
I like Joan's - there are always good things to be had from their spinach leak dip to the chicken milanese to soups to cheeses to cupcakes.  The desserts there are excellent, marshmallows covered caramel, cookies and they have great cupcakes.  The only drawback is that it is kinda pricey and the parking is nightmarish to say the least.  Try parking in the back in the alley but there are only a couple of spots.
