I've walked by this place many times during my high school days at LP and always wondered how the food was. A few buddies and I decided to try it out on a late night after drinking and walked in on the cashier and a patron screaming at each other... We stepped to the side to give them space and also decided on what to get. A few moments later the cashier stopped screaming at the patron and asked us what we wanted. I told her we were still deciding and then came the unprovoked racist comment," Hurry the fck up, we don't serve egg rolls here!" Are you serious? My friend got really upset and he just went at it with her. This is when I decided we had to go before the situation gets out of control. As we left she screamed again,"And I bet ya'll dcks are small too!" Â It surprises me and is very disturbing to read the reviews on yelp and find this as a regular occurrence.
