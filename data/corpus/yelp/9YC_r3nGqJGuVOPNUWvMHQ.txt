I really like this place.  But it's important to remember when its appropriate.  It's not a good "date place" nor is it fine dining or healthy.  It's a deli that's open 24 hours a day.  It has an enormous menu that is guaranteed to clog the arteries.  And if you're still alive afterward, it has an even more amazing dessert selection, with more cookies, cupcakes, breads, and pastries than you'll ever know what to do with (though eating them is a good start).. . The servers are nice to you if you're nice to them, the place can get somewhat crowded and somewhat loud, and the people are as varied as LA has (old, young, westside, downtown, hollywood, etc...)
