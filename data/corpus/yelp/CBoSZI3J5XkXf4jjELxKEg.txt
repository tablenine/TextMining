DELICIOUS ice cream! Unfortunately, their equipment was broken when we visited, so they only had 5 flavors instead of the usual 10 or 12. BUT luckily, the two flavors we chose were amaaaaaaazing. A scoop of peanut butter fudge swirl &amp; a scoop of maple pecan put together in a cute glass dish, topped with hot fudge, coconut whipped cream, peanuts, and a cherry... Mouthgasm. Just incredible!. . This place is TINY, and not quite as "cute" as I imagined (I pictured like '50s-style ice cream shoppe with fancy little stools &amp; bright-colored counters). Truthfully, it sort of looks like a storage closet. But the product is very high-quality, the staff was really friendly, AND they had veg literature all over the store.. . Most importantly, the ice cream was the best I have ever had... Well, it's tied with Maggie Mudd in San Francisco. But it's certainly better than any dairy ice cream I ever ate - and that is really saying something because I used to be QUITE the dairy ice cream connoisseur. This is creamy perfection that is sweet, rich, and satisfying.
