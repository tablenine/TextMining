i came here saturday for brunch and it was fantastic i think most people assume that because perrenial is a little nicer than, say, r.j. grunts, their brunch is going to be overpriced. but it isn't at all! most dishes were between 7 and 9 dollars. and it was all delicious. the fresh-squeezed orange juice was perfection, as was my '2x2' - eggs, sausage patties, and pancakes. we ordered a brunch appetizer called croquettes, i believe, which were fried balls of potato, sausage, and something else, with a delicious dipping sauce. really good.. . service was very friendly, and it seems like it's a good place to go with family and even kids. i can't wait to walk over here in the summer and sit outside, people watch, and enjoy a fantastic brunch again! what a find.
