For all you Geisha House Hater, I'm ashamed. This is probably 1 of the top 20 places to take a date for a long lasting impression. You take a date here because you pay for the ambiance then head to Hollywood to go clubbing. . . The food isn't great for the regular items but the Special rolls are pretty good. I would get the 911 roll, Ocean Dragon, and the Soft-Shell rolls. The sauteed calamari is a must which is not fried but made tender with a zesty sauce. . . Price is pretty high as 4 special rolls, 6 drinks, and Calamari rans up to 130-150 price range. Just make sure you have a fat wallet or your date is well worth it.. .
