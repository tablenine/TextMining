Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
This place is a in between taco bell and something else...I just cant figure it out yet. There menu is really small but the lines are super busy? I had three tacos and they were alright...they need salsa or it doesn't taste that great. Wouldn't eat here by choice.. and wouldn't suggest it. But try everything once no?
