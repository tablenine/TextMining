Okay so I just ate here for the first time last night with my boyfriend. I was surpised to see the line go out the door, it was about 830pm, but it was really nice out so maybe that's why. They feature a very small menue of only hot dogs, tamales, fries and drink. Â The place inside is kinda dirty looking but I got over it prety quickly. My bf told me I'd love the hot dogs. The prices are really good too, better than Superdawg I admit. BUT, when I finally got a double dog with mustard and relish I was pretty disappointed.The hot dog was just OKAY, but the fries were so f'n greasy and bland they made my bun like soggy and I got fricken stomach pains from all the grease. And it didn't fill me up! I didn't really like their relish either. WTF. I am going to stick with Superdawg for sure. Maybe I will pay a couple bucks more but I will at least be full with ONE superdawg, NON GREASY yummy fries, and my pop. =/
