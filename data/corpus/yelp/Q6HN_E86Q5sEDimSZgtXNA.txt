It got there a wee bit late -- but we had to test out the hype. . . Kimchi quesadilla? Eh. Novelty wore of in three bites. Maybe two.. . Tacos? Nothing over the top. Great concept -- not the best delivery.. . BEST? The special concept burrito which was a mixture of chicken-pineapple-and-spicy-melty-goodness.. . Other than that? . . Done.
