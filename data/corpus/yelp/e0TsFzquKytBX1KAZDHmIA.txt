Went here in Jan of this year and I really liked this place. But at only 7pm on a Saturday evening this place was beyond packed!!! Took us 30 min to wait for a table to clear. Other then this the beers were great and although I paid $13 for a burger it was absolutely amazing!!!. If you can get a table I highly recommend this place.
