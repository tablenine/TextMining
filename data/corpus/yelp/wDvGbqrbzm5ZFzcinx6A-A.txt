a bit of a fad, but for breakfast food, especially pancakes, it doesn't get better than this. the pancakes are HUGE! you won't be able to finish it in one sitting! the regular breakfast food is pretty darn good, too. the only problem is that it's wickedly popular and on the weekends the wait is ridiculous. but if you're in the right (waiting) mood it's totally worth it
