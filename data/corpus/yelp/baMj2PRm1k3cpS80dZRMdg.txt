Kyma was abso-fabo-delicious. My pal Kim and I headed over after work today--thanks Buckhead Life for the $30 gift card--and even though it's Monday we were in the mood to unwind. We decided to get the Meze dinner plate; 3 chef-chosen spreads and then 5 appetizer plates. Opa! All was great!. . The chef's choice of spreads were served with warm, soft, pita. We had an eggplant w/ mint and yogurt spread, a fava-bean spread w/ capers, and a red pepper w/ feta. They were the perfect size to start the meal, but we could have easily eaten more of the eggplant selection. Our apps included Greek meatballs (lamb and beer served w/ taziki); fried cheese (need I say more!); calamari (second choice after sending back the cuddlefish); ahi tuna w/ lemon olive oil; and stuffed grape leaves that had a perfect balance of sweet bulger inside with a savory yogurt sauce for dipping.. . We also had a bottle of Greek wine (a first for me) and the feast was worth every penny. Our server even let us take our time and enjoy our food slowly, just like in the actual Mediterranean. Great experience!
