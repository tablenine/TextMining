Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
The dessert was great. We had a cookie with ice cream or custard I'm not sure which but it was delicious. My sandwich the "Diego" was good but agreeing with Noah I should have asked for it grilled which they do but being our first time I missed that on the menu. There are a lot of sides to choose from but the macaroni and cheese was great. I'll probably end up going back here just to try some other sandwiches. It's not cheap but its not overpriced for the area either. Try it, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
