I'd heard of the original location in Santa Monica for years through friends, but have never been. I'm definitely all for anyplace with a wide variety of beers on tap, so I was curious, but heard many stories of standing in line to get in, so I was in no hurry. We stopped by the new location in the old Helms Bakery complex in Culver City to see if we could get in on a Friday evening, and hey, no line, so we went for it.. . On the way in a guy by the door asked us if we'd been there before. We just said yes and walked on in. My friend had been to the Santa Monica location before, so he told me that they have "rules". I guess there's no substitutes on food orders as others have mentioned. Whatever. We got us some delicious beers and went off to look for someplace to sit. Another friend showed up soon after, and then we found a table for two, so one of us stood next to the table which was located near a door leading to the patio. No problem.. . I went up to the bar and ordered another round and an order of fries. The bartender asked where we were sitting so they could bring the fries, and I pointed to our table. The bartender said, "That table is for two people, so we might ask you to move since the person standing is blocking the door". "Ok", I say. I went back to our table for two, they brought the fries, which were tasty with the garlic sauce, and they never did hassle us, so I guess we really put it to the Man. . . Good beers, decent food, uptight somewhat snooty atmosphere. Whatever.
