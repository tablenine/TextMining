#200. . I'm refusing to give this place 4 stars on principal.  Ten years ago, I strolled by this place and thought it looked lovely for lunch.  I was barred from entering from the snotty hostess and given their business card.  "We're booked for months.  You have to call for reservations.". . Every day for about five years, I stared at that card and wondered if it was time to give 'em hell (yes, I hold grudges).  I moved and subsequently threw away the card but I never forgot it.. . Sunday evening rolls around and we could not find parking in WeHo for the life of us.  My friend says, "let's just go to the Little Door."  I grumbled a bit but held my tongue.  I wondered if they were going to let us in.. . It turns out one of his tenants works as a bartender there on Sunday nights and treated us fabulously.  I'm fairly certain he comped half the drinks.  It was also fun to eye the barback and impress him with my knowledge of ice wines.  Ha.. . Yes, the space is lovely.  It would be nice to have dinner here.  Maaaybe.  I'm still kind of bummed about how shoddy we were treated years ago and it looks like it hasn't changed from reading the recent reviews.  . . I visited the ladies' room but it was occupied.  A busser told me to use the men's room and then proceeded to barge in on me three minutes later.  Gee, thanks buddy.  . . They do a fairly early last call and I witnessed one of those embarrassing scenes from some Hollywood nobody threatening to "tell someone" when she couldn't get another glass of wine.  Yeah, well, I don't think they care.  I do have to at least respect them for being snotty to everyone.
