I thought this place was really great! I went here tonight with 3 other friends and we all really enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere. We were up on the second floor and it is very intimate and quirky inside. The pace of our meal was leisurely (about 2 hours), but it gave us time to just enjoy our food and conversation--we really liked that. . . As for the food, everything I had was great! . Appetizer: We started off with the hummus and flat bread appetizer. A safe choice, but very yummy! . . Entrees: I usually do not like seafood but for some reason, I was really compelled to order the scallop dish with the sweet potato puree. It was delicious! Go there and order it! As for the sides, we order the Mac and Cheese, Brussel Sprouts, and Spaetzle. I have to say that the spaetzle was my favorite; the crunchy texture is really nice in contrast with the mushrooms...I've never had anything like that before. I thought the other two sides were ok, not amazing (although my friends really liked them). . . Dessert: I had the bread pudding and it was really good! The portion was a reasonable size for one person, although I probably could've eaten way more of that if they had given it to me :). . All in all, I think this place deserves 5 stars. Definitely a great value for the price of the food. Everything was well done and tasted great. Only con was parking...
