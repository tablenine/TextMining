Finally tried this place after the hype machine kicked it into high gear and I gotta say: Not so much. . . Perhaps it is my self-proclaimed sushi snob status, but the 5 star reviews are a bit questionable. As Jenny pointed out in her review when we walked in it smelled quite fishy. Usually that is my cue to turn it around and bail, but seeing as how the reviews were so high, we thought we'd stay and try it.. . The red snapper was good, although it was served with the skin on, which Â is never a fave of mine :(. The halibut was good. The yellowtail was very good. Spicy Tuna, I'm never really a fan of, but in spite of that, I thought it was okay. . The ankimo was a true dissapointment. I order this everywhere I go as I feel it speaks volumes about the place, but this was nothing to write home about. Super fishy and bad texture. If you want THE best ankimo with the tastiest of ponzus, try Sushi Ike in Hollywood. They truly set the bar.. The lighting in this place also took away from the ambience I felt. It felt like last call in a bar, too bright and not appetizing.. The beer and sake, sure, hard to go wrong with this.. . Overall, I think it's more like a 3 and a half, but I'll be kind and rate 4. Not horrible, but nothing standout enough to crave.
