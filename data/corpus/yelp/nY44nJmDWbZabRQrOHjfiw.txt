The pastrami here is the best.  I've been to Katz in New York, and consider myself somewhat of a pastrami connoisseur, and this place is definitely the best.  Although many people don't like the hard crust on the rye bread, I find the crust a good balance to the extremely moist pastrami.  The best part is that the pastrami is thickly sliced, and with the cheese and Russian dressing, this sandwich is the best.. . The cost is a bit pricey, at around $13 dollars a sandwich, but it's honestly so good that cost doesn't really matter here.  Get some chili-cheese fries with your sandwich.
