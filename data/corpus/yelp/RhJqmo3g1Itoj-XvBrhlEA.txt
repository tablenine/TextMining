I went here with two friends this weekend. We started off with the crab rangoon (per the recommendations here--we were not disappointed) and some sushi roll (good, but nothing special). For my main dish, I had a pan seared sea bass served over mushrooms and asparagus drizzled in a sweet and lightly salty sauce (soo good! paired well with the Riesling that I brought--this place is BYOB). My dining companions got bulgogi (a Korean beef dish) and the ping pong chicken (if I recall). I enjoyed mine the most, but hey, I was in the mood for fish. The atmosphere was fitting for the eclectic style of Broadway Avenue here. Stark white decor, house music, odd movies playing from the projector (seriously...a Fresh Prince/Jazzy Jeff video!). Service was prompt, friendly and unobtrusive. Overall a unique, positive dining experience.
