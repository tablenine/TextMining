Entirely unassuming, which is good, because nothing is worse than going to a restaurant that looks like it's "all that and a bag of chips" (a thanks to my memories of 90210 for that one) and then being disappointed. Well, what might be worse is going out with a girl who paints herself up like a whore, as I was once wont to say, only to discover that her face and kickin' bod is all she has going for her... no substance. Of course, if you're going out with someone that you could say has painted themselves up like a whore, I guess a compelling personality ain't what your chasin', if-you-know-what-I-mean.. . Service was great, the waiter recommended a nice white (label escapes me). I started with the duck-fat fried chicken, which was killer, while my wife had the "amazing" (her quote) seared tuna with hearts of palm. I then went on to the halibut, while she had the NY strip with miso glaze. Both were out of sight: the steak had a great char on it, the glaze made itself known but wasn't overpowering, like some obnoxious drunk guy at The Cubby Bear. We split a chocolate thingy for desert. . . It misses the fifth star only because the downstairs, where we sat, is lacking in pretension (or "strong ambience," if you prefer). Maybe upstairs is different. We'll be back, and that may cause me to amend my review.
