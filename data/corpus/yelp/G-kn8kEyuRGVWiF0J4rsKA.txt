Restaurant: Opera
Category: Chinese
So I was a little nervous about Opera since I am always very hesitant about trying pan-asian types of restaurants but what attracted me to try Opera was the fact that they are not your regular run of the mill chinese restaurant. They take a traditional asian dish but they add the flair, ingredients, and presentation of contemporary american dishes. It combines the best of both worlds! I would recommend coming to Opera for the $30 pre-fix menu where for just $30 you choose an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. It's a great deal considering that just ordering an entree can get you close to $30 already. My only complaint was that some of the dishes came out lukewarm.  I would definitely go back here again, especially for the pre-fix menu!. . Crab &amp; Chopstick  . LOVED the presentation, set next to a big crab cake are two long "chopsticks" that are spring rolls filled with this spicy crab filling.. . Sea Scallops  . This dish was amazing and exceeded my expectations! Three scallops set atop a bed of polenta and surrounded by this amazing rich brown XO sauce that taste more like an exquisite blur blanc sauce. Sooo yummy!. . Soup of the Day  . The soup of the day was a butternut squash soup with a mini crab rangoon on top. LOVED it, but then again I do love any type of butternut squash soup. This was nice and had hint of ginger.
