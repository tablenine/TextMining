Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
This is a nice little diner. It's family owned (brother and sister). The two are comical if you ever have the opportunity to dine here while they're in.. . The space is tidy. Service is quick. The food is a little toned down for my taste... but it's decent. You can eat healthy here without breaking your wallet. They've got fruit cups if you're looking for something fast in the morning.
