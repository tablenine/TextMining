This place is well loved by Yelpers and I guess you have to get it to enjoy it.   I've never had a good meal here and waiting on line to order and then sitting and waiting seems so bush league to me.  It's nice to sit outside when it's beautiful out but I can do that at numerous places throughout the hood.  I've not had their deserts and have heard great things, no comment there. I do love their infused teas, they are tasty and have the right amount of kick to them.  It's also very pricey, which is what also makes it annoying that there is no waiter service.
