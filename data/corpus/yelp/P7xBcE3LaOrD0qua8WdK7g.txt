I went there the other day with my friend. The place itself is kind of grungy, but absolutely adorable. It encompasses what Little Five Points is in one tiny dive bar. There are different groups of people there, mostly locals, and there is a full bar with, well, every drink.. ever. Very casual and fun. Always a good handful of people there. It is very cheap which is good, and the food was excellent for the price! I got a quesadilla with chicken for like $7! Plus the beers and stuff are cheap but delish as well. I've had a great experience with the EAYC, but one time I went there with my friend for lunch, and he ended up getting food poisoning which is why I'm giving the EAYC 3 stars. He ended up puking yellow stuff all over his car... pretty gross! I guess just stay away from the friend chicken wrap..
