Is this really the best brunch atlanta has to offer?. . Murphy's brunch came with high expectations, and failed to meet them. The service was very friendly, but slow. The biscuit/muffin basket came so late that we barely buttered them before the food came out. . . The food was ok, but nothing special. My chilaquiles were ok, but lacked any spice - it tasted like bland salsa dumped over some chicken. Also, it was cold. Like not even lukewarm. All in all, disappointing.
