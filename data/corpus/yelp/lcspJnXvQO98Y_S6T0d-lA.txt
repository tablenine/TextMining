I've been going here ever since Huell Howser did a special on Californias Gold. My favorites:. . 1. Biggest  lamb Gyros in LA, don't forget to grab some roasted garlic &amp; peppers behind you while you wait for your gyro. It's a really great value for what it is. Beats having to eat Daphines!. . 2. Lamb Sandwich- Get it at the Deli. Fresh baguette, thick slices of  tangy Greek feta, and slices of roasted leg of lamb. Add some pickled veg/olives &amp; your in business.. . 3. Lamb dinner plate @ the deli . Savory, tender pieces of  braised lamb in greek herbs served with  sides of green beans &amp; white rice. . 4. Baklava. . They will also sell you prepared gyro meat so you can have a greek BBQ @ home
