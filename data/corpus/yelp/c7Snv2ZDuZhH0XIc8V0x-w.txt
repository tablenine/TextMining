I hate to say it, but I found this place a little overrated.  The ramen was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever had.  I also found the restaurant to have poor air circulation which is important when eating a hot bowl of ramen.  Everyone raves about their fried rice, but I thought it was good but not the best ever.  Overall, I might come back here but only if my favorite J-Town restaurants were too packed.
