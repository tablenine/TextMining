FEED ME!. . I thought I wasn't that big of a "southern food" girl but I guess I was wrong! Ever since my visit last week I cannot stop day dreaming about mac 'n' cheese, cornbread dressing and pulled pork.  If you don't "do" pork they have rotisserie chicken served with house made salsa and breaded catfish sandwiches.  If you are a fan of the southern sides you can order five as a meal- if you can narrow it down to five!  Remember Louisiana hot sauce makes everything you order taste even better!. . PS- no one spent over $10 and we all left stuffed!
