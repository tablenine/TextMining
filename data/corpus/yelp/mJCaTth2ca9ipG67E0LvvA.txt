The food there was decent. The decor was ok, a million clay pots on the ceiling made it look interesting but that's about it. The food wasn't spectacular. The lamb shank I had was ok, I wasn't immensely impressed by it. The food overall is good, especially if you're into the whole i wanna hang out with the trendsters crowd. . . The service was a bit lacking. Apparently if you show up in a large party, the staff has a bit of a freak out. Ok so we were a party of 13. Not a lucky number I suppose. All the soda came in these tiny glass bottles, great for novelty purposes, not so much for drinking as you don't get that much. Oh well no high corn fructose syrup for me then!. The waiter wanted us to order everything immediately, geez so much for chatting and enjoying the ambiance of the place. No you just can't order appetizers now. You have to order everything now. And for some reason the waiter thought that being that two of us wanted the same dish, doesn't mean we're sharing! . . The staff couldn't wait to get rid of us. Considering it took us a while to get our food, and geez we'd like to chat, cause that's what a bunch of girls do, oh we're closing the register can you pay now? Wow...you really want us out don't you? Oh and of course tip is already included. . . If you're flying solo or just with a friend then great for you! otherwise you might have better luck elsewhere.
