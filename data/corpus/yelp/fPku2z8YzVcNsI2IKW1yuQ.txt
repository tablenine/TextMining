Restaurant: Tokyo Delve&#39;s Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
first of all, this place really shouldn't be called a sushi bar. it should be called a bar, which also serves some overpriced unremarkable sushi.. . you shouldn't come here if you're not a fan of either sake or beer.  in fact, it's best if you're a big fan of both, mixed together with a slam of the fist on the table. drunk with a cheering crowd and a very friendly/outgoing wait staff.  i've heard that you can almost never make it out of this place sober or with a bill costing less than 40 a person.  i guess that makes sense if the sushi costs $35 a plate.  i can't really say for sure, because i've only been there once and i was so drunk when we left that i have no idea how much money i slapped down, if any (sorry guys if i forgot!), let alone how much the bill came out to be.. . don't order the food if you can get away with it.  it's just not good, and definitely not worth it.  go for the sakebombs.  and the mini kegs of beer that they place at your table.  and the chance to dance on the tables with your friends to the tune of america's favorite: YMCA.. . i think it'd be a great place to celebrate a birthday.  or a promotion.  or a friday.
