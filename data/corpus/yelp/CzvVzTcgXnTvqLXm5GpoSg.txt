i love this place! it really feels like a real japanese ramen place that was taken right out of tokyo and put in LA. the ambience and decor is exactly what i would imagine if i were in tokyo eating ramen. . . my friend was dying to take me here so i ended up just driving from OC with him and it was worth the long drive. there was even a bit of a wait but sitting there was ok cuz you have a lot to look at and manga to read haha. i didnt read it but its an option for those who do haha. . . as for the food i ordered daikokuya ramen and a spicy tuna roll and my friend got the same along with the flat gyoza. simply delicious. i wanted to eat every last drop but my stomach can only hold so much haha. . . but yes PLEASE GO HERE! in fact i'm contemplating going tonight...mmm. . as for the reason for only 4 stars...is because it's a B rating. i'm not sure about how clean the food stations were but it looked a little sketchy back there hahaha. but i didnt get sick so that's all that matters!
