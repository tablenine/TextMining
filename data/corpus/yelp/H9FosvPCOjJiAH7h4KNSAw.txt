Restaurant: The Old Oak Tap
Category: Bars
I love Old Oak. My boyfriend and I have made this one of our staples and we try to go as often as possible. I highly recommend the Sirachi Wings, Fat Boy Pie, Fish Tacos, Pork Sampler, Grilled Cheese and Talapia Sandwich. Personally I prefer the dinner to the brunch but it is still good. I also heart 2 Brothers Domaine Dupage. This is one of the few places that carry it. Try it, I know you will like it. . . I would shy away from the Crab Club. It is just okay and there are much better options.
