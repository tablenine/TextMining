Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Two tacos and a beef burrito every single time.. . Tastes exactly the same as it did in 1992.. . Prices aren't too different either.. . Don't forget cheese on the tacos, and listen up gringos, always order to go and you will get the hook up. Â if you have to ask why, you'll never know.. . just a little tip from tio daniel.
