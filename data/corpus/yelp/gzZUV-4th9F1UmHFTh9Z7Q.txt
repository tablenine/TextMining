Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
Probably the best / most palatable Sushi place in LA.. . WARNING!!. If you've been to the Katsuya in Brentwood, Hollywood, or Glendale, then you HAVE NOT BEEN TO KATSUYA!  These are a complete ripoff, not nearly as good, and twice the cost, but if you want to pay for the "by Stark" and fancy decor, be my guest.. . The real restaurant is Studio City. There is one in Encino, and  a new one on 3rd near La Cienega, but it's called The Izakaya and is more expensive.. . This is a specials place, meaning they have a bunch of signature dishes that have made them famous, and you've no doubt had copies of since other places have started to catch on.  The straight up regular sushi is average with some standout winners.. . Specials:. Honey Roll, hand roll. Albacore with crispy onions. Crispy rice with spicy tuna (signature dish, everyones favorite). Crispy sesame tuna. Baked crab roll, cut. Seared crusted tuna w/ special mustard sauce. Cajun halibut cheek. . Sushi:. Japanese red snapper with yuzu pepper. aji. toro. yellow tail belly
