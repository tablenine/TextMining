Went here for my birthday..the guacemole was nothing special, I am not sure if was fresh..almost tasted like it had been made prior..I am a big fan of the fresh made to order varitey and when your payint $8 for it, the I would expect it...had the taco platter, I would recommend the duck toco and the tres queso taco...very tasty...service was good and a hibiscus magarita was interesting.
