Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
My friend heard about this place through the Travel Channel and I'm so glad I got to experience it.  . . The place is TINY!! And the best hole in the wall place I have ever been to.  The ambiance is so welcoming and the service was amazing.  The waiters are so sweet but nothing compares to Manuel the owner.  HOLY CRAP! I love that man.  He is the funniest little thing!!!  I went there at 11am and he offered me a shot of Tequila.  How can I resist??? I felt right at home.. . We had the 5lb burrito between the 4 of us and we were DYING!! It was SOOOOOOOOO GOOD though.  Considering the size, the quality of all the ingredients was the best! I would definitely come back!. . I'm from San Diego and trust me I know Mexican food.  This place is definitely a must try!
