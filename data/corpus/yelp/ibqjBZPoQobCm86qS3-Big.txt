Came here after work after being insisted by my Japanese colleagues.  I'm glad I gave in.. . Everything I've had so far is amazing.  Yes, amazing.  Whatever you order from the menu is good, but please make sure you do order the chicken cartilage, for non-Japanese readers, it might be hard to find on the menu.  But just ask them for it if you can't find it.. . The place is loud, filled with drunk people, you have to wait in line for a considerable period of time (30-45 minutes?) and while you wait, you can hear the terrible karaoke singing from the bar next door.  But everything fits in so well, it is almost like a different country once inside.  I highly recommend this place.
