This is the best hamburger place in Atlanta by far.  . . I love everything about the place except for smoking area and the size of the burger.  The smoking is pretty much self-explanatory, and I have to say the burger is just too big!  I know it sounds crazy, but I struggle breathing at the end of my meal.   Why do not just not finish it?  because it's just that good. . . My favorite is the blue shroom burger.  Nice thick patty, blue cheese spread, bacon, and lettuce... it's the perfection.. . The place is 18 and up, so don't plan it with your kids.  There is a smoking and non-smoking area that's divided by... well.. nothing.  So be prepared for that. . . Their tater tots, fried zuccini, and sweet potato fries are awesome, too!
