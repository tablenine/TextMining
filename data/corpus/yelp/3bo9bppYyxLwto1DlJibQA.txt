Hainan chicken is the best - and I'm simply addicted to their chili sauce. Ordering anything else from the menu makes no sense to me - unless you just don't eat chicken.. . Maybe bcs. I'm a regular, but they have AWESOME service. Ice tea is good too, and they make sure to top it off regularly. The place is relatively small, so it does get crowded - but if you want a quick fix, inside seating is usually open. Btw, I don't understand folks who give it less stars for there being a wait.. Â Good food at good price = popular = lots of people = wait if you show up at the peak hour. Also, it's an Asian place in Alhambra - it should really be no surprise that it's cash only.
