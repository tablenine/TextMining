Restaurant: Butterfly Sushi Bar &amp; Thai Cuisine
Category: Japanese
Stopped into Butterfly for a quick lunch.. . (Note: This is across the street from Flo...my favorite breakfast place). . The people working at Butterfly were extremely friendly. It was a Sunday so I was the only person for awhile but it quick started to get busier.. . I sat at the bar and ordered Crab Rangoon (i know...not your typical sushi selection) and a Spicy Tuna Roll. . . The Crab Rangoon came out quickly (not too quickly which would suggest the use of a microwave) with a complimentary bowl of Miso Soup. The miso was great. A little on the hot side but it cooled down with a little stirring  and I busied myself with my appetizer. The Crab Rangoon was noticeably good. As much as I love the stuff I don't really think about it. I just love the cream-cheesiness. The mix in these little fired goodies was really good. A little spice, maybe a touch of red pepper but overall it was a bit more interesting than you'd expect Crab Rangoon.. . I'm going to add a photo of the Spicy Tuna Roll  because the presentation was fantastic! Drops of spicy sauce on one end of a long sushi plate followed by a quarter of an avocado sliced up. The roll was beautiful with heaping amounts of spicy sauce mix on top with little garnishes. The ginger was fresh and not soggy and they press the Wasabi with a mold for another extra touch. . . Look, this lunch was mind blowing but it was refreshing and really filling. The sushi chef even stopped to ask how it was and if the spice was good, not too spicy and so on. I thought it was great.
