Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I saw this place on Food Network.  . . You know...on one of those foodcumentaries that show the popular foods in the country.  Tom Hanks ate here all the time before he was famous.  (jay h. factoid: I love Tom Hanks.  I've had the biggest crush on him since Bosom Buddies.)  . . So I was taken here yesterday to get an "LA experience".  They have a HARRY POTTER DOG!!!  I would've ordered it but it had grilled onions(bleh) and mushrooms.  I'm a hot dog minimalist and that hot dog was way too involved. . . I ordered a chili cheese dog...mmmm.  . . Hot juicy meat in my mouth!!  Ya'll know I love it!  Shit...I'll get it where ever I can!   . . It was perfect...not too big and not too long.
