Restaurant: Zocalo Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
This place hits the spot if you need a quick mexican fix. The guacamole is really good (made fresh, tableside). Don't expect your standard beef taco combo. The menus a little different...as in molcajete carmelita (a cheesy, beefy concoction). The food is slightly better than average. I usually get the fish tacos. This is a great place to go for salsa, guac, cheese dip and drinks. The entire restaurant is out on a deck so its defnitely a good place to go in the warmer months.
