Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
Geez, a number of people kept telling me this truck was a let down. Well, these people are picky, hard-to-please little biatches, but they're also completely right and therefore, not such biatches.. . I had high expectations of the truck because I love grilled cheese sandwiches. They're part of that "kid food memories" compartment of my brain along with peanut butter/jelly sandwiches, spaghetti-o's, alphabet soup, little debbie zebra cakes, gummy bears I would find on the ground, s'mores (remember when those came pre-packaged??!! Remember??!! Now you gotta put it all together on your own), etc. Any new "take" or reinvention of my childhood favorites is a welcome addition to my stomach.. . Given, when I went at the T Lofts Haiti Fundraiser event, the line for the truck was super-long so maybe they were really busy, but the mac n' cheese with bacon grilled cheese sandwich that I shared with my friends was just kinda bland. I LOVE the concept of mac n' cheese in a sandwich (kudos for the idea!!), but I just couldn't grab onto anything with any real taste in the sandwich--even the bacon. Maybe if I had hot sauce or something, that would've helped. Or butter? I don't think they put butter on the bread but I'm not sure--maybe not enough? Or maybe tomato soup for dipping?--practical on a truck? No. But delicious? Probably.. . I'll definitely give it a second chance if fate gropes me in the buttocks again and the truck appears before my eyes...oh, and if there's no line. Maybe I'll try the "Harvest Melt" or the "Dessert Melt" next time--those looked creative. But as of now, I would classify the truck in the "Kogi" category, where the concept is brilliant, but execution is lacking in the food (that sounds weird to say about grilled cheese sandwiches). I do like the unique look of the truck though!!
