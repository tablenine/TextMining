I had an egg omelette with ham and sausage. It was delicious! The server was very nice, quite entertained with her job and clearly wanted to help us. Great job!. . Parking is either valet or try to find street parking which can take a while.. . The place itself is pretty small. There's no more than 6-8 tables in the building and about 10-12 tables outside. Sitting outside is best I think.. . I have no complaints and would definitely go back!
