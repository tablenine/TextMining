Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
plus half the three and half is for the Staff- the management etc. They are good at what they do. I had a small get together in June and they took good care of us.. . That is where it ends.. . The bar ambience is too airportesque and bright not at all comfy like the last Pops.. . The selection should be OVERwhelming in Champagne but it is limited to the status quo.. . I am really into champagne bars and their vibe this place has gone Commercial well the view is Chilli's !!!
