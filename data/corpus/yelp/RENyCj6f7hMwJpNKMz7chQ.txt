Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I love Tito's Tacos. There's one in Stanton California as well. it's always such a hard decision when I go to eat at Tito's or Jonnie's (they're next door to each other). It's got great greasy mexican food that tastes like it got flown in fresh from Mexico City. Very inexpensive. They make their own chips, which I think it always such a bonus and they have the best salsa I have put in my mouth in months. So good you can drink it. In fact, usually I do. In a big salsa drinking cup. So good.
