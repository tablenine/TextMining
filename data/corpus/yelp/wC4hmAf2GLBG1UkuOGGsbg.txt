Restaurant: Taqueria del Sol

Hype is kind of a bummer. I was really excited to finally try Taqueria del Sol after hearing so much about it, but left a bit underwhelmed. The food was certainly good, but it wasn't as fabulous as it's made out to be. . . The prices are definitely awesome and I might have been well-served to get a little more adventurous with my ordering and try a few different sides, but instead just got a few veggie bean tacos and a side of rice. . . We actually didn't have much of a line at all, and when my friend and I went up to order a bit more food they called us over to order at the bar so that we didn't have to wait in the short line that had formed, which was nice. Also, the food comes out really quickly, which is always good.. . I'll probably be back, but I was definitely underwhelmed by the food at Taqueria.
