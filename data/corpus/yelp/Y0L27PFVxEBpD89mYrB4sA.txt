I know there is a higher power, since I live just far enough away to only get here a few times a year. Otherwise, I would be 800 lbs and blissfully happy. I never really liked pies that much until here. Drop in on your way to the Your DeKalb Farmer's Market. That way you won't fill up on the nasty baked goods they have a YKFM. Save yoru calories for Southern Sweets and ignore any damn yankees.. . Wow. You have to taste their cherry pie to believe. I'm not big on coconut cake, all the other southern sweets (and I can make pecan pie, so I don't usually try it out). But I have loved everything I've tried here. . . Standouts - Apple pie, Cherry pie. Caramel cake. Anything with chocolate. I often bring their carrot cake to the in-law (my other favorite carrot cake is at Rhodes).. . Lunch - Go here for lunch so you don't eat a whole 5lb slice by yourself. They have the best chicken salad ever. No real mayo - but red peppers, etc. Get it over the greens. All the soups are fantastic.
