again - thank you Yelp for pointing me in the direction of someplace new for breakfast/lunch... . . i just popped in with a friend for a monday lunch...  and we had a nice meal... . . the crab benedict was nicely flavored and seasoned - but the chiabatta bread that they served it on was too thick and tough - i'd have prefered it on an english muffin or croissant.... . my friend had the chicken paprikas which looked tasty - she liked it.. . prices were moderate - the whole menu looked so good - i had a hard time deciding what to get - so i will definitely return to try something new.. . oh - and the water did taste delicious - but it had a peachy flavor today - not lemon/mint.  the coffee was good enough to enjoy black - and they did bring us some crusty bread with a mildly spicy tapenade before our food was brought out - very good.. . in all - it was about $15 each including tax &amp; tip... not bad at all.. . *****update 8/14/07*****. . my second visit here was just as good as the first!  i came with a different friend, and we split their catch of the day - a blackened salmon served over rice... SOOO good.  it wasn't just salmon over rice... it was served with a baby carrot, slices of zucchini, garnished with fresh sprigs of dill and snips of fresh chives... and the rice was cooked with peas and something else - i can't remember... but it was a perfect lunch!. . i just bumped them up to 5 stars because they were just as good if not better than the first time.
