This is a Chicago landmark! Every time I have out-of-town guests, I take them here for a Chicago style dog or polish. I myself don't eat beef or pork so I can't personally attest for the dogs, but everyone has loved them. And the fries are pretty good as well as the chicken sandwich. Going here late at night is definitely interesting - the women are crude, loud, cursing. If you're a guy, you get slammed by the crudeness. They are a little more polite (polite is not really the word though) to women and don't curse quite as much, but they will yell if you don't have your order ready by the time you get to the front of the line. And for everyone's sake, DON'T order the "chocolate shake!" There is no milk involved!
