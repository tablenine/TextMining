Loved the openness of the space and great for people watching. Drinks are pricey and the food is mediocre. Fried chicken looked good but ended up disappointing in the flavor and moisture category. Fries were good but it's very hard to mess that up. Waiters were attentive and managed to keep the water glasses full throughout the meal.
