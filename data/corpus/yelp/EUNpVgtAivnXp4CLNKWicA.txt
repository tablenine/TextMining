Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
If you love garlic the stinking rose is for you!  Had a whole dungeness crab, tureen of zuppa di pesce, garlic bread, garlic fries, and salad.. . The dungeness crab was good...well seasoned and easy to eat.  A small tureen can feed about 2 people for an appetizer and was just enough food.  Could've done without the garlic fries because I was already stuffed by that time, but nevertheless it was good!. . Overall I'd go back because I'm a garlic lover.
