i just had lunch with a friend and I really liked this place a lot. i thought our waitress was super nice and i am so sorry i didnt get her name to post on here, but she has long blond hair with blunt bangs. so patient with us and really explained the portions, we wanted a lot, and gave some suggestions to us. . . one negative was the tea. i think nescafe. ugh.......... . i had the nutella and strawberries with ice cream. oh my god! yummy. i will be back to say the least and i like they were wheat too. yeah i know but every little bit helps.. . the menu is also diverse but not huge, which is a huge plus for people like me that freeze when ordering.
