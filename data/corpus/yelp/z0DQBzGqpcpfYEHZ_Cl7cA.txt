Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Perhaps Mastro's was overly hyped for me, but I was not impressed in the slightest. The bone-in filet was good, but nothing exceptional -- I've had better at Ruth's Chris, honestly. Perhaps my company was a little too dressed down for the snooty hosts, as we were relegated to a lonely corner of the downstairs. Our waitress--her nametag read Butterfly--may have been cute (what, she was), but not the most helpful or attentive. The lobster mashed potatoes were the only side worth getting, and were, like everything else, much too expensive for what they were.
