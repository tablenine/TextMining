Restaurant: Sepia
Category: American (New)
It's been way too long since I last dined at Sepia, but thanks to my sis-in-law for graduating from Kellogg we had an excuse for a dinner celebration! Most of my husband's family can't seem to hear so we tend to stay away from loud restaurants.  While Sepia is by no means a quiet restaurant they reserved a private table in the back for us, which was just perfect. . . The cocktails are unbelievable here, which made me a bit sad I wouldn't be able to drink them, but they did make me a yummy virgin cocktail filled with lots of fresh fruit.  It looked and tasted so much like a real cocktail that my mother-in-law questioned what I was doing to her future granddaughter. . . The menu changes frequently, but if they happen to have the gazpacho as an appetizer make sure to order it! Days later I'm still thinking about how that may have been the best gazpacho I've ever tasted...the shrimp marble in it was especially tasty.. . Between my food allergies (no meat, soy) and pregnancy there's few things on any menu I can eat.  There were only a few entrees I could choose from and opted for some sort of special dumplings with greens in them.  They were very yummy and I'd totally order them again, although once baby arrives I may need to go for some halibut.. . The hubby and I split the dessert special: the banana cake. The cream cheese frosting was perfectly sweet and you could taste chunks of creamy bananas in each bite.  I offered a bite to the others at the table and my hubby shushed me and said "don't offer anyone a bite." It was so good that he clearly didn't want to share.  Lucky for him they can't hear anything anyway so the banana cake was all ours.
