My wife and I have been frequent visitors to this restaurant for around a year now. We even have a membership with their rewards program. However, the past 3 times we have visited, we have been concerned about the direction the restaurant seems to be going.. . Most of the competent waiters that were employed there seem to have gone.  What is left are waiters who disappear for 10-15 minutes at a time, refill my drinks once, and generally give off the attitude that you are inconveniencing them. If your waiter/waitress happens to have a group of 5 or more in your section, be prepared to be treated like you don't have any money. . .  The food has also taken a hit in the area of  quality. I usually like to get steaks when I go and my wife usually gets fish or chicken. All the meat is a decent quality, but it has been abused during cooking to provide a rather tasteless meal. . . All in all, we probably won't go back unless one of my friends or family really wants it, but you can get better food at any of the other area restaurants and not be treated poorly by the wait staff.
