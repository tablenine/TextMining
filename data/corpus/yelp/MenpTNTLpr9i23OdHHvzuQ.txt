I've been twice now.. . First time, strictly adhering to nothing from the japanese menu. It was really good. A highly enjoyable, low key Friday night after a long week. The soft shell crab was brilliant. Two bottles of wine were consumed so I don't really recall EXACTLY what we ate but, it was all very good.. . Service was friendly, relaxed and everything was well timed.. . Total bill = $35 [which induced a healthy amount of questions but, it was correct]. . The second time, the entire menu was fair game and the sushi won the day. Of course we did go back to the soft shell crab appetizer. All lovely.. . Total bill was about $55 this time round which was more than reasonable for the amount of food....and prolly quite cheap for the taste / quality.
