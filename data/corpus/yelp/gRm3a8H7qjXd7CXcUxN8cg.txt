despite the $5.50 (+tip) valet charge, the sometimes long wait, and the $2 charge for a tiny block of cream cheese for my bagel, i really like toast. the attractive staff may ignore you when you walk up to put your name on the list, but eventually you'll be on and hopefully not too much longer will you be seated. then you'll enjoy a delicious breakfast (or lunch, or dinner). toast is a great place to meet up with friends for lunch, as well as a good place to people watch. i like "the favorite" scramblette: eggs, spinach, goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms and basil. yum!
