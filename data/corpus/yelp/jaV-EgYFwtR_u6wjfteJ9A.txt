Really nothing to write home about  here!  I went there for the second time, but only out of convenience.  The spring rolls that my sister and I ordered were the worst I've had, but yet the noodle dish we ordered was quite good.  The rice dumplings for dessert were NASTY though.  I like rice cakes, but these were gumyy and tasteless.  I think you have to know what's good on the menu because it's hit or miss.  I won't venture back there if I didn't have to.
