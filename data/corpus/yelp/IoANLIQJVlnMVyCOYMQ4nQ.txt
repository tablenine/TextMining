Another place I wish I could give 3-1/2 stars.  . . What El Barco does well: a variety of tilapia and other fish grilled in many different ways with different flavors.  Some of the better 'full fish' plates I've had.  I also love El Barco's salsas that they serve right when you sit down - nice smokey flavor and lots of heat.  Also, El Barco's presentation for all their dishes is just fantastic...you really want to dive in as you walk by other patrons on your way to your table.. . What El Barco could improve on: I find their Caldo de Muchos Mariscos to be iffy.  Not only is it a ton of work to eat it (get ready to dig your hands in there) but frankly I don't think the flavor of what you get is really that good.  Also, I ordered a dozen oysters here but found them to be tough to work with and quite small.  Good oysters are hard to find and I was disappointed that El Barco couldn't do better.. . Drinks are very good and generous.  I ordered a Corona and was pleasantly surprised when they delivered a 24oz bottle to me!  Their margaritas are also fantastic.  Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't say that the majority of the waitresses are pretty easy on the eyes.  . . All-in-all, a decent place but for the money you could probably trade down in atmosphere for a bit better food.
