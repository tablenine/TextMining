Pretty much what they said.  Arrived at 2:15 on a Saturday and there were several people eating, line was short, staff was friendly.  Got a pound of boiled shrimp to go, as well as fried oysters with fries, and a slaw.  Total was around 24 bucks.  A bit pricey, but it was very good.. . The oysters were excellent, disappeared fast.  The fries were kind of orange in color, but tasted like regular fries.  IMO, they should kick-up the cajun flavor on the fries.  . . The oysters were around 12 bucks, so not a spectacular bang for the buck.  But the shrimp, at 10 bucks or so per lb, were a great deal.  I look forward to going back and trying some other things.
