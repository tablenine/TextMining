After hearing all the hype for the last couple of months, I finally had the opportunity to try the Kogi truck. Eating here was kind of an afterthought, we drove by the spot at around 10:00 pm and saw a large crowd gathered. To make a long story a little shorter, we made friends with the couple who were last in line, we waited in line with them for 1 hour, and then when we got to the front of the line, we gave them $5 so they could order a shortrib burrito for us. After they ordered, we spent another hour waiting for the food during which time they announced they were now out of the chicken and the spicy pork!. After waiting 2 hours for a burrito, I was expecting something magical. While it was very good, it wasn't magical and it certainly wasn't worth waiting 2 hours for. The poor couple who ordered for us waited 4 hours!!! The shortribs were tender and had a good flavor and the burrito had potatoes in it as well as some other unidentified ingredients, we were so hungry we devoured it, in fact we were so hungry, we were about to leave the madness to go to Del Taco. Bottom line; If the total wait time is over 45 minutes, forget it, it's not worth it.
