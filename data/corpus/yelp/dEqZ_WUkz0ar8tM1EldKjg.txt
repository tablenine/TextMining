Week three upon stumbling into this place and we have been back twice.. . I don't usually like to wait in line for my food, but we waited for about 1 1/2 hour the second time we were there just to satisfy our TanCang craving. I'm not a big fan of lobster or crabs, so we ordered the hot and sour soup with catfish, the French beef and the clams with the basil sauce. Yummy.. . My husband loves the French beef, but I'm all about the clams and the soup. We ordered too much for two people and had to take some home. The soup still tastes good even the next day.. . If you've never been here, try it, you won't regret it.
