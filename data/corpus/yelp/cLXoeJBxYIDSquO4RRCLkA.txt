i think everyone agrees the sushi is tasty...everyone also agrees that the sushi is very expensive for what you're getting.... . so the real question is whether the premium is worth it...and i vote no.... . i can't discern any real difference between the sushi here and at places like coast or hachi's kitchen...but i can tell a difference in my wallet.... . also, the vibe is a little too pretentious for my taste...i get it...i know if you're a high-end sushi joint in chicago you play soft euro-techno in the background and have lots of shiny objects around...but still, this is a little much...
