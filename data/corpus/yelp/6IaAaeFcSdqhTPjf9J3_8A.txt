I love Portos and their crispy, succulent potato balls. Yeah I know, each one is probably 100 calories, but for balls that leave me this satisfied, count me in.. . Cheese rolls are bomb. Red Velvet cake is even good. The empanadas (meat rolls?) are good but I felt were a little too doughy.. . My sister and I had the Roasted Pork Sandwich (Pan con Lechon) and couldn't finish. I think they forgot the garlic dressing because this sandwich was hella dry and meat was not seasoned. Next time I'm going for the Cuban Sandwich w/ Mayo and Mustard.. . I was impressed by their coffee + espresso - top notch! Tamales were blah - WAY mushy. I think Mexicans do em best.. . But Cubans can boast the balls...
