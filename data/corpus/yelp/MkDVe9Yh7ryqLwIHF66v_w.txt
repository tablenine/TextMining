I live in Pomona (about 45 minutes away), but I have been here twice this week and about 4 times this month! That is how amazing it is!. Spinach croissant melts in your mouth. Red Velvet cupcakes are better than any I have had in the South! Potato Balls are lighter than most; some people make them way too dense. Try the Italian cheesecake it is a very refreshing dessert. I could go on for hours...lol
