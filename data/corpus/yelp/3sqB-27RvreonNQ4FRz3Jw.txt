eat the chicken! make sure you have someone else to eat it with unless you're a beast and can finish a whole half rotisserie chicken by yourself. dang i'm a hypocrite! Don't say I didn't warn you though, you'll have major food coma if you finish the whole thing by yourself. Their chicken is good and can't be compared to other rotisserie chickens because it has a zesty lemon flavor to it. I'd still prefer other rotisserie chickens, but cuban style is definitely worth a try! The plate comes with onions, black beans, rice, and plantains. I usually don't like plantains, but these are fried to the point of oily goodness!! EMPHASIS: OILY GOODNESS! I did NOT say disgusting oily! There's a difference! Both times I went there, the service was great! I gave it three stars instead of four for its crappy and cramp parking lot (but i guess its a gift to have a parking lot in LA) and for the fact that I'm not obsessed with it. Don't get me wrong, their food is good, but I guess I don't have the urge to eat cuban food all the time?
