It doesn't matter if you order from the Thai, Japanese or sushi menus, all are handled with equal skill. It's really nice to be able to combine a well made Thai appetizer or entree with a helping of fresh and expertly-crafted sushi. There are some creative inventions to be found on the sushi specials board. The Thai iced tea is the best I've ever had, attractively presented in a huge, tall glass. The waitstaff is friendly and enthusiastic, and the atmosphere tasteful and comfortable, with big photos of sushi porn lining the walls.
