i think the term "supper club" is a bit much.. . the food is OK, but i just could not seem to find anything that i really wanted to eat on the menu.  too "turkey dinner, chicken pot pie, roast w/ mashed potatoes" sort of place.  it's like bar food with an identity crisis-which i guess is where the "supper club" stuff comes in.  . . i guess the burger was good, so says my boyfriend.  but basically, we had a toss up between bar louie and silver cloud for our bar food dinner last night and we picked silver cloud since i have had bar louie plenty of times.  i left wishing that we had eaten at next door, however.
