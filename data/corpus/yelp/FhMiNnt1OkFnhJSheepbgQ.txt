I haven't been out much in ATL (been here for 2 weeks).  The line to get in was a little much..... The "crowd" inside didn't warrant a 30 min. wait!!!!. I think they wanted us outside to think that it was really "on" inside.... I'm from New York so I know how clubs play line games.. Good crowd, for the most part nicely dressed.  Seemed like a "grown &amp; sexy crowd" 25-30yrs. Very nice decor &amp; night club  ambiance, cool fish tank. I spied some UN-B-WEAVABLE hair styles &amp; a few sad lace-front *FAIL* wigs. Bar service *FAIL* took so long to get a drink..... They didn't have Blackhouse, WTF!!!! *FAIL* . My first drink was WATERED DOWN &amp; served in a hot glass (probably just came out the dishwasher) and my ice got melty and my drink was warm :( . I also ordered a Peach Bacardi &amp; 7up and I think the bartender forgot the 7UP!!! So I was happy with my cup of Peach Bacardi. DJ was good.
