Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Canters has been one of my dad's favorite eateries in Los Angeles since before I was born. As a result I have very fond memories of this place, along with a few colorful ones...including the one where I called my dad Â a ba$t..in front of everyone (including some of his friends)...he promptly escorted me to the bathroom for an impromptu a..whoopin'.. . Canters has recently started to "freshen" up their staff, which is a bittersweet affair. My childhood memories are filled with their signature waitresses...but some of their new staff is very good.. . Overall the food at canters is good but I end up going there for the corned beef on rye. I like having a side of pickles (often free) and on occasion I'll go for some bagel chips and matzah ball soup.
