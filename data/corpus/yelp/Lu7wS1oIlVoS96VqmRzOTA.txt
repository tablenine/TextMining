Let me start by saying movie theaters have come a long way baby! First of all my wife and I have not been to a theater since Die Hard 2. We like the comforts of home while watching a movie, kick off the shoes, pop a bottle of wine, sit back and relax. Well that is exactly what our experience was today. Wow were we impressed. No more Blockbuster for us! We are going to the movies! Thank you Fork &amp; Screen!
