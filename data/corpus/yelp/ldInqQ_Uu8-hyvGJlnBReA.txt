Dude, been coming here for over 7 years and its always good. It was better back then when they weren't so busy though. Only bad things?. 1.) they keep weird hours cause they close whenever they run our of soup base. 2.) they don't do take-out orders when they're busy. . Other than that, I love them and will keep supporting them. On another note, since they got so damn crowded, i started going to their sister restaurant Ebisu Â (one block over on 2nd) since its closer to me and while they don't serve hakata, they're still good and they still serve my favorite, free cabbage salad with the yummy, creamy dressing. SCORE!
