Tapas...if you like tapas, then this is a decent place.  The interior was very spacious on a week night.  The bar was small but inviting and the booths were comfy.  The decor was somewhat of a mix between Spanish rustic and colonial English.  But, the food was decent.. . I tried several tapas.  The best was the chicken empanadas.  It was so full of flavor and just the right amount of crispy.  Friends also had the steak skewers, plantain chips, yucca fries.  (Sorry, these aren't there official names. I can't remember what they were called.)  Everything was pretty good.
