I'm not gonna lie. . . I'm just not that impressed. . . You can try with your really awesome interior and extremely awesome staff to make me impressed, but your food isn't amazing. . . Came here the second time the other night and I got two tacos and a salad. I ordered a pork taco that came with pineapple something (too lazy too look up the fancy name) and a steak taco. Both seemed a bit bland. . . It's like you take Mexico food and you try to make it fancier than the $6 combo meals at Los Arcos or whatever down the road, and you end up just completely bland-ering it. Keep it real. Keep it cheesy. . . I may come back for your yummy/fatty corn. That's all for now.
