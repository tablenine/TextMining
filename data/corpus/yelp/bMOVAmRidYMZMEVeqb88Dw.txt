i can't believe i've been eating here since they opened and never thought to review it.  best cole slaw in town, mac &amp; cheese. the salads.  i love the 3 styles of bbq sauces, the hoisen, the hot, and the honey mustard, the wings are to DIE for, portions are big, atmosphere is great, great service, pretty much the only place i go when i'm up for bbq.  there are some decent beers on draft, too, such as a couple belgians as well as micro brews.  . i have nothing bad to say about this place.. . i tried the burger "daddy style" for the first time today.  it's a half pounder with brisket &amp; bbq sauce.  holy crap!. . and they sell their home made pig ears for dogs.  so doris always wins when i go to the daddy.
