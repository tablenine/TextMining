Yea so you're probably not getting laid if you go here with your buddies and then hit the club. But garlic...esta BUENO! Yea that garlic that just sits in a bath of olive oil....spreads like butter on your toast....I had the prime rib here...the big one....the one that doesn't fit your plate. Yea freakin great. I tried the rabbit once...eh...not so much....But seriously everything is covered in garlic. Even the ice cream isn't bad. So every Nocturna Demonium and Vampyr will steer clear of you for a week. Because your pores reek garlic. Even when you shower. You reek garlic....yes. Be the garlic. Only thing I really don't like about this place...is the over exaggerated gaudy decor.
