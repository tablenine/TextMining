Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
2 Things to know.  Go hungry and bring a fat wallet!!. Honestly, if it wasn't for cash constraints I would eat prime rib here until I vomit and then come back and eat some more!. I feel like a lion on the savannah who just killed a buffalo and now it's time to inbibe in massive quantities of red meat!!!. I honestly can't understand how anyone can be a vegetarian.  This is what life is all about!  Order lobster also while you are at it!  The last time I was here it was almost better than sex!!
