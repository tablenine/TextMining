At last, my Osteria Mozza experience!  Angela O (Do read her review . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ) didn't have to twist my arm too much to join her, as I'm a huge fan of Nancy Silverton, Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich (love his Mom's cookbooks, especially "Lidia's Italian-American Kitchen").  . The Tasting Menu (Sunday through Thursday) - $35 (not including gratuity) is perfect for Osteria Mozza virgins, the optimal way to go solo, but even better with a friend - double dining!  . Watcha get is wine, one white or red - Bastianich Friulano or La Mozza Morellino di Scansano; plus, one choice each from the Mozzarella Bar, Primi and Dolci offerings.  We ordered, shared and dubbed ultimate foodgasms:. Smoked Bufalo Mozzarella with Prosciutto di San Daniel. Burrata with Bacon, Marinated Escarole and Caramelized Shallots. Goat Cheese Ravioli with Five Lilies. Maltagliato with Wild Boar Ragu' . Cicoccolato, Bittersweet Chocolate Cake with Perugian Chocolates. Rosemary Olive Cakes with Olive Oil Gelato and Rosemary Brittle. Our server/bartender was both knowledgeable and accommodating; she even split our red/white wine servings to pair with our food. How good is that? . We were not rushed. Each course arrived at the appropriate moment; plated with artistry. Portions were both adequate and wise considering some of the higher calorie ingredients.  . Small plate. Slow food. Fair price. Live well for less! I'll be back.... P.S.  As per Anna A. do valet ($10, not including gratuity) ); it's so worth it to relax and enjoy.
