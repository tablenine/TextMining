I grabbed lunch here today with a friend and we liked it. The sweet potato fries are nice and crunchy with a chewy center and they have a decent beer selection.. . I did the burger in a bowl and it was pretty good. Ordering on the clipboard is nice if a bit overwhelming. Lots of options but you might end up worrying you will ruin your burger. Interestingly I didn't circle a cheese and did circle onions, but I got cheese and no onions. It still turned out tasty, but I wonder how you screw something up when the customer fills out the order form for you.. . It gets 3 stars because it cost my friend and I $31 for two burgers, sweet potatoes (shared) and an ice tea. Normally I wouldn't mind spending $20 on lunch, but it felt overpriced for what we finally ended up with. Also, they offer roasted red-peppers as a topping, but they came out cold.. . I will probably go back, but only if I am in the immediate area.
