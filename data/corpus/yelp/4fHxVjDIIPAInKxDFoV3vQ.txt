So it gets 4 stars cause its the best Dim Sum I've had in ATL so far. Please note it was my first time there, but it hit the spot having not been back to LA for months and missing the delicious dim sum out there.. . It is kinda pricey. I'm used to spending $10 a person or less for dim sum, but it'll do until I can find a better place.
