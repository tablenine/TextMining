Don't see the fuss about the limit of $11 as I have never seen that at all. Have been twice, including a couple of weeks ago. The wait depends on location and the day of the week. I bought food for mine, and my friends family and was not hassled at all.. . Food is good, I say the burritos are the best bet with short ribs for somebody Â going their first time, or maybe the chicken. I really want to try the spicy pork. I say it is worth the wait
