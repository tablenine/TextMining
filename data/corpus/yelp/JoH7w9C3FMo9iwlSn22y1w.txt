Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
"Chicken? And, waffles?  Together?  Ummm OK, that sounds gross but I guess I'll try it."  I wonder exactly how many people (including myself)  have said that before going to test out the (in)famous Roscoe's.  I was told #9 was the best choice on the menu, so I went with it.  While I wouldn't say it's the best food I've ever had, I give it a solid 3.  The fried chicken is really good and the waffles are, pretty much, like every other waffle out there.  Decent prices, interesting crowd.... . I have to say, the highlight of the night was the saucy older woman who waited on us.   She was quick to make sure we behaved and didn't put our knees on her clean seats.
