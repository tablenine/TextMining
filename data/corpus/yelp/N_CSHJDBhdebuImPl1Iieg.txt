I'll give 3 stars because maybe just maybe I'm not really a steak person so i ordered salmon.. 'twas my birthday that day and they actually give free cake which i love because its free. Â . The place is classically designed. It's kinda European in a way, their waitress have a french maid attire which i think is so cute.. they are also so nice and good with making you feel important. which i love. . . If only i could take home some of those yorkshire pudding and i wonder if the salad taste the same without having to spin them while putting on the dressing... . They only have valet parking i guess..
