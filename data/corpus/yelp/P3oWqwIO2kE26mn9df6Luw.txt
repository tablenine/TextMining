Restaurant: The Real Chow Baby
Category: Asian Fusion
At first we walked in and the waitress sat us, then a cool waiter guy came over to explain the process..........at first I was a little confused......Then I got Â up to do make my bowl and it was awesome. The only cons are: don't go on the weekend. And please know a little about your creation. I was overly stuffed because I wanted to try to create so many different dishes They all were awsome. I love Chow Baby, I will definately go back!!!
