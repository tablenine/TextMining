Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
Sooo...the food. The food was the awesome. I ordered the Papi's sandwich, which is like a Cuban on steroids (a la Jose Canseco), complete with cheese, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. It was huge, filling, and delicious. No complaints from this sandwich lover. The passion fruit milkshake brought much love to my heart with its perfectly lovely sweetness. I will for sure come back for one (or seven) of these.. . The service, however, was lacking. I was ordering for takeout and things were... not good. Dude at the register? Surly. Manager yelling at another employee 'cause he spilled some ice? Bad idea, lady. Plus my food took a hell of a long time to prepare: probably about 20 minutes. That's a long wait for a takeout sandwich, no matter how good it is.
