I do not understand all these raving reviews. That is most likely due to the fact that I didn't eat here because I GOT SO PISSED I COULDN'T GET PAST THE HOST.. . My sister's boyfriend works here, so I and my group of 6 had plenty of reason to go and love it. I call to make a reso, and the guy says, "No Reservations. You will wait 1.5 hours." and hung up on me! Whatevs. I go anyway to start waiting while my amigos show up.. . I get there and I couldn't even walk to the "host stand." There had to be 100 people waiting and they are all crazy. I finally get up there and the "host" FINALLY comes up to me and I repeat my story. He shouts, "NO NAMES! ONLY FACES!" . . Bitch, please. I was a host for 5 years and there is no way that is an efficient system. (I found out later he keeps a "list" of "descriptions" in the kitchen.). . He says its an hour and half and no, we can't sit in my sister's boyfriend's section because he has booths. I try and say he cleared it earlier that day with a manager, but got cut off. I asked to speak to the boyfriend, got a mean look and a huff, and was never talked to again.. . So I left. Â . . And I will not be going back.
