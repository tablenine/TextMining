Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I LOVE Fathers Office! Bar none best burgers in LA. The prices are a little steep but as soon as you take a bite you know it is worth it. Make sure you try the sweet potato fries the aioli dip make sure you do not even miss having ketchup available.
