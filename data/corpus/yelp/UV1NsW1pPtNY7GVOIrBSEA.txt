After a night out drinking and partying, pho is always one of my major requirements.  Came here on a Sunday, ordered spring rolls - good and pretty typical and this other type of roll that had pork skin it that turned out pretty good, too.. . As for pho, I always have to get the pho with flank and tripe in it.  We ordered three bowls of their #2 and devoured it - soup, noodles, meat and all.  Decent service but fantastic pho!
