Yummy! I've only been here once, but it was so GOOD!  I had been wanting to try it and somehow I was able to convince my brother  to join  me for lunch. We were unexpectedly surprised with how good and authentic the food was. We had some of the tamales, tacos and the agua de Jamaica.........Good stuff!!!
