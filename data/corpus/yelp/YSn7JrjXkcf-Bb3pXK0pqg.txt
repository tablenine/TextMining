Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I have to admit, I'm a Father's Office fan though I didn't visit this location until tonight. Culver City (and the surrounding area) is progressively becoming an up-and-coming hotspot and they tailored the decor to suit its area. Like its name, the paneled wood gives a sense of a masculine office and the outdoor patio area houses a series of wooden tables. The lighting is dim, but since it's a bar that's a given, and the communal restroom sink is an interesting touch. . . Staff are friendly and efficient. As long as one gets here early enough, one should be able to get a table though it does get crowded fairly quickly for such a bigger space (in comparison to their tiny SM location). Even when crowded, it doesn't feel very cramped and is a good place to relax after a long day of work (or watch the game from multiple tv's around the bar).  . . Generally I come here for the sweet potato fries, a must try that pairs well with their dipping sauce. Their burgers are delicious too, but I was here for some beer and fries, so didn't order that tonight. The fries were full of flavor as usual (I wonder what oil they fry it in) and I had a good night sampling a couple beers I haven't tried before. There is generally a great selection of beer that should satisfy most people's tastes so try something you've haven't heard of or ask the bartender for recommendations.  . . A great place for regulars and with the ease of parking, I will definitely be returning here quite frequently.
