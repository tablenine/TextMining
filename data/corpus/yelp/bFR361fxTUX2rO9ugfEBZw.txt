Pretty good and cheap. Definitely the place to be right now.  Ten tatoo minimum on the clientèle.  We had 6 drinks and ate like hungry drunks for $37!  Great people watching and the music was good. Try the pork tacos with the pinapple. The fish ones were so/so. Also, the pablano tacos rocked. $3 beers and huge patio, YAY!
