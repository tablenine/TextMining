Wow, it's been a long while since I was last at this place.. so I will base my review on the past and I can assure you it prob hasn't changed since now.  . . My friends and I would come here to hang out on the weekends on occassion.  Well one of my friends LOVED this place and that it was featured in Swingers with the infamous Marty &amp; Elayne lounge singers.. eh, big wow.  As soon as you walk in you're in the lounge room thats dark and cave-like.  Older folks, couples mainly, take the seats here.  We opt to sit in the dining area.  It's all white and cabana-like seating.  They'll usually be some young folks in groups but the vibe is non-social.  Weird.  Our talks would usually be of somewhere else to go to next.  We've had some of the appetizers and they sucked. Service is horrible. Waiter here.  Drinks 20 min later. N everything is pricey too.  Booo.  Never really enjoyed coming here nor do I miss it.
