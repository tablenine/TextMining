This is a really special place. It's a place for people who love food. You have to wait - a long time, and that's a good thing because there's some excellent drinks to be had here - even if all you need is a perfectly-poured pint of guinness - or four. . . The people working here are all professionals. They are the kind of people you would like to be friends with. Many of the people who come here are also professionals in the same industry. So, it's a good idea to be on your best behaviour - because that behaviour will be reciprocated.. . There's a lot of waiting here (this is the part where you are in a pub and having a conversation with your friends) but this place works like clockwork when you consider the quality of what they are putting in front of you - whether it's food or drinks. The burger is as good as it sounds - if you can get it. It's a good idea to talk to your server and assemble a nicely-paired collection of tasty bits and wines. If you like specialty ingredients that feature large amounts of collagen, you will be in heaven here with the pork trotters and cock's comb and whatnot. . . I really love the stainless/glass meat curing chimney and the way the interior design appropriates an unorthodox but effective relationship between all the parts of this tightly-composed space. It all fits together to create a very comfortably luxurious feeling - if you can ignore the jocks in the bar area who ordered every last one of the 24 burgers.
