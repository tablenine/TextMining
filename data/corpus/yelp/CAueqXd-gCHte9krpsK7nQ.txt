Restaurant: Thaicoon &amp; Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
I'd give this place a solid 2.5 stars.  Came for sushi today with some company after some positive word-of-mouth and further Yelp verification.  Should also mention that I'm not someone with a particularly refined sushi palette.   I ordered the rainbow roll and the avocado roll.  Maybe the hype and 4 stars are for their Monday-Tuesday bargains/Thai food, because I honestly didn't think the sushi was all that great.  The rolls fell apart way too easily, the rice left something to be desired for, and the fish wasn't all that fresh.  I honestly feel like I've had fresher sushi-grade fish in the Midwest, which is kind of a sad standard to fail.  Biting into the seaweed kind of had this elastic chewiness that I haven't experienced before (not so pleasant).  The prices are average, so it's not exactly like Thaicoon is a steal.  I will say, though, that the sushi chefs did a good job with presentation - everything looks very appetizing.  Too bad it's not equally as satisfying in one's mouth... I might come back to check out the special on Mondays/Tuesdays or even try their Thai menu (I think the fact that the management was Southeast Asian might mean that the Thai food is at least decent?), but at this price and quality, I gotta believe that ATL has some better options.  . . Other things:. - The service was pretty good.  We even got some warm moist cloths to wipe our hands before the meal started.. - Major props to the wait staff on always filling up my glass of water.  Never left me dry!  . - Restaurant was surprisingly empty on a Sunday evening during dinner time.  Maybe it really is bumpin' only during the bargain times.
