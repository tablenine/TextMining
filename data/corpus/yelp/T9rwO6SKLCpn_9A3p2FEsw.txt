Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I've lived here for 4+ years and right down the street from Pink's for 2: I'm glad that I went because it is such a staple in Los Angeles history.. . The fries (in any form) are superb.  I din't feel like having a heart attack that night so I ordered a Guacamole Dog.  It was ok - I should have gone for a Heart Attack Dog because it seems like the Chili is where it's at.. . The total for two people was $15, which made me happy too!
