I think my friend put it best: the awesomeness of the food is not greater than or equal to the time you spend waiting to get a table. The ramen is highly overrated here.. . We waited for about 55mins, which is fine, it's a Saturday night, I had read all the glorious reviews of this place, and didn't mind waiting for something that was going to be supposedly epic.. . I have big sanitary issues with this place. . We were sat at the bar, so we got a peek into the kitchen the whole time. A couple of things: A guy opened boxes with his hands, switched hands, and then dipped his box-hand into the pork slices and threw them into the bowls of ramen to be served. . . Then he picked his butt, and proceeded to put the noodles in the basket and toss them around with his butt-hand. . . Ick.. . As for the ramen, it was very mediocre. The noodles reminded me of the cheap "Top Ramen" noodles from grocery stores. And I hope you like green onions.. there's about a 1/2 cup of them in the soup. . . The pork slices inside the soup were all fat.. Which made me sad. I sat there and picked up all the pieces trying to find 1 little bite of meat, I could not. . . Sigh.. . $41 for 3 people, 55 minute wait, I will not be returning.
