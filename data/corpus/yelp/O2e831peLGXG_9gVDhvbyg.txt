Restaurant: Buddha Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Wow!  There's actually a large golden Buddha statue right when you walk into the place.  You can't help but smile when you see that.  I did rub his belly!. . It was nicely decked out in black and red and much nicer looking than what used to be in that location.  The hostess was very friendly and accommodated our large group of 14 with a smile.  Then our waiter, Patrick, was amazing!  He got a big tip because he got all of our orders right and out to us quickly!  Go Patrick!!  I ordered the Sesame Chicken which was good.  A little on the soggy side but still tasty.. . We were all in such a good mood that we started a wave around the restaurant, which everyone joined in on.  Even some of the waiters!  So fun!  We had to show them some love.  (Plus, we were recovering from celebrating New Years Eve!)
