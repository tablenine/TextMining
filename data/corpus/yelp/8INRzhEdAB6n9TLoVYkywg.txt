GIANT PANCAKES!. If I could increase the font +72 times, you might understand better.. . Don't be macho. You'll only eat one. I tried all 3, and got through all three, but only if you count cutting down through 1/3 of each in the stack. Which I will. The sweet pancakes (with butterscotch, etc) were teeth-hurtingly sweet and not for me, but I had the all blueberry ones. They were AWESOME (+72 font sizes).. . Also, I loved the french press coffee. Which I wouldn't share (don't pay attention to the fact that my compatriot doesn't drink coffee): thus I also drank all that by myself.. . We waited about 15-20 min outside for a table, hovering over others. The wait was worth it. We got a little table outside and talked to our friendly table neighbors about their food and ours, and had a generally nice time. My only minor complaint was that the street seating occasionally smelled of truck exhaust. But the coffee was strong enough to generally mask it/make me forget my woes.
