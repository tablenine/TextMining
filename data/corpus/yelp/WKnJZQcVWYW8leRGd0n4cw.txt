I havent actually eaten inside the restaurant, we get take out from here at least once a week. The food is good. I normally get the 3 item bento box with cooked stuff then get some rolls on the side. I've tried almost all of their cooked stuff, its standard , nothing special. I like the fact that you can get either the spicy tuna or california roll as one of the items. Seared Ono had an interesting sauce, really salty tangy clear liquid. The spicy scallop roll was soo slimey, I will never get that again, I couldnt even finish eating it. Bleh. The Unagi was good, although my pieces always seemed to have alot of the hairy bones. I dont usually go pick it up, but the one time I did, I got quite the attitude and its also kind pricey. 60 dollars for 2 for lunch. Also when they pack it up, each item gets its own Styrofoam container. Think of the environment! I will have it again next week because I don't pay!
