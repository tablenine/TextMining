Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
The Majestic Diner is your typical greasy spoon, but it is also part of Atlanta history: it's been open since 1929 (and the inside still looks it!).  Some Atlanta-area friends brought me here late one night after a Braves game.  I had a veggie omelet.  The sweet tea was definitely Southern, so that was a plus.  Food is typical for this type of eatery, but the people-watching is better.  Majestic is open 24/7.
