Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
When a friend informed me over a year ago that a noddle and dumpling house was slated to open up near my apartment, I was stoked.  I would stare longingly at any of the possible storefronts along California between Diversey and Belmont for the slightest sign of anything resembling an Asian restaurant.  We obviously sped over as soon as we heard it was opened and saw the first drool-inducing photos posted on LTH forum.. . It was..  not quite what I expected.  I imagined stopping by after work and picking up buckets of noodles and dumplings to take home and devour while watching Project Runway on my couch.  Though Urban Belly does do carry out, the prices suggest that you should probably eat in and enjoy your meal.  The seating was communal, which was kind of nice, but I spent too long staring at other diners' dishes and making them uncomfortable before our own food came.  That, and we'd forgotten wine in our haste to get over there.  The three of us sitting in a line on a bench didn't make for the easiest conversation, but that became irrelevant as soon as the food arrived.  The dumplings and noodles were all divine, but somehow left me wanting more.  The $70 dent it left for a meal for 3, however, prohibited that, and I went away pouting and questioning if delicious lamb and brandy dumplings were truly worth $2.00 each.  . . Better prepared for the sticker shock and BYOB policy, I went back a few weeks later with another friend and a bottle of wine, but after seeing the wait leaking out the door, we got it to go.  The food, while still delish, didn't hold up too well during the 5 minute car ride home..  the dumplings especially, should have been enjoyed hot.  Even so, I'm sure I'll be back soon enough to continue working my way down the menu..  pork belly fried rice, look out, you're next.
