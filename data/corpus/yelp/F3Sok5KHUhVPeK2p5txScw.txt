Really had a great breakfast from here. Got it to go and the staff was uber-friendly and accommodating. . . I had the gouda scramble. It was way good with the perfect amount of everything. Actually, I would have appreciated a lil more basil. . . GF wanted the potatoes. Definitely never had anything like that. They're really wet/creamy and have what tastes like some curry infusion. . . Definitely look forward to coming back.
