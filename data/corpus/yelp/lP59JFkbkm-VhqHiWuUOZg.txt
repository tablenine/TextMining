This was probably the best food I tasted in my three years living in L.A. Granted, I didn't pick up the check (ouch!) but still. An atmosphere like no other, food that is perfectly cooked, perfectly assembled and perfectly served and a wait staff that is readily at your service.  And the wine, my goodness the wine.. . Do yourself a favor when you go, order some scallops.  Just trust me on that one.. . Is it expensive? You betcha.  But when the food's this good, it's worth it -- even if you have to spend a couple paychecks to get it.
