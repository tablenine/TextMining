My dinner at Yamashiro was okay.  Definitely not worth the money spent.  The food was pretty decent.  Our waiter was not very observant.  We had to constantly ask for our drinks to be refilled.  After our meal, he asked if we wanted coffee and when we said no, he turned to get us the bill, when we said we'd like to get dessert.  Hello?  Should have asked, you would have missed out on an extra $20.  We were hungry after our appetizer and entrees so we wanted dessert.  Desserts were small and not worth it.  I would have been happier getting a Mrs. Field's cookie.. . The hostesses, however, were very friendly and attentive.  The view was great.
