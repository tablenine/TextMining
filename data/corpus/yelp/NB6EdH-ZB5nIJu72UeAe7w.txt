Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
c'mon, i've lived in LA for about 10yrs now. and i still cannot figure out the fascination. with PINK'S.  it's the strangest thing to me .... . 1.  stand in line for 1/2hr, or more. 2.  pay $5, or more, for one hot dog. 3.  then sit outdoors on plastic chairs. . my friend from san jose insisted we go,. so for the sake of debunking the hype,. i took her to PINK'S.  when i asked. "how did you like it", she said "i'll. tell you right after i find a bathroom".. . seriously, i can't make this comedy up.. if you are not drunk, i don't get it .... but after the bar, it's perfect! ;)
