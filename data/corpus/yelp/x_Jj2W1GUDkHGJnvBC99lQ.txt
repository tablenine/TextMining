I often have this problem where I desperately want an amazing salad and can't figure out where to go.  Tender Greens solves this problem, at least in Culver City.  Salads are fresh and delicious, although admittedly not enormous for ten bucks, but the meat is well-cooked and high quality.  Fun drinks and sodas too, coupled with classy but casual presentation and atmosphere...I wish I still lived nearby so I could be a regular.  Minus a star because they don't like to let you mix and match salad dressings-- why on earth not?  I made nice to the cashier and he made a "special exception," but it seems like a low cost high return change to make... do you hear me Tender Greens management?  I would also subtract a star for terrible hard bread, but I didn't want bread anyway so they can keep the star...
