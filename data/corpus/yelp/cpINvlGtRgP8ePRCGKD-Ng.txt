Restaurant: Cafe Selmarie
Category: American (Traditional)
Dislike.I waited 15+ minutes for service (standard is 5 minutes or less). Ordered the quiche ($10.50), which was average. While eating my semi-soggy quiche, my water was infrequently filled (I mean, come on, it wasn't busy at all and water was my only drink). Cafe Selmarie is pretty average with moderate (but maybe a wee bit high) prices. It is vegetarian-friendly-ish, however. . . Am I being snobby about the service? Not really. Again, it's standard practice for servers to greet the customer within a few minutes. Granted, this wait was due to miscommunication between the hostess and the server, which was accidental, but also unacceptable.
