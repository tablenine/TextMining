Love the BlueBird.  Really love the Bluebird.  But can't give it 5 stars for some reason.  I think it's because its a bit pricey and their flat breads taste like something coming out of a frozen pizza box.  . . But thats not exactly fair.  They do SO many things right.  Their meat and cheese selection is excellent.  Go for the Merquez sausage.  The olive appetizer is a great way to start off also.  The Octopus salad is amazing.  And i have to stop myself usually from ordering all three German sausages and pretzel roll, because I will eat the whole damn thing and have to be rolled out of their.. . Lets talk drinks.  The beer list is amazing.  Are you kidding me?  Go for the Belgian Gran Cru.  And if its just too perplexing for you, ask the waiter.  They know their stuff (especially Bradley).  That man makes good suggestions.  Tell him what you like typically and let him surprise you.  They don't do the hoity toity cocktails though.  If you want a Mojitio, Caprahina or some other shaken not stirred cocktail, this may not be the place.  The wine list and spirits list is very complete though.  Drink your booze straight an enjoy the taste instead of covering it with fruit juice an more sugar.
