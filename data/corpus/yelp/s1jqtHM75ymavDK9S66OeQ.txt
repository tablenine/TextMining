Restaurant: Feed
Category: American (Traditional)
Feed is a tiny restaurant featuring Southern comfort food like rotisserie-grilled chicken, grits and fried green tomatoes.  It's good, but hardly incredible.. . The place was fairly packed when I arrived on a Friday night.  There are no waiters, you just go up to the counter and order off the chalk menu board.  I had 1/4 chicken (light) with fries and mashed potatoes.  Honestly, the highlight was the fries.  They were crisp without being crunchy or burned.. . The chicken was moist and tender, but I would have loved some sort of barbecue sauce for it.  It was screaming for something extra.  The plate came with tortillas and a tiny cup of salsa.  Not sure what I was supposed to do with that.. . The beverage situation was disappointing.  If you order a soda, things are great.  You can go up to a cooler and grab a fresh 12 oz. can whenever you need a refill.  But I ordered water.  When it came time for a refill, I had to choose between one of two fairly unclean-looking pitchers sitting near the front.  Also, there was no way to get fresh ice, aside from asking for a new cup at the counter.  Lukewarm refill of unfiltered tap water it is!. . Feed isn't bad.  It's pretty good.  But unless you happen to live in the neighborhood, I don't see why you'd make the trip.
