Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
I know, there are tons of reviews, everyone loves Mastro's, blah blah blah.. . But me being the fantastic orator, writer, philanthropist, and all around great guy, I had to put in my 2 cents.. . Me likey the food lots.. . AAAA LOT.. . I'd seriously kill for their bone in filet.. I'd do some serious damage for almost any one of their side dishes.. I'd shoplift for their pretty stiff drinks.. I'd tell you lies for their seafood tower.. . And what makes me really happy are the prices...I never feel guilty for spending my dough there as I think it's usually very worth it.. . Yay for the M.
