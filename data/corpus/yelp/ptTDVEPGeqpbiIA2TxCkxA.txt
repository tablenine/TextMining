So as I've said before, Foodlife is AMAZING! The best deal ever on this side of town. There is one thing that I've realized after today however....make sure that you tell the servers that you're there for the SPECIAL, if not, they WON'T ask, and you'll end up being charged a full meal. I took 3 ppl there for the first time today and EVERYONE of us (including me) had something wrong with our order. I was charged a regular price even though I told each person that I wanted the dinner special. The good thing was that they were pretty good about changing things, only one person ended up screwed since she took the entree sized salad (as a mistake) and was then told that that had to be her entree and that she was only allowed a soup and a cupcake after that. . For everyone else they were gracious and Parker (who's apparently new there) was able to get everything squared away.. All in all, still a wonderful deal, but just be sure to tell them EVERY TIME, that you're there for the DINNER SPECIAL.
