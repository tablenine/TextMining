This is my fave Chicago-style pizza place.  I love how you can sit outside and watch the city go by.  Sure it's touristy, but it's also good.  I love the crust, and how it tastes like it was brushed with olive oil...which it probably is.  Hubby and I share a small.  I've never been able to have more than one slice, although my bottomless pit Marine brother has polished off two.  I would recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago, seeking typical Chicago-style pizza.  Ask to sit outside, eat some good pizza while watching the activity on the street all around you, and drink a cold 312 beer.
