If I still worked in the valley, I'd go to lunch here at least once a week. I'd probably put on about 80lbs and have to waddle over to my table but dear lord, this is a find! . . Logistically, it's odd but good. It's in a strip mall and looks like nothing from the outside. The valet is free. Walk-ins at lunch will probably wait for about 10-20 minutes. The dining room is pretty small but sit wherever, there need not be a concept of good seats when the food steals the limelight. . . The food ... well, I won't blather on because you'll go there. But I will say that it's amazing how their wasabi is almost sweet -- please don't tell me they stir in high fructose corn syrup! I mean, seriously, if you know how or why it has a sweetness I don't want to know. . . And OMG! a glossy, sticky, perfectly supple and slightly crunchy piece of unagi atop a quickly deep fried nugget of warm rice is the kind of high calorie decadence that one will be forgiven for, maybe not by your personal trainer or family doctor, but your deity of choice I'm sure will understand and grant you all the things you're rightly due in the afterlife (or next life) despite this bad, naughty, sinful, gluttonous delight.
