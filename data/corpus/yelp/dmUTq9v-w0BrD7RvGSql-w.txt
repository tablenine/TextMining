Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Oh this place. First of all, there food has enough salt in it to last me 3 years. The dishes are massive and hide what could be a good flavor with a shit-ton of salt. One way to tell when things are fresh is to see how overly salty they are. The food, aside from the salt just isn't that good. I don't understand why people wait forever, end up paying close to $30 a person, when nothing about the cheesecake factory is even worth it. Yes, they do have good Cheesecake, but better can be found elsewhere. Seriously disappointing.
