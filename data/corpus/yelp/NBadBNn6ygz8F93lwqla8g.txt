Restaurant: 5 Seasons Brewing
Category: American (New)
well I have to say I always have been a fan of 5 Seasons. Since I live Dunwoody, I patronize the Sandy Springs location a bunch. I was looking forward to their new location. I have a few issues with this new spot. First is parking. what a cluster. After making my way through the labyrinth to the restaurant, we decided to sit down out side. Our waitress said she would be right back to take our order, well something happened to where we had to get another waitresses attention. We placed our food order quesadillas &amp; fish tacos. Very greasy and with average flavor. The quesadillas had too much cheese which made the whole plate greasy. The shrimp in the tacos were deep fried. The menu itself seemed to be too diverse and all over the place.. My biggest disappointment was the decor. This place has no soul. The dining room chairs were queen ann style and do go with there modern environment. I will still go to the location in Sandy Springs but not this one.
