Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
Good, cheap food anddecent service.  It's open 24 hours and it's great after a show at the Masquerade.  You'll get plenty of food by ordering any dinner meal.  It is a diner and the interior is fairly outdated but as long as you aren't obsessively picky you'll be just fine.. . There's free parking in the lot with the movie theater in it.. . Update - They pretty much completely redesigned and updated the interior... It now has the look of a retro-style diner from the '50s or so... really brightens the place up.
