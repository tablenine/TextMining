Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Named after a castaway on the island of Amchitka, Daikokuya has come to seem as the Island of refuge for hipsters in L.A., they cling to it as did the Captain to the isle. . . As great as the Ramen is at this lovely shop, I would be hard pressed to say it's the best Little Tokyo has to offer. What Daikokuya has to offer in comparison, is "Atmosphere", that great companion to enjoyment. Where as the other Ramen houses have a more modern restaurant visage, Daikokuya has "a cheerfully fake '50s-style" (as Jonathan Gold of LA Weekly put it),that seems authentic, intimate, and with the acceptance of Angelenos and Transplants alike, always brimming with life. Now that's a complete meal!. . But as those of us that live in Little Tokyo know, Where the Transplants seem to not venture, is: . . Mr. Ramen has an excellent Ramen(when the owner is the one making it), and San Sui Tei's Spicy Ramen is divine, And if you should ever get drunk with us locals, at Cosmo's bar, after Joe kicks us out, we will take you for a late night dine at Koraku's for some Mabo Ramen, and you tell me, this doesn't have something to offer.. . Point being, Daikokuya has yet to take title of the houses for this local, But they do serve an excellent Ramen, and will not disappoint.. . P.S. Our dear Captain did finally venture out, and find other islands.
