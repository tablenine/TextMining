this review is based on the ONLY time i've been there, so i don't have extensive experience with the menu by any means. . . we started with the beef carpaccio, which was good but a little too lemony for me, and some deep fried rice ball dish, which was GREAT!. . i ordered the goat cheese and sun dried tomato pizza, which i was very excited for, but was sadly disappointed when it arrived.  where to begin...the pizza is uncut, and while that may be a tradition in italy (or not?) it proved to be a pain in my ass since the pizza is the exact same size as the plate.  also, trying to cut it with the knife appointed to me proved to be a bit difficult without spilling the bag of arugula they dumped on the pizza.  granted, it may be my fault for being lazy, but i don't particularly like preparing my own food at a restaurant unless i'm aware of it ahead of time. there was also hardly any goat cheese on the pizza, which was seriously overwhelmed by the arugula.. . the room looks great and the staff was friendly.  the only other issue was our main dishes coming out TOO fast, practically right after our appetizers arrived. . . so/so experience first time but definitely worth another shot.
