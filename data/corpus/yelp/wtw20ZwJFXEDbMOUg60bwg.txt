Had a REALLY nice time tonight at Bluebird!  We were going to go to Hot Chocolate and saw some tables available at Bluebird and figured we'd pop in there instead... we live around the corner and it seems to be really busy most other days... . . Small food menu and HUGE beer/wine list.  Beer was good, food was good and service was really laid back and super warm and friendly.  So glad we finally gave Bluebird a shot, we'll be back, for sure!  Loved the interior, cozy and comfy.
