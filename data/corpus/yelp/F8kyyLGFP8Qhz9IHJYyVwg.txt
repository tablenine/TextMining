I haven't been to many fine dining places because I find that I am easily let down by all the hype and cannot justify dropping that much cash on dinner. But my boyfriend took me to Spring for my birthday last week and I have to say that it surpassed all my expectations and didn't let me down at all! The food was so great and the service too. We started with a butternut squash won ton and a shortrib dumpling which I thought would be too similar but were actually quite different and delicious. We also had the lemongrass soup which I never thought I would like but was out of this world! I think that was the highlight of the meal. Also, we had the black cod and then scallops. Ehhhh The cod was pretty good and my boyfriend said the scallops were good but I am not a big scallop fan. We had some apple dessert which was great too. The brought out this gelatin thing with a candle in it for my birthday which I thought was a bit odd but appreciated the thought none the less. I forgot the drinks. I can't remember what my boyfriend had but I had some tea infusion cocktail with pine nuts in it..delish! . . Overall, Â a good dining experience but probably will save this place for special occasions.
