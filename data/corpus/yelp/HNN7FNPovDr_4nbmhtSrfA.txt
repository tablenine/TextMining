This place is super noisy since the marble floors does nothing to suppress the conversations around the restaurant, but if you can stand the noise level then stay for some great Italian dishes. . . My favorite is the pizza... guess the fortune they spent on the pizza oven was well worth it since the crust comes out perfectly thin and crispy.
