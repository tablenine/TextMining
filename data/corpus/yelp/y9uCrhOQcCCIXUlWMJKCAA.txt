Restaurant: Trader Vic&#39;s
Category: Hawaiian
The only place other than my house that I've been to in this city that mixes a real Mai-Tai, of course Vic claims to have invented the Mai-Tai.. . This company takes pride in its' cocktails.  Their bar isn't like many that are all about high volumes of register receipts and mediocre quality. . . If you want to make real Mai-Tai's at home you'll need orgeat syrup which is almost impossible to find, but luckily Trader Vic's sells it. on-site.. . I like the lounge atmosphere, island drinks and appetizers.  The entrees are a bit pricey, but part of what your paying for is the tacky Tiki island decor and the exotica / slack-key Hawaiian guitar environmental music.. . I really like this place.  It's both relaxing and a bit campy with all the Tiki kitsch, which is a great combo.
