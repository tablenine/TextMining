Last time I was here, I tried the short ribs again and thought they were really fatty this time.  Not quite as enjoyable as the first time.  Maybe the novelty is fading, I don't know, but this place just didn't have the same coolness factor it did the first couple of times.  Maybe it was just a less choice piece of meat they served me, but in the future I'm sure I could find someplace else to try where the food wouldn't be so unpredictable.
