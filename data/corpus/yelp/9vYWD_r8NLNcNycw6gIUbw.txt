We went to Fat Cat for the first time last night and my boyfriend and I loved it!. We were meeting up with some friends and we got there a little early so we took a seat at the bar. The bartender makes a darn good martini! The manager came over and introduced himself and bought us a shot. Gotta love that.. I love getting rockstar treatment when I am out! ;). The door man was also outstanding with the rockstar treatment.. . The drinks were great. The food was great too.. My only complaint is our waitress. She wasn't horrible but she wasn't as great as the rest of the staff. . Service was a bit slow.. . She also never returned with my *doggie* bag. Which, now in retrospect, I should have said something about it. Oh well.. . I will go back though! I will go back a lot!
