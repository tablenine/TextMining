Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Father's Office has been getting rave reviews for the past year, and has now expanded to two locations.   Its known for its excellent booze selection - but it kind of surprised me.  Instead of being a high-end burger restaurant with a  nice drink list, it's more or less a bar with some food items on the side.  Good food items, for sure, but the food doesn't seem to be the important thing here.  Their menu is 5-6 pages of alcohol, and one half-page of food at the back.. . The ambiance is great. Broken Social Scene over the speakers (nice), sleek, modern wood furnishings, tons of bar taps, clean, well lit, just a very pleasant place to hang out in.    You have to order everything from the bar, which makes for a less-crowded space (no waiters), but it means you have to jam through drinkers to order food, which kind of sucks.  It would be nice if they had a dedicated spot for ordering food, or something to alleviate this issue.. . Sadly, this was just a stop through, but the Father's Burger is indeed worthy of the hype.  This is a tasty, tasty burger.  I'm not positive, but it seems like a hunk of sirloin steak, caramelized onions and a deep, rich smoky sauce which keeps them together.  It's big, and comes with a heaping pile of teeny-tiny cut fries, but honestly, I can't remember a burger which had that sort of flavor.  . . I can't believe I didn't order the pork belly as well.  What the hell was I thinking.. .
