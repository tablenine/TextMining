I came here just before going to Yelp's event at the Drury Lane.  It was my first time there and it's definitely  a step up from the typical food court.  This place is an odd combination of cafeteria + food court upscaled.. Walking in, you're handed a card for you to charge your meal on.  No rush juggling your food and your wallet, just pay the balance on the way out.  There are a lot of choices from the healthy salads section, an all soups stand (I want to go back for the unlimited soup bowl), italian, mexican, etc etc.  I ended up with the chicken pot pie meal which was a delicious chicken stew and biscuits.  You can also get yourself some cheap wine if you're a boozehound like me.
