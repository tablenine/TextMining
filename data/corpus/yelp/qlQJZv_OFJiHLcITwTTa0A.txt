yum.  i guess.. . wait, i forgot about the fries for a sec with the garlic aoli.  yum for sure. . .  (but can we make a new word for aoli?  i feel embarassed by this word for some reason. ummm.... nevermind.). . my roommates and i were lookin for a cheap eats spot to dinner together.  we tossed around the names of neighborhood regulars and then a lightbulb appeared over naomi's head and she said OINKSTERS! . . and it was so.. . its a cute spot- very la kitsch, diner on wheels kind of vibe.  but it is my understanding that the ingredients are above the line in terms of quality, something about gourmet ice cream in the milkshakes and the iced teas are from intelligentsia.. . i cannot vouch for the pastrami.  i had a burgr which was suprisingly good.  i felt like it was cooked very specifically for me.  there were whispers about russian dressing on the burger- i cannot speak to this. if it was there, my burger ate it before i did.. . also we all shared a carrot cake cupcake which was yum-i-fied although had it been my pick i would have gone with the pb and j, because, that is the right thing for a cupcake to be.  . . i have curiosity about the pulled pork and the cabbage slaw.  i guess the pastrami too but i think i dont really eat pastrami- too... cured?  not sure.. . i take away 2 stars for the screaming beer spilling football fans who drowned out our conversation with their screams in response to happenings on the two big scream tv's on the walls of the oink.  also it felt a little fast foody cold inside.  . . the oinkster could use a glam-over but everything we ate (the roomies had veggie burgers and fries) was good.. . unless i decide to love pastrami really bad or if i had only $8 to eat, im not sure i would race back but i would definitely walk at a brisk-ish pace.
