What a cute name for a brunch place. I went on a weekend visit to ATL based on rave reviews everywhere.  I love brunch and am always excited to check out new brunch places.  As expected, I waited about an hour to get seated (got coffee at Caribou across the street).  The place has a very casual ambience (bright plastic tablecloths and all) and is very packed &amp; noisy.. . I have to say I was disappointed relative to my expectations.  I got the clifton omelette (goat cheese &amp; mushrooms). It came w/ grits &amp; a biscuit.  The grits were good, the biscuit was OK (on the drier side - surprising considering it was the namesake) and the eggs were ok as well.  Maybe I should have gotten the french toast?  . . All in all, decent place, but not worth going out of your way.
