Restaurant: Strip House Steak House
Category: Steakhouses
Strip House's gem is the black truffle creamed spinach. Hands down the BEST steak side I've ever had, let alone the best creamed spinach I've ever had. This dish could've gone wrong in so many ways, but went so right! The Truffle oil to cream to spinach ratio is perfection. . . The steak here is good and each cut comes with its own bulb of roasted garlic. I wouldn't say the steak is as tender, juicy and delicious as Wolfgang's or Peter Lugar's (No sizzling plate!) but is pretty damn close. My favorite cut here is the bone-in filet mignon. Â Beware of the Strip Steak-- it was a bit saltier and much less tender than the Filet.. . For b-day celebrations, tell the waiter in advance what the birthday person's name is and what dessert you want to order at the end. Your birthday guest will be wow'ed since they bring out your dessert of choice complete with a lit candle and a cute, chocolate "Happy Birthday [name here]" message written on the plate. :-) I picked the 12-layer chocolate cake and as the other reviews confirm-- it's gargantuan, moist, and has just the right level of sweetness.. . As for ambiance, I prefer Strip House over Peter Lugar's and Wolfgang's. Feels way less crowded and crazy since the tables are much more spread apart and the wait staff is uber attentive and kind. Overall a great experience!
