Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I think Flo has a pretty great brunch menu, unfortunately I don't think they are very sensitive to vegetarians. . . I specifically asked if the green chile sauce had chicken in it and I was told that it did not. So, I ordered a dish with the green sauce and it was delicious. Unfortunately, about 3/4 of the way through brunch, I started to question my waiter's answer, and when I asked again if the sauce was made with "chicken stock," I was told that it is. . . I definitely blame myself for not being more specific in my request before ordering, but I do question restaurants who aren't sensitive to questions regarding dietary restrictions. . . I just wanted to write so that other vegetarians know that the green chile sauce does definitely have chicken in it.. . I still think that the food is good, the prices are fair, the ambiance is comfortable and I would certainly recommend it to friends.
