Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
Yum-e! This place is as adorable as Papa himself! We love to take my Greek in-laws to this place for a quick bite when they're in town. . . Maybe once every six weeks the hubby and I take a jaunt down here to restock on our Greek staples ... the yogurt, the olives, the cheese, the pita, and the tzatziki. It's the best Greek market that we've found in the area. The service is friendly and the selection is more than adequate. . . Don't be daunted by the parking situation either ... There is an ample lot in the back (they even offer valet for busy times) and an entry door from that lot that seems fair game for welcoming their visitors.
