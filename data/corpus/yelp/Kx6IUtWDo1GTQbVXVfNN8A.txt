Wow the buisness owner read my review and wrote her explanation for my critique, lol! Thank you Alyssa for your reasoning. . . Hi Ren,. . Thank you for writing us a great review on Yelp.  Traditionally, soup and rice are served at the end of the meal and I'm a suprised that your server didn't ask if you'd like any.  I will speak to all the servers this weekend to ensure that this doesn't happen again.. Our parking lot gets very full on Fri/Sat and we need the valet guys to manage to squeeze 30-50 cars in that tiny lot.  I wish that we didn't have to use their service as its very expensive!. Anyways, I'm happy to hear that you enjoyed the food at Soowon.  Please don't hesitate to let me know if there was anything else we could have done to better your experience.  . Have a great day!. . -Alyssa Min Lim
