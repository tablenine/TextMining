update: 10.09.07. so i tried their food.. the sloppy joe tasted like chili. Â it came with lettuce, tomato, grilled bell peppers, and cheese.... . the mac n cheese balls tasted like jalapeno poppers without the jalapeno.. . so overall, the food was Ok.. my bossa nova waffle sundae was disappointing today. the waffle was way(!) too crispy and hard. usually the waffle is soft and mushy. . -------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------. i havent tried their food but... . they get 5 stars for their bossa noval waffle sundae.. its a waffle with homemade vanilla bean ice creme, dulce de leche,. and whipped creme (from a can it seems)! . . if it was homemade whipped creme (like the one from mastros) it would be even better. . but none the less... both times i ordered their latte, it came a little hotter than lukewarm. not good.!. . it was still really YUM!
