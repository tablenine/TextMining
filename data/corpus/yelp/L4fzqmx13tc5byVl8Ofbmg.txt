Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Simply put -- there isn't an item on the menu that will let you down but their Saio Lung Bai (small steamed dumplings) and Fried Rice (you heard me, fired rice) are must-have's!. . I've been to their locations in Taipei (that's where they're from), Hong Kong (that's where I am from) and Shanghai (that's where my grandparents are from) and I am just glad that this gem finally made it to the States.. . If you are in the LA area, do yourself a favor and visit this place. Plan plenty of time as they do not take reservations and you'll be sure to wait for at least 20-30 minutes.
