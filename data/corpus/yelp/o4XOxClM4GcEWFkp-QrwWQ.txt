My boyfriend has been eating at this place since it opened and it had become a favorite of mine after he introduced me. The original chicken plate is to die for and so is the Margherita pizza. Always open late and crowded. We both have met the owner and he recognizes us when we come in, that's how much we have eaten there. For a long time we ordered the caprese salad to be delivered to our house. No problem until this year. We ordered a salad and they refused to deliver it to us. We have always tipped well because we know it's a small order. We were confused and told the woman on the phone they always have delivered to us. They keep your credit card on file and can look up food you have ordered in the past. She did, told us we had never ordered that dish for delivery and said we were liars. She was VERY rude and we were trying to be nice, but she was very snitty from the start. After she called us liars for  no reason for the 3rd time I jumped in my car and went to Bossa Nova to see if the owner was there. We got there and she still proceeded to treat us badly, call us liars and tell us we had never ordered that dish. It's something I could have dropped, but  you shouldn't call people liars and I wanted to see if the owner was there but they said he was home for the evening. to bad, he's a nice guy and has great food. She could barley speak english and was running the place! It's bad business for them to have someone call their customers liars. She got customers involved and co-workers treating us like we were crazy and we wanted an apology for being called liars is all. We have eaten there once since then and I cannot enjoy it anymore. Used to be my favorite place to eat in L.A., not anymore.
