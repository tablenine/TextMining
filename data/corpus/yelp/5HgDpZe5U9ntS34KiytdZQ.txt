Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Overall we really like the food and ambiance at Ugo.  The lasagna is always tasty and the chopped salad, my favorite, is fresh and tasty.  Over the last few months the service has become slow even at getting the simplest items like a diet coke with a lime wedge.  Today a friend ordered Linguini with clams which should have been a safe choice.  However, the pasta was drenched in a bath of olive oil and too rich for my friend to eat.  When it comes to dressings and in particular olive oil, less is better as one can always ad more.  Like any restaurant, not every dish will be perfect and some will be duds.  Watch out for the olive oil on the pasta - avoid it!
