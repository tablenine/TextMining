A mediocre thai restaurant, has the standard menu items.  The place didn't make a real impress with me or gave me a favor dish.  They're open later than most and is great for that late supper.. Some seafood dishes are too fishy tasting, not fresh.  Sorry I can't be too excited about the place, but it just didn't make an impression.  Only can say I've been there.  And if I had to eat there again, it'll be okay.
