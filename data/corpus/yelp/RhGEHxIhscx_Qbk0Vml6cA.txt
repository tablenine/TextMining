Ok I'm going to base my review on the foods there and not the fact that parking is a pain...then again...it's LA...what else would it be.. . I LOVE going here to dessert.  They recently just raised their $5 price on sundaes and milkshakes to individual prices ranging from $5-$7.  They have so many things to choose from. I like getting The Blondie sundae which has pecans, vanilla ice cream, a fresh blondie brownie, whipped cream and butterscotch. YUM! They even have home made bon bons there! Their strawberry shortcake milkshake is delish. If you're looking for something to take home they have jars of homemade caramel and to the right side of the registers is a whole display of desserts.. . It can be busy at time but whether it's hot or cold outside their desserts hit the spot.
