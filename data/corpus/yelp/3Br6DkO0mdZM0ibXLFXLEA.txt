Although I don't make it to Spoon nearly as often as I'd like to (once or twice a year in three years of Atlanta living), I've found it to be one of the most consistently excellent dining experiences in the ATL. The food selection is satisfactory, the service wonderful (On my most recent trip, after putting an automatic gratuity on our large party's tab, the receipt was marked so we couldn't accidentally tip more. I did anyway on principal because I so appreciated the honesty.) and the wine selection is appropriate as well. The Masaman Curry and Ginger Stir Fry come highly recommended from this guy.
