Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
My prejudice for LA Korean restaurants has always been that while they offer delicious authentic food, they lack in quality department. The only Korean BBQ restaurant in LA that really impressed me in quality to this day, is Chosun Galbi. After seeing all these positive feedbacks, I decided to give this place a try for lunch on last friday since my gf has been craving korean BBQ for the longest time. When I stepped into the place, I immediately noticed the place was a lot cleaner than average korean restaurants, with interior design that didn't appear too flashy but worked just fine. We both ordered Soowon Wang Galbi(marinated korean BBQ) that cost me about 26 dollars/person. I was impressed with the quality of the meat as well as generous serving size. We had 3 very friendly waitress ladies giving us full attention and prompt service(since no one was there around that time). The only thing that I didn't like was, as others already mentioned, we couldn't really take our sweet time enjoying the food because those waitresses were standing by the table the whole time and cooked for us(constantly dumping meats on our plate so they don't get burned). I guess we could've told them we wanted to cook. . . PRO: Best quality, reasonable price, great service. CON: Don't let them cook for you if you want to enjoy your meal
