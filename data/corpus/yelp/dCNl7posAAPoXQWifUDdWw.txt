Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
I had never been to Chicago before so when I finally did decide to visit, I asked for a bunch of suggestions from friends and co-workers on good places to eat.  Weiner's Circle was one of their picks and it is indeed yummy.. . I'd been forewarned that they would yell at me but it was all in good fun. The girl who took my order was icy at first but then we started talking and looking through a JET magazine she was reading.  I went around midnight on a Thursday so maybe that's why I didn't get the "full act." Weekends are supposedly crazy busy.. . So onto the food. I ordered a spicy polish dog with grilled onions, mustard, and pickles. I could feel the food coma approaching as I downed it but yummm....I was tempted to get the cheese fries too (I hear they are very tasty) but resisted. I didn't want my heart to spontaneously combust from all the greasy goodness.. . Probably not the best thing to eat everyday unless you want to be a complete heffer but good for those late nights out.
