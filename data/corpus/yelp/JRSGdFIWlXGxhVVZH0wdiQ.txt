Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I may only come here once a year and/or whenever it's most convenient (when I'm in the area AND the line isn't so damn long) but I'm always down for a trip to Pink's. Pink's is essentially the LA equivalent to Ben's Chili Bowl in DC, both are hot dog institutions in their respective cities... so you can't help but try 'em out. . . The parking can be a nightmare and it can be quite a wait so it might or might not be worth it. But if you manage to endure it all, seating isn't bad. There's usually some available since people are always filing in and out. . . The menu's fairly extensive. They seemingly have combined anything and everything that could and would go well on a hot dog. I guess that long wait helps you decide what to get. I always love getting the chili cheese dog with fries. Always hits the spot.. . Also, beware of parking behind Pink's if you have a car with low suspension. The curb is so high that you might need to climb out of the passenger side window if you don't let whoever's sitting shotgun out of the car first before parallel parking. That's what I had to do once.
