Love it - we go here for lunch when we're feeling extravagant!  The variety of sauces are delicious and the portions are so generous.  I never eat the entire meal - I always take the leftovers home to my husband.  Even the salads are good: huge salad with heaping mountain of delicious meat.  Definitely get the platter and try the sides - they're just as good!. . I really like the atmosphere as well - down home without feeling dirty or sketchy, as sometimes happens with hole-in-the-wall places.  And they're good for groups, since we've had more than one team lunch here.
