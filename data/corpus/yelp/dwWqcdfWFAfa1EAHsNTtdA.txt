Something about these trendy Hollywood brunch places just never rub me the right way.... Granted, the food is not that bad and the prices were decent, but to the likes of Toast, Doughboy, etc., I just feel the quality of food is not exceptional.  . I ordered the Chopped Salad with Green Godess Dressing...wow, my salad was DRENCHED in dressing...there was more dressing than actual lettuce!  It was so much the dressing made a pool at the bottom of my bowl.  The salad would have been awesome if I wasn't swimming in greeness, but that completely ruined my salad to where I had to toss it.  . I did try the sandwiches my friends ordered and they were pretty good, thus the 3 star rating.  . But I hope they ease up on the dressing before someone dies from a clogged artery.  . . Must haves: asking them to go easy on the salad dressing...or better yet, get it on the side.
