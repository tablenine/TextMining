I was taking a friend to dinner at Rathbun's last night, and decided a stop in at Krog Bar for a drink and a snack beforehand would be fun.. . After an amazing trip to Spain in 2006, I really took a liking to a few Spanish specialties, and luckily Krog Bar delivers. . . They've got a few bottles of Cava on the menu to choose from, so we started with a nice refreshing bottle of one whose name escapes me, along with some marcona almonds (to die for) and a cheese tasting plate.. . The service was friendly, chatty and helpful. The only complaint was that the air conditioning was out that day, and it was pretty miserably hot in there, but I don't think they can really be faulted for that.. . All in all -- great selection of gourmet tastiness, good wine selection, and a neat, well-designed environment. It's not cheap, but the quality of what you get makes up for it. Don't let the word "Bar" in its name make you think you're stumbling into a Taco Mac.
