Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
My dude and I had a hankering for Chinese and an even stronger hankering for not leaving the warmth of my abode, so I went to Grubhub to see who was delivering in my area. Friendship Chinese seemed to be a popular choice on the site so I ordered the Creamy Crab Rangoon, General Tso's Chicken and the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce. For damn-near $50 (including tip) I should have been doing back flips of joy but I really wasn't all that impressed. It wasn't bad it just didn't rock my world. Maybe if we would have chosen one of their signature dishes like the Champagne Lemon Chicken or the Honey Walnut Shrimp, that could have been how Friendship distinguishes itself from other Chinese restaurants. I would have been happier ordering from my old standby-- China Fast Wok.
