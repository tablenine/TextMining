Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
It's fun finding the trucks! I had the cheesy pork mac melt, tater tots and their tomato soup.  I have taken a bite of their provolone and roast beef sammie and that was yummie.  For me, the food was so comforting and especially helped during the cold el nino weather that we've been having here in so cal.
