Restaurant: DBA Barbecue
Category: Southern
On our casual tour of BBQ places around the ATL we hit this one on Father's Day. It was my first time there, though in the past we've frequented San Francisco Coffee in the same complex. The brief: ribs were cooked quite well, though the dry run was lacking (of all things) salt. The merest sprinkle of salt onto this beautiful rack woke them wayyy up.. . Their sauces? Keep'em. If we go again, I might sneak in my own sauce.. . My take on DBA so far is that it is adequate BBQ, but no competition for old pros like Sam Huff, Fox Bros, Fat Matts and the gang. Hell, I'd even throw Dreamland in there, as corporate as they are, just for the sauce (which is the dreamiest portion of the meal).
