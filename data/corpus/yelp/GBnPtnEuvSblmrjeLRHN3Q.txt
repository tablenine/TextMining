The Pulled Pork Sandwich is A-Mazing!! really really good. I think I can go and eat 2 or 3 of those, oh SO GOOD! I was able to try the ribs too. Good, but a little dry, but I think its just because they were smoked. Good, but I'm more of a Carson's rib fan I guess. The sauces are great and offer a nice twist to the traditional BBQ. Our server wasn't the greatest, didn't seem to care that she had tables to attend to, but I won't knock it. It was still good and the outdoor seating is pretty large.
