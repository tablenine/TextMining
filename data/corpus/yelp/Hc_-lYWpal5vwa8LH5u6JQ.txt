I can't decide if I really like this place or not. Location is excellent, no doubt about it. Drinks are expensive but tasty and almost "alluring" to look at. I tried the monkfish... and I must say, I'm a little disappointed. Maybe I expected too much after reading the reviews here. This is probably a good place to dine with a friend or go on a casual date. But fancy? Far from it. This place is not what I would consider "upscale dining." I give it 4 stars because I think it's a decent place and I'm a nice person. I like to give good reviews, unless the place really sucks.
