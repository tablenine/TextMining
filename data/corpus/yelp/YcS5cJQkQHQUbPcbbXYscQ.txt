Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
Edit 12/3/06. Way to go pops with the new downtown location because after tonight's visit I am obsessed! . . I loved it from the minute my friend and I entered the lounge and I couldn't figure out exactly why. Then I realized that I felt young again! There weren't any drunk 22 yr olds falling all over each other at this lounge, but a fabulous looking crowd in their late 20s to early 30s. My friend nailed it on the head when she described the new Pops for Champagne as The Red Headed Piano bar for people our age! . . We were lucky enough to get a table in this crowded lounge (apparently word is out that this is the place to be). I was eying the cheese and fruit plates as waiters carried them by, but after a filling meal at Feast I decided to stick with a glass of champagne. The champagne wasn't anything special, but then again it was one of the cheapest glasses on the menu and I don't know my champagnes well enough to know the difference.  . . After enjoying our champagne and some people watching (fabulous crowd) we headed downstairs to check out this jazz club that I've been so much about. There weren't many people down there so the waiter offered us a table (usually there is a $10 cover on the weekdays and $15 cover on the weekends).  We declined because we were getting tired (champagne makes me sleepy), but I'll definitely be back for some jazz and of course more bubbly!
