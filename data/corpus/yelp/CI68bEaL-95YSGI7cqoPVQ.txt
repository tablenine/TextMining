I tried the potato balls for the first time a couple weeks ago.  Tasty!  A combination of meat and potato.... and fried... that is no way it can go wrong.  It tastes good fresh, and it tastes good if you microwave it for 30 seconds or so.  For sweet, I like the Guava cheese strudel.  It goes really well with warm coffee.  . . I think parking is a little tough, but it is not impossible if you are willing to walk a little.
