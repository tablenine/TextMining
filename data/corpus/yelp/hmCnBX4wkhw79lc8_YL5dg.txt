I think it's funny that my L.A. folks gave me a funny look when I mentioned going to this place.  Not because I wanted them to eat multiple pounds of boiled crawfish, but because it was in Alhambra??  They were basically like, do you know where that is?  I said of course I don't, but I spent all of my time in L.A sitting behind the wheel of a car, so what's the difference?  Give me a map, shut up, and let's go!. . I've been on the West Coast for 3 years now but I'm originally from Texas and Louisiana.  In the sourth, during hot su \mmer days, family and friends would gather in the backyard, round up a extra large big metal pot, throw in some crawfish (alive of course), potatoes, corn, and spicy seasonings.  Beers would be downed.  Good conversation would be had.  And then when everything was cooked, we'd lay down the newspaper and commence to peeling those crawfish and sucking the juices... Thanks Boiling Crab for giving me a wonderful and similar (albeit California-nized) version of this Southern experience.  . . Go with the shebang crawfish -- cajun seasonings, butter, garlic, and lemon pepper.   So much flavor!!  Even the mild is spicy, so beware.  Get lots of corn and sausage (which I absolutely loved...maybe a bit more than the crawfish).  The cajun fries were really tasty too....I guess I would have tried the entire menu if my stomach would have let me.   Be prepared for a wait.  We got there at 8pm on a Sunday night and was told the wait would be an hour an half.  Needless to say we got it to go and asked for some butcher paper to take with us!. . Anyways, I'm usually a complete snob with regards to all things Southern on the West Coast.  But I recommend this place.  They done good.
