Every visit to this lively izakaya makes my day. I often wait 30+ minutes for a table, but once I sit down, it's party time from there. I cannot get enough of their small plates!. . My Favorites:. * Hanpen cheese (fish cake stuffed with cheese then deep fried). * Teba saki fried chicken wings (mildly spicy, crispy, salty, and lip smacking tasty). * Sauteed enoki with scallops in butter. * Yaki onigiri (grilled rice balls). . However, beware of their yakitori set. The good deal called my name plus the set included a variety of skewers, yet the results were dry, tasteless, chewy meats on a stick. No thanks. Â . . Oftentimes, it's so crowded that the staff forgets items we ordered, too.. . Despite the highs and the lows, I highly recommend this izakaya. I love their hanpen cheese!
