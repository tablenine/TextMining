nom nom nom nom nom. what else is there to say?. limited seating gives way to a fun community face-stuffing, please-pass-the-hot-peppers mealtime experience. i don't mind it...then again, i've somehow gotten lucky every visit to get a seat.. service is speedy, but there have been a couple visits where i thought they could have kept us waiting just a minute longer, as the pizza seemed a l'il on the undercooked side...but when it's good, it's very, very good. the folks manning the counter have always been sweet and friendly--i've never been led to believe the popularity might be getting to their heads.. . and the cannolis didn't stand a chance--we got them 'to go', but they were gone before we started the car! mmmmmmmm. cannoli.. . these days, when i'm with enough folks to warrant a whole-pie kind of pizza night, antico has become my go-to. yum.
