I am a big fan for several reasons: 1) Food was good- we listened to our server and did quite well. The eggplant was heavenly, the black cod was delicious. Everything we had was pretty darn tasty. 2) we stayed for 3 hours and never once was rushed or looked at with the "please leave soon" vibe. Such a nice feeling. And we had a cushy booth. 3) our waiter was phenomenal. Adorable too. One reason to dock it though- red toilet paper in the bathroom- I mean, seriously? Red? It was weird. And I totally saw some poor tragic girl walk out of the bathroom with it attached to her shoe, but the crowd swallowed her up before I could tell her. So sad.
