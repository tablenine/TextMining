I love this place! It gets really messy...but who cares?! You wear a bib..and have lots of paper towels to clean up your mess.. I had crawfish, dungeness crab and spicy fries! It was really good.. The crawfish had NO meat...but I guess it's for juice you get to suck on.... The crab was the best~ get that...if you're going to drive all the way there!. PS...Don't wear anything white or nice....it'll get crab juice all over it!
