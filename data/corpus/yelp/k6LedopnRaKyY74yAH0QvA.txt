Had a quick lunch here today (St. Patty's Day), and I had the corned beef and cabbage "Burger of Today", as well as the Irish car bomb milkshake. . . Everything was quite good, not too much to add to my last review. It was much less crowded at 11:45AM on a Tuesday, which I guess is nice. . . Now that the new restaurant smell as subsided, I am not as ecstatic about this place. It's just too expensive. One burger + fries + shake was plenty to fill me up, but it was $24 with tax and tip. I think a fair price would be closer to 2/3 of that.
