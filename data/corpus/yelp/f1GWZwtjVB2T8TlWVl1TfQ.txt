Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
OK, everybody knows this place ain't great. It's not even REAL Mexican food to be honest. But there's something comforting about this food--kind of like the gringo Mexican food mom used to make. When I do decide to go to Tito's and brave the long, disorganized lines at the walk-up windows, trying not to feel guilty about the sheer volume of paper waste that this place contributes to the local landfill, I rarely get the tacos. I prefer the meat burrito. Sometimes the meat can be chewy, but it's stewed in this wonderful clove-flavored colorado sauce. Wait about 5 mins before biting into it, otherwise you'll get a nasty roof-burn-- At the very least, the food is served piping hot--more than can be said about any number of other LA Mexican sit-down restaurants (hot plate/cold food?) if you know what I mean...
