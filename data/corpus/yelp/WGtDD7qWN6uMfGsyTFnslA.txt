Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
While I believe the food is a tad pricey for sushi that other establishments make the same if not better, the decor and atmosphere of Geisha House is extremely relaxing and sets a good mood for the evening spent within. The music was great and our table was set near the DJ which added an extra fun spark to the night.
