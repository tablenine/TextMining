Restaurant: Desta Ethiopian Kitchen
Category: Ethiopian
I recently tried Desta Ethiopian restaurant with Daniel B. at a UYE. I ordered the prime rib eye steak, with a side salad. The food was stellar. It was perfectly seasoned, wonderfully cooked, and a good portion size. The prices were great, as my meal only cost 12 dollars. And our service was great. Our waitress was exemplary, and was wonderful in offering her recommendations and descriptions of the dishes. The dessert was also pretty a-ok as well!. . The only thing that I have to complain about is that I'm just not sure I'm down with the whole eating everything with your fingers method...including the salad. You could eat the baclava with a fork though. That was good.
