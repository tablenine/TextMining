Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
When I decide to indulge I indulge all the way.... That's why I was thrilled when my friend suggested to have breakfast at Toast before our blissful massage almost next door at Lincoln Park Massage Spa. What better way to start off the day?!?. I should always take my friend with me every time I go out because she's a perfect parking spot magnet. Sure enough we parked just in front of the restaurant and headed inside for some much needed coffee. Then the dreaded choice time arrived. See we want to indulge but without taking in the calories.....which is as rational as logic gets with girls and food. Yeah...we are lovely like that and it is fine, believe me. . We decided to do the only smart move in such a situation: split. You don't eat as much, you don't feel too guilty because someone else is sinning with you AND you get satisfied. Hehehe..... We shared the Tijuana omelette which was really tasty and deliciously spicy: jalepeno peppers, tomato dices, cilantro, green onion and great chihuahua cheese. But at $9 without sides I thought it was pretty steep. The real indulgence came with the sweet part of the meal: three big and fluffy pancakes whipped with mascarpone, topped with stawberries, orange segments and zests, pine nuts and drizzled with honey and lavender...mmmmm....the combination was as delicious as it sounds - but just a tiny bit on the dry side. We gulped them down in no time though so obviously that wasn't a big downer.. The place is really small and was quite full even on a Thursday morning. But service was diligent and right on queue every time (every 34 times) I needed coffee. I don't think I would fight the crowd during the weekend...or maybe in the summer. There is the lovely cutey Oz Park just across the street to make the wait sweeter!
