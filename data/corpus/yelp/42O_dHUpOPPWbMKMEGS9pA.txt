I'm a bit conflicted by my experience here. While the pizza was amazing, the rest of the meal was only ok. We went for brunch on saturday, right at 11, when they start making pizza, phew. i had the french toast, which was made with healthy bread. meh. needed lots of syrup, and the menu said it came w/ a berry compote, but mine was lacking. mom had a chopped salad that had the most sour dressing ever. dad had the eggs benedict, and he wasn't completely stoked since he's not too into collards (don't worry, i ate them all). we all shared the margherita pizza, which was really great. their marinara was so flavorful. . . so overall, the pizza was worth the trip. also there were so many servers/waiters, it was easy to flag any of them down. they were all very helpful. have to say the rest of the food was only ok. maybe we just ordered wrong? but 3 wrong dishes out of 4? hmmm.
