I've never seen so many Asian people in a semi-American chain restaurant! Haha, no just kidding. But seriously, this place is a bit overrated. Though the seasonings used on all their seafood items taste and smell deliciously good, I don't think it's worth such a long wait. But, I am glad to have finally experienced this place after a number of recommendations from friends. . . A few friends and I dug into two pounds each of the cajun shrimp and crawfish, a basket of fried oysters, fish sticks and seasoned fries and had a blast. It was funny to wear a bib when you're a grown up, but that was fun, too! . . This place does not offer any utensils, so it can get messy. They had a roll of paper towel on the table (in case you drool before your meal), which reminded me of dining at 'Hooters' when you have their chicken wings. . . So overall, the food was good and tasty. But, I would probably only go back if there is no wait in line. 4 stars!
