"Dude, bro, this place is sweet.". . That is what I was imagining every single guy at this bar was saying. Probably because this bar reminds me of all the frat bars where I went to college. For some reason all my friends on the west side seem to think the place is awesome though. . . I have no idea why. Personally, I think they just like to say the alliteratively stupid name.
