i think i came here opening night way back when, and of course, it was packed.  i had never gone to the one in taiwan up to this point, and i was excited, since the place was so hyped up.  the dumplings here beat the ones in shanghai by a mile.  however, my fave thing to eat here is actually their fried rice w/ a fried pork chop.  it tastes just like the ones in taiwan.  . . the standards here are very high, and since it's chain, you can go to any location, and the food would taste the same.  a couple yrs ago, i finally had the chance to go to the one in taiwan, and it was great.  there is a reason why japanese tour buses make a pit stop at the taiwan location...it is that good.  if you don't get in by 1130 on a weekday for lunch, forget it.  . . i wish they would open one in the bay area.
