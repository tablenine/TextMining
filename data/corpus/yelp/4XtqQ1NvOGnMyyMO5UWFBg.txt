Restaurant: Twisted Taco
Category: Mexican
I'm a big fan of Twisted Taco. I like the relaxed atmosphere, the large patio and the lively scene. The tacos are tasty too. . . Bring on the margaritas and decently prices beer - this is one of the better spots for chillin' in Midtown with fun people and little pretentiousness. You'll find me on the patio with Beth W.
