is it just me, or is the food not as good as it used to be here? . . last time i came here, i tried the bone marrow thing, and it was like spreading fat on a toast. it wasn't bad, but it was very bleh. i expected it to be more decadent. . . and of course i got the burgers. but they no longer impress me the way they did before. there's more bitterness with the veggies i think and the meat wasn't as good... still really good! but not as mindblowing as before (or the other location that i remember).
