No joke. EVERYTHING on the menu is great, if not decent. Portions are huge and the price is just right! You get what you pay for... don't give yourself a cheap alternative to good food. . . Although, I make no effort of eating at the sunset location... I've always picked up to-go. Limited parking (meter) and absurdly long waiting list.
