Wow, this place was PACKED! After reading all the reviews and hearing about the chicken from my friends, we had to wait it out. After about 45 mins we got seated at the curbside tables. Came here to eat one thing only, Hainan Chicken! And was it worth the wait? Gotta say it was! Super moist and flavorful. Rice was really good too. If you want cheap and good eats in Alhambra, this place is it.
