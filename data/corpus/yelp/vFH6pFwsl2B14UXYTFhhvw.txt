Such a letdown...maybe my expectations were too high, but I was really disappointed after dining here for my bday the other night. I had the roasted salmon, which was OK but nothing special. My boyfriend had the cheddar glazed short ribs, which sounded scrumptious but tasted gamey and well, just kinda gross. It wouldn't have been a big deal if it was cheaper, but charging $31 for bad short ribs is just plain wrong. I was really looking forward to the cocktails --- but that turned out to be a bust too. Do not get the "Grape and the Cape" --- sounds good in theory but in reality, vodka, grape juice and champagne just do not go well together. Â I normally ALWAYS order dessert, but there was nothing on the dessert menu that sounded tempting so we went to Yogurt Land on La Brea instead. The best thing about this place was the service --- the hostess, waiter, busboys, etc. were very friendly and attentive. The patio was nice, too, but at the end of the day, if the food doesn't deliver, why bother going back to The Foundry?
