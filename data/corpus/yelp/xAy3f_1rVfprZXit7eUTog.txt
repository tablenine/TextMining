I am adding another star to this place!  The first time I had this I didn't think too much of it - I even thought it was somewhat ridiculous to have to wait for the right day for the truck to come to the right area, and once that day comes you need to wait again in the longest line possible, just for that dang burrito that I can gobble up in minutes if not seconds.  . . But howdy howdy how did I find myself beginning to crave the idea of chasing after this little truck?  I think this built up hype and cult following that "everyone's chasing after the truck" is working pretty darn well.  I find myself craving this place days after my first bite.  Then, this craving returns again, and again.  The reason for this might be that it's hard to get and so not readily available that makes us want more of it.  Evil-lious, I say.
