Fanstastic.  You have to go if you've never been here.  Of course the corned beef is good, but I also love their gefilte fish, mac and cheese and matzo ball soup.  Sandwiches are big enough to split, unless you are a big guy or have a huge appetite.  Never disappoints.  Oh yeah, they are closed on Sundays.
