Who knew cooking on Â hubcaps could be so much fun?. . I'm not going to say anything that anyone else hasn't already said. It's a great environment if you like really crowded, smoky rooms (which I do!) and the lemon soju can't be beat.. . The marinated beef is consistently good. The pork is usually a bit tough for me. I'm going to make a point of convincing my friends next time to try chicken or maybe even squid. Bring on the squid!
