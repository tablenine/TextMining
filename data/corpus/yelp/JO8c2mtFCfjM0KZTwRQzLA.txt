Okay, I admit that I was highly skeptical after driving by the place a couple of times.  That is, until my wife and I sat down for lunch today and, jeezus, this is absolutely the best country cookin in the Atlanta metropolitan area.  The fried chicken is simply divine.  The owners of Mary Mac's and Colonnade need to eat lunch there every day for one year as punishment for the drivel they are serving.  Authentic southern style veggies -- collard greens and black eyed peas -- plus beautiful homemade desserts such as blueberry cobbler, banana pudding and Coca-Cola chocolate cake.  This place is simply a treasure!
