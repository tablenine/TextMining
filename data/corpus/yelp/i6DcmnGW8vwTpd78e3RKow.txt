Wow, 1090 reviews! I've lived here for 7 years and just discovered this place a couple weeks ago. So far I've only been twice, but I love it. I'm vegetarian, so I was a little wary of what I could order off the menu. They had 3 veggie sausages: apple sage, Italian sausage, and another I can't recall. The first time I got the apple sage sausage, which was good, but I'll definitely be going back for the Italian sausage.. . Seating is a little crazy at first, but once you know what to expect you'll be fine. Basically, you order your food then wait for it in a big cafeteria style dining room. Sit wherever you can, next to whoever you can. Hope that the honey mustard is near you...we couldn't find it the first time I went, but then again, we didn't look very hard for it either. It is a bit fun trying the different types of mustards they have (I think they've got 4). It can get loud, so if you want to actually have a conversation without yelling, you might want to sit next to your friend instead of across from them. Enjoy!
