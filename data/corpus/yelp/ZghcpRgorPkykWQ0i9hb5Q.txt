I am so happy that I listened to my fabulous LA yelpers and tried the mac and cheese.  I was slightly afraid of it at first because I hate mushrooms.  And I mean HATE them.  That combined with truffle oil could prove to be a disgusting combination in my book.  But, I love my fabulous LA yelper friends and trust them completely so, I ordered it!  And guess what friends????  I loved it!  The first couple bites scared me a bit but once I got paste how different it tasted from other mac and cheese's I fell in love.  . . I also got the zucca salad which I loved so much!  It had squash, zucchini, tomatoes, Grana Padano cheese and this delicious light walnut vinaigrette.  So very good!  The cheese was awesome and I was pleased that there was so much of it on the salad.  . . The portions were small but hearty.  Everything was quite fresh and tasty.  I loved it!  The prices were a little high for the portions but hey, the quality and taste made it worth it.  . . My dining companion got two appetizers, the ahi tuna tartare and another one that I can't remember but I know that she really loved both of them.  We both loved our meal and we saw a Cricket there!  That was a fun bonus!
