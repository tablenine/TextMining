Went here this week while traveling for work. I specifically wanted to watch the Warriors game and eat a good steak, so I took the advice from three different people and headed for Gibson's. I sat at the bar on a Sunday night and liked what I saw...tons of activity, great piano player, good wine list and GIGANTIC twice-baked potatoes. A pound-and-a-half. I'm not kidding. So first things first - come HUNGRY.. . Anyway, experience was great until towards the end of the night. I sat at the end of the bar with my purse hanging on a hook underneath the bar - when I went to pay, my purse was open and my wallet was gone. Which totally surprised me because I thought it was a pretty classy joint. However, after mentioning my drama to some local clients the next day, none were surprised - apparently the clientele can be fairly sketch and say they tend to stay away because of this reason.. . I have to admit, even though I'm so frustrated with what happened and probably won't return myself , I'm a little bummed for Gibson's because I thought my meal was pretty outstanding. And I'm a serious steak LOVER. I know a good steak when I taste one. . . If I didn't get ripped off, I would have easily given them five stars for food and service. I'd still say give it a try but be sure to keep your eyes open...
