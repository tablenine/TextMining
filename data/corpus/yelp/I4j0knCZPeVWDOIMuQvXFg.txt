Category: Steakhouses
Fogo didn't live up to my expectation. I was a bit disappointed. I was really looking forward to dine here, especially after reading these reviews before mine. . . So my boyfriend took me here for my birthday last December. He made reservation on a Saturday [8pm]. We got there 5 minutes before 8 and we had to wait around 25 minutes for our table. When we got the table, it was right next to a server station and kind of on the way. It look ed like they added our table last minute and just snuck us in the corner. My boyfriend had to duck his head a couple of times because there were people passing by with huge trays full of plates. So yes.. it was inconvenient. . . I love steak needless to say. And I love them rare and juicy. Not the kind of steak I got at Fogo. I asked for a medium rare fillet Mignon and I got a medium well. It was dry and tough. I thought maybe I just got a bad piece... so I tried the garlic picanha... also tough and dry. The sausage was pretty good, though. I didn't try anything else because I was so disappointed. Bf had the pork and chicken and he said chicken was pretty good. . . So if I was so disappointed.. why the 3 stars?! The salad bar. Unbelievable. I love the salad bar. So clean and colorful. . . The cheese rolls...to die for!!! So warm and moist and chewy and cheesy!!! I wanted to take them home!!!! [of course I didn't] . If I could eat those cheese rolls everyday, I would be a very happy woman. . . Cheese rolls + Xingu = [= . . Will I come back to Fogo? I don't think so. It was pricey and I didn't enjoy the meat. I'd rather go to Ruth's Chris or Houston.
