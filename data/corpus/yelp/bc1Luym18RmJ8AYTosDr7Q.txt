so fresh, so yummy.  i LOVE the line-caught ahi tuna.  i've had it as a salad and also as a sandwich.  both very tasty.  and i've had their tomato soup.  it tastes like they just plucked the tomatoes out from the back. mmmm.  the only annoying thing is that the line is always out the door during lunch on a weekday.  otherwise i'd come here more often during my lunch break.. . UPDATE: i added a star because i went this weekend and had my favorite ahi tuna as a hot plate.  the mashed potatoes are soooo yummy. plus, i've been coming here non-stop and it's been consistently wonderful.  the food is always fresh and so tasty.  i'm also now addicted to the baby spinach simple salad because of the hazelnuts in it.  i was surprised to see the same line going out the door on a sunday during lunch.  i thought it was just the work week lunch crowd that did that but apparently not!  that's always a good sign. oh and saw tim robbins randomly, eating there w/ a bunch of people.
