Restaurant: Sakura Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Sakura has the best sushi in the West side the fatty tuna is Ono! Also their tempura is very good the previous owner was a tempura master and passed it long to the new owners and its still great they use very clean oil to cook and you can tell by the taste, the main draw back is that it is always crowded so if you are hungry you will have to wait and wait, but the service and food is worth it! Some times there is a line before the restaurant is even open!
