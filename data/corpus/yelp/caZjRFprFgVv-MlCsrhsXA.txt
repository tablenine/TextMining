Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
WATCH OUT! - This place is DIRTY!!! Super Slippery Greasy floors, greasy chairs, tables are disgusting.. . We all had to clean our shoes before getting back into my car.. . Be especially cautious of the chair you sit on! I came home to find out the back of my pants were all greased up from people putting their shoes on the chair leg. Did I mentioned they had very slippery greasy floors?. . Although the food is cheap, there a lot more $16/ all you can eat bbq in Ktown. I rather not deal with the dirty environment. It just takes away from the whole eating experience. NOT FUN.. . I don't think i would come back here again. Food is only sub-par.
