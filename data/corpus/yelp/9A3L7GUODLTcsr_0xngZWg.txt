You know what's better than going to Osteria Mozza for the first time?  Being treated to Osteria Mozza for your first time  :D. . We walked in at about 9:30 on a Monday night and the place was buzzing!  Eagerly looked for Nancy Silverton at the mozzarella bar but not luck :(      Our server was very cool and we ordered our entire dinner off of his recommendations. . . We started with the much talked about grilled octopus salad with potatoes and greens.  Oh my goat.  Heaven in the mouth.  I don't like octopus but this was fantastic.  The slow-poaching in olive oil made the octopus super tender and yummalicious.  We also had the burrata cheese with bacon, carmelized onions and braised escarole.  This was served on thick slices of grilled bread.  Mostly having had burrata with fresh tomatoes and basil, this was a much richer combination but delicious nonetheless. . . Next came the gnocchi with wild boar ragu.  So apparently, I've never had gnocchi before.  The gnocchis I've had before were potato rock dumplings cuz these babies were fluffy airy pillows of buttery potato goodness. . . Then came our braised short ribs served over polenta with freshly grated horseradish  and our sweetbreads picatta with artichokes.  The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender but nothing to ooh and ahh over but dayum those sweetbreads were yummy. . . Oh and service at this place is ON POINT.  They seriously know what they're doing here.   . . On a sidenote, I finally did see Nancy Silverton talking with a table in the wine corner.  And who was at that table?  Ming Tsai and Todd English!
