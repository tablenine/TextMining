While it doesn't measure up to Salsa and Beer in Van Nuys, the carnitas burrito that I had one June evening with a friend was certainly very tasty. Their chips and guacamole are quite good but the highlight of the entire visit to Loteria was the Agua Fresca. This is perfect after a day of wandering LA or even just a nice cool down to get out of the heat. I'd drive out of my way and pay the obscene parking rates at The Grove (at least if you don't get validated) just to have another.
