If you're a burger kind of person and are okay with having it just as they prepare it (with carmelized onions and blue cheese), it's a great meal at a fun and non-traditional place.. . At Father's, you order everything at the bar and they'll bring the food to you. They won't bring you ketchup or hot sauce or anything other than what you've already paid for or ordered at the bar. You want another drink? You gotta go get it yourself. Despite that, the decor is handsome and chic, the beer selection is awesome, and the food is great.. . Final thoughts.... Go for lunch as dinner gets crazy and harder to get a table. Order the burger and sweet potato fries and be prepared to feel the love of a content belly.
