Came here for lunch last week sometime.  The place is somewhat off the beaten path, surrounded by a few warehouses/factories.  There was a decent amount of foot traffic coming in and out, so that's always a good sign.. . First thing that I noticed when I walked in were all the fresh baked pies sitting out on shelves.  Not something I'm used to seeing and they looked amazing yet gluttonously dangerous.. . I ended up ordering half a Turkey Sandwich and half a salad.  Nothing terribly exciting, but a good measuring stick regardless.  The turkey sandwich was very good.  Soft bread, fresh, chilled, cold veggies and delicious smoked turkey.  The salad left a bit to be desired and even though it came with raisins, walnuts and feta, it tasted quite bland.. . I didn't get a chance to try any of the desserts, but everything they had in the glass displays looked really decadent and tasty.  The chocolate mousse type cakes looked especially deadly.. . I'll have to try one of the desserts next time I'm around there.
