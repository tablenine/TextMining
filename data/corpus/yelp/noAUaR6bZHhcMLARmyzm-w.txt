Dear Mr. Bearded Frenchy, . We met last night. Just thinking about you makes me melt, my mouth water. . . Love,. Jane. . Mr. Bearded Frenchy = french toast "bearded" with cornflakes. The crunchiness from the cornflakes and the softness of the toast swimming in butter and syrup (seriously, it does not get any better) really satisfies any late night breakfast craving you have.. . The place is decent. I do wish the group tables could be a bit bigger, but it's a small place so what can you do. There's outdoor seating, but they could definitely get more people to sit outside at night if there were some heat lamps. Otherwise, good, fast service and...Mr. Bearded Frenchy!
