I order the chicken pot pie when it's cold.   I also like the pastries, especially the fruit tartes.  I can't remember having a bad meal here. . . We mostly go on weeknights, otherwise the wait is too long.  If it's warm out, at least you can wait in the lovely park/courtyard area by the fountain.  But I personally wouldn't wait for more than 30 min. (but that's true of most places). Parking in the area is tricky, so we walk whenever possible.  . . Service is prompt and the artwork is wonderful (a nice bonus).  My dad asked about a painting, and it turned out one of the servers painted it and had an upcoming show.  She gave us the flyer.  Cool!
