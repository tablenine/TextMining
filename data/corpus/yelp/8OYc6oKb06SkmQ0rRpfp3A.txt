This place is awesome if you are willing to spend a lot of money on sushi.  It is definitely a nicer place to eat out at, so good for a celebration with friends or on a really nice date.  The sushi is excellent, the ambiance is what you make of it.  It can be romantic with a date, yet fun w/friends.
