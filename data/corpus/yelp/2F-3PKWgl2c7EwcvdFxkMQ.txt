Category: Burgers
OK the life of THIS carnivore sadly coming to an end.  I am slowly losing the need to eat and the love for meat.  That being said, in the next several weeks/months I am hitting all the places that I've been wanting to visit before I nix the flesh for good.. . This place was recommended to me by a foodie friend so I HAD to go.  Miss SJ doesn't disappoint, and she was dead on with this place.. . I had the Umami Burger and the Malt Liquor Tempura Onion Rings which is what your first experience with Umami should be.. . This could easily qualify as my last meal on Earth.  The onion rings were fried just enough to make the batter crispy, leaving the onions inside semi raw with an awesome bite.  If you don't like raw onions, these may not be for you but they may be the best I've ever had.. . OK now for the awesomeness.  This burger defies all laws of all 11 dimensions of existence.  I'm still not exactly sure what all was on it, but I know there was some cheese in there...really, it doesn't matter because the first bite made me cry.  The burger was perfect.  The bun was slightly grilled and buttery/oiled.  It took me nearly a half an hour to eat because I savored every bite.  The world around me was completely tuned out.  All that existed for me at the moment was the meal.. . Burgers for me are like pizza.  I don't have a favorite because they are all so different that I love them for all different reasons.  Umami is like that although nothing comes close to this.. . My goal is to try everything on the menu before I swear off animal flesh.. . Service was nice and friendly and they openly expressed their own opinions on the food.  Happy happy.  I go back!
