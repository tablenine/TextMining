Not sure why it took so long for me to write this up, here goes.. . Securing a same day ten-top reservation for 2pm is a bit harder than one would imagine. I am sure making the initial phone shortly before noon didn't help. However, with a phone call to a very well connected gentleman by Juan, two tables next to each other was waiting for us as our party arrived.. . Few antipasti and salads were ordered for the table. All were wonderful but writing this up a month later, I can't exactly tell you what they were. Also had couple of bruschette to pass around, I especially enjoyed the version with Chicken livers, capers, parsley &amp; guanciale. . Next round of food, pizzas of course. One each of [b[Funghi misti, fontina, taleggio &amp; thyme[/b], Fennel sausage, panna, red onion &amp; scallions, and Speck, bufala mozzarella, olive tapanade &amp; oregano if memory serves. Haven't had pizzas this good since I don't know when. Probably not since the visit to Lombardi's in NYC a few years back.. . Mike ordered a white and red for the group, bottle each for both table. Sadly, a bottle of white was corked but quickly replaced by the waitress, no hassle at all.. . Just a casual late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon, thank you to the Realm crew for the invitation. I will have to get back in during my next trip to SoCal.
