Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
I'm too hungover to write complete sentences so I shall just give some brief observations: . . 1. Pretty good banchan, especially the crunchy aloe in a sweet cream sauce. . . 2. Staff is attentive and helpful... the menu has nice descriptions of the items in English. (Great for non Koreans) . . 3. Their combo deals suck because they contain chicken. (I love chicken, but you don't go to kbbq for chicken...you would absolutely never see this in Korea) . . 4. The combo deals and the menus are geared towards non Koreans. . . 5. The galbi was excellent... the chadol was a bit greasy. . . 6. For a non all you can eat Korean BBQ located in koreatown, there were A LOT of non Koreans there. . . 7. Soowon is definitely doing something right!. . 8. Soju is evil!!
