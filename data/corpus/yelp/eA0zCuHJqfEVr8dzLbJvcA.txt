Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
The only place where burritos are to be savored. . . El Tepeyac makes enormous burritos. The Hollenbeck burrito is in a class all by itself.. . I was first introduced to this little cafe by friends form Long Beach who'd family makes the drive on a regular basis just for dinner.. There is no other place like it. . . It's good to get there a little early as it can get quite busy. Even with a wait the turnover is fairly quick.. . Maybe the best Guacamole in Los Angeles.. . I could go on and on.
