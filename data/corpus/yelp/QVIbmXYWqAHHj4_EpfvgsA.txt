I'll give this place 4 stars because the half priced maki deal they were doing was sweet (half priced before 6pm on weekends) and I felt I like I got my money's worth for sure- the veggie tempura roll and fish and chips were really tasty, and my date was in heaven with a roll that had salmon, salad greens and apples.  . . I think I would have felt a little jipped if we had paid full price because I did find the portions to be a bit small, and the overall atmosphere of the place was chaos.  I know that's pretty much out of the staff's hands, but it was loud and overcrowded, the tables were practically on top of each other, and there seemed to be a congregation of screaming children spread throughout the place.  And all of this before 6 o'clock!  If we had to wait 20 minutes for a table that early I can't imagine what it gets like later.. . Overall a good eating experience, just not the best atmosphere for a relaxed dinner.
