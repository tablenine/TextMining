I just came back from a night at Moody's  and I smell like a french fry. I had a veggie burger with blue cheese. It was delicious. The lettuce and tomato were both crunchy and fresh. French fries nice and crisp.  Yum Yum. No Coca Cola just Pepsi. . We had 12 people in out party. They accommodated us by putting 3 tables together in a kind awkward way by making an L shape, so not everyone had a chance to talk to each other.. Service was ok, little slow and the waitress did not want to split our bill.  Left it to us to figure it out.. I cant wait to take a shower and wash off the french fry smell off me.
