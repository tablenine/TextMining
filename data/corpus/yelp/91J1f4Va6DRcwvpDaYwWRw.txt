This place is so cute!!!! great place for breakfast, brunch, or lunch!!! i am not sure how it looks at night. Deserts looked yummy! but wasn't able to taste. decor was nice. Country feel. Love the outdoor sittings EXCEPT the back side. They tried to sit me beside the trash bins and i sat somewhere else. WHY WOULD ANYONE SIT BESIDE A TRASH BIN? now that's disgusting!!!! but besides that it was such a great place for girlfriends to meet or who ever!!! it's perfect for a sunny day! =) . . food was good. Healthy and fresh.
