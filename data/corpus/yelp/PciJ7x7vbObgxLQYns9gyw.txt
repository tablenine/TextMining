i went here for their new year's eve party and despite the insane amount of people, i actually had quite a bit of fun until my feet hurt from all the dancing because they played really good music. there were also appearances by perry farrell, seth mcfarlane, mickey avalon and travis barker (though we left early before he showed up).
