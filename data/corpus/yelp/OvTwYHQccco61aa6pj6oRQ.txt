Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Despite high prices, long lines and overcrowding, lackluster decor and the absence of common amenities such as wait service, the food was quite delicious. And judging on that, plus the extensive beer selection, "Father's Office" is definitely worth a visit.
