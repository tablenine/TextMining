Bob San is a solid choice for sushi on the Division strip... but with Mirai just a few blocks further down I almost feel like why bother?  . . They do have a nice selection of sushi basics here... you'll find your standard rolls; california, spicy tuna, dragon, rainbow but not much else. Their premiere 'Crabby Dragon' with soft-shell crab, unagi and avocado which at $16.95 is the most expensive maki on the menu, pales in comparison in not only flavor but especially in size to the likes of the 'Godzilla' and 'Giant' rolls you'll find at Wabi or Butterfly for the same price point. The small 6 pieces were laughable when they arrived at the table so we abandoned the Bob San rolls altogether and moved onto some sashimi..... . The pieces were lovely! Cut well and tasty fresh... perfect buttery salmon, super white tuna with scallion, sweet shrimp and quail egg with ikura. I missed my sweet shrimp heads though, I love to munch on those fried suckers but I have noticed several Chicago sushi joints tend to opt out of serving them. Could just be a West Coast thing or maybe they fear the Midwesterners are afraid to have their food stare back at them but I dig it!  . . Our service was very slow and our waitresses had a tendency of disappearing for long periods of time seemingly exactly when we needed something. Being outside on their large patio in the warm summer air made it so much more tolerable, not sure how I would have felt about it had I been seated indoors. . . I think I'd skip Bob San next time in favor of Mirai, but I wouldn't complain if someone really wanted to come here, I'd just stick to the pieces and shy away from those puny but pricey rolls.
