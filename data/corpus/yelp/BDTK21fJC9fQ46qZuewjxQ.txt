Restaurant: Italian Village
Category: Nightlife
Having tried Vivere a few days earlier, we thought we'd try this third of the restuarants in the building.  Where Vivere was my best meal in Chicago last week, Italian Village was the least.. . The food wasn't horrible but to echo another review, just very bland.  Maybe the spices go to the other two resturants?  I had the chicken rotolini and was dissapointed by both the lack of flavor on the fettechini alfredo (I tasted more butter than cheese) and that for the marsala I was given thigh meat that was somehow devoid of the natural flavor dark meat has. If the sauce was really supposed to have been made with a wine sherry and prosciuto, I couldn't taste either. . . My wife didn't think her ravioli was anything special either.  We both split a canoli desert and agreed it too wasn't anything special.. . The service was very good though.  Our waiter was very attentive.  I also appreciated the atmosphere.
