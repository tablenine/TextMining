Opa!. Just thinking about this place makes my taste buds jump.  I can't say enough how much I love this place. It reminds me of what living in a metropolis such as L.A. is about.  Both menu and staff at Papa's is friendly.  I've been here on many an occasion and always try to bring some out of town pals around to taste some great Greek tasty treats like dolmas and gyros. My faves are the filet of sole plate, greek salad, and oh did I mention the Feta? Gotta try it and freshly baked french bread. While you're at it buy some treats for the ride home or better yet a pic-nic rendez-vous.
