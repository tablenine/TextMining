Restaurant: Spring Restaurant
Category: American (New)
Spring is solid and has continued to grow on me over time and after continued visits.. . Their food is very subtle, but that happens to be my speed so suits me perfectly.  They always offer  at least 3 seafood entrees (I only eat seafood - no meats!) and in my experience they are always exceedingly delicate and well prepared.. . They have a good wine selection, a friendly and professional staff, and a lovely understated decor.. . Spring has earned it's spot on our small rotation of regular spots and I'm always confident on my expectations when I dine here.
