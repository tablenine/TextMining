Category: Steakhouses
I was on the bubble between 4 stars and 5.  Would've preferred to have given them 4 1/2!. . I've eaten at the Chicago &amp; Rosemont locations many many times each.  Both are very good and very consistent making Gibson's my 2nd favorite steakhouse in the country.. . Great food &amp; even better service.. . -  The T-Bone, NY Sirloin, and Pork Chop are all excellent.  Always prepared exactly as ordered.  Their meat is well-seasoned, and always served with a nice char.  Oh, and the sauteed filet medallions w/peppers are pretty darn good as well.  Their meat is just not as flavorful as Chops in Atlanta, nor is the ambiance quite as nice, hence 4 stars vs 5.. . -  The sides are also tasty.  I usually go for the creamed spinach and asparagus.. . -  No matter when I've been there, the piano bar has always been fun and packed before dinner.. . -  And their Gibson Martini's (have to order a Gibson while at Gibson's, right? :D) are always shaken just right!. . What I like about this place is the consistency of their kitchens and the old school approach of the waiters who always take care of you.
