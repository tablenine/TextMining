I really want to give this place more stars, especially because of their great mojitos!  BUT the day we went here it was so unbearably hot in there.  It was cooler outside!!  The service was good but it was not cool for them to tell us that the air was really on when it defintely was not.  At least our server told us the truth about the broken A/C!  Other patrons were using menus as fans.  . . Food and drinks were great but the atmosphere gets rated down.  We know we probably caught this place on an off night, but it stinks how we rushed to get out of there due to the heat!  May check this place out again - but probably in the winter.
