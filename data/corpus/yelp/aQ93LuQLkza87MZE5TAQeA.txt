Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Father's Office in Culver City - maybe I'm not as cool as the other westside hipsters 'cause I prefer coming to this location over table-stalking people at the Santa Monica one, but I feel like the new Father's Office has just as good of burgers and just as many beers and just as nice of waitstaff.  And, it's easy to find parking!  . I think the interior is nicer at this location as well.  It's a little on the pricey side if you want to eat here but it's a great bar with a younger (but not too young!) crowd of professionals.
