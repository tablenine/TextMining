yeah, #19 is good, but #89 is better: HOT CORNED BEEF, Sauerkraut and Swiss Cheese Grilled on Rye . . *the pastrami is is very peppery, and must consumed with the coleslaw and bread. The corned beef is actually a softer and more fragrance cut. The meat is delicious just by itself or combined with the swiss chess and sauerkraut. . . *yeah, the area is horrible, the price is expensive.. but. still, it's a solid 5-star. . . *The portion is not huge, but big enough for a bit of left over snack. and guess what, the leftover Langer's sandwich is still better than just about any other fresh sandwich you can find. Now, that's pretty impressive.
