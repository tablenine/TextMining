Restaurant: El Tesoro
Category: Mexican
Hit Tesoro today after seeing Avenue Q at the Fox, massively hungover from last night at Fado and looking to score some gourmet mexican.  Considering it was 3:30 in the afternoon it was less than bumping so I'll forgo any comments about the mood there.  The restaurant is basically in a converted house with a nice, big porch out front that looks to be ideal for summertime drinking.  Had the guacamole which was quite good.  The menu is very unique.  If you're used to going to mexican restaurants with letters or numbers or combos you can get lost in it.  Had the quesadillas with pork and was very happy.  It's worth checking out.. . Note: They have quite the tequila selection.
