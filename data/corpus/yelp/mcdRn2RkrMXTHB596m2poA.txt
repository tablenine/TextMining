Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
Garlic Garlic and More Garlic! =D. yum yum yum. My breath does not thank me after though =[. It's weird that all the food doesn't taste like it's reeking of garlic but you know it's there. it's subtle with a good blend of other herby flavors. you do get the after effects of the stinking rose though... . btw. I never knew garlic is aka stinking rose!. . This is the place to bring garlic lovers! . from the bread to the spread to the appie's to the entree's to..yes..the DESSERTS...alllll garlic infused more or less.. . Today we had. . _complimentary bread_. smeeelllls deliiiiissshhhuuuzzzz!!. we asked for more to go and i would take this over car freshener any day =]. it's very soft and subtly tasty too. there's a plain, an onion flavored, and garlic flavored which actually doesn't taste like garlic bread at alll. . _garlic clam_. this was well worth the $15!! there was so many clams in there for the small size and the soup was very flavorful. it's got olive oil and garlic and herbs in it. my mom and baby bro LOVED it. especially with a dash of tabasco and a sprits of lemon from the calamari. . _popcorn calamari_. Small size was still way too much...since the other food was better. this is your average fried calamari..well, it was very nicely golden-crisped though. and it came with two sauces. one was more marinara-y and the other more ketchup-y...good to dip the bread with =]. . _40 cloves garlic chicken_. half a chicken basically...breast+wing and Thigh+leg. Oddly enough, wasn't blasting with garlic flavor. but it was subtle and in the gravy and mighty tasty. chicken was very juicy too. served with about 10-20 cloves of grilled garlic and a side of mashed yukon gold potatoes. i loved that they had skin in it!! adds texture =D yum yum yum. . _filet mignon_. WOW never have I had filet mignon so TENDER!! it was so soft and juicy and wonderfully flavored!! well worth the $20+ for the plate...someone should show Black Angus how to make this REAL slab of meat! this was served with a side of more mashed tatoes! =] and a scoop of DELICIOUS creamed spinach! so different than your average creamy cheesy mush...they really brought out the spinach flavor somehow with a subtle sauce. it's kind of odd at first but it grew on me!. . _Garlic Ice Cream_. we shall find out on our next visit!! we were too full to get it.... . our bill? $80. we had enough leftovers to make another meal to-go though.. will be back for Mommy's b-day! and for that garlic ice cream!. . o yeah. last time I came, I got the halibut. it wasn't garlic-y but it was VERY tasty. and the fish was fresh and juicy. I also tried their cous cous, which was also very interesting and yummy.
