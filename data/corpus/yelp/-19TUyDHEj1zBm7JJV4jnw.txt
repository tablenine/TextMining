My go to Atlanta Mexican spot. . . This place is quant, charming and the food is oh so good. They have a giant tequilla selection so they get stars off the bat for that. The quaco is to die for and gotta love the table side presenation. The place is a little on the dark side so beware of what you are actually eating. I got the fajitas and what I thought was a piece of meat was an entire chili! Steam did come out of my ears but I learned my lesson and it was all in good fun :)
