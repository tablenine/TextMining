Best breakfast in LA.  Period.  Just make sure that you exercise for the rest of the day to burn it off.  This is a must for out of town guests, get there early on the weekends.. . Also a secret that is not on the menu is that for pancakes &amp; french toast you can ask the waiter for one or two stack, opposed to the standard three stack which is impossible to finish.
