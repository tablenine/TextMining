Memoirs of a Geisha House, Saturday Dec. 16th....... . This review is made possible by my fiance's company, which held their Christmas party here and EVERYTHING, from the cab rides, to all food and drink, was FREE. So it could have been in a stable, I would have said, yeah, that place was ok.. . But surprisingly, I did really like the decor of this place. It's not like I get out much to trendy places, so this one screamed STYLIN' to me immediately. And it's huge. There's a bar on the first floor, lots of seating and an open area for dancing, an upstairs with lots more seating where you can also look down at all the dancers, and another "open air" room with a bar. That's where I spent most of the evening. They had Guitar Hero II set up in there, so HELL YEAH, I had to show 'em how it's done. :). . The food was good. I mostly snacked on the sushi, and that would be my least favorite of all the appetizers I tried. There was this tuna sashimi on a crispy wanton with apple that was utterly divine. Everyone was raving about the black cod and the lamb chop, but I hit the drinking and missed all the hot food downstairs. I did try the famous "Geisha Kiss" and it went down smoothly, especially after a so-so Manhattan. The servers were on it for this huge-mongous party and everyone was pleasantly stuffed and knocking 'em back all night. . . So, my advice, if someone is paying your way, GO HERE! . If you wanna know how it would be to actually pay---read the other reviews.
