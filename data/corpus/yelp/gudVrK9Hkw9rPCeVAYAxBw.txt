Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
I had a Groupon for this place and so braved the parking (which wasn't as bad as I expected) and left the Valley to try Taste. I had one of the Prix Fix meals and it was all very tasty. The stand outs were the Mac &amp; Cheese starter and the bread pudding dessert. The other food I enjoyed but none of it was as good as the Mac &amp; Cheese or dessert. But hey none of it was crap either! So I hope to eat here again and give it another try. Maybe I just ordered the non wowing stuff because my beginning and end wowed me.
