This is a great italian restaurant!  It was extremely easy to get a reservation on a saturday night yet the restaurant was packed!  They've got a great coupon floating around that's $59 for a four course dinner for 2, including a bottle of wine so keep your eye open for that.  Their bruschetta is really good and I had a pasta special that night which was pumpkin filled ravioli with butternut squash, it was awesome!   Their panna cotta is really good as dessert too.  The service is great as well!  I will definitely go back here.
