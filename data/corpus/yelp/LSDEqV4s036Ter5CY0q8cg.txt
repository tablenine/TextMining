red light was VERY good!!!!!!!!!!!   . . We got the kung pao chicken and it was great.  I really don't care for cilantro, but it was still very, very good.  We also got the peking duck.  The sauce was made of cranberries (I believe), and it was a bit sweet, but the portion was VERY big.  The skin of the duck was amazing as well.. . For dessert we opted for the oreo cheesecake, which was magnifique!  I even got 3 extra scoops of oreo ice cream.  Nope, and I am not ashamed to say, I finished it.  . . I was pleasantly surprised that Red Light's food is so much better than Opera's.  If you must do a Jerry Kleiner pan asian spot, do RED LIGHT!
