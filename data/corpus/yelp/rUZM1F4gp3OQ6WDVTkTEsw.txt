Another reason why I miss Southern California to pieces. Literally, cheese roll pieces if you need a better visual. The only request I have of any person I know that comes to visit is... please oh please can you stop by and get me some cheese rolls! ... what else? ooh how about a fruit tart pie too if you must! . . They're sandwiches are yummy as well, as I'm a dire fan of their Cuban and I don't care if I don't try another Porto's sandwich, I'm a sucker for repetition. . . I've always gone to Porto's during what seems to be a rush time, but staff still offered friendly smiles and are extremely organized for a bakery/cafe and can expedite your order fairly quickly.
