If you're looking for a romantic spot with a great wine list and excellent food... this is the place for you! . . I was there last week and loved everything about it.  The wine list is extensive, it was hard to decide (but we did, of course!)  Our server was extremely friendly and helpful, but not overbearing.  We started with the hazelnut crusted foie gras and loved it.  For my entree, I had the duo of duck.  It was excellent - perfectly cooked, seasoned and presented.  My husband had the lamb tajine (a special for the night) and it was amazing!  For dessert we shard the flourless chocolate cake.  It was very good, but rich so I'm glad that we shared it.  We ended the meal with the Moroccon Mint Tea, which I would highly recommend. . . Overall, I would go back to The Little Door in a heartbeat!  I would highly recommend it for a romantic evening out or a special occassion.
