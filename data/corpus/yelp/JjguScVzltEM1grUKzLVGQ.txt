This was the last stop of our brief food jaunt through LA.  . . We heard a bit about the garlic chicken- the portions were huge, but the flavor was just decent.  Solid, but nothing special.  I think i've had better in GA.  (ouch, is that mildly blasphemous?). . The fried plantains were a bit overcooked, and lacked any consistent shape.  It doesn't take much for the imagination to come up with other things that these plantains may resemble....(you fill in the blank). . I had the special of the day- the roasted leg of lamb- which came out with no bone.  Again, solid food, but nothing special.  The garlic mojo sauce touted by the menu just seemed like an overdose of lemon.  We probably won't come back the next time we're back in the area.
