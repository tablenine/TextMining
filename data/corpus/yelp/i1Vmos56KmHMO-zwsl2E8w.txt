I have been coming here for years and the food always rocks..Come hungry cause portions are on the heavy side.  I always LOVE the potatoes stroganoff.  It is so rich and amazing.  The dollar pancakes are always a winner too.  oh oh and the bacon cheddar waffles.  I honestly havent had anything I didnt like except dealing with the massive crowds and lines on the weekend..
