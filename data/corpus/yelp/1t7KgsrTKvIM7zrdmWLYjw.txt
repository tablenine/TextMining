Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
I visited David Burke's last weekend, and overall, I had a good experience.  I ordered the 75 day-aged steak which was excellent!  Ordered sides of asiago truffle fries, garlic spinach, and tempura green beans and they were good as well.  . . In summary, good food, excellent service, prices par with a high-end steakhouse.  Will definitely go back.
