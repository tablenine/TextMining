Not sure if some of the "less than 4 stars" reviews I have seen recently are just *really* hard to please or if they just dont get that sometimes a nice time out will require you to spend more than $10 per person.. .   The Thai was good but the appetizers and sushi were really delicious and probably the better bet.  ( highly recommend for those who like sushi). Monday and Tuesday is dollar sushi..ask the server for dollar sushi menu if you don't get 1. . . summary: Awesome!!
