Could be Atlanta's best restaurant....if it weren't for the location.  The food is consistently incredible.  The last time I ate here, I had schnitzel.  I have never had schnitzel that was anything above mediocre, but for whatever reason I was in the mood for it.  It was f'ing unreal.  Rarely does a side ever stand out as a menu highlight, but the fries (cooked in duck fat) are a meal in themselves, possibly acceptable as a dessert.  The decor is very chic, the crowd very cool, the vibe very urbane.  However, tucked into a residential neighborhood in Inman Park makes it a destination restuarant, and thus a secondary choice if you're looking for a place to start your evening.  Nevertheless, top notch.
