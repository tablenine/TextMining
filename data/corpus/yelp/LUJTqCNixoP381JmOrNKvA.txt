A beacon of love in a dingy city.  I work in downtown LA and I must admit the food options for this vegan have been bleak for the 5 + years I have been trudging the streets of the various "districts".  But Louie sweet Louie is a place for everybody. The service is as close to white glove as you would get this side of The Beverly Hills Hotel.  The price point is affordable the food is delicious and they are very flexible and accommodating to special requests.  The marble floors and ceilings to the sky make it a bit rackety if you are planning to relax in tranquility. But if you want to have a delicious meal or meeting in a chic eatery go to Louie.  And be careful not to spend your nest egg on the AMAZING sundries and pastries in the little bodega in the front of Bottega Louie. Love.. . Vegans get: . -French fries sprinkled with tabasco and fresh garlic. -Lentil soup. -Italian salad (hold the pepperoni and provolone). -Broccoli rabe with red pepper flakes and roasted garlic. -Heirloom Carrots. -White bean hummus (hold the cheese bread). . Everyone else get:. -Pizza margarita . -Caesar salad. -Any pasta dish (the sauce is excellent). -Portobello fries
