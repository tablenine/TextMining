Restaurant: Sepia
Category: American (New)
My favorite restaurant in Chicago.  Inviting, relaxing, sexy, with well executed food and bev.  I've never had a bad meal at Sepia - I crave the octopus.  I only hope that the change in chef doesn't ruin what I've come to love about this extraordinary restaurant!
