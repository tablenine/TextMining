OY VEY! Matzo Ball Soup &amp; Corned Beef on Rye.. ain't nothing wrong with that!..  The atmosphere is pretty diverse, cafeteria like..  sort of like Phillipe's - very old school...  the wait was a bit long, but you know I was in the mood to be around lots of people, so that was okay with me... . It is one of those places that you expect to see a Tarantino scene taking place in...
