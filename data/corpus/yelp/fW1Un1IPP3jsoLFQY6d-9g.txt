First and foremost, you HAVE TO try their cheese rolls. Actually, I take that back. DON'T try their cheese rolls so I can have them all to myself. I was an atheist until I bit into a warm one. Now I worship Porto's.. . Props to their sandwiches as well. Â Don't bother with anything vegetarian. If you're going to get a sandwich here, get something with a little meat in it. TRUST.. . Aside from the cafe, I've also ordered a birthday cake from here (the tiramisu). It was huge, looked like a masterpiece and tasted like... really good tiramisu.. . It gets crowded and the parking is shitty (TINY lot in the back and if you go when it's packed my heart goes out to you), but it's worth it. . . Next special occasion = a cake made of cheese rolls.
