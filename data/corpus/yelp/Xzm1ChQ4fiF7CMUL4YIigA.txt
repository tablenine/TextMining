I went here because I saw it on Food Network as one of the best place to get a bacon burger. Not impressed at all. Perhaps i was expecting an explosion of flavors and yumminess which I was sadly disappointed. The fries were mediocre. Â The garlic aioli sauce was ALLLL right... But the beer was great! And so many choices. . . Also ordered the roasted bone marrow with french bread which was good but short lived. . . Would go back for the beer, but that's about it. Save your burger appetite for another place.
