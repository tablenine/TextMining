Whatllyahave? Whatllyahave? . . A really mediocre fast-food meal of course! This place is an Atlanta institution and when you visit you can see why. Great downtown location, right off of 85, tons of parking, in-car drive-up service, and a million people screaming "whatllyahave" at you until you actually, you know, have something.. . So, for the originality, the experience, and the Atanta-ish obligation, I say go here. Just don't expect the food to be worth anything. The hot dog was tiny and bla, as was the chili. The onion rings were marginally better, but still nothing special. Someone told me that the Varsity was the "in-n-out of the South". That would be massively incorrect.. . Still, when in Atlanta, you might want to check it out to say you've been there.
