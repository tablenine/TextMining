The breakfast there is great. it's a nice surrounding, very friendly.. . I've only had the granola bowls and the french toast, but they're pretty damn good! the portions are very decent too.. . oh and the chocolate chip cookie is very very satisfying.\. . the only drawback is the service, it can be really slow on a weekend. they're really nice and friendly though.
