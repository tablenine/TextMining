Best hand sliced smoked salmon in the west. Great pickles too. Love the bakery items, especially the chocolate race track cake. . . When eating in, their lunch and dinner specials are worth the money. Usually for around $15-20, you get an entree plus app (soup, salad, etc), beverage, and dessert (jello, pudding, ice cream).. . Open 24/7, the people watching is best after midnight.
