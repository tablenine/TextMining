A friend took me here tonight for a "welcome to LA dinner", knowing that I am a huge fan of french food.  Although I could not call the menu overtly "French", it was delicious nonetheless.  The main dishes are types of food commonly prepared in France, but the method of preparation is thoroughly American.  . I had the roasted beet salad and pork chop with a side of green beans, and the pineapple tart tartin for dessert.  All were wonderful, excellently prepared and interesting to taste.  . The waitstaff was friendly from the moment we walked in the door, and I had the impression that everyone who worked there actually enjoyed their job, which I know speaks well of the management (from my own restaurant - working experience).. I could not give it five starts because it is not as French as the name implies, but I would definitely recommend this spot for a Friday night dinner that's quite good, and with no "snobby" LA feeling.
