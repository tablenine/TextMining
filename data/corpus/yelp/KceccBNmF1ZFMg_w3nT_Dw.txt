Can't speak for the restaurant side of the EARL, but I have seen some great shows here (Akron/Family killed it!)  Staff has always been very nice and bar service was quick.  I really dig the acoustics of the room as well -- loud rock bands always sound great in here, though I can't recommend earplugs enough.  Overall, an excellent venue to see bands in.
