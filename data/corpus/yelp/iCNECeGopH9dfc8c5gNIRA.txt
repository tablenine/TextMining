I feel like I have been to so many good sushi places in Chicago that they are all starting to blend together.  Regardless, Bob San has good food and a pleasant interior.  I really liked their white tuna with jalapeno special.  I'd never had jalapeno anything on sushi since I figure it would mask the flavor of the fish.  Hence, I was skeptical until I put it in my mouth.  It was tasty and I thought the two went really well together.  Nice job, Bob!
