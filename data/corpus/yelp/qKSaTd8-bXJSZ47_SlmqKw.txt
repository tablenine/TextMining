I went there this past wknd and I'm now a fan. The fact that it was on Man Vs. Food made me a bigger fan, haha.. . I tried the ramen with miso soup broth with #3 spice with no extra toppings. Most of the ppl I went with order #4. I tried my soup and it was a little more spicy than I'm used to, but still tolerable and yummy. The ramen was really good! Next time I go, I'd personally order more meat b/c there's barely any.. . Their noodles do not seem to be consistent b/c when two of my friends odered a 2nd round of noodles, it was not as soft and tasty as the first time.. . Overall, pretty good!
