Excellent!!  Thank God Nacional 27 rescued us after we walked out on Zealous.  Great vibe, with a great mix of people.. . The food was spectacular.  We had the tapas sampler which was great all around; chicken empanadas, lamb BBQ tacos, shrimp, and these little ball things that were to die for.  Our entree of marinated steak with a mole sauce, as well as potatoes, was perfectly prepared.  Dessert didn't disappoint either.  The drinks were stiff, and the sangria was right on.  Everything was excellent.  It is a little pricey, but since everything was so good, it felt worth it.  I'd definitely go back.
