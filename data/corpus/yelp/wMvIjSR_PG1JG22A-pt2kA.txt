This is one of the places in LA I recommend to everybody. . All you need to know is this: show up early, don't expect to get a seat at peak hours and go get something exciting. . Do not get the PBR. You can get PBR many places. And you'll pay less at those places. You've got all kinds of wonderful beers available to you. Ordering PBR at a restaurant like this says "I have more money than sense, and I don't have that much money."
