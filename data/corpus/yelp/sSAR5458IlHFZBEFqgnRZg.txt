ooohhhh yyyeeeahhhhh!!! ***BRRRUUUPPT****. . I think I am still full form this place and I ate there last Saturday night! The crazy thing is that there are Nakato's all over the south east and while it's a great place to get some hibachi style food, I have to specifically yelp about this particular location. . . My girlfriend and I popped in late on a Saturday night just looking to get a little grub grub on with out any reservations. No problem, we were seated immediately at a table/hibachi grill. There isn't much more I can say about the food here as you know just as well as I do that it's consistently amazing!!! .  Â  The funny thing is that my girlfriend and I had pinky swear-ed that were where not going to over eat because it is sooooo easy to do so at this place. I mean, who could resist their tender jumbo shrimp or their juicy fillet grilled up hibachi style right in front of you. That's not even mentioning all the sides they give you! Oh you know what I'm talking about. The soup, salad, noodles, vegetables and of course the fried rice. You probably eat at least 6 pounds of food in one sitting. . . Any way, this location is very friendly and has some of the nicest people I have encountered in a restaurant in this city. Even if we did show up late at night with out a reservation. . . Good food, good meat. Good lord let's eat!
