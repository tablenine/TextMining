There just ain't nuthin' like a steaming bowl of Canter's mish-mosh in the wee hours of the morning.  It's damned near a religious experience.. . Many here rightly call Canter's an L.A. institution.  Originally founded in East L.A. back in its Jewish days, Canter's moved to Fairfax to become the hub of the district.. . I've been here hundreds of times over the past 15+ years, and have never had a disappointing meal.  The pastrami and corned beef are piled high and succulent, the pickles are home-made and perfectly seasoned, and the corned beef hash for breakfast (or after a late night) can move one to tears.. . The fact that many of their wait-staff have that grandmotherly appeal sure doesn't hurt.. . Canter's Deli.  Try it.
