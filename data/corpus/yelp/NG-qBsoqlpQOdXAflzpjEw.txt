Restaurant: Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant
Category: Chinese
By far one of the best Chinese food places in the San Gabriel Valley-- a high compliment considering the plethora of good food in that area. . . I would recommend that you go to this restaurant with a couple of people at least 5-6 but you'd probably need more, because you will want to get the 266 set menu. This menu includes a great balance of both seafood and meat dishes. Let's go more in depth shall we.. . . 1 fried crab dish with a hint of green onions and tough of Chinese seasoning. 1 garlic and saucy crab dish . 1 pea sprout dish-- a good refreshing dish considering the really heavy and delish other courses. 1 3 flavor kung pao chicken-- truly amazing: includes shrimp, beef, and chicken to which all three flavors mesh together and wow simply wow . 1 abalone soup-- apparently real, but I'm not too sure since abalone is CRAZY expensive. 1 orange chicken . 1 sea cucumber dish. . And MORE. . If you can't go with a huge gaggle of people, I would just recommend to get the crab dishes, because that's their specialty. I do warn you that this restaurant probably uses a lot of MSG. An hour after eating, I Â uncontrollably toppled over and fell asleep. . . The restaurant dosen't sit many maybe at most 50 or so. So I'd recommend that you get there a wee bit early if your doing a lunch thing.. . Update: Apparently no abalone soup and or orange chicken thing on the 266 menu. I did go on Christmas so perhaps its a different menu or something. Anyhoo. yummo nonetheless!
