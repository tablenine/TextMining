SOME PIG!. . Sorry Charlotte, but all the fancy web-work in the world won't save Wilbur this time!. . For as long as Twin Anchors continues its homage to the pig, its entelechy deliciously realized in succulent falling-off-the-bone-finger-licking-eye-rolling-li p-smacking-zesty-tangy-smoky-goodness, no swine is safe. Hell, even the baked beans are filled with chunks of tender pork perfection. Top it all off with waitresses with attitude who call me hon, and you've got a winning combination.. . The wait can be a bit long, but ***lightbulb*** that's why there's a giant bar there. Â Be sure to ask for doubles when ordering mixed drinks (not much more expensive), and remember...positively no dancing!. . 5 finger-licking stars!
