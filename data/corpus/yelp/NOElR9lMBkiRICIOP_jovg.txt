One thing I appreciate about this place is the relative sophistication of the staff. They know their menu and can describe the dishes at length. Obviously they've tasted them all. They are consistently gracious, well-groomed and well-mannered. And they are likewise fairly articulate about their food, which is more than I can say for a lot of servers in town. Finally, you get the sense that they actually care about your dining experience. And that is half the pleasure of eating out. The other half is the food, which for me never fails to impress. The masaman dish with jumbo prawns, grilled scallops and mussels over a bed of fried rice was delicious. Every bite. Highly recommended.
