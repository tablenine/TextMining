For being someone who was Vegan and Vegetarian for 6 years, I really jumped the gun when I started eating meat again. I'd like to say, this place has amazing brisket. I'm not ready to eat ribs or anything thats served on the bone yet. The service is ALWAYS friendly and extremely fast. Always clean, and always just what I need.
