Been here several times.  It's pretty great.  Usually I'm down for a good Starbucks or even better Peetz, so I was a bit skeptical about coming to LA Mill.  I was dragged here by a friend who raved it was the best coffee she has ever had, and it was pretty good.. . First thing that was helpful and rare in LA, they have their own parking lot!  I've been 4-5 times and have never had a problem finding parking.  Secondly, there is an Asian male barista that was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the different coffees and extraction methods.  He gave me the 411 on the Clover Press and how it works.  Amazing!  The coffee turns out really smooth, I have gotten the Guatemala and Ethiopian (which is my favorite!).  Always through the Clover Press, I can't justify spending 6-12 bucks on the other ones for the same amount.... Maybe one day.. . The ice coffee is also great, they do an 18 hour cold water steep!. . The reason why it's not a 5 star, the food is good, but the portions are mini, the wait staff can be at times slow, and lastly (but not included in the deduction of the star), sometimes there are super pretentious people there.
