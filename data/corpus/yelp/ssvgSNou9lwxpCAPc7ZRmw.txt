This place has the BEST garlic chicken.  The plantains are also very good.  Some restaurants post photos of celebrities on their walls...this one is no different.  However, I was lucky enough to sit at the next table to Sir Ben Kingsly during one of my visits here.  The food is just that good.  Its a great place to gather with friends and family and is very unpretentious.
