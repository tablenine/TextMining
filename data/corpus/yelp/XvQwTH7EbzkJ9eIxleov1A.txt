Best steak I've had in the city!!  The service is amazing, the house wine is delicious and the side dishes are to die for (highly recommend the mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach and broccoli - heavenly!!).  Great spot for weekend dinner and close to other places to barhop before or after.  Been here 3 times and can't wait for my next visit!  A bit pricy but worth it.  I've never had enough room to try the desserts - they are huge!
