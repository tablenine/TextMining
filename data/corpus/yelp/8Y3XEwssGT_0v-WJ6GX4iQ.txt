Went here with friends last night because we went to high school w/ the owner. No room upstairs, though we'd have preferred it. . The chips were very fresh; didn't try the pico de gallo but went straight for the green salsa which was nice and hot. We had an appetizer of grilled shrimp wrapped in bacon, stuffed w/ cheese...not bad. Â I had a tamarind margarita which I quite enjoyed, didn't care for the house martini, which was horchata-tasted too vanilla-y. My friend had a salad with squid and shrimp that she said was very good; her hubby didn't touch his entree so I don't know about that. My chicken mole enchiladas were good. I've had better food overall, but service was good, water glasses always full, the food was fresh and we got free tequila shots(ok, I turned mine down). All in all, not bad and I'll probably go here again.
