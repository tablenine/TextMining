You have a secret second kitchen, shut your mouth.  This is a pure genius way to market your most expensive entrees because if you tell someone like me this I will fall for it every time.  It's like taking candy from a baby.  So yes I ordered the lobster and the infamous garlic noodles, the few items that are made out of the "secret second kitchen".  Was is worth it???  Hell yes!  The food was incredible, service fast and fantastic and I love the fishtank floor.  Will I be back next time I am in L.A.?  Me thinks so.
