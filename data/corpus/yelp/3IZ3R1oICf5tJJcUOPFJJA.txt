Came here for lunch since I figured there would be no chance in hell I would be able to go for dinner.. . We couldn't get a table so we just sat at the bar since it was just the two of us. Started with breadsticks.....eeeeh ok nothing spectacular. We went with the fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese. I've never had squash blossoms before so I don't know how they taste like. It didn't taste of anything but the ricotta stuffing was really good. The batter was also very crispy. For pizza we went with the Bianca. Shoulda known not to have gotten that since it has fontina cheese. The cheeses were too overpowering and that was all I tasted. I really like the crust because it was chewy and not tough. It was also airy and not too densed. . . Would I go back? ummmm yeah.....I would like to try their homemade sausage and the gelato. The gelato may take a little courage because you get three flavors for $8!
