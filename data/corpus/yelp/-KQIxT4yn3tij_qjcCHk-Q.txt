Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Father's Office dances to the beat of their own drummer, to be sure, but I am willing to forego some of the comforts of pedestrian restaurants to chow down at FO.. . All the complaining about the lines and bouncers is somewhat valid- no one likes to wait in line. No one likes bouncers or fighting for seats. I get that. That said, I went today (saturday) at about 1pm and had no trouble finding parking, a table, service or anything else. You'd think I'd be in queue hell... Complain all you want about the shortcomings- the burger was delicious and the beer selection was dynamite. The bar and decor is beautiful and even the bathrooms/shared sink made my heart skip a beat. I am in love and will return.. . I've heard all of the hype. I have stayed away from the Santa Monica location out of fear that I'll never get in. I'm never a fan of a restaurant that has limited hours or limited menus or limited seating, but when the best burger I've had in a long time is washed down with delicious Belgian beer, I think I can deal with the limitations. The new location at Helms seems to have alleviated some of the problems of the SM location.. . I may revisit this review after a second visit if the delightful food and drink at FO proves to be as much of a hassle as everyone else seems to have encountered. In the mean time, I'll be dreaming of a cart full of sweet potato fries and the long line of beer taps from heaven.
