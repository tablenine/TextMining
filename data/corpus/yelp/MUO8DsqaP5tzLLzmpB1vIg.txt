Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
when I first moved to Atlanta Fatt Matts was the top bbq spot in atlanta. Within the last year it has been bought out and the original managment is gone. With the old managment went some of the authenticity and flavor of the place. I am not saying it is horrible now but its reign supreme over Georgia is over. It definately is still good especially for tourists but for those that tasted early 2000's Fatt Matts know the difference.
