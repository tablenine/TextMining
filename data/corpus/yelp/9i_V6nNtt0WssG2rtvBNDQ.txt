Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
Go ahead, indulge.  Bask in the richness that is Mastro's steakhouse.. . This place screams swank and the food back's it up.  I made reservations for this restaurant the same morning.  Arrived at the restaurant and was quickly escorted to our table.  It's everything you love about a steak restaurant and done right:  attentive but not pestering waiters/waitresses, useful suggestions and pairings of wine suited to taste, and food that is as solid as the price-tag associated with it.  . . I know the amount of food ordered would've covered one month of automobile payment but I only remembered a couple of things.... . Complimentary bread basket - plenty of types of breads to choose from, proceed with caution and don't waste precious stomach capacity.. . Lobster mashed potatoes - Nice and creamy 'tatoes and the lobster was a nice touch but I think I reached a limit of the lobster richness.. . Ribeye - Perfect and came out the way I ordered it:  medium-rare, perfectly seasoned, and generous.. . One of my fondest memories of dining in LA, I definitely need to dine here again.
