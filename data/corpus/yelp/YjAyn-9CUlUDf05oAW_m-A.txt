Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
Growing up in Eagle Rock, who hasn't been to Casa Bianca? It's an Eagle Rock landmark, and definitely one of the best places to eat on Colorado Blvd. Â It's always been a go-to place for my family and I. I went to high school with some of the grandchildren of the owners. Great family, tight knit, very warm and welcoming. . . The pizza is pretty good too. I reccommend any pizza, antipasto salad and the chicken parm. . . Be prepared for a wait on certain nights. Street parking only, so make your way into the residential area if you're goin on a weekend evening. Also, I reccommend calling ahead to see how long the wait is, and if they're open. They have odd hours
