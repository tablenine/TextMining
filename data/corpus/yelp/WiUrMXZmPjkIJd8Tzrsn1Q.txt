I've chased down their truck 3 times thus far, and I'm still not sick of it!  Lately, they've been making their way further south (towards OC area, yayy!).  My latest stalker moment was in Fullerton/Anaheim area.  The line wasn't as long as I've seen (lucky me), and I was able to order just about EVERYTHING they had to offer.. . So far, after my 3 visits, here's what I would Highly recommend (in order of faves):. . 1) Kogi Sliders. 2) Short Rib Tacos. 3) Short Rib Burritos. 4) Tofu Tacos. 5) Spicy Pork Tacos. 6) Kimchi Quesadillas. 7) Chicken Tacos. . I have yet to try their Kogi Dogs which looks DELISH!  Yes, the portions are small, so if you have a big appetite, I'd order at least 4 tacos...  The cabbage garnish they put on all of their dishes is what makes it KOGI style.. . I'd recommend following them on Twitter (kogibbq), NOT (wtfkogibbq).  The people working in their trucks are uber friendly and the people waiting in line are fun to talk to.. . Definitely a cult-like amount of followers for Kogi!  Can't wait to chase them down in OC again!
