I really LOVE Geisha House! I read all the reviews before I went there for my birthday last night and was a bit apprehensive but overall I was SO impressed. The decor is great, the food is fantastic(ESPECIALLY to Kobe beef), and most of the service was great. The bartender Drew is absolutely great, he's really friendly and helpful, and our pretty blonde(one of many) waitress was so helpful as well. The only complaint I have is that the hostess working was pretty rude, but she was just a little spot on an otherwise perfect night. I highly recommend going here for a romantic evening or a group dinner.
