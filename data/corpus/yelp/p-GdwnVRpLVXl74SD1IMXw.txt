Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I tried to make a homemade version of Orochon with Shin ramen... umm, didn't quite turn out the same.. . Anyways, I like the soy sauce number 3 with egg and pork chirasu. Mmmm, the pork is so good.. . I do not like the long wait though. It doesn't make sense to wait an hour for a bowl of ramen. It just doesn't I tell ya!
