Restaurant: SinBala Restaurant
Category: Taiwanese
My friend and I wandered past this place on the way to the Bank of America ATM and decided to try it because it was filled with people who looked like they were really enjoying their meal. . . Their specialty is their SinBala sausage so of course we tried it. The sausage comes plain or topped with an extensive selection of condiments. We tried it plain and with the satay sauce. Both of them were very yummy although the satay sauce could have been better. . . I ordered the fried pork chop with rice and it was so good! Not overly greasy and came with so much food that I could not finish it. The pork was full of flavor with just the right crisp from the breading. The accompanying vegetables and rice was also very good. . . I will definitely go back again when I want a really good, filling meal without having to pay more than $10 for it.
