Restaurant: Gladys Knight and Ron Winans' Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
At my request, my boyfriend treated me on my birthday here. We had the midnight train and had fried green tomatoes. Being from nyc, I wanted some Southern flava~~.. . The ambience is actually really nice. I liked it a lot. Being Asian, I felt a bit out of place but it had a cool vibe. The chicken wings were huge. Loved them. They are v. v. good. I couldn't finish all of it.. . The waffle wasn't anything special. It was better than Eggo but I didn't find anything amazing with them. The boyfriend liked the waffles though. . . The fried green tomatoes are amazing. It was my first time trying them ever and they were oh so yummy. Peach cobbler a la mode was also good.. . Service was good. There was a bit of a mix up, but that got fixed fast. Our waiter was polite.. . I would come back on special occasions. But a definitely recommend. The prices aren't bad but won't fly on my college budget! . . Pictures of what we ate added to this page. Check em out.
