Restaurant: So Kong Dong
Category: Korean
So Kong Dong is the best tofu house in Atlanta!  Pork Soondubu jigae is really really REALLY powerful.  I crave it after I walk out of the joint.  Get the Kalbi combo with your soup, I promise you will not regret it.  Excellent fried fish comes with each order.  Good assortment of banchans.  Chap chae is really good for a side dish.  Daikon and kimchi are solid.  Look for the week when that have the Korean potato salad!  Good stuff!  Seafood pancake is decent.  Highly recommended!  Oh yeah... That raw egg that comes out... Be sure to crack it open for the bubbling hot soup that comes out!
