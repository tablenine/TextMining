Bartender was so on point and knew about every specialty sweet shot I could think of! German Chocolate Cake shot is where it's at! The food honestly for an upscale asian fusion restaurant was out of this world. I would totally recommend the schesuan black peper beef stirfry, low mein chicken with noodles. Ethan, our server was exteemeley helpful and ever recommeneded other killer restaurants in the area for us to try. bomb. That is all.
