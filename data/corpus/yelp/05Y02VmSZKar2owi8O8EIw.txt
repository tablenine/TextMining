Restaurant: Casa Vega
Category: Mexican
Casa Vega was satisfying after a long Saturday night.  I was happy to find a Mexican restaurant that was open and serving food his late. Didn't have to settle for the drive thru.  I ordered the burrito ranchero, which was entirely over priced. The burrito itself was packed with chicken, beans and cheese and came with a heaping serving of sour cream and guacamole. I loved the cheesy sauce that encased this gigantic burrito. Everything about this burrito was tasty, i just think they could knocked  off about 5 bucks from the price and make it taste even better :-) . . I will say that i was not a fan of the drunk table with loud obnoxious wandering girls, but hey it was a Saturday night and it was after midnight. I suppose your really cant expect much less.
