We thought this place was going to be awesome, it was OK. We both had a dandelion salad which was really good. I had the fried chicken after the waitress said they had won awards and they were nice to give me the parts I wanted, the crunch was nice but the taste was a nonevent. The sweet waffles that went with it were just not the flavors I want with fried chicken, give me salt or spice please. My friend had a steak which she did not even finish. We skipped desert because we were bored by that time.
