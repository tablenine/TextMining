hands down, one of the best ramen joints in LA and little tokyo.  came reviewed by my brother and it was definitely worth the one hour drive from west LA.  the soup base is wonderful and the noodles are of perfect consistency.  you can see them make your ramen in front of you and it's like dinner and a show..only the show's alright and the dinner's amazing.  the gyoza come looking kind of strange but they're marvelously yummy.  my roommate got the fried rice (you also see them cook it in front of you) and i was sold after a few bites (and i don't even like fried rice that much).  all in all, come hungry because you're definitely going to leave full and nobody likes soggy leftover ramen.  but be weary of the wait as it's a small place and there are tons of hungry diners!
