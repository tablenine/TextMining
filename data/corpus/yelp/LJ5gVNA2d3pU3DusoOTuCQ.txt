I'm going to ignore the fact that I saw the filthy waitress station right in front of the women's bathroom and give this place 4 stars. Sounds good, right? ;-). . Honestly, the food was really tasty. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, which was excellent and my favorite part of the meal. And, I certainly can't forget the pitcher of margarita for $10. You should always get the pitcher - even if you're dining alone. A glass costs about $8 - why not spend a few more bucks to get a full pitcher? We also ordered the shrimp and guacamole quesadillas, which were also pretty good. The shrimp were nice and large, not the baby salad shrimp. For the main course, we split the mahi mahi fajita - not my favorite part of the meal, but decent.. . Service was a bit slow, but it really didn't bother me since I was enjoying a relaxing Friday night dinner. . . A big plus is a lot of outdoor seating; they even have a pseudo outdoor seating that is covered when it's raining.
