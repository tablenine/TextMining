Average Mexican food that's overpriced.   It's a fun festive environment, albeit you have to wait 45 minutes to get seated.  But $20 for enchiladas that are mediocre at best?  There are so many good hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants in LA.  Why this one gets the acclaim is beyond me.  Maybe this place would be desirable if I played in a local after work softball league and needed a place to wind down with the team after a victory over the Southwest Airlines Brew Crew club.  But for me, unless it's midnight and I want something other than Mel's, this place is a pass.
