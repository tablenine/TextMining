for over $90, we felt totally ripped off. We felt the dinner was overpriced for what it was. We could have paid half of that and not been as pissed. We had the 3 cheese plate, the chicken with quinoa and coleslaw, and the 16 dollar hamburger.. . i'm just saying.. the father's office hamburger is much cheaper and tastes a whole lot better. in fact, in and out's burger is way cheaper and tastes much better than its price. if i'm going to pay $16 for a hamburger, I expect to not be disappointed.. . bleh. this is not the economy to be trying new things or taking risks in dining out. next time, we'll be sure to go somewhere we know is worth paying over $90.
