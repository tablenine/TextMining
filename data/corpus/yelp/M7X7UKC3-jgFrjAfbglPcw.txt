This Montana Gal was very impressed with my dining experience at Taste.  Went with a group of friends on Halloween night.  A fabulous experience!  Our waiter was Batman!  Service was impeccable.  Food was amazing.  Can't remember all our dishes  but mac and cheese was superb, the fries were delicious for about 2 minutes after they were served.  I loved everything even if I can't remember all that we ordered.  Street scene was fun too - especially on Halloween night.  One thing- be cautious if using the valet parking.  We parked in the lot (no valet service in sight-we were a little early).  Then the guy came and asked for our keys while we were dining.  Then when we were leaving there was no valet in sight.  After waiting about five minutes we rummaged through the drawers of his valet stand and found our keys and just took them and drove away.  We could have taken anyone else's keys and driven away in their BMW or Mercedes, but luckily we are honest Montana folk!! (also he missed out on a tip).
