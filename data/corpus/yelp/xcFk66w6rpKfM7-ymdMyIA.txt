Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
My first time and sooooooo damn yummy!!! Â I am extremely picky when it comes to eating beef or any kind of meat out at restaurants but after reading so many great reviews, I figured I'd give it a shot and I absolutely LOVED it! The sangria was very tasty, rice was nice and moist and the marinated steak and onions was to die for. So damn good, make you want to slap somebody! No need to read anymore reviews after this one. If you want authentic mexican then you found the right place. Small, intimate family owned cafe that will leave you full and smiling. Tip: tell them that your a yelper and you might even get a free flan on the house! Enjoy and please let me know your thoughts.
