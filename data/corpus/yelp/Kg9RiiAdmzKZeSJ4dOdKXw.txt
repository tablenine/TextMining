MAC N CHEESE!!!!!! with bacon bits... so deliciously creamy and perfectly seasoned with just the right amout of baked bread crumbs on top. I assured my girlfriend that we would only eat a couple of bites and get sick of it, as she's watching her girlish figure for her upcoming nuptials... but by the end of the meal, we were both fighting to scrape the bottom of the bowl for the last bits of cheesy goodness. . . The curry sandwich was also very good- although I wasn't a big fan of the ciabatta bread, so I ate just the insides on top of a salad to make my own version of chicken- curry- cranberry salad with vinaigrette dressing. . . Coffee was deliciously strong but lukewarm, and strangely enough, we found a piece of cardboard in our salad that I at first mistook for a root of some sort- no, I did not bite into it. Just stared at it for longer than I should have. . The waitress apologized and gave us two free cookies to go- and there went our diet. The cookies were pretty awesome.. crispy on the outside, moist towards the center with sweet chocolate chips. And I normally don't even like cookies! (Yeah, I'm weird that way)
