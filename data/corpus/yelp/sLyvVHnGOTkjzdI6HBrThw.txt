Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
First off I think dumplings are OK. I heard that this place is "da bomb" so I decided to try it out. I give them this, IT IS FRESH, probably the freshest dumplings as you can them. Well there is a wait... I mean a real wait... We waited for an hour and half to try this dumpling out and parking is a joke also. So there I sat for about an hour watching 8 to 10 people work like robots making more and more dumplings. The overhead is low, I'll give the owners that. Well we finally got lucky and got a seat. I heard to try it with a hole and put vinegar in there. The final result was a very bland tasting dumpling. OK so I thought to myself, maybe its just the fact that there is vinegar. So i tried it with nothing, very bland, just like steamed water.... OK so i tried it with soy sauce... it was a sub par dumpling that you can get anywhere else other than the fact that is truly fresh. Its been months since I have gone and I will never go again. I would give this place 3 starts, but its because of THE WAIT. If you don't mind waiting for an hour plus like so many others, please try it.
