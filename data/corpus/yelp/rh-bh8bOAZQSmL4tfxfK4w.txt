Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
I completely approve. The cheese fries are worth dying for...because pretty much, if you do finish all of the cheese fries-you will die. I don't know what kind of cheese it is...like cheddar or something, but it's really good. All the food is good at Wiener Circle. The ladies behind the grill are super nice to me and super mean to everyone else. If you are a Â belligerent, drunk, and/or spoiled Wrigleyville Cubs fan you will promptly be rewarded with a thorough shaming topped with several complimentary F bombs along with your meal. However, the servers tend to apply these benefits quite liberally among the variety of patrons that frequent this place. Example: my friend witnessed during one visit a drunk midget trying to get lippy with the the ladies behind the counter. One of them said that she would throw him up on the grill next. Poor guy, but everyone gets it about the same at this place unless you've got soul and then all you hear is "heeeyyy babbby, surrrre babbby, what do you do for a livin' babbby??? you want to take me home???". Although I think some people come here just to get yelled at and vent their angst about life back at the servers the food is very very good. Pretty much awesome food and a verbal happy meal surprise every time. Sox, Sox, Sox, Bearsss...
