This is a great late night stop.  Everytime I have wanted them to be open, they are.  I took some friends from out of town and they loved it.  We were fortunately drunk enough to handle the "chocolate shake" and greasy food.  I dont think this will be a stop for me during the day but I often see families and it seems to be a great lunch spot.
