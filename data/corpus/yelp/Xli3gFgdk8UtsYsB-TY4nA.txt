3.5 Stars...choosing not to round up. . . Big fan of the pug burger which I've had on previous visits, but this review is specifically for an early brunch we took in before the matinee of The Color Purple on Valentine's Day. . . Started off with a 1/2lb of their peel and eat shrimp, which were luscious and plump. The hubby had the fish and chips which were tasty but not mind-blowing so. I chose the crab benedict, and I was completely underwhelmed. While I was impressed with the crab cakes themselves (lots of crab, no filler), the scant pour of hollandaise was thin, runny, and bland. Â The lank black kale was not a bright addition - it was overcooked and slimy.. . If I was one of those crabby patties, I would have felt so ashamed and naked. . . The service was excellent and quick, but overall skip the brunch here and dive in to a burger or one of their delectable seafood platters.
