I am completely obsessed with this place. We stopped by to get a few sandwiches to go on our way to the Hollywood Bowl recently - curry chicken, egg salad, and pear and brie. Our reactions, in order, were: Holy crap! WOW! and Oh my god this sandwich is INSANE. The bread is delicious and grilled, which I think might be the secret to great sandwiches. The ingredients are fresh and interesting without being too weird - dried cranberries in the chicken curry, for example. . . We went back for brunch last weekend and I had the french toast, which was just fine. Not exceptional, but my SO had the croissant breakfast sandwich - again, insanely delicious. A really good croissant, which is hard to find, plus eggs and cheese and dried tomatoes, and...I don't know - magic? It was fantastic. . . Must go back and try the mac 'n cheese. Maybe if business picks up enough they'll stay open for dinner?!
