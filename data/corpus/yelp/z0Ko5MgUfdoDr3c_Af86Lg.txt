i'm new to la, but i'm not new to jewish delis.  and this is one of the best.. . dare i say it: i like this place better than new york's second ave deli.. . service is amazingly fast, although not always friendly.  food is generally pretty good (try the chopped liver!  the mishmosh soup!).  only major downside to this place is the price.. . oh, did i mention that the pickles are great?  and it's open late.. . only real competition, as far as i'm concerned, is brent's deli in northridge.
