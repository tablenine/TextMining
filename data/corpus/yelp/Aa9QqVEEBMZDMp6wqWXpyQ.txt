Brett Schulte says:  Great place for a beer lover like me.  And a food lover.  And a wine lover, and a..., well, you get the idea.  I ALSO love that they have not one but two happy hours Sunday-Wed, from 3-6 and again 10-12.. . It's a big menu, and since I'm usually there for Happy Hour I tend to eat off that menu.  The chicken fingers, while boring sounding, are particularly good.  The fries are (almost) always cold, they're the thin kind and unless you get them RIGHT when they're done, well you know.. . The thing that gets me is that the free wifi inexplicably blocks a lot of my favorite sites.  OK i understand blocking xtube, but blocking Craigslist and Gmail?  Really?  I mean, if you can't check your email, why have wifi at all?  They block it with WebSense so it's particularly easy to get around, but still an annoyance if you're not prepared for it.. . The desert samplers thingy is great and a bargain with three different tastes for under ten bucks... if you have the room after all the great beer and food.. . Ironically, the "Yard House" no longer sell beer by the yard after being sued too many times.  Funny huh?
