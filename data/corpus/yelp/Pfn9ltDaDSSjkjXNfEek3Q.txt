Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
A group of my friends and I ordered the lunch specials and I got to try the green curry, pad thai, and some type of beef.  The food was cheap and really tasty.  I loved my green curry!!  The pad thai was good and the beef was okay.  I will definitely frequent this restaurant whenever I have the chance.
