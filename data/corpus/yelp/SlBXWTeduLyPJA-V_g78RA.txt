'Sexy' is not a term I ever recall using to describe an item of food. The idea of doing that has always been a bit silly to me. I think certain cars can be sexy. Perhaps even a beautiful armoire, or a credenza made of mahogany maybe. But food? No way. After all, it's just nourishment.. something we all need to survive. You kill an animal, and you eat it, so you don't die. . . Well, I was mistaken. When my plate of 'food' arrived, I grew pervert eyes. I looked the sandwich up and down, almost intimidated by its appeal. My...god. 'Would it be rude for me to lift the top bun to take a peak underneath?' I wondered. This was no ordinary sandwich. This was a proud, busty heap of warm, wet, juiciness. If it had a face, it would surely be Marilyn Monroe's face - in all of those come-hither photographs of yesteryear. . . I ate the shit out of that sandwich, and it felt amazing. After the deed was done, I lay back smoking a cigarette thinking to myself, 'I don't know if I could do that again...at least not anytime soon.' I felt as though I had just done something forbidden, like the devil himself was smiling upon me from below, poking me in the side and saying, "I told ya so." . . Oh Langer's' #19, you sexy bitch you.
