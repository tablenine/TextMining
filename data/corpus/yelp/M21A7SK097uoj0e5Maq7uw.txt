Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Pretty cheap and pretty decent as well. The fish can be fried a little more for that extra crunch sometimes but other than that I give it a 7/10. The salsa bar is delicious with I believe 5 choices? from mild to really spicy. A good place for a quick bite!
