Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
After my many years of living in California, I finally got the opportunity to eat at Pink's Hot Dogs on the corner of La Brea and Melrose.  . . Their selections are bountiful, offering more combinations of pig and beef than anyone could ever dream of.  My final decision was between the Planet Hollywood Dog and the Giant 12" Jalapeo Dog.  Naturally I went for the 12 incher (what can I say, I can't resist the wang!). . We also ordered the Chili Cheese Fries.  The fries them self are great (dark seasoned fries, medium in girth), and the chili was good too.  . . My dog was ridiculously huge, and to my surprise the jalapeos were INSIDE the dog, not sprinkled on top.  This excited my muchly, as I have yet to see a hot dog filled with jalapeos in my lifetime (and believe me, I have searched far and wide, sampling the wang from coast to coast.). . The line resembled that which you would find at Disneyland, which was surprising since it was a weeknight.  By the time we sat down to eat I was exhausted from standing in line, and famished.. . The star deduction is mainly due to the wait to quality ratio.  The food, although good, was definitely not on par with the amount of time you have to wait.. . Final Verdict:  Tough out the long line for the experience, and so that you can say "Pinks? Why yes, I have dined at that fine establishment before!"
