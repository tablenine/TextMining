An LA classic.. . To live/visit/exist in LA and not eat here at least once would be an experience missed. It is filled with legend, kitch, and grease up the wazoo.. . The atmosphere is straight out of the 1970's mixed in with bits from the 50's and beyond. The wait staff are a colorful bunch... don't expect all of them to smile and be eager to refill your coffee, but sometimes you'll catch a gem who will. Despite Canter's Jewishness, it is not kosher. I had a waitress ask me if I wanted cheese on my pastrami sandwich (I did). . . Its a bit pricey. Some things you know were not made here, rather reheated and slopped on a dish. The portions are ample though. I had the California Burger and it was STACKED with mushrooms and probably 4oz of avocado... mmm.... . . What always brings me here is it is an excuse to stop by the bakery on my way out to indulge in the chocolate rugelach (roo-gah-la). Dozen, two dozen? They are fantastic fresh and stay delicious for a few days, so feel free to go overboard.
