Our praises are our wages.  -The Winter's Tale. . This is true of food worth eating, and certainly of the absolute deliciousness served up at Baohaus.. . While review after review extols the savory, luscious flavors of the Chairman Bao and the smoky sweetness of the Bao Fries with sesame (my personal favorite), most lament the slightly steep prices of the food served up in this teensy shop.  Let's face it, $4-$4.50 for a small-ish sandwich is not what most would want to spend, but when you're getting humanely raised pork and beef and organic tofu that's made to order the price is totally worth it.  Just think of the extra couple bucks you spend as going to happy animals, small business owners, and a cleaner environment.  Now doesn't that make you feel better?. . On a side note, it's entirely possible to be full after indulging in one sandwich and some fries, or two baos.  Go to Baohaus.  I promise it's worth it and that you'll find it impossible not to go back.
