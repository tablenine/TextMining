Restaurant: Buona Terra
Category: Italian
I live in Logan Square and love that there are good places to dine.  Buona Terra is such a good comfort food place.  The first time I came here was years ago with my then-boyfriend-now-husband and his cousin.  When I go to Italian restaurants, I always get pasta.  And Buona Terra pasta does not disappoint.  I love their veal ravioli with the fresh mozzarella.  Normally, I don't eat veal but I always make an exception when I am here.  I am such a creature of habit that I continually order the same thing when I come here but isn't that why I keep coming back?
