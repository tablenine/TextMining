Restaurant: Wakamono
Category: Sushi Bars
Atmosphere: minimalist-mod decor, dim lighting, young trendsetting crowd...slightly noisy with all the chitter chatter, but you can def. hold a convo with your table. I've been here a few times and the highlight of my last visit was the most recently added bar/lounge area. I can't think of any better way to spend my time waiting for a table, than socializing and throwing back a few drinks before dinner. *love* it.. . Service: Very quick but not overly friendly.. . Food: Have enjoyed all rolls here except the green emerald. There's just way too much rice on that roll. However, strongly reccomend the white tuna w/almonds - very different from the usual and also the spicy calamari appetizer. Yum!
