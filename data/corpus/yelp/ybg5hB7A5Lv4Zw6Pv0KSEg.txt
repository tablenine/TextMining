Well it looked upscale for a sports grill/ bar so that was a plus. The atmosphere was pretty cool with the tvs and lounge type areas which made the place kind of comfortable. The food was not good at all, but the waiter was very nice. The food is not worth it for the prices...OVERPRICED! Actually...the drinks were not good either...minus another star.
