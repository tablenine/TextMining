Oh crap.  I think I've crossed the line.  I've either developed an  "appreciation for the finer things" or I've turned into a pretentious yuppie asshole. . . This is my new favorite beer, which i discovered at Bluebird:. . t Smisje Guido - a Belgian Strong Ale . Brewed by Brouwerij De Regenboog in Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium
