Restaurant: Eclipse Di Luna - Park Place
Category: Tapas Bars
I absolutely love Eclipse Di Luna.  If you go on a weekend at perimeter location make sure you make reservations if you want a seat.  And all ppl of your party need to be present to get seated.  Drinks are always great, they can make anything I believe.  Great crowd and music.  Lots of pretty people.  The spanish ribs, fried green beans, calamari, and empanadas are great.  I have had almost everything on the menu.  They cant split checks, but take multiple forms of payment for the check.  The best thing to do is write your name, payment method, and amount on the back of the check  Food comes out promptly.  Service is good, you can only ecpect a waiter/waitress to be able to do so much when its so busy and everybody is asking for something constantly, asking questions about food and stuff.  They atleast remember what I'm drinking on amoutg the dozens of other peoples drinks.. . One last thing, it is a tapas restaurant meaning small plates, portions of great food at small prices.  Don't expect this big plate of food.  Remember great food, cocktails ,and wine and beer make a fun time.
