Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
Let's start with the strong points. Location, ambiance, service, and view. Yamashiro's is located atop a hill overlooking Hollywood so you can imagine the view is incredible, if you're lucky enough to be seated next to the window. Bright lights, mood lighting...if ever you needed to impress your dinner guests this would be the place. The servers are attentive and helpful. . . However, you can't win me over just on fancy property and good looks! You gotta have quality food too! My only grip is that the food is expensive for the quality of food. I don't mind paying extra bucks for good sushi, but at Yamashiro's it's fusion so you're not really putting those extra $$ into quality cuts of premium fish. *le sigh* . . We ordered the Darth Vader roll, which was decent! But for the price tag not really worth it. I had the Shoyu Glazed black cod which was tasty...well seasoned, you could taste the wasabi in the potatos again it was good but not AMAZING. We also tried the Tropical Albacor Ceviche which was hardly memorable. . . I have to say presentation, service, ambiance is top notch food - is decent ... So if you're trying to impress someone take them here if they're not a food lover. Else save your pennies for a better taste experience.
