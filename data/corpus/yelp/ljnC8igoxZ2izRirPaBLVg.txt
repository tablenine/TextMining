Day-to-day, Im mainly a vegetarian. I eat a lot of Morningstar, and the only "meat" I cook at home is fish. But I am a meat-eater when I go out, and, boy, what a carnivore I turn into when at Fogo!. . I love their asparagus, and its really the only thing I eat from the salad bar. My best friend always has about 4 helpings of the salmon though, and would probably just order that if it werent a measly ten or fifteen dollar difference between getting just the salad bar or the whole shabang. I think the cheesy rolls are great, but Houstons Fogo has better cheesy rolls. The polenta is ok, but that and the mashed potatos leave something to be desired.. . I love the normal filet mignon, filet wrapped in bacon, chicken wrapped in bacon, picanha (sirloin), and parmesan pork. Those five are the only meats I eat here - theyre so divine that the others must not be able to compare (or so my thinking goes).. . Tres Leches for dessert is a MUST! Best tres leches Ive ever had...melts in your mouth.. . Minus 1 star because for the price Id like a bit more variety - maybe another chicken, or a turkey, selection? Some kind of roasted ham?
