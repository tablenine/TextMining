Go for the martini's first and foremost...I happen to prefer the mojito's but that's just moi!. . Great place to do a girl's get together...went here recently with a gaggle of 8 or 9 women and had a wonderful dinner, good conversation, lovely service, etc.  Not a good joint for picking up the opposite sex per se...more of a place you go to just chill and have a drink with friends.  . . Parking is readily available on Fairfax and nearby residential streets or you can valet...whichever blows yer skirt up.
