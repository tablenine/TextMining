I booked a table 6 weeks ahead for my boyfriend's birthday.  While the food was good, we had awful service:  After our order was placed with a lot of misguidance ("How's the fish?  "Get the rabbit."  "We only eat fish."  "Try the quail."), we never saw our waiter again until I had to speak with a manager about the lack of service (And perhaps it would have been better if he hadn't shown up again).  Wine and water ordered never arrived until we asked someone else and they had to ask which wine it was because it had been ...lost? forgotten? never entered? Who knows. The wine arrived some time after our first course. No balsamic or olive oil with the bread although every other table received it.  The waiter showed up at the end of our meal and apologized in a condescending manner saying "I'm sorry we got off to a rough start,"  then approached when my boyfriend was gone to ask if I wanted to get some birthday dessert. I said that I had a surprise dessert at home and we just wanted to go. He came back with a single scoop of ice cream and said in front of my boyfriend "I know you've got something waiting at home but here's a little dessert." Thanks. Surprise ruined!! So disappointed that a great meal was diminished by such awful service.
