This is another cool spot for a date night, though it can get pretty loud with the large surrounding parties. The atmosphere is dim-lit w/ high ceilings and a European flair. It's great for dinner and/or drinks if you're in the downtown area. Â Use the valet parking next to the building, unless you want to street park and experience dodging the homeless bums on the way to the entrance. . . Some of my recommendations are:. . - Eggplant Parmagian. - Bucatini Pesto. - Portabello Fries (everyone has recommended these but I personally think it's a little much on the salty side). - Green Tea Mojito. - Bruschetta. - Macaroons (chocolate, pistachio, lemon and strawberry flavors). . Oh, and at the end of the night, if you're there late enough, they give away goody bags of free dessert items. Be on the lookout for that!
