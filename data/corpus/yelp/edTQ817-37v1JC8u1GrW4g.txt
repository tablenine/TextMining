Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
I've been eating here my entire life where french dip sandwiches were invented.  in fact, this is the only place i can have french dip sandwiches.  gotta stick to the original with a side of cole slaw or potato salad.  since cole's closed for remodeling, this is now the oldest restaurant in la (continuously at one location).
