OK, this club is kind of overrated. I'm giving it 2 stars, b/c it wasn't THAT bad...but it wasn't that great either. I'll admit I'm a sucker for the Hills, so I was dying to go to this place after seeing Lauren go there in almost every episode. The club is kind of small and it's not as nice looking as it is in the TV show (big surprise there, huh?) I guess I went in with big expectations, so that was my problem.
