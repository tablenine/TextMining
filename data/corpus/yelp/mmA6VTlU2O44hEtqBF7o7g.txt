I had this weird drink with a blood orange and champagne that was tasty and sweet and it gave me a good buz. My friend had the Basil/Lime Elixer and she seemed to blossom in front of my very own eyes.. . The noodle dumplings were completely different from what I expected them to be. For one, I thought I'd get a round, spring roll type of dish, but I got a flat pancake sandwich-like thing with little bits of tofu in it. I had the chicken noodle bowl, and although it was good, I think I'd get something else next time. They have a very wide selection of fresh, appetizing food.
