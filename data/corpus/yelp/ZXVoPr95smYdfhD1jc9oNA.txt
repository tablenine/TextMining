I mean it's not the best french dip I've had. That would be at Houston's, which uses prime rib. But it's kinda fun, tasty cafeteria type of french dip and food. Except you don't get your own au jus to dip yourself. I prefer the lamb sammich. The cole slaw is sweet and good. The potato salad is pretty good. It's kinda cheesy and old skool. It's comfort food. Yeah, that's it. And the mustard has such a bite.
