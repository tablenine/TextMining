Restaurant: Wilde Bar &amp; Restaurant
Category: Pubs
My fiancee and I recently bought a condo around the corner from Wilde and went there when it first opened.  We've been back several times now, and I'm glad to say that I have yet to leave unsatisfied!  Their food is great - I'm a huge fan of their salmon, meatloaf, and their chopped salad.  Drink selections are good as well.  This is a restaurant that this area of Lakeview needed!
