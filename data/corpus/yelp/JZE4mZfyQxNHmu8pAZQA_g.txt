I love coming here! The cappucino is soo addicting. Sweet ice tea is refreshing. Hot chrysanthmum is great in the winter.. . Almost everything on the menu is delicious at this little place. But they are most Famous for their Hainan chicken and Curry beef stew (I love their fried onions on this dish). Escargot and shrimp Eggrolls are delicious.  They're little pizza like breads are great for dipping in Curry and eggroll sauces.. . The only downside is they try to rush you out for a faster turnover. Fast and friendly service though.  I like sitting in the patio most because of the breeze and space. The inside is a little small.  Take out is great too!
