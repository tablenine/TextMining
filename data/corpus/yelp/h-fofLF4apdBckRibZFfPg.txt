This place has a gorgeous view from the top of a hill overlooking the city which made it seem pretty awesome. However in my opinion the food was average and nothing special. Sushi was okay, but not as good as a hole in the wall place and overpriced. The calimari tempura was about my only favorite thing and my entree of their only shrimp dish was okay (forgot the name). The dessert yama'smore was a huge smore and excellent as well! I'll probably never come back here unless I go with a group cause everything is very pricey for just the location, not the quality of food.
