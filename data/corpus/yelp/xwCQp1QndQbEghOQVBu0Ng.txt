I have been to Toast many times, so I can say this place is a hit or a miss. Which is why I am giving this place 3 stars. It's a great place to have brunch on a nice day. I would preferably sit outside but I wouldn't mind sitting inside either since you can usually get seated faster if you request for a table inside. We usually ask for whatever that's available first, and we get seated right away at the indoor seating. . . Today my boyfriend and I decided to go for brunch since it was so nice out. As always, people were waiting to get seated. We asked for first available seating and we got seated indoors right away. There were times when service was bad, and we waited forever to get served. There were also times when the staff was rude. But today, the service was great. We got seated, and got greeted right away. . . I got: . The Portobello - Portobello mushrooms, mild jalapenos, cheddar, mozzarella, green onion topped with sliced avocado: $10.95 ( $12.45 With egg whites) . . My boyfriend got: . Eggs Benedict - Poached eggs and Ham served on a toasted English muffin covered in hollandaise sauce: $11.95 . . . http://www.yelp.com/bi.... . . My omelet was eh~ OK, but my boyfriends eggs benedict was REALLY good. It's now his favorite thing on the menu~ and it might just be mine too! . . I only give this place 3 stars, but I know I will keep coming back here~ maybe if they stay consistent with their service, I might raise it up to 4! he he
