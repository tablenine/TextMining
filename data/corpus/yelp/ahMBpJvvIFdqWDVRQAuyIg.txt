Rules in effect: No one under 18 allowed. Why: Light 'em if you got 'em. . So don't bring your tots to this "Hells Angels" type of place b/c it's get rowdy! Thursday is the classic bike night anytime its warm enough to ride your sled but us bikers are anything but trouble makers. Usually, it's the OTP people w/ kids hollering and demanding to be served. I should know, been going here for years and seen it many times. . The food is well...bar food but it's above par. Burgers are tasty but not the best in Atl. The rest of the menu is actually pretty decent. You go there not for the food, you go there for the whole experience. People watching is the term kids use these days. . Why they opened one in midtown is beyond my understanding...it is terrible. The entire midtown staff (servers, cooks, bartender, door guys,etc) have zero personality and 100% attitude. The L5P is like going home to me. So, fire up them cafe racers and old skool chops and take a ride over, just don't park up front with some hog riding bitch. You'll get more than stares and pointing fingers! lol. . Vroom vroom
