Took the advice of fellow Yelpers and headed town to Papa Cristos. Wow, I feel like I have just stepped into a mini Greek Village. This huge building has a market place and the food place and then a huge seating area to eat. Delicous fresh lamb and chicken kabob.. Nifty alternative sodas and at reasonable prices when you're on a budget. Best of all...fresh french baquette is baked here so when you get yours...it is still warm, soft and crispy. Yummy factor off da hook.. . Thanks fellow yelpers.
