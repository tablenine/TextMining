Ok I definitely see how it can be more hassle than necessary. if you venture out on a weekend night. It's also questionable. as a veg why I'm so fascinated with a good sausage but. hey the veggie mexican chipotle sausage was sooooo. good! I like that you can pick your toppings, I got some grilled. onions and peppers I believe. I also added a bit of mustard . (probably not the most conventional mix, but it tasted delish). . . I also like that once you make it in the door, they will serve. you drinks while you wait in line. And nothing makes you. feel better than some refreshing belgian beer. . . It would be nice if the location wasn't such a pain to get to. and if you aren't into the whole scene--hipsters, shared. tables, loud music-- whilst eating, probably best to go. during downtime. We only had to wait about 15-30 mins. which was just enough time to get you slightly annoyed,. however the food made up for it. . . And I could definitely do with another tasty veg sausage. right about now...
