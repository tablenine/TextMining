The best thing about this place is playing "Guess Your Server's Chromosome Pairings" while waiting for average food served with awe inducing snotty attitude under an umbrella of music so loud your balls bounce on the chair on which you're perched. Â Boystown is a bastion of culinary mediocrity and in following suit this place does not disappoint.
