Restaurant: Pasta Da Pulcinella
Category: Italian
I'd never heard of this until the boyfriend recommended it for date night this week.  It was on . http://restaurant.com. , a MUST for us!  Though I've been in the area several times before, I NEVER noticed this place.  I thought that it was adorable that it was an old house, gutted out to make a cozy little restaurant.  . . It was a beautiful night out, so I opted to sit on the porch.  I was a little annoyed that some other folks on the porch were smoking up a storm (I thought that you weren't allowed to do that here?) and the smoke was flying directly into my face several tables away.  The host offered to turn on the fan on the porch, helped a little.  . . I had the caesar salad - it was just ok.  The bread service wasn't great.  They had rosemary scented olive oil on the table, the bread tasted a little stale.  No one offered me any parmesan (which I dearly love in my dipping sauce).  . . For the main course - we had the salmon and lobster ravioli.  I fell in love, it was excellent!  The lobster was genuine, the sauce was creamy.  The salmon was tender and seasoned well.  The mashed potatos were pretty tasteless, though.  I hope that my suspicion that they were instant is not correct.  Perhaps they should avoid the potatoes and figure out a way to make that a pasta dish?  . . I'm not a drinker, but did notice the extensive wine list.  They do not have drinks on tap (soda) which is kinda annoying.  The tea isn't sweet - this is the SOUTH, put some sugar in that while its still hot!. I'll definitely be back and hope better for the bread!
