Restaurant: Pylos
Category: Greek
This is my favorite Greek restaurant in Manhattan, definitely one of the best places in the East Village. Really attentive, friendly service. Loved the moussaka offerings, soutzoukakia smyrneika, and pastitsio; the galaktobourekakia is an awesome dessert. The atmosphere is cozy and rustic, great for two, though I probably wouldn't attempt to come here with more than four people at a time. The menu is embarrassingly unpronounceable, so be prepared to do some menu item pointing and "Could I please have the ga...lak...tob...this, uh, this first one here?" The waiters won't judge you. They will serve you in a timely fashion and be sincerely happy to hear that you've enjoyed it, and you will leave thoroughly satisfied, if not bursting at the seams.
