I TRULY HEART THEIR CHEESE ROLLS!!!!  seriously... this is how all cheese rolls should taste like!!! oh so yummy!  why can't they open one in the OC?!? cuz i'll be gaining lbs and lbs of fat!! hahahaha. yes, my fav is the cheese rolls~  but i also love their steak tortas: strips of grilled steak, guacamole, black bean spread, cotija cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes, on French bread. yummmmm~ it comes with banana chips but i don't care for much.  and of course i have to pick up few meat pies, potato balls, ham croquette, tamales, and chorizo pies.  and few more CHEESE ROLLS!!!  . . there's always a long line, but it moves really fast..  and you can't beat the flavor and the quality!!! IT'S DELISH!!!!
