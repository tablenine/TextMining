Excellent place for wings.  That special sweet and peppery taste, just love it.  However, the rest of the menu items were just ok.  We did over order, but the kitchen did not pace our order, so, most food arrived at the same time.  By the time we get around to certain dishes, the food was cold.  The next time, we will place order in parts.  The drawback to this place is that being an Izakaya, they don't sell sake by the bottle only in those tiny carafe.  Oh well, it did save us some money, since we ended up ordering two pitchers of beer at $15 each and only two large carafe of sake.  Otherwise, we would of ordered 2 to 3 bottles of sake at $50 each.  Great place for the wings.
