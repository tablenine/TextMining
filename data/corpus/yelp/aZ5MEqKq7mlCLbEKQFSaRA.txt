I came here with my girlfriend once for Valentine's Day. It was so hard getting a reservation but I did it! Yes I know, I was such a good boyfriend. It is a trendy restaurant in the smack of Hollywood. Anyways, on to the review. . . When we came in we noticed the exotic looking restaurant. I also noticed many people dressed very nicely and I even think I saw an actor there. After waiting for like 15 minutes we were called to our table and the hot waitress gave us our menu and explained to us that all the meals are put in the center, and you share. It was a smart idea, since we were sharing anyways. It made the date more romantic which was a plus for me :). We ordered about 3 plates and we were full. It came out to about 60 dollars for the both of us but we enjoyed every bite.. . Did I mention they have a full bar?? If you want to come here and enjoy some sushi with your buddies, come have a drink. But let me warn you, your tab will definitely rise after a few of their drinks ;). Definitely recommend
