The Versailles No.6 Garlic Chicken is the best chicken I have ever had, including fried chicken, barbequed, roasted, grilled, smoked or however. The Garlic Chicken is so good, I don't get anything else on the menu because I just can't pass it up, every bite is exhilarating. One time I did order a ribeye steak and it was very mediocre at best, same for the salads, so I just get the G.C. and that's all I need. If that isn't enough, I don't leave hungry AND the G.C. is a steal for what they charge for it.
