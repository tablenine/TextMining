With the location to my work, you would think I'd be there everyday. However, since they got rid of the $1 Kettle Ones, I can't afford a daily stop. . . Things you should know.... . . 1) Since the Kettle One special halted, they have continued to have some sort of drink special. The current wine special: A list of over a dozen different wines for $10 by the bottle or $3 by the glass. I'm a wine lover, so I'm loving the new special. . . 2) The entrees are just okay. I suggest going during the 1/2 appetizer times during the week: Monday-Thursday 5-7pm, 1/2 ALL appetizers. My husband and I shared 4, plus I had a glass of wine, and our tab was like $22. My favorite two: the meat grape leaves, and the cheese egg roll contraption. . . 3) They offer valet parking, but during the week there's plenty of street parking. If you don't have the cash on you, grab a street spot. . . 4) The service I've had there has been pretty spotty. Sometimes excellent, other times just horrible. I've been there over a dozen times now, so it's been so mixed; that I can't pin point an exact overall rating. If you go and have bad service, ask to speak to the Manager/Owner. He's a very nice reasonable man, and I'm sure he'll do or say something that will make you want to come back again.... . 5) On weekends they offer hookahs with different flavored tobacco. I've never done it, but maybe it's your thing. . . 6) Sleek &amp; trendy; to me makes it an every once in a while stop, because of the atmosphere and the food. Both good, but not something I'm craving on a weekly basis. . . You should try it out though - I totally recommend it. Hope my tips help makes your experience a good one!
