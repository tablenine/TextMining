Went here for brunch over the summer.. Had the taste protein scramble with potatoes and I recall it being really good, especially the potatoes. Great atmosphere for brunch... I regret parking valet because there were metered spots in the front and the valet guy barely even had to park my car, but besides that it was a great experience. Can't wait to go back and try something different...
