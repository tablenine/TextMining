This place is adorable. I think I've fallen in love. Everyone mentions going for brunch but I met up with a friend for dinner here and the ambiance was so nice, really homey and comfortable. I'm a sucker for cafes with outdoor seating, throw some pretty Christmas lights around trees and I'm a happy camper. The service could be better - I kept waiting for someone to come by so I could get the rest of my dessert to go, but ended up having to go back inside to get box. Not a huge deal. Speaking of dessert - HUGE points there. The chocolate pecan pie was amazing, and massive. My panini with brie and apples and onions - yum yum yum. Fries were okay, just fries. Lemonade was fresh. So good.. . This is one of those places that I'd love to make a regular spot. Next up, breakfast.
