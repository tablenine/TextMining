Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Ok...so...Friday night at around midnight we threw in the towel and on our way home we thought Pink's sounded really good and the line shouldn't be that long so early....... WRONG.. . We waited an hour and a half for these hot dogs, which were pretty frickin' good.  But were they good because I was starving at that point and I could've eaten doo-doo on a stick and thought it was good at that point?  Who knows.. . Bottom line is that I enjoyed it a lot.  I got the Martha Sterwart dog and IF (big IF!) I ever find my way back at Pink's I would order a polish dog.  Those looked pretty good.. . Their fries - not so hot in my book and the root beer they have is so-so, it's a bit on the spicey side, and I'm not into that, not with my root beer at least.  Cheers to Pink's at being it's 437th review or something ridiculous.
