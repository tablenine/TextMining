Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
Moody's is a place that changes drastically from summer to winter: In the summer, the outdoor beer garden is open, and invites you to lounge at a table in the open air with a burger, a beer, and some friend or maybe a book. In the winter, it's time to hole up inside the dark, cave-like interior and warm up near the fires with a big burger and a pitcher of dark lager.. . Either way, Moody's is a "comfort" sort of place for me, to just hang out and relax with some friends for a while. The wait staff tends to be attentive, polite and prompt, without harassing you when you're obviously just chilling out for a while. The burgers don't qualify as "gourmet," but they're big, well-made and delicious. The fries are tasty too. The beer selection isn't spectacular, but it has some good standby options and will satisfy casual drinkers.. . For just hanging out with friends over burgers and beer, there aren't many places as conducive to the right atmosphere as Moody's.
