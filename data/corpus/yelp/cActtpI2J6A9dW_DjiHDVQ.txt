How have I not written a review about Manny's? Seriously?. I love this place. . . Sometimes I find myself so seriously jonesing for this place it is absolutely ridiculous. . . I don't even know where to begin.... . To me, Manny's is a Chicago institution. To me, the usual is corned beef and a potato pancake, but don't let that deter you from ordering their other deliciously cooked and lovingly sliced meats. Yep, I said it. I used those words when referring to meat. And what? This food will guarantee to fill you up, and probably a hearty lunch the next day too. Don't expect fancy combination or exotic ingredients... that's not what Manny's it about. There is REAL beef in the beef stew... cooked with BEEF stock, with carrots, celery, and potato. That's it... nothing that you can't pronounce or need a special pig to dig out of a tree.. . Manny's... serious food for serious eaters.
