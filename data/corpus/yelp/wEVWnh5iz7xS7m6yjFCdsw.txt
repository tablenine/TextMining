You could play pin-the-tail-on-the-pastry here and everything you might hit would knock your socks off.  I'm not an adventurous eater by any means, but even I've strayed from the chocolate croissants and plain pan to try the guava and cheese pastry (which may not be weird to you but it is to me!) and other interesting blends they've baked up.  Every visit I expand my horizons with one new item; however, there is simply one Porto's staple that my ravenous eyes and belly must consume from the hot counter each and every trip:  the infamous potato ball.  . . Whoever thought this one up goes right down in the record books with the chef who first fried a ball of mac n' cheese.  Seriously?  Who can resist a dollop of yummy ground beef (seasoned oh so well), thickly layered in mashed potatoes, then fried.  Voila!!   The most superb thing to come in ball form... at least that I can think of.. . Porto's is a Glendale must.  If you've driven this far into the smoogy gloom trapped by the foothills, you need to exit Brand and get yourself a potato ball... and something else tasty to go with it.
