Restaurant: The Flying Biscuit
Category: American (Traditional)
I LOVE the flying biscuit. I usually come for brunch. The biscuits are incredible. And the food is just sooo good. The food is very fresh and there are a lot of healthy and organic options. Rachael Ray eats here. So has Justin Timberlake when he is in town. Enough said!
