I love me some Versailles.  The reason I don't go as often as I'd like to is because it is a bit far for me.  I had mentioned to a friend that I liked Cuban Bistro and she happened to live down the street from Versailles.  One day when my husband and I went to Venice Beach, we were cruising around and we came across Versailles.  I begged to try it and we were both glad that we did.. . I had the Lechon Asado and it just melted in my mouth.  The onions are just barely sauteed, so if you don't like onions on the raw side, you may not care for their onions.  I, thankfully, like onions in all forms.  My husband had the garlic chicken.  It just came right off of the bone it was so tender.  I also don't know how I did it, but I saved room for flan and boy was I glad that I did.  . . We have returned a few times since that initial visit and have been happy each time.  The only drawback to this place is the parking.  They make the Hollywood Bowl parking lot look like a masterfully orchestrated lot.  ;)
