Joy Yee is the Joy to my Yee.. . It means I like this place a LOT. Not the Chinatown one in particular. This is a review for all Joy Yee.. . 1. Their food is consistent. From Naperville, to Chinatown, to University Village, to Evanston. Yes, I have been to all of them.. . 2. Their bubble tea *IS* the best in the city. Their smoothies too. Nowhere else can you beat the price and tastiness of their fresh mango smoothie.. . 3. How can you have 52846 things on your menu and keep the quality even and consistent at every location??? . . 4. While it may not be the best chinese/ best thai/best korean/best vietnamese/ best malaysian, joy yee is a place you can count on, and not disappoint. See #1 &amp; 3.. . 5. Large portions. sometimes very large. check with waiter if you are unsure.. . 6. Fast, easy, it does not pretend to be what it is not.. . 7. Large pictures so you know what you get! See #6!!. . Things I like: . -Basil Chow Fun. -Basil Fried Rice**. -Green Curry Chicken**. -Malaysian Baked Rice. -Seafood Baked Rice. -Mango Freeze w/tapioca. -Green Tea Freeze w/tapioca* (roundhouse kicks Starbucks Green Tea Frappucino's ass. serious)
