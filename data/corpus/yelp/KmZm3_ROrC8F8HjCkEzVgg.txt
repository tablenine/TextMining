Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I was kind of scared to go here. I always want to try out new sushi places and of course looked to yelp to see what the deal was. A lot of people said they got very sick after eating here! Not really what you want to hear minutes before you are headed somewhere..... No one got sick! Hooray! I really enjoyed Tank...the sushi was a little pricey, but tolerable. We tried a bunch of different rolls.....I have short-term memory loss so I have no idea of the names. Ocean Sundae I'm pretty sure...maybe a dynamite in there...Overall, the sushi was very tasty and fresh...no complaints. They had a okamount of variety although I saw a lot of tuna rolls on there...what's up with the tuna yo? And rolls, now nigri or sashimi... For a Thursday night it wasn't that busy, but there were people coming in every few minutes. The service was good and the atmosphere was nice. Everyone from kids to adults were in here enjoying some sushi. They have a bar and TV's to catch the games at.. Will definitely go back!
