I have been to Ben pao a number of times and to me, it fits the majority of the LEYE places - the food is ok, service is fine but you are not going to walk out of there totally wowed or impressed.   . . I had a work dinner with a number of out of town guests.  We took roughly 18 people out here for dinner after a long day of meetings.   Our host pre-ordered which helped with having to eliminate all the deciding.   . . First frustration was they would not seat the party until most of the guests arrived.  Unofrutnately, Ben Pao does not have a party room, just a big table in the back behind some bamboo.   Since we were all walking, people arrived at all different times.  After being sat down, they gave good recommendations on wine that would pair well with the food.   Appetizers came out - we had chicken potstickers (good), fried tofu (which actually might have been the highlight of the night for me since I normally don't eat tofu) and eggrolls (they can keep em).   Dinner was mongolian beef (average), sesame chicken (average), scallops (poor) with some green beans and white rice.   10 minutes after we started eating, brown rice was brought to the table with many apologies.   The food to me was no better and likely worse than PF Changs which I consider to be a 3 star type place.   . . The dining room was not very busy and while it was midweek, with the recent passing of Vong's Thai Kitchen (which I loved), you have to wonder how much longer this place has.
