I've been going to Porto's for years, and every time, I am not disappointed. Whenever I bring a guest from out of town, I am always asked, "what's good here?" My reply is simply everything. . . Favorite cake: fruit tart and mango mousse. . . Sandwiches are off the chain. Semi panini styled and served with banana chips. . . And you can't forget the potato ballz! It's a ball of mashed potatoes with meat in the center, then deep fried to stay solidly round. . . nom nom nom.
