I was looking forward to trying them out.  But man!  What a mistake!  This place blows!  . . The hot dogs are tiny.  The dogs are not grilled/charred, probably steamed or boiled?, shoved into a bun and then the soggy fries piled onto top of it.  The whole thing is then wrapped up in paper.  By the time I unwrapped it, it was a soggy, messy, unappetizing pile of mangled fries, broken up bun and grease...  Ewww gross.. . It seems to me that a lot of the people that likes this place grew up eating there.  That's cool for nostalga and such, but come on...  Let's look at the dog for the dog.  And the truth is this place served up a mediocre dog at best.  . . Go to SuperDawg for a much better dog.
