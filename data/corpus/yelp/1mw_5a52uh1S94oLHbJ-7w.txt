New to Los Angeles. New to owning a car again. New to LA Â traffic. Not new is the New York attitude toward sitting in said traffic. New to cheating and failing to avoid the traffic by finding side streets to get around Dodger game traffic. Not new to illegal maneuvering in new car ala New York crazy driver style. Almost and hour and a half later coming from Hollywood i turn to my close friend visiting from NY, "This better be some kickass dip sandwich! Taking suggestions from 'Man vs. Food' better be worth it or you're paying for my lunch." (She's cute, my NY friend. She writes down everything. This time she wrote down all the latest episodes of the show and of all the attractions in LA, she had to cross off eating at Philippe's from her bucket list because Adam said so.. . Never trust the GPS around Dodger stadium, oh no. . . Double dip pork sandwich with jack cheese, split the coleslaw and split a heaping bowl of bean-less chili with cheddar and onions on top. Oh, and a cold Fat Tire on tap to top it all off. Slather on some hot mustard and you've got the kick of a wasabi-like sting in your nose. Soooo good! Both our affects changed immediately upon first bite. (Actually, it began in line when I started singing the "Chips" theme song in earshot of the motorcycle cops in the adjacent line.) i turned to my NY friend and said, "Sonia, I'm buying YOUR lunch!". . Always trust a TV host, oh yes.
