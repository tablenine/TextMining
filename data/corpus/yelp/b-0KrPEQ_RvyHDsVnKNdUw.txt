Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
I am a man, my needs are simple but numerous. A nice home, a car that won't break down, my friends, a kick ass DSL connection and a beautiful woman or two are but a few of my necessities to make me a happy Welshman.... . Another major need of mine is meat. I likes me some meat, meat in my mouth makes me happy Â (no snickering in the cheap seats).. . I have been to Fogo de Chao several times and I have now refined to an art the best way to satisfy my meat needs.. . Yes there is a kick ass salad bar, yes the bread is good, but do not let these temptations distract you from the true joy of FdC...MEEEAAATTTT!. . By all means get a few veggies to complement the feast, but do not over-stuff on this frill!. . The beef, the sausages, the chicken and of course the delicious lamb chops are what you should be cramming down the neck hole. The gauchos are walking around to offer you their meat swords, so take advantage and keep that little coaster on green for 'feed me!'. . I also like that it is a place that you can dress smartly and not feel out of place, which I like to do now and then, especially if there is a beautiful woman on my arm.. . If you have any space left after the orgy of meat, then the desserts are killer too, which is nice.
