Restaurant: Ecco
Category: Modern European
So I stroll into Ecco last night with my friends Lisa and Nichole, it's a frigid night and we're on our way to another event. Let me just say Ecco has a great flair. The establishment is very well appointed and inviting.. . We decide to sit at the bar, we're at the far end which provided a great view of the restaurant overall. No sooner than we grab our seats, we're greeted by the friendly bartender and he sets our places.. . For a Tuesday night, it sure wasn't empty. They seemed to be doing some good business. Nice mix of people.. . The drink menu was great, I tried the Lemonade Provencal and the Long Live the Queen. I was more partial to the lemonade. Food wise I had the Pommes frites and the Fried Goat Cheese. Both were extremely tasty and in good portions.. . Really nice experience and I look forward to having a full-on meal here sometime soon.
