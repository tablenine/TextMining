Yay:  The ropa vieja sandwich--perfection.  Media noche sandwich with croquetas--incredible.  Potato balls, meat pies, croquetas--delicious.  Also love their sweets.  Sooo good!  Service is excellent.. . Eh:  Long lines at times, but definitely worth the wait.. . Boo:  No boos from me, not with this place.
