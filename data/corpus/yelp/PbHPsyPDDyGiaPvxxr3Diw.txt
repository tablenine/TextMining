Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
If you can get past the long wait, prepare to demolish your stomach and spend a bit of time in the bathroom. I came here last week and ordered a pastrami burrito dog, which was exactly what it sounded like... with chili inside. I also opted for chili cheese fries. I don't know, I guess I have this obsession for chili. . . Let me tell you in advance, don't get this burrito dog unless you plan on eating the rest later or you plan on splitting it. It's good after a few bites, but then it becomes an obligation to finish it. . . On other visits, I usually get the millennium or the ozzy spicy dog. Those never fail me, and I like em with guacamole. I should have have stuck with either of them because they're not as overwhelming. Chili cheese fries are must though.. . They have a water cooler off to the side for your convenience, but the cups are small. So if you want water, be ready to make more than one trip to the cooler. Despite the long lines, there's usually a table open for you and your party to take. I've been rather lucky to score a parking space in the back lot, so I've had no problems each time. . . With the abundance of hot dogs, its going to take many trips to try everything. I'm not gonna go here every weekend to do it, but its a nice treat to have once in awhile when I'm in SoCal. If you don't want to fill yourself up, split with a friend. I'll stick with my Costco polish dog for now though. Cash only at Pink's. Cheerio.
