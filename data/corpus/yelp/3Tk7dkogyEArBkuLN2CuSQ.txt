With places like this that have so many reviews and such high ratings, I always feel like it doesn't matter whether or not I add in my two cents.  But I love to yelp when I'm hungry, and boy, am I hungry.. . The bf and I got here about 5ish mins before our reservations, checked in, and waited outside with the other 15+ish people waiting for a table.  About 15-20 mins go by without being called, so the bf goes inside to check what's taking so long.  Turns out, the guy forgot about us (I know, I know, Marisa- why are you still giving them 5 stars?  Let me explain)!  So he profusely apologizes and gives us the next available seating.  We order the shrimp tempura, soft shell crab, and the dinner sashimi plate.  When we were ordering our drinks, the host came and told our waitress the sake was on HIM, because he felt so bad about forgetting about us.  Talk about awesome- especially in such a crowded restaurant, he really didn't have to do that.  So a big thank you to the host!  Anyway, food was great, super fresh, super delish.  You can read about the delishiousness from all the sushi connoisseurs.   Great place, great peeps, great spooshi.
