Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Sooo....I drive by and noticed a LONG line. I decide to stop by since my buddies kept telling me to stop for a few dogs. So we lined up....for like 45 minutes!!! RAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First tricked by SPRINKLES now this!! The hot dog was very typical! Actually I've been to TOPS which is much better than this! I think most of the people lining up here are here because they saw a long line and thought "Hey it must be good here".....cause it worked on us......and its not that there are a lot of people its that the line moves soooooo slow!. . Food: 3. Service: 1. Environment: 2. Price: 2
