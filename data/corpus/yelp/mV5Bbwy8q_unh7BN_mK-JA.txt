Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
I've been going here for the past 7 years and I have never been disappointed with my meals - this place is awesome.  Great for casual dining, great for a date and very good food too.. . My favorite dish is the Grilled Chicken Breast with Rice... I typically start off with a side salad and one of the main attractions for me is their Chimichurri  (and bread) - excellent!!!. . Prices are resonable, decor is nice, valet or street parking available.. . If you're in the mood for some Argentinean food... check out LaLa's, you will not be disappointed!!!
