Wow, it's hard to mess up scrambled eggs and bacon, but Toast just aced the task.    There was truly nothing tasty on my plate. The eggs were unusually dry, the bacon ash-like and nuked beyond recognition, and the pototates were basically cut-up French fries.   . . And the check:  $11.00 including coffee --  a meal Norm's or Denny's would charge $3.99 for, and deliver better food.. . Just to complete the experience, the waitress was as disappointing as the food.  It took her a ridiculously long time getting to my table (I read the entire Sports section), she had no clue about how the potatoes are cooked with breakfast, and I found her sitting in the back at a table with another waiter when I went looking for my bill.. . Yikes.   . . I truly got burnt at Toast.
