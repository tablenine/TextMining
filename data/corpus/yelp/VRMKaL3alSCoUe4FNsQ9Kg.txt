A corollary to the fact that Caribbeans can cook well: they can also bake up a storm. Oh sweeet Jesús, the baked goods at Porto's should be a sin. The pastries are something special... and seriously, everything I have tried so far I have liked a great deal.. . The potato balls rock.. deep fried on the outside, and smooth mashed potato and ground meat center. I am utterly helpless to the damn potato. The cheese rolls, is a lovely flaky pastry filled subtlety with cheese.. Meat pie is an awesome savory pastry, meaty in the middle, flaky sweet crust on the outside. Heck, actually  ALL their flaky-crusty-pastries are just darn good... . My first affair with Porto's was an excellent experience....... I'm ready for Round #2 with their cakes and food.. mmm!
