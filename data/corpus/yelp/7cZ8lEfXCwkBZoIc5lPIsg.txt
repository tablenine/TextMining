Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
This place deserves 2.5 stars, but unfortunately Yelp doesn't give that option.  The ramen here isn't bad by any means, but it isn't anything noteworthy either.  The noodles are bland and the broth relies way too much on saltiness rather than balanced flavor.  Also, they're a bit skimpy on the portions.  You can tell that they carefully measure/ration the amount of noodles they put in each bowl (in contrast to Daikokuya and Chin-Ma-Ya), which I consider to be a cardinal sin of ramen.. . This is a very forgettable ramen place; not bad, but also not anything I would ever write home about.  Chin-Ma-Ya downstairs is *much* better.
