Don't get my low rating wrong. Food is delicious, and after growing up eating S.Cal food, I know good Cal-Mex when I eat it.. Service SUCKS!!!! Get your food to go if you want to really enjoy it. Otherwise, you'll deal with waiting to get a table, having the worst service as your waitress trys to get you in/out ASAP.. Last night went with a party of 6. Didn't have to wait (first time ever) got sat downstairs where me and the rest of my party was bumped and knocked every couple of minutes as waiters/customers would walk by. Towards the end of the meal, I guess we weren't going fast enough, our waitress started clearing our table. I had a margarita which she promptly threw out. Although I was almost finished, she could've asked before she grabbed. When I said something to her, she just shrugged her shoulders, and didn't even apologize. we would've bought dessert, and more alcohol if she had ever returned to see if there was anything else we needed. Instead she tossed our check down, never to return except to give us the stink eye to get out. After that, they won't split checks on parties over 6. After the piss poor service, we still got dinged for the 20% grat.. When we tried to complain to the cashier, she really couldn't be bothered, and even just stopped me and answered the phone. IF I go back, it will only be for take out.
