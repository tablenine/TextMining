The #19 is to die for.  My husband, the lifelong Pastrami connoisseur, declares their sandwich THE BEST PASTRAMI SANDWICH he's ever had.  And believe me, he's had lots!  I believe it's their cole slaw and that mysterious russian dressing.  . . I will say that I was hesitate given the location, but they own the parking lot where we parked our car.  They not only validate for free parking once you eat there, they also have a camera pointing right at that lot, so I felt a lot safer when I saw that at the cashier stand.  The bathroom also surprised me, it was surprisingly clean.  I was expecting old and dingy, by got updated and clean.  I would even bring my kids there.  So, 3 thumbs up and 5 stars awarded!
