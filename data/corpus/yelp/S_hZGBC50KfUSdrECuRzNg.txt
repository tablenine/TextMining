I had my bachelorette party at Lola's. We had so much fun!!! They sat us in the private area because we had a large party. The service was awesome as well. The waiter came around continuously making sure we were okay with our drinks. I'm not normally a drinker but they have delightful martini's. The selection of martini's was quite impressive. The burger was yummy, a ground top sirloin and portabello mushroom cap served with fries. For dessert the Chocolate bread pudding with creme anglaise definitely satisfied my sweet tooth. The portions were huge. We all had food coma after but were all happy campers!
