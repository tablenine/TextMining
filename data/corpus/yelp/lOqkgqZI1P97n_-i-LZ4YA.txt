The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because I bit into a piece of the delicious bacon wrapped shrimp to find a long curly strand of hair. It made me think of good old home cooking.  Anyway that's how good this place was, i just put the shrimp down and moved on to my deep fried Quail which was so garlic(y) fantastic. the papaya salad was quite refreshing yet fire(y) and we ordered it medium, can't imagine what hot would have been like.  I ate a pepper to see the temp and it was quite frightening. needed beer but didn't bring any because i didn't know it was a byob joint, next time, *sigh*, i'll get it right. Three of us ordered 4 appetizers, 2 orders of sticky rice and then two desserts and it was quite filling. The dessert which was taro wrapped around sweet sticky rice was so scrumptious. . . Go here, but bring beer with you, especially if you like spice, trust me.
