Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Oh, my I'm going to have to be sacrilegious again--yet another legendary, mythic food spot that everyone always raves about, but, I finally get up there to try it, and well, um....meh. . . Titos has been around for decades, in fact it used to be next to Johnny's pastrami, but moved to it's present spot, when their original building got turned into a Taco Bell for awhile, and then a Lucy's for awhile (yeah I'm old, and grew up in CC). Somehow I never went there, I liked Lucy's well enough, and growing up my parents liked other local places like Canton Kitchen and Villa Italia, so as a kid without the decision making power I didn't get up there, and as a grown up, I had my set of favorites in the area (I still miss Larry's BBQ on washington, anyone else remember that)? I never tried Tito's mostly because whenever you go by there you see that line.. . So finally I ventured over (the line by the way moves pretty quick) and ordered some tacos getting ready for an authentic mexica.....oh wtf hard shells? Sigh. Well they smell pretty good....and they were...OK, but for the price...kind of small. As a fat man that loves his food, an important thing to me is the price/to portion/to greasiness level. I like spicy greasy food. I like big portions (because first, I'm usually pretty hungry and second, you can get a couple of meals off that $12 or whatever you just spent). . . So, the bottom line...it was...OK. Since I stay in the south bay, I would not make a special trip up there. As one person said, for hard shell tacos and blah burritos, there's taco bell (where you can still get a big sack of food and a large drink for like $8, by the way). . . Not recommended (sorry fans).
