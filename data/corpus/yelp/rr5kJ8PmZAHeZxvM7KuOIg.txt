Sure it was Passover, but our friend bequeathed his no-longer-needed reservations to us and the pizza crust is thin enough that it's more on the unleavened side of the bread spectrum.. . Our party of three had to wait 30 minutes past our reservation time to be seated, which was made easier by a bottle of wine ($35, which was on the cheaper end of their offerings).  Once we were seated, we were immediately brought two complimentary appetizers for our patience, which were very tasty.  We ordered another appetizer, which thankfully got lost in the shuffle, because by the end of the night we were very full.. . We ordered three pizzas, all of which were very good, but my favorite part of the meal was dessert.  The clementine gelato was outstanding and the other dessert---some sort of mint pie---was also good.. . ---. Take the MTA #10 or 11 to Melrose/Highland or the #212 or 312 to La Brea/Melrose and walk a few blocks east.
