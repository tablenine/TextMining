Restaurant: Uncle Julios Hacienda
Category: Mexican
My wife and I were in the neighborhood and decided to give Uncle Julio a chance. At the time, we were avoiding eating meat so we ordered the veggie fajitas. Traditional Tex-Mex veggie fajitas usually mean you get mostly onions and bell peppers. Surprising to me, the dish comes with mesquite grilled portabella mushrooms, zucchini, squash, sweet red and yellow onions, red potatoes, and roasted red poblano peppers. Of course you get your sides of Avocado and Pico De Gallo, but the waiter failed to tell us that so I ordered an extra Avocado. I felt he just wanted the sale, so it did effect our experience a little. The music was really good (salsa, cumbia, etc), but was a little on the loud side for a restaurant. Over all I thought is was good and I would go back for the same dish and maybe some drinks. . . I say go out and enjoy Uncle Julio's Hacienda. You won't be disappointed.
