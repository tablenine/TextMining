Restaurant: Spacca Napoli
Category: Pizza
I was pulled over as I was looking for parking at Spacca Napoli. Imagine flashing lights in the context of the serene-ish neighborhood where the restaurant is...it was pretty dramatic.. . Anyhow, I guess the cop looked into my car and saw two dorky grad students with seat belts un-amiss and decided we weren't really worth the effort, so we were let go to continue to dinner.. . The police ordeal? Took more time than dinner itself. Not a great place to have a romantic drawn out date. Much better for kid friendly dinner.. . The pizza was good. I've had neapolitan style pizza in the US with the VPN (vera pizza napoletana) stamp of approval. This was not the best of them (Punch in St. Paul, MN is.) The crust is perhaps too chewy -- I like mine with a touch of structure. The pizza must also be eaten quickly before the crust gets soggy. I thought the ingredient-to-crust ratio was a bit off, hence the sogginess.. . I took home a leftover piece and it was better reheated. (More integrity to the slightly drier crust.). . A plus: owner and staff are accommodating. The three stars? Great pizza, and certainly better than anything else in Chicago, but not the heights. (Also, I think there's too much grade inflation on Yelp, in general.)
