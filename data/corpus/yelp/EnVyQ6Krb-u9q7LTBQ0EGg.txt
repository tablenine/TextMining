I'll start by belaboring the obvious: the wait without reservations is frikkin' horrendous.  75 minutes on a recent Saturday night.  I must have annoyingly asked the host at least three times how much longer the wait would be, and he handled it most graciously each time.  Still, Domino's just two doors down started looking more and more tempting.  Just a slight downgrade, but what the hell, I was on tight schedule.  . . I'm glad I blew up the schedule because the sushi here rocked.  The blue fin special (3 pc. nigiri and 3 pc. sashimi) was some of the best I've ever had.  Amazing texture, freshness, and flavor.  Salmon nigiri, yellowtail jalapeno sashimi, and spicy tuna handroll were also stand-outs.  The one lackluster item was the grilled prawn special, which was on the bland side.. . Highly recommended, if you get you get a reservation or come during a less busy time.
