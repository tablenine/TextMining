So, this place makes my food wang hard.  I like food that much, and good fun THAT much.  Get the combo.  A little tasty rib action and some tofu soup.  . . This is ninja food.  It'll fill you up but make you feel great!  As far as flavor and gourmet goes, maybe not the widest range as I tend to get it hot which binds my experience.  That said though, if you're craving vinegary pickled things like kimchi, some spice with a lot of palette presence, good ol hotness, and the briny-soy sauce tang of galbi then this is your place!  They prolly have a lot of other good stuff on the menu... but I haven't tried it.
