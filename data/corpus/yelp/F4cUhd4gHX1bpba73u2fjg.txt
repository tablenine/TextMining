Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
hella crowded...all THE TIME.  . . I've gone on a weekday and a weekend.  It's ridiculous! :D . . the food there is good, and there's so much of it.  it's all you can eat which makes it even better for about 22 bucks a person (including tax/tip) which is cheap for how much one person can eat.. . Definitely...do not wear anything nice there because it will smell like oil and meat.  There is a high chance that you might get some oil stains if you are the one cooking so be careful.. . Also, most of the workers really don't understand English well, so if you' don't speak korean (like me), try to remind as many of them as you can to bring you what you need.  . . 1. Galbi. 2. Bulgogi. . 3.  ALL MEAT- minus the chicken.  everything else is delicious.  the pork is a little bit fatty though.. . awesome for friends...to chill and chat over good food.  NOT FOR DATES. :D no ambiance.
