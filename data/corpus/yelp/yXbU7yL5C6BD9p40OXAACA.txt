Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Small place, long line, short wait for the food and not enough parking.. But I really like Pinks! I try to stop by here whenever I'm in LA. Its also a great place to run into a Star. I met Fat Joe here, but he was a dick.. ANYWAYS about the food.. Â I like my hot dog kinda plain and with some chili cheese fries! YUMMY!
