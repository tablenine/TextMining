Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
Went to Parkers for dinner with my wife and ordered the Cheese Platter, Porterhouse for 2 (very rare) with the Merlot mushrooms and steak fries, and the pecan sundae.. . The cheese platter was of good quality, if not a little small for the price tag associated with it. There were 3 types of cheese: Bree, Goats Cheese, and Blue Cheese, which were wonderful and came with pairings that enhanced the flavor and strength of the cheese. There was a thinly sliced fan of granny smith apple, which was wonderful with the Goats Cheese. The only down side was that the portions of cheese were small.. .  The steak was cooked perfectly to order and the seasoning complimented the meat well. The Merlot mushrooms were a near perfect compliment to the texture and flavor of the steak and added a little depth. The steak fries were nothing exceptional and could have come from nearly anywhere. Dessert was served quickly and had very good flavor along with a pleasant texture throughout.. . Service was of good quality and was not ignoring of their customers, but also did not hover around the table. They were attentive to not only where people were in their meals but also levels of drinks, when attending to nearby tables.. . Parking is available all around the restaurant and can be approximately a 5 minute walk with numerous parking meters and a parking structure.
