I just went there for lunch on my Birthday and it was such a treat.  . I don't remember exactly what we had because I have a memory of  a dog but I do know that we had a pizza for an appetizer, a lamb ragut pasta and a lobster sandwich..or something. Everything was so excellent, I don't think it would've  mattered what I had it would've been De-li-cious! The best part of the whole experience was that Wolfgang came over and wished me a happy birthday!
