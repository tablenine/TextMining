Two thumbs up! I recently met up with a friend after work at Lola's for their happy hour that goes until 7:30. Valet parking was $5, I didn't bother to look for street parking despite my hatred for valet. While I don't typically drink martinis--even though I dressed up a dirty martini for Halloween 3 years ago--I enjoyed the Apple Martini and the Raspberry Martini. Both were delicious! Service was great -- our waitress took our last drink order a few minutes after happy hour ended, which was appreciated. We sampled a couple of dishes off the happy hour appetizer menu. Each dish was $5.50. They didn't offer any healthy options other than edamame, but what we ordered was delish. We ended up chatting with super cool people sitting next to us. The bathroom was entertaining after a couple of drinks because it was decorated with photos of celebrities and performers. A sign in the bathroom that said the photos were rigged with an alarm system so don't you dare try to take one down. haha. I definitely plan on going back soon even though I'm trying to exclusively stick to trying new places.
