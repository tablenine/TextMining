After reading so many poor reviews here on Yelp, I wasn't expecting much. I don't think that mattered in the end, because everything was terrific. The layout and design of the restaurant is great - open and airy but still intimate with a nice use of natural elements. . . As for the food, it was delicious. The pumpkin soup with cinnamon marshmallows tasted like Christmas and the braised short rib ravioli is divine. My wife had the lamb and ricotta gnocchi which was also fantastic. There were many unique flavors in every bite. . . The fritters for dessert are a must - so save room. Everyone around us got them and the smell alone warranted the order and we were not disappointed. Puls there's this (no alc.) bourbon tea that is terrific.. . I would definietly return to this great addition to the neighborhood.
