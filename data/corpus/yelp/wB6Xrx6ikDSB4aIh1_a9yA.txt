I'm hoping to come back here to try their pizza; I heard it was really good. . . Had their panini and raspberry chocolate macaroons. The sun dried tomato panini was really good. I was actually craving meat around that time but the panini satisfied me even though it didn't have meat in it. That's how good it was. Also had the raspberry chocolate macaroon for desert. It was pretty good but not great. . . Servers were really friendly. Finding parking sucked, oh well, that's downtown LA for you.
