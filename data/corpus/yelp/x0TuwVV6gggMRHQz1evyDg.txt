Best Sushi value in town!. . I don't proclaim to be a sushi snob...steak is my specialty.  However, Katsu-Ya converted me to a sushi lover.. . You can't go wrong having a full meal with two beers and pay $70 for two.  What a deal!. . Also, the sushi cannot be beat.  I have gone to Nobu and Koi, but end up liking Katsu-Ya at Studio City the best...and for half the price.. . Suggestions: . -crispy rice with spicey tuna (immitated throughout sushi land). -warm spinach with tuna. -garlic albacore!...yummy to cleanse your pallet at the end. -japanese salsa. . Now, the decor leaves much to be desired.  But you're not paying high-end prices.  This does not prevent celebs from rolling in...most I have ever seen at any restuarant (my wife loves celeb sightings and is real enough to admit it).. . You will wait without a reservation.  Be warned.  My suggestion is to have a drink at Firefly next door for 30 minutes.. . This is one of my favorite restaurants...go and have fun!  It's sushi viagra!!!. . Rating: 5 out of 5 Ribeyes!
