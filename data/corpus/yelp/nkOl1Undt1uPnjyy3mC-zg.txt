For a weekday lunch, it's still as crowded as all the reviews below suggest.  However, at a recent midweek dinner around 7pm, it was pretty quiet.  Service was attentive, line was 5 minutes long tops, and my dad enjoyed it so much he's actually ASKED to come back to this place again.  For a guy who deemed Fox Brothers "not worth the drive," this is saying something!. . The options are endless, and sure to satisfy even the pickiest eaters, but that doesn't mean that you'll get the perfect combo on your first try.  My suggestion is that you add more sauce than you think you'll need.  Don't mix and match (except to add a ladle of soy sauce to add some much needed salt), but do add 2-3 ladles of whatever sauce you chose.  . . The beef always seem a little tough and dry, but I've been pleased with the squid and chicken.  I can't quite figure out how the sausage goes with stir fry, but it's there if you want it.. . Overall, a solid four star experience, and one I'm sure to be repeating with my dad soon.
