Went to this place with a friend on a whim looking for some new, interesting Chinese food. Got some things I've never had before and regretted it. Didn't really like the textures or the tastes I had.. . The service was pretty bad, too. It wasn't clear who was serving us, and that seemed to lead to confusion regarding our service. Don't think I'll be going back here.
