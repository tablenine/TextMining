I went here for breakfast, and let me just say, the french toast alone made me like this place. They definitely give you Â your money's worth. I also was very pleased to see how well the bacon was cooked. It was perfect. The only thing I didn't like was the size of the tables. Our group had 6 people and we barely fit everyone's plate on it. But I guess it's not meant for large groups. Overall, I like!
