I loved the food at Bluepointe, even though it felt like I was eating in an aquarium since the ceiling is so exaggeratedly high.  I had the Bluepointe roll as an appetizer, and my friend had the tuna tartare.  Both were divine.  For my entree, I ordered the sea bass, which was delectable.  The service was similarly outstanding, and I can't wait to dive back in to that fishbowl for another magnificent meal.
