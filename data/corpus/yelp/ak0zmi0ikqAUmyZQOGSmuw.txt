Maybe my expectations were too high.  Maybe I know too many romantic, dark lit places.  Zenkichi is as said, a wood front place with no name or anything to distinguish it on the outside.  In fact, it looks almost as though it was an unfinished structure but once you walk in, it has low lights with tiny little booths perfect for two people and larger groups.  The food is very good, esp for the price. We had the prix-fixe menu with a bottle of sake.  The sake menu is in itself quite worth a visit.  It spans 5 pages with short descriptions, for those of us that are not sake connoisseurs.  We settled on a bottle that tasted very much like a white wine and went beautifully with all our food.  While portions are small, there are 11 courses to go through and by #5, I was basically full already.  Service is good but there isn't as much privacy as I thought there would be.  Because of the number of courses, the waitstaff comes in quite often and in some ways, I'd prefer they give us more privacy with fewer courses.   . . Despite having only crossed one river, it seems you're far away from Manhattan.  This is very reminiscent of something you'd find in Kyoto.  It's an all-around great experience but I must admit that I have been to more romantic dining locations..  So maybe go with fewer expectations and everything will be great..
