Despite the mixed reviews, I really do love this place.  My favorite thing on the menu is:  Tony's Salad - Mixed greens topped with bleu cheese crumbles, candied pecans, grape tomatoes, grilled chicken breast and avocado served with house vinaigrette.  And they have half-portions for days where you aren't very hungry, but still need to eat.  I feel the prices are totally reasonable and service is always pretty good.  They have egg white omelettes, too!  I really like sitting outside under the umbrellas on a warm sunny day.
