Restaurant: Maoz
Category: Middle Eastern
Hopelessly addicted to this place. There must be crack in their broccoli/cauliflower - try it, you'll understand.. . Pros: . . Love the self serve salad bar and wholewheat pita choice option.. The black guy who works here is the friendliest, most helpful worker, Maoz are spoiled to have him - it gets crowded and hectic here but he is ALWAYS smiling and doing 5 things at once. . . Cons:. . Limited seating, especially at busy dinner/lunch times. . Very small place, if they extended it somehow and added more seating room and a bathroom it would get 10 stars.
