Restaurant: Pick Me Up Cafe
Category: American (New)
I ran into the Pick Me Up about a year ago one day shopping in the neighborhood with a friend. I think it is a good place to go if you are very patient and have time to waste. The service is extremely slow and they seem to often forget about you. And they can be very rude. One time I went in there late at night and my friends and I just ordered a few drinks. The waiter rolled his eyes at us and gave us an attitude because we weren't getting a lot. Then when it came to paying he was very rude and mumbled something under his breath. Besides the service the food is just okay. I usually get the cheese fries and they have gotten a lot better. At first they used to be very spicy and the cheese was hard and gross. But, lately they have been getting better with gooey cheese and less spice. The garlicious is always to die for. And also the wraps are pretty good. In all I would recommend this to someone who enjoys late night cafes.. . Changed from 3 stars to 2 because the waiters and waitress are just brutally horrible.
