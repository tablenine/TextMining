Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
It's really weak sauce to rate a hot dog place if you hate hot dogs. . . Lemme do that.. . I don't much like hot dogs, but I really love lines so I come here often when I have friends from out of town and they want to go somewhere that they saw Martha Stewart talk about. The specialty dogs which are listed all over the ordering and cooking station seem to be variations of the same 5 ingredients to me, but I will say nothing about that because I haven't ever ordered those. I usually eat one of their few burgers or a burrito and they are decent. . . Once, while eating with my friend who got the Harry Potter or the Al Roker or a Crystal Gale or something, he took his very first bite into that foot long and it made a snap sound so loud I thought maybe he had just shot something out a water cannon with his free hand or even had a loud aneurism. Â I imagined his mouth shot full of a pressurized ribbon of meaty miscellany. . . Pinks!
