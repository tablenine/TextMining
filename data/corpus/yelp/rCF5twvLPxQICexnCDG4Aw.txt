Meh. I've experienced better. Came down solely for the burger since Iv'e read fabalouse reviews about them but sadly I'd had better at Granville and the Cheesecake Factory (which is sad to say since I had high hopes). . . I can see it as a place for locals but not worth the drive for me, luckily we were in the neighbor and gave it a try. Thanks anyways.
