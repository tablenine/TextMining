Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
Atmosphere: Cheesey!. Food: Standard Theme restaurant fare. Service: Lunch SLOW!. Prices: Slightly overpriced for the level of service. Bathrooms: Clean. . Server was very formal for a lunch service, zero personality. Took a long time to bring the check. It's lunch! he should have been more cognizant of his job!. . Food was good! Spring Rolls, Chopped Salad and Edamame!. . Go for the location!
