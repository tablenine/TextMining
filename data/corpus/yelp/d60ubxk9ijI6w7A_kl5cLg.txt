Ok the 1 star was for its ability to provide a fun time amongst a group of people... other than that SAVE YOUR MONEY! . . So we came with a large party and once your party is a certain size its a fixed price per person and for us it was $30 per person for FOOD only. For anyone who has eaten food in general (not just Japanese food) you'll quickly come to find how BAD the food is. It's really bad... . . Once you start drinking, and oh yes they encourage you to drink a lot, the bill starts to add up. It got to about $60 per person at our table. . . Let's see $60 = 6 shots of sake, 3 whole beers, 3 pieces of sushi, 1 piece of tempura, and some god awful edamame.... My bf was slightly more than I, but for $120... I would have rather gone to Nobu or something. . . Don't get me wrong, it was a fun time. I think they try to get you to drink a lot not just to wrack up your bill, but so that you really don't care the price once its time to pay. . . Unless you're going with Â A LOT OF PEOPLE and have a cold so you can't taste the food... SKIP IT!
