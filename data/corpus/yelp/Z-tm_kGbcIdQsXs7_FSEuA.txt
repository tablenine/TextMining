David and I met up with our friend Roxanne who found this place while jogging around Emory.  I am always up for a good breakfast and was eager to try this place out!  Once I walked through the doors, it reminded me of a cute breakfast place I loved when I was in Chicago.  The place was packed with students and families...definitely a different scene then I am used to.. . The menu is simple and very healthy.  I enjoyed the helpful hints on the menu on what to eat after a workout or what types of food gives us the most energy.  Another thing I liked were the prices!  It really was like eating in a college town!  Roxanne has the sweet potato pancakes with fruit, granola and yogurt, David made his own omelet and got a sweet potato and I got the Spanish omelet with a side of jalapeno and Cheddar grits.  It was all very good and I have to agree with the other yelpers...the sweet potato pancakes were the best I have ever had in Atlanta!. . Definitely will be coming back for my own stack of sweet potato heaven!
