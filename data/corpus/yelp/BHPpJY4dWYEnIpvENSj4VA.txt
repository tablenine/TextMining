8.14.09:. Get in: Invites only through a magician. What if you don't know one? Well search on yelp through talk threads, I found one through that method. They can email you an invitation. You will have to eat dinner there, which is probably the only downer cause the meal there is expensive and not up to par. . . dress code: ladies no jeans! Cocktail/business atire. Men make sure you have a jacket. If you don't have these things they will actually look inside their closet and make you change. And its not guarantee that they will have your size. so be careful! or they won't let you in. . . Valet only: I forgot how much it cost. . Admission: $25 on weekends. . Castle: Lovely on the inside. This place I have to say is very entertaining. From the invisible piano player Irma to the Bartender who does tricks and serve drinks at the same time. The shows is a must, do not miss out on their shows, it is definitely worth the wait! . . Make sure to try to tour the whole castle. There are members throughout the place with a pendant, you may ask them some questions. Some are very delighted to help. . . I would love to come here again and maybe one day the food will be decent enough to talk about .
