Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Wow is this place over-rated on the Yelp scale.  I really wonder if the majority of reviewers who are mostly non-Korean can tell me that this place really constitutes THE best Korean bbq in Koreatown?  I really have been disappointed by Yelpers, and now I take every review with a grain of salt.  . . The service here was not very good, and it was near closing time when we were there.  In addition, the banchan quality is mediocre at best and not all that is hyped it to be.  Most of the banchan was not that generous either, and the flavors are not as authentic as I thought it would be.  Some of it tasted like some kind of banchan that would suit a white person's palate, which I assume fits most of the palates on Yelp.  Thus, the five stars that people have been giving this place.. . The meats in quantity were not as generous, and I still was hungry.  Granted that I was with a party of three guys, but I still was really hungry after.  Quantity and value is the name of the game, and this--this Soowon does not have.  The interior is nice, but that doesn't excuse the fact that the meat quality is not as high as Park's BBQ down the street or Chosun.  There are plenty of other Ktown bbq restaurants that I would go to before being misled by all the five star reviews that others have given here.. . Disappointing experience, and I won't listen to Yelpers again.  Soowon is not all that it claims to be.
