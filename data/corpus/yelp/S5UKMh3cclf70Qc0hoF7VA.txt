Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Once you get through the LA traffic, find a place to park, and get through the long lines in the restaurant, the food makes it all worth while. Many people from all nationalities come to sample the world famous french dip sandwiches. and you cant beat the prices. I would suggest you print a menu off line, study it so you know what you want when you get there, but of course you will change your mind many times while you wait in line. Just remember get a sandwich to go, and don't forget the hot mustard, this is a must. . . Not a place for the impatient person! so leave them at home and just bring them a sandwich :)
