Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Some of my friends insisted I try Orochon, so I did. Their ramen is just okay for me. Their ramen is on the saltier side, and I think personally the reason behind their fame is due to their challenge. (If you don't know what the challenge is.. you have to finish the spiciest bowl of ramen under 5 min. or was it 10 min?..). . Their noodle was cooked fine, but the soup was just too salty for me. I think Orochon's spicy ramen is supposed to be a Chinese-fusion style Ramen (like tantanmen). The flavor was great, but just salty and rich.
