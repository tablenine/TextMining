Restaurant: Italian Village
Category: Nightlife
There are three levels at this restaurant.  Each level has a different menu and price range. This review is for the upper level of the Italian Village on a Saturday afternoon at 4pm.. . We walked in and were asked how many.  He stated they had a table available but we would have to be done by 5:30pm.  I understand that they probably had reservations booked but to limit the time we had in the restaraunt by telling us seemed a bit rude.   The place was very busy and so was the turnover rate.. . Our waiters were attentive and I felt there was no issue here.  . . I ordered the Chicken Rotolini (chicken stuffed with sausage, prosciutto, and sage with a mushroom sherry sauce.  It was served with fettucini alfredo.  The meal itself was mediocre.  Nothing stood out about this meal that would make me want to come back.. . As I mentioned with the busy atomosphere they were cleaning our table off while we were still eating.  As soon as my plate was finished it was gone.  The busboy was reaching over the table to remove silverware that we were not using and just being a nuisance.   . . We stopped here because it was after the Christkindl Market and we had a taste for Italian food.   It was convenient, probably price appropriate for the area, but overpriced for the quality of the food.
