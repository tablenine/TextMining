First thing you should do when you arrive this place is to write your name on the clipboard they hang outside the door.  Yup, there is usually a wait at this place.. . They don't have a large selection of noodles here.  It is the typical ramen with pork broth place, where you can add corn, seaweed, bamboo, eggs to your noodles.  Aside from having a great pork broth, I love this place because it gives you the option of getting your ramen just the way you want it.  The softness of the noodles, amount of oil, and how strong you want your soup base.  . . And if you are still hungry after the first bowl?  Never fear!  You can always order extra noodles for $0.95!  . . Ooh, don't forget to top off your perfect meal with their yummy creme brûlée.  They usually have the regular creme brûlée or green tea flavor.
