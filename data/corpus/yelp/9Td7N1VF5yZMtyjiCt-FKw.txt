Yummmmy Thai.  They put a sweet sauce on their pad see euw that I haven't found anywhere else.  Fair prices and excellent service.  Whether I'm dining in or picking up, I've always had my food in 10 minutes.  Their best deal is the $5.50 lunch box special where you get an entree and an appetizer between 11-2:30.  I only wish I could come home for lunch more often!
