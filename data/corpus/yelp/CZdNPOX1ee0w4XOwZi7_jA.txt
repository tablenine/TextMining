Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
I ordered some food from Friendship Chinese for delivery. The delivery was super quick. The driver was really pleasant and the food arrived in a cute little cake box. However, the Crab Rangoon was so salty that it was completely inedible. The Singapore Noodles were tasty (although a bit too salty, as well) and there was a good amount of shrimp, pork and fresh tasting veggies. I really wanted to like this place simply because they don't have 100 items on their menu. I think that's supposed to mean that rather than doing a ton of stuff poorly, they do a fair amount of things really well. I'll give it a second try.
