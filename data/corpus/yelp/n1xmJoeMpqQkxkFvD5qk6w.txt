Uh.. bread pudding... yes please.  These SOBs are huge with nice chocolate chunks in them.  probably made from left over croissants etc.  the impressive part is that each one weighs about 3lbs. no kidding.  . My boyfriend and I tried to share one and then eat a plate each..bad idea.  . . Alcove has large food portions, and I think it's more hits than misses.  Love the Huevos Rancheros, it feels fresh and non-greasy-- except the homefries.  Those need a little work.  . . get a bread pudding (at least to go) warm it up, and with some coffee or juice.. oh yummmsmsmsms
