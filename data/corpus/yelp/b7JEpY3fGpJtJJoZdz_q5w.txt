Went to dinner at Spago last night and was quite excited Â because I've always heard good things about Wolf Gang Puck's cooking. . . I ordered the pan seared chicken with chanterelle mushroom with mashed garlic potatos for my main course. for my main i had the endive salad and for desert kaisher schmere! . . Every bite was heavenly. . . Valet parking is available as well as street parking. I suggest that when you go to make reservations although they accept walk ins as well. Their bar was ample with drinks and cocktails. . . The staff was very friendly and accomodating especially to my little cousin Mark. So parents who are worried about taking a toddler along - do not fret! They will provide you with a high chair and even entertain your little one. When Marks mom had to walk him around for a little bit the server offered to take her dish into the kitchen to keep it warm. I've never been to restaurant that offered this kind of service with smiles all around. I was quite impressed. . . Do not be afraid to doggie bag as well. . . The cherry to this sundae was we met Wolf Gang Puck! Like a good host he made his rounds around the dining room and shaked hands with every guest. I was so star struck that I failed to whip out my camera! . . It is a bit pricey but is worth it. This would be a place to go to for a special occasion and of course for the excellent food and service. . . Would I ever go back? ABSOLUTELY!
