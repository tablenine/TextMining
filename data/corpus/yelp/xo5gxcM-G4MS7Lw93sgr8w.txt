My Korean friends take me here a lot, they would know where good Korean food is right? We always do Korean bbq with Cha-Dal-Bae-Gi. SWEET MOTHER OF..its damn good. Plus all the ban-chan (side dishes) they give you is over the top! I came here once, without my Korean sidekicks, with my family and used my limited 20-words vocab of Korean to order. I succeeded and we left full, sleepy, and constipated. Always a good sign. . . If you aren't familiar with Korean bbq, definitely go a couple of times with someone who is. The servers do speak english, but its super fast and their words only register after a couple of seconds while my brain breaks it down slowly and translate the accent. So expect a lot of pointing at the menu and at other strangers' food. Its ok, they are all used to it. As with any bbq method, you will end up smelling like a July 4th party. . . We came here for dinner and the line/wait was long. Try to go during lunch or super early/late dinner. You pay around $12/person (usually in a group). Does that rock or what???. . Oh yeah there's always street parking in that area. That alone deserves 5 stars.
