As a bakery goes this one's fantastic.  Its hard to beat these prices and quality.  The potato balls are awesome the croissants are great.  If you need cakes, pies, pastries or baked goods this is the place.  Watch out for the holidays cause this place lines up out the door.  One of the best deals around for a quick bite..   Drinks are a bit slow so just keep that in mind when ordering.. . Service:4. Food:5. Decor:4. . Would I go back?  You bet your pastrami I would!
