Restaurant: N9NE Steakhouse
Category: Lounges
What distinguishes a great steakhouse from a good one?. Is it dry aging vs wet? The sides? The appies?. Somewhat... More importantly it is the little things.. Yes that's right Gavin Rossdale was singing to the choir.. If N9NE did all the little things right they would get 5 stars from me and be close to a 90 on my more-descriptive-proprietary-rating scale.. . First off I found it tacky that we needed to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  Second they announced lack of a particular item on the menu.  Third and this is on the plus side they had a wine paring, what a great idea, all participants of the promotion machine that is Chicago RW  should have such foresight.  Now back to the minuses, the steak knives were c'est terrible and the portion was tiny, I expected more.  The mustard glaze on the Salmon did not assert itself in any way.. . Everything tasted was quite flavorful. I enjoyed the Hangar Steak and Fries, the sauce and butter that was on both elements was very nice and well seasoned, a real hit.  . . The atmosphere of N9NE is nearly unmatched in Chicago, its cool sleek and hip. Everything is cook solidly, the flavors are excellent, plates are nice and innovative, ingredients quality,  steaks ok -- ish.. . Food 15/20  Ambience/Decor/Service 19.5/20   $$$ 13/20  Execution of concept 17/20   Pleasure of the experience 16/20. . 80.5/100 A great place to dine but more needs to be done in order to reach an elite level and deliver a truly memorable experience with a hook, everything is there to accomplish this but Bush is right its the little things that kill.
