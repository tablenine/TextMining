Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I think what makes Tito's so great is the salsa. Eat a taco, or whatever, with the salsa; then without the salsa. Pretty crappy without.. . My usual order is a beef and cheese taco, meat and beans burrito, upgrade the salsa to a medium, and a Sierra Mist. Comes out to about $6 or $7.. . Great food, just don't ever forget eat it with the salsa. One of my westside favorites for 10 years+
