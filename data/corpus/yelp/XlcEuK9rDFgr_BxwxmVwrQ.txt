I have been 4 times each time a tried something new.  The service has been marvelous, we sat outside each time and dined at about 9 pm, the bar next door makes for great people watching.  My one complaint would be the music was super loud for the amount of people sitting on the deck.  The rock shrimp app. is so Delicious, the strip steak was cooked to perfection, and the drinks are on point.  . I think a great addition would be, a great bread with some sea salt and olive oil brought out first the place just has that style about it.  the food prep is reminiscent of a fav. of mine from back home in Cambridge Mass. called Casablanca, (little plug for home). Last but not least the crowd is always friendly 25-55 conversations on the deck are often multi table or maybe thats only when I am there drinking.
