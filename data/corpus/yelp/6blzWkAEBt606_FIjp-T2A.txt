Restaurant: Yamashiro Restaurant
Category: Sushi Bars
Probably the most unique and incredible atmosphere I have ever eaten in. The view is absolutely stunning and the food is out of this world. Yamashiro is basically a huge Japanese temple which doubles as the pearly gates. This was my first experience with sushi of any kinda and boy was I spoiled. When my friend and I arrived we were a bit early but I would suggest getting there early (if possible around sunset) to enjoy the view. As we ate the lights of LA began to glow as we enjoyed some cold Sake and delicious platters of fish of all varieties. It's hard not to enjoy the food because it is so fresh and presented superbly. Our waitress was very helpful with the few questions I had which my sushi-expert friend couldn't answer. Â  Their bathrooms, although somewhat confusing to find, are something to marvel at as well. . . Bottom line: Yamashiro is an indulgence worth spending a few extra bills for. For special occasions this place will blow most establishments not only out of the water but it will bury them underground aside nuclear waste. Aesthetically its the most pleasant dining experience I have ever had and the menu offers a little something for everyone. (they also have a continental menu) . Now if I could only afford a Samurai sword , I would be all set.
