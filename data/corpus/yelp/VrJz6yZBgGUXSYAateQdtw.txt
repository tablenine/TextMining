Holy Shit. I took my mommy here for Mother's Day this year and it was incredible. EVERY SINGLE thing we ate was pretty much perfect. The menu confused me but I don't take away stars for that kind of shit. I thought we were supposed to order 3 courses because I had read to do so and that they were small. That was a bit much. A salad or appetizer and a main dish would have been plenty. But then we also got dessert (!!!). I can't remember the names of anything I got, unfortunately, but considering how we tried 7 items and the fact that they were all good makes me want to say EVERYTHING will be that good (just a shot in the dark, 7 items, 7 7 7 7 7 7). . . The service was excellent. The waiter didn't make me feel even worse for being stupid with the menu and not being able to figure out what anything was, he was extremely helpful. The environment of the restaurant was beautiful. Nice decor but not OVERLY fancy, just simple and nice. . . The dessert we got was this dish with 3 scoops of different ice cream/gelato. WOW. I never knew something like that could be that good. And one was pistachio, so that should say a lot. . . For 2 people with 4 COURSES and wine, the bill was around $200. Worth it if you have the money. And you can eat there without drinks for under $100 (for 2), I'm pretty sure.. . Oh and to top it all off- A staff member came by our table and gave us a free appetizer at the beginning of the meal. He either gave them to everyone or felt bad for us after he saw how much we over did it. . . A+++++++++
