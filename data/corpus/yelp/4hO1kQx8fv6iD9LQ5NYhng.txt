The oysters (I've had them on two different occasions) are not quite as fresh as I'd hoped they would be.  . . The food is good not great.  I had the Soft Shell Crab BLT with Potato Salad.  The crab was too salty and lacked flavor.  The potato salad was good though.. . The service is great!  The servers are very attentive and polite.  My clients like this place, so I know I'll be back again.  Will repost if things change.
