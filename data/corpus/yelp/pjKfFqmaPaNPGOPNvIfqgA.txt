I don't know what they do to the french fries here that makes them "Belgian style," but it is more than alright by me. In fact, these might be some of the best fries I've had in this town--tied with Troy Burger over on York. . . They're especially tasty when dunked into garlic aoili or any of the homemade from-scratch condiments they serve in huge tubs with giant pumps. Multiple ketchups and mustards ensure that every fry tastes unique, but you could really eat them plain and enjoy that, too. . . Now, I've had difficulty getting a really decent burger in Los Angeles--Counter and other fancy joints know how to spruce it up, but it doesn't seem like many know how to keep it simple. Oinkster's burger is nothing special, just a solid ground beef sandwich, and that is something I can almost appreciate more than a gouda-blue-cheese-cranberry-caramelized pineapple-topped piece of meat. . . Their pride and joy pastrami wasn't as heavenly as I anticipated, though--I might actually prefer Troy Burger's version of this, as well. But they win me over by having sides of black beans and plantains [which you should dip into the aioli) and peanut butter and jelly cupcakes that I have yet to try but which beckon me every time I stand at the counter. . . There's also a pretty great selection of beers on tap. Prices are a little steep for a burger joint, but nothing too extravagant.
