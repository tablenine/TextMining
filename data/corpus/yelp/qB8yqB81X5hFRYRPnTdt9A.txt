I was not excited for a place like this because It seemed like one of those places that cared more about its reputation of being the first certified organic restaurant than they cared about making good food. Â I ended up being pleased with the food and also the atmosphere and the service. . . The vibe of the restaurant is very inviting. It totally encourages a nice time and good conversation for any group regardless of the size. I went with a group of 15 people, and the servers were pros on serving a group our size. Even though there was a bit of confusion with our reservations, they were able to accommodate us and they provided exceptional service. I particularly liked the intro the waiter gave us about the restaurant the first certified organic restaurant in Chicago. You can really tell that they like where they work.. . The food was also good, but more expensive and smaller portions than I'd like to pay for a salad and a pizza. While they were delicious (the salad quite possibly the freshest I have ever had), the food wasn't that special or unique for the price other than it was organic. My friend was actually hungry after his meal because his portion was too small, and we ended up at McDonald's right after.. . Overall, these three stars are for the atmosphere and the service.
