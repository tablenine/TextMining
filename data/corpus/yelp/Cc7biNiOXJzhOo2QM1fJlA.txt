We crashed here for dinner after our long drive in from Grand Rapids.  We stayed at the Hampton Inn around the corner.  Classic Mac &amp; Chicken really hit the spot!  Waiter was helpful in suggesting bars to check out for the birthday we were celebrating.  I know I should've had a beer, but the mixed drink I had got the evening to a good start.
