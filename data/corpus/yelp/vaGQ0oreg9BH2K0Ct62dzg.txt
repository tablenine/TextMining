I have held off on writing an review of Silver Cloud because I haven't been there in a while.  I thought that I should try it again before I write a review.  Then I realized that I will probably never go back to Silver Cloud.  . . The food is ok.  Mainly comfort food.  Nothing too spectacular.  A few years ago when I was in the process of moving to Chicago, some friends took me out to dinner here and I had the best fried chicken that I have ever had in my life!  It was their nightly special on that particular day and it was damn good!  Par-baked so it wasn't too greasy and the coating was perfectly golden brown and had a yummy buttermilk flavor.  After I moved, I returned for dinner and was not impressed.  If they served that chicken regularly, I would probably go again.  . . I prefer Blue Line Club Car for a loungey "comfort food" place.  Plus, it's closer to the blue line and thus, closer to my couch so that I can lay down and rub my full belly.  ;)
