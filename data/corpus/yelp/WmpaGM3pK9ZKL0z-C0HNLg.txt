Went to brunch here this morning, and it was quite tasty!  We had to wait a little while because it was packed, but not too bad.  All the servers were very nice, and the food came out quickly.  I had the crab cakes hollandaise special with the AWESOME cheesy hashbrowns.  Crab cakes were also great - big chunks of crab...mmm...crabbiness... Really enjoyed Dunlay's - not for the kid-unfriendly though, many small children everywhere.
