Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
three stars for being a novel LA only experience.  The best part of Pinks is the long line and the great menu.  Definitely not the food.  I'm a big fan of hotdogs.  . . If your new to LA this is definitely a great place to go.  Sort of like the Hollywood walk of stars.  Do it once and you're satisfied.  The rest of your visits will be only to introduce others to it.. . 2.5 stars for atmosphere/experience. 0.5 star for food. . bottom line definitely worth trying once.. . check
