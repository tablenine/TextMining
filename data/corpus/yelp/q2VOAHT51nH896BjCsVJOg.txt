Whoa.  Drama.  It's an experience.  Walking around inside is a little frightening - like a fun house ... after half a bottle of sake.  I almost fell down stairs and walked into mirrors several times.  Food was very tasty but I was completely distracted by the setting/atmosphere/service/trying not to fall. But tasty, by all means.
