Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
I am never a beef lover!. But definitely Mastro's change my mind.. We ordered crab stuffed mushroom , shrimp cocktail and lobster mashed potato.. except the lobster mashed potato, others r just ok... The shrimp was not fresh. . However, its a steakhouse instead of seafood place. I wont put too much expectation on in.. . I ordered Bone Rib-Eye cook medium rare.. They sealed the best juicy part inside the meat!. That was so so so so good!!. and my pals had Bone in Filet, and Rack of Lamb.. They r awesome too.. For the quality n the super huge portion 22oz for me,. the price is worthy.
