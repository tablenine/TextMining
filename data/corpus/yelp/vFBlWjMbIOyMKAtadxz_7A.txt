Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
I love this place. I try and go every time I'm in NY. You have to get the egg noodles, shrimp wontons, roast duck with Chinese greens! You just gotta do it. It's so damn good my mouth is watering just thinking about the delicousness.. . If someone can recommend a place in NOVA that is good as that, I dare you. . . I'm hungry =(
