Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
My brother who is from out of town, suggested Orochon Ramen because it was featured on Man vs. Food on the Travel Channel.  When he, some friends and I arrived, it was packed.  There's miso, soy and salt flavored broths.  There were also 7 or 8 levels of spicyness, 1 being the most spicy.  My brother ordered a 3 which was just right.  I ordered a 4 which ended up being a bit salty.  I was able to switch it to a 3.  The first few sips of level 3 soup were great, but it just kept on getting spicier and spicier the more I ate.  It got to the point that my nose running uncontrollably.  One of my friends started out with a 4 and upgraded to a 2.  She too was able to handle the soup at first but eventually, she had tears in her eyes from the spice.  The noodles were cooked perfectly.  The ramen comes with some bell peppers, green onions, and a slice of pork.  I don't recall other vegetables.  I added charsiu pork and corn.  The char siu pork was delicious. We arrived at the restaurant wondering what we were going to get ourselves into.  At the end of the evening, everyone was telling my brother that he picked a good place to eat.
