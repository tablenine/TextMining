Too much MSG. Didn't seem like it while we were there-- seemed tasty as usual, but five hours and a liter of water later, I'm still thirsty.... . Server took our hot sauce and gave it to another table without asking us.. . Our last (of three) order of xiao long bao, the shrimp and pork ones, took forever to arrive.. . And we ordered the spicy beef noodle soup, which was a mistake. Meh.. . Still... if you want good xiaolongbao, well, there aren't that many places to go here, and DTF isn't bad.
