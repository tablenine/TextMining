Eh. It was okay. . . My friends and I got one of each cake and none of them really impressed me. Not even the blue velvet cake. . . Strawberry gelato is delicious tho!. . And snickerdoodles are a MUST at this place that's why I'm giving it three stars instead of one. Plus the cookie was only $1 so totally worth it!. . Try it but I've had better.
