4.5 stars. . F.O. II is so, so, so much bigger than F.O. I and there was a, wait for it, parking lot!  I remember when I went to F.O. I, I had to park in a little neighborhood and walk about a block to the restaurant during a chilly winter month.  . . It's a very laid-back atmosphere here with a linear row of tables and benches for outdoor seating.  I couldn't help but notice a complementing line of heat lamps embedded into the wooden patio covering.. . I got in around 10pm on a Thursday night. No lines, no wait -- not even for a table!  There was plenty of seating inside and outside but it wasn't dead empty either.  The feel is very contemporary and sleek with a lot of wood paneling going on.  I'm not much of a beer drinker so I solicited the advice of the bartender who directed me to a very delicious Great White.  As for my meal, I got the Office Burger ($12) with a side of sweet potato frites ($7).. . My medium rare Office Burger was packed with meat, arugula and gooey Gruyere cheese.  The arugula was notably fresh as the leaves were quite firm.  I couldn't help but notice that something was a little off with the meat; it had a very apparent raw taste, which I've never experienced in all my years of ordering my meats medium rare.  That turned me off a bit so I dock .5 stars for that.. . The sweet potato frites are as amazing as everyone makes them out to be.  I was really surprised that they weren't drenched in oil as most fries are.  And they're served in a cute mini fryer -- though, I must admit that the shopping cart is cuter.
