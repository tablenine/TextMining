What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's dark inside, the beer garden is shielded from the street, the blue burgers are great, and they've reasonably priced pitchers of Anchor Steam!. . I haven't been there in a bit, so unless they've changed their policy, there's an unlimited supply of (serve yourself) peanuts, located in a wash tub near the door... it''s the tossed shells you're crunching when walking to an inside table! (I've been there times when it was so dark you couldn't see the floor. Don't drop anything you want... you may not be able to find it!). . The only thing I'd add is that you'll occasionally find a decent coupon in the Reader. ...thom
