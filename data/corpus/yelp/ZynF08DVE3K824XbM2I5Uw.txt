Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
There is much debate in Los Angeles over the best Jewish deli.  I have always been Team Canter's.  They make their own pickles, their matzo ball soup is no frills perfection, and their bakery items are old-school just like I want them.  I love the decor that hasn't changed in decades, the service with or without a smile is always as entertaining as it is thorough, and they are open all day and night, every day of the week.  Don't visit Los Angeles without checking this place out.. . Extra shout out for the Kibitz Room bar too.  Never change. You are perfect.
