I love this place. I hate the wait, and there always always is one, but I'm giving it 5 stars because the food is worth the wait. . It's vietnamese inspired, but I think it's a fusion restaurant, borrowing the sweet/salty/tangy flavors of similar foods like Chinese, Thai and Malaysian. . They have a set dinner for large parties, which is what we usually get, but you can also swap in/out other entrees I think. . Come on people, don't come here and crowd the restaurant with your  orange chicken or fried rice orders. You're killing me. . Things you should try: fried calamari, luc lac (vietnamese style filet mignon cubes with black pepper sauce, AMAZING) their wonderful house special lobster,  house special fish (a whole fried fish topped with spicy/sour/sweet sauce), a savory sour fish soup. Oh man. Delicious.
