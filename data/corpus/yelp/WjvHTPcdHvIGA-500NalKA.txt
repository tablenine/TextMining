Perhaps I expected too much.... . I've lived a block away from Opera for almost 2 years now.  I can see it out my window.  Always wanted to go but it was just too pricey.  Enter Groupon.   I was so excited.. . We dined on a Saturday night.  Early - I believe we had 6 PM reservations (I made them three days before and for 2 of us my options were 6 or 9.  I can't wait until 9 to eat...).  We arrived to a completely empty restaurant.  Fine, it was early.  But it never seemed to fill up.  There were 3 employees idling by the host stand the entire evening.  . . The food was fine.  I enjoyed what I ate (apps of calamari and wings were especially good, entree of firecracker chicken was very spicy but still flavorful).  And my drink (vodka with lime and lemongrass) was tasty.  Service was mostly fine (only exception being that it took 20 minutes to get our check)...  . . But I couldn't help but feel completely underwhelmed.  I've had similar meals just as good, if not better, for a quarter of the price.  Our final bill for two entrees (only one of which was large enough for leftovers), two apps and 2 drinks ended up being over $100 with tax and tip.  Thank goodness for that $50 groupon, but my wallet still hurt after.  . . I would come back, I enjoyed it... but only if someone else is paying!
