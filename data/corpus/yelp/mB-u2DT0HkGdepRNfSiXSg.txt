My bf &amp; his friends are the biggest carnivores I've ever met in my life. I, however, am not a serious carnivore, but I appreciate a good cut of meat. We've been to many churrascarias and Fogo is definitely my favorite. . . I've come here before &amp; just gotten the salad bar ($28) because I knew I wasn't going to get enough bang for my buck with the full dinner (which is $57.) Between their salad bar &amp; their sides, there was enough variety to keep me full &amp; happy. I love their fried bananas &amp; polenta &amp; the parmesan cheese at the salad bar is one of the best I've ever had.. . The last time we came here (part of our friend's bachelor party weekend) I ordered the full dinner &amp; it was absolutely delicious. The filet mignon &amp; the picanha (sirloin with salt &amp; garlic) were the best cuts. . . It is like a meat orgy up in here, so pace yourself. They will keep coming out with more meats until you turn your card over to "red," signifying you are done (at least for a while.) Obviously, only come here hungry to get your money's worth. . . Coming here is a really enjoyable dining experience (except at the end when you have to loosen your belt buckle or explode.) The waiters are always very attentive and the decor is elegant &amp; beautiful: dark wood, mellow yellow paint on the wall, murals, great lighting and white table cloths.
