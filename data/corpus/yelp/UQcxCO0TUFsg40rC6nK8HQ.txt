Yes there is a wait. Most breakfast/brunch places will have a wait, especially on the weekend. Just sit at the counter. Its worth it. It will be easier to flag down the staff up there anyways.. . Best pancakes I've had in Chicago. There is something in them, maybe a touch of Cinnamon. Just delightful. Not too buttery or greasy. Bacon is just crispy enough, crispier than average anyways, it can never really be crispy enough actually.. . Orange juice isn't fresh but pulpy.. . Expect to pay at least $10 for yourself.
