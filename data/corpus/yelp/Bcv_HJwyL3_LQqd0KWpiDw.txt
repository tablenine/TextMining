i love brunch and try to go to new places all the time. so, my eating pal and i hit this place up.. i have to give kudos for the great coffee, but that's about it.. the environment is ok and watching the scientologists across the street is pretty fun.. but the food wasn't that impressive.. my eggs were bland....they kinda tasted like the grits i had.. i won't be back.....sorry square one.
