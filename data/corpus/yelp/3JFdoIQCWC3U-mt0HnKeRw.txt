Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
What's not to love about this place? First, the sushi is fresh and delicious. My favorite is the Uni! So sweet and tasty (my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it)..... . Second, the service is usually adequate with the waitstaff monitoring your drink needs and such, but sometimes the chefs are backed up and it takes a while to get your order. When you get it, though, it is worth the wait!. . Third, the prices are pretty decent for what you get.. . Fourth, the parking is easy with a lot next door that is free with validation. You can't ever find parking on the street during busy times so the lot is a big plus.. . Lastly, with most Japanese restaurants closed between lunch and dinner, it's nice to know that Hide Sushi is always there to satisfy my sushi cravings between the hours of 2pm and 5pm, b/c they're the only game in town during that time. Gotta luv it!
