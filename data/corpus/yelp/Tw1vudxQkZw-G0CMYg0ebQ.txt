HAND IN HAND WAIT STAFF ARE CROOKS!!! . . I have been a regular to Hand in Hand for several years - it being a popular post-class hang out for my b-school friends... in our time - we have spent MORE than enough on overpriced beers and such but this time takes the cake as it was pure thievery.. . On a recent Tue. night we ran into the worst waitress possible - hello - you are working a slow Tuesday night at a run down bar!!! Suffice to say - beyond all the deplorable service - when it came time to total out the bill - I left her a marginal 10% tip feeling unsatisfied by her efforts but recognizing the difficulties of the job.. . The big surprise came when I just checked my credit card statement and low and behold - this little thieving crook had CHANGED the input and added another $10 on for herself.. . I am awaiting confirmation from the credit card company - but plan to ask the APD to pay her a visit so she can explain her actions face to face.. . Good job!
