in one word - inedible. went here for the first time because i had a HUGE craving for sloppy joe and it's close to my house (googled 'sloppy joe chicago' and ended up on some yelp board.  should have read the reviews first.....).  the menu even said 'more sloppy than joe' - wrong.  no sauce at all.  not any kind of flavor.  it tasted like plain ground beef fried up in a pan.  really, really bad.. my poor husband was choking down his grilled cheese without comment (he was trying not to ruin my sloppy joe experience).  once i admitted how awful my sandwich was, he confessed his was terrible as well.  we had a laugh, and he offered me a bite of his bad sandwich.  seriously, how bad can grilled cheese be?  one bite and I almost puked all over the table, had to spit it out in a napkin.  even the bread tasted bad.. i wish i was joking. the fries were ok
