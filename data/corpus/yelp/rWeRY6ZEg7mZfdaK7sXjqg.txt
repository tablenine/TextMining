One of my favourite restaurants in LA. when I'm feeling flush. Great atmosphere, beautiful lush green patio, great when we have those beautiful Southern California evenings. Lovely, fun date restaurant unless you want somewhere quiet. Also great for entertaining good friends. Good little bar while you wait for your table (which you probably will have to do). Its usually buzzing. Definitely best to make a reservation! $$$
