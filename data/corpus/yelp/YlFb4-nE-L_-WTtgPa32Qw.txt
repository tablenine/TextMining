Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Amazing homemade GELATO (over 30 flavors).... wonderful outside patio, perfect for people watching or just enjoying the LA weather... they also just added over a dozen new desserts to the menu which are all divine... I recommend the peanut butter chocolate bar, bread pudding or panna cotta..... . This place also has a full bar and is open late every night. Â  It's the perfect place to go for an after dinner drink/dessert &amp; conversation. . . Although it's the perfect place for dessert, it also has a great food menu that is more sophisticated than the Ugo Cafe next door.
