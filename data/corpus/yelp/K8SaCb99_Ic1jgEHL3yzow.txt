Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Of course, after seeing Man vs. Food, I'm pretty sure my entire reason for wanting to go to LA that weekend was for the Manuel Special burrito.  I thought it was great!  Chile was good, and the guac was really fresh.. . There was a line out the door, but it was just my husband and I, so we were able to jump ahead of the line to sit at the bar.  The waitstaff was nice, and we got out of there spending less than $20.  Can't go wrong!
