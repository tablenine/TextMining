Restaurant: Pho Cafe
Category: Vietnamese
I've been coming to Pho Cafe for years, and love it. BUT, let me just say that the service sometimes can be a bit spotty... when I first started eating at Pho Cafe there was one waiter who was pretty friendly, but I'm pretty sure he no longer works there and there's one waiter there who has zero personality (and has frosted tips that suit what a douche he is) - other than that, the wait staff is efficient if not really that friendly... but I digress. . . What I go to Pho Cafe for is not the traditional beef pho, but really the vegetarian pho and the vegetarian bun, which are both fantastic (especially when you add red chili sauce - yum!). I crave that veggie pho at least once a month, and I'm one happy woman when I've burned through yet another bowl of the stuff. I'm sure veggie pho may be an oxymoron/b.s. to some people, but goddamnit, it's so freaking good, who really gives a crap?
