Restaurant: Joe&#39;s On Juniper
Category: Gay Bars
I want to like Joe's just a little bit more, but they just haven't earned it quite yet.  (That said, I'm down with giving them many second chances.). . Went there for the second time yesterday, and it was a beautiful spring weekend, so the patio was super packed.  We ended up inside rather than standing around.  I'm not sure they had enough staff on hand for the crowd, as our server got roped into helping behind the bar.  This meant waiting a little while to get a drink, which isn't my favorite thing in the world.. . The food was fine.  Not "Oh my god I must have this again and again", but not bad.  Though the nacho chips appeared to be orange in color.  I hope that's just how it looked from all the fluorescent lighting.  (Though clearly it wasn't a health food kind of day.)
