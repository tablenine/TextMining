The little red fortune fishy predicted that I am going to be struck by a crane. I will then sue the city for 300 million dollars and purchase the glass tower on Astor place and turn it into an animal shelter.  Ok so the fishy didn't really predict that..but it did curl up on both ends which means that Tori K is very Passionate.  Come on.. are you surprised? . . I have been coming to Mermaid Inn since it opened in my nabe a few years back. I am very passionate about good food and drink...amongst other things...and I have never been disappointed by the fare or the fine bartenders (um none of your beeswax ) ..they make a kick ass dirty, spicy martini...that much I'll tell you.  . . The spaghetti with shrimp and scallops was cooked to perfection.. al dente the way pasta is designed to be.  Beware, the pomme frites with old bay seasoning are the best I have had in this town..crispy and quite addictive. The service is always pleasant and attentive, the coffee fresh and robust. They do not have a dessert menu, however, all patrons receive a gratis cup of  heavenly chocolate pudding. It's to die for. . . If I do get struck by a crane, I want my passionate body to be immersed in a pool of  Mermaid Inn's pudding where it can spend an eternity. The hell with cremation-my luscious ass deserves a proper  creamy pudding burial.
