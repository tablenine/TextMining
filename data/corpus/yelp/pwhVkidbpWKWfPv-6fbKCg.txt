Restaurant: Ru San&#39;s
Category: Sushi Bars
The great thing about RuSan's is the ability to have really fine-grained portion control in your meal.  With lots of 1-2 dollar nigiri options and three-piece rolls available, you can get exactly the right amount of food for your needs.  This is my idea of fast food: order just what you want, get it in five minutes or so.  (At least when you're at the sushi bar.). . That said, it's definitely not the place for a relaxed meal or a big group outing.  The music would be annoying if you were trying to have a real conversation.  But for a quick yet tasty meal, it's definitely a winner.
