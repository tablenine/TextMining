I didnt know what to expect when we pulled up, but it was a Garlic Extravaganza up in there! I like the decor, its pretty cozy spot. We started off with the pesto/chimichurri sauce &amp; onion/garlic rolls.  I ordered the Lousiana Shrimp (Sauteed garlic shrimp, in a tomato garlic sauce) and a side order of couscous (blah). I didnt see many dishes that I just had to try, everything seemed pretty basic. And i love garlic, but I wasnt too impressed. The best thing I tried were the rolls &amp; the garlic ice cream was good. . . We all thought the garlic ice cream was a bit much, and we were not sure what to expect. We asked if we could sample it first, but they didnt offer samples. Our server was so kind to bring us an order of the ice cream, b/c it was my friends birthday in 2days. So we got to try it and I actually loved it, especially the Caramel Mole sauce! That was some good stuff. . . Overall, this place has a good gimmick for tourist.  Im glad I got to try it but I dont think I would go back. I do like the concept though. My breathe was so bad afterwards! I even felt like my entire body was smelling like garlic, coming out of my pours! Yum!
