Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
When I stopped eating mammals almost 20 years ago, there were two foods I knew were going to be the hardest to forgo: bacon and french dip sandwiches. And so discovering Philippe's and their perfect turkey french dip made me very, very happy. . . Turkey with swiss, double-dipped. Two lemonades. More spicy mustard than I really should be trying to eat. This is happiness on a tray.. . I love the lines (they move so quickly), the counter ladies, the sawdust on the floors, and the communal tables where you never know who you might meet. I miss the old mustard containers with their little mustard spoons, but am begrudgingly learning to live with the new squeeze bottles.
