Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
The food here is so yummy!! I drive over an hour to get to Tito's Tacos.The place is not very nice and the area is a little dirty, but the food is great. The place is always busy! The reason why is that the food is absolutely great! My parents took me here, and every friend and family I introduced here is now a regular. Great for picky eaters!
