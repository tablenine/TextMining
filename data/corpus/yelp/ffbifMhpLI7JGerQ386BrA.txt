YUM!  I love this place!  Super great foods with some interesting combinations.  Love the specialty drinks.  They make a great cosmo.  My friend is a fan of their mint julep.  They also have outdoor seating, which is really great in the summertime.  The wait service was very friendly.  Good for both couples and small groups.  Been here 3 times and haven't found anything that I didn't enjoy!  Pasta/mussels, appetizers, mac and cheese!  They also have live music in the evenings (not sure what the schedule is).  Easy to get to.  Go go go!
