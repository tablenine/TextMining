I gave this place a try when I lived in Logan Square and it's just ok.  The chicken sandwich is very juicy and I liked the beer selection but it's nothing special.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I love the chocolate chip cookie sundae.  My complaints:  Small menu selection and they really should tell you that the wild rice is cold, yuck.
