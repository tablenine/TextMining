Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
Langer's is supposed to have the BEST Pastrami sandwich in LA .. which is not saying much because I think food in LA sux .. but I figure, hey, a restaurant that has been around for over a decade must know what it is doing, right?. . I can't say that the Pastrami sandwich here was the BEST that I've ever had but I would recommend it to others if you are in this area of town.. . The parking sux, the traffic sux, there are cops everywhere, and you might even see a loose chicken running in the street (no joke) but hey, that's Alvarado Street for ya.
