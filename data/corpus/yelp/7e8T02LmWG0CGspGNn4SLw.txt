Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
Urban Belly just went Belly Up.. . I'll try to make this brief.. . The food was way too salty and too greasy. The menu was very limited and - disjointed. Where are the vegetables? Strictly for those who have absolutely no concern about a healthy meal.. . As for the atmosphere, it was 80 degrees outside but the North Pole inside. The air conditioners were blowing hard and there was no place to hide. . . Service was a la Flat Top grill. You order your own food. You get your own service. And you pour your own water. The food came pretty quickly, but who cares. It was awful. . . By the end of the meal, I was wishing that I had gone to White Castle.
