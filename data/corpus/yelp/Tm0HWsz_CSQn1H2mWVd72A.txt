My good friend Nichole was kind enough to join me for dinner at JCT Kitchen, neither of us had been before and we were feeling a little adventurous. . . For a Sunday night business looked to be picking up rather well. Although not completely full to capacity, business looked to be brisk. We decided to sit outside on their patio. I enjoyed the courtyard view, although I wasn't sure if this was shared space or if they owned the surrounding buildings as well.. . Our servers were good, not big on small talk as they seemed to be hustling quite a bit. I had the duck confit on my mind initially from looking at the menu online earlier. One of our servers informed us of the Sunday Night Special: a prix fixe, which consisted of 2 entrees and 3 sides that could be shared for $24 a piece. Well, how could we pass to that? Keep in mind this included their biscuits with apple butter and cinnamon butter and a wonderful salad to start. And I almost forgot about the deviled eggs! Those are my vice.. . Nic went with the fried chicken and I went with the short ribs, our sides were the mashed potatoes, the mac &amp; cheese with bacon and the butter green beans. We were truly happy with our choices. My personal favorite were the mashed potatoes which were wonderfully rich in flavor. To end it off we were given a slice of chocolate cake. Truth be told, I didn't finish that...way too stuffed.. . Have to give kudos to the staff for not butting into our conversations, yet being very attentive.. . Looking forward to my next vist!
