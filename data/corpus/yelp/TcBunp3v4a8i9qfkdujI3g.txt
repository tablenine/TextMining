when you want a violet hour cocktail and an avec dinner, go to sepia. sit in the lounge if you enjoy your co-diners. the dining room is more conducive to shiney distraction and eavesdropping. . . the flat bread shouldn't be missed, nor should the grilled octopus - both deserving of deep head tilts. The pork chop was fantastic - and big enough to feed a small tribe. . . the experience is rich. we had to end the night at berry chill because our tummys couldn't take anymore decadence.
