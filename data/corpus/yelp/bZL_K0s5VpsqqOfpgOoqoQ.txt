Last time I went to this DTF was in July last year. I enjoyed it so much that I returned with my family. The service was good and the place was very busy. The parking was pretty bad and the line was long. They will not seat you until all your party is there. But the good dumplings made up for the long wait. Pork dumplings were especially good. Overall a very good experience.
