Wow, I must be an alcoholic, since this is the fourth bar I reviewed this week.  I mean since I work in marketing the automatic assumption is that I'm at least an alcoholic in social situations and that can I hold more down than one shot down.  Anyway, the Yardhouse in Pasadena and I go way back... lots of good times.... . FOOD/DRINKAGE:  Food is all right, unfortunately not very consistent, can range from being really good to just too salty (even for a salt fiend like myself!).  The portabellow sandwich with sweet potato fries is normally a safe bet for vegheads like me.  The onion ring tower is good but expensive (almost $10).  The drinks, however... I mean c'mon 100 beers on tap?!!!  How can it NOT be good?  Even the fruity ciders are good.   I have yet to down their famous yard-long glass of beer, maybe after my marathon training.... . AMBIENCE:  Very much like a hipper, homier sports bar with more professional-looking servers.  There's an outside seating area which is nice as it allows you fresh air and the opporunity to people watch.  It's a large space but I guarantee you that it will ALWAYS be crowded here, especially since this is right in the Paseo Colorado mall and right outside the movie theater.  That said, I would NOT advise coming here after watching a depressing movie.  Unless of course you want to tackle that Yardlong.... . PRICES: Definitely a bit more on the expensive side unless you come during Happy Hour.  Be prepared to shell out $25 a person if you want food and at least a decent selection of drinks.  I'd recommend at least trying 2 of their beers on tap.. . PARKING: Very convenient since it's right in the heart of the Paseo Colorado mall.  And they validate parking at the theaters and most of the stores.  Nice.... . Now about that Yardlong...
