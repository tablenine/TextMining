Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Don't go expecting too much...it is not worth an hour wait, but it's still pretty good...for a hot dog. This place is not about the dog, it's about the toppings. If you're really curious, I'd say go when you don't have anything else to do...just to fulfill that curiosity. It also depends on what you're in the mood for and if you are starving. Their chili is phenomenal...it's the kind where, if you look in the huge vat of chili that they scoop out of, if they haven't touched it for a minute you'll already start seeing the layer of grease forming at the top. Know what I mean? They have to get the ladle and give it a bit of a stir to mix all that goodness in there before topping your hot dog with it. It's pretty much a heart attack in a bun...I think this place is a total tourist trap, but it's still something to try at least once in LA.
