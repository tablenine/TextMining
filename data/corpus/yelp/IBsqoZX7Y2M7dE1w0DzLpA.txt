Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Just went to Canter's this morning at about 2am, and dayumm..... . How is it that I have spent so much time in LA, practically my second home, and never enjoyed the late-night experience that is Canter's? I walked in with my buddy and immediately felt like I had entered a 1950s Jewish deli. The lighting over the dining area is so funky. I don't think I've ever seen such lighting before. Yes, i know, they are just colored pieces of plastic, but I was impressed.. . The service was spot-on, and the menu has everything I would want EXCEPT smoked sable. The prices are pretty standard for a Jewish eatery ($14/person) but it is well worth the price when you need 24/7 comfort food. I will surely be visiting Canter's again soon.
