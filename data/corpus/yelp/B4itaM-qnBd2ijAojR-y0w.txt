To be honest, I was expecting more for some reason.  Perhaps, its because I've been to the real thing in Rio or perhaps because my boyfriend did not gorge nearly enough to impress me.  Something was just off to me.  . . The bread was ok.  Not as great as reported.  I'm a carb-phene and had no desire to eat more than 1.  The mashed potatos were good.  The plantains- just like all other plantains.  The polenta- bland.  . . Salad bar was great.  I wish I had eaten more of this.  I love sun-dried tomatoes, so I was in heaven!  . . Meat- most of it was delicous.  However, I found a lot of it to be overly salty.  The filet mignon was the best!  Picanha pretty good and lamb chops were good.  Also, beef ribs were good (but way salty).  . . Some of the meats were a bit dried out even though I typically order medium rare.  . . Oh well, overall, it was fine, but I have no desire to go back.
