Holy. Incredible curry. I couldn't shut up about it.. . Minus 1 star for their very scary and strange 'fried meatballs'. But then again, what I was thinking ordering that from a thai place is beyond me. All I know is all the guys on my crew couldn't' even figure out what kind of meat it was. And these guys know their meat.. . Again, this speaks to the food only, as we catered it for lunch. . . Other highlights were the sweet &amp; sour pork and pad see ewe. Reasonable prices, and tasty thai.
