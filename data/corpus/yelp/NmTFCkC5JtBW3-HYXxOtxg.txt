This is a review of the bar and the bar snacks.. . I waited about five minutes for someone to take my order.  Then I waited longer.  And longer.  Eventually, a different waiter, who couldn't believe I hadn't been served yet, went and hunted down my margarita.. . It was extremely tasty, but tiny.  A few sips, and it was gone.  I had a second, but at these prices, I was reluctant to have a third.  The waiter brought me a glass of water without me having to ask -- that was nice.. . I had the cheese plate and the marinated olives.  The cheese plate was pretty good; five cheeses, large servings, many accompaniments -- though no bread, only crackers, and not many of those.  The marinade on the olives was so spicy that I couldn't taste the olives.. . After happy hour ended at 7 p.m., the prices went up and the place emptied out.  There never was anybody in the restaurant -- recession?. . Overall, there were some good points, but it was too uneven for me to want to go back.
