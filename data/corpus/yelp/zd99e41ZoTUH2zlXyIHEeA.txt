First time I visited this place was for my buddy's birthday function.  I am glad I did.  The place is clean and has a large dining area.  They have a large salt water aquarium (a nice touch).  There is valet parking in the back, but they do charge.  I think it is $3.  I don't do valet parking anymore after seeing what some valet drivers do to your car once they drive your car away.  Youtube "valet drift".  I just park a block away in the residential area.  This way I can walk off the food when I'm done eating.. . I arrived there at 7 PM and they let us sit at a table even though majority of our party had not arrived yet.  We were served drinks when we were seated at our tables while waiting for the rest of our party.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Our server was nice and friendly.  He frequently checked with us to make sure everything is fine.  There is also a singing Elvis that only performs at night time from around 8 - 10 PM I think.  He sings the birthday song to the birthday person and he takes requests on what Elvis song to perform.  It was starting to get packed as the night progressed.. . This place serves great thai food.  I got to try a few dishes, but the BBQ steak and fried fish stood out of the bunch.  The steak was marinated perfectly.  It was tender and juicy.  The fried fish was served with mango sauce and sliced mango on top.  The typical thai iced tea, shrimp pad thai, and pineapple fried rice were good too.  Price of each dish is around $7-$10.  Average is about ~$35 for 2 people.. . I recommend to check this place out if you have not been here before.  A nice set up of good food with live entertainment during dinner time within the Hollywood area.. . Bon Apettit!
