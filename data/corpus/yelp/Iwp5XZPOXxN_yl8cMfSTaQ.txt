Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Manna, Manna, Manna. My Korean friends (I know, I know) started taking me here years ago before they started with the whole all-you-can-eat thing, and I guess (at least among my friends) there's been an undercurrent of sentiment about Manna going downhill. . . Yes, the bathrooms are kind of gross and sometimes you have to wait (if you're unprepared, mostly), but I still like the food, the generally attentive service (even when none of us at the table speak korean), the indoor/outdoor seating area, the bells on the tables, and the general boisterous atmosphere. OH, and it's cheap as hell, maybe $25 a person if you drink to excess.
