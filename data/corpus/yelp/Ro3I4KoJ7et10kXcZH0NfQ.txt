They have the biggest menu ever, with every type of food imaginable, but none of it is that amazing, then again that's not why you go there.  At night it's fun, be sure to check out the top (the best one+patio) and bottom floor which I didn't even know existed until a few visits later.  The middle floor is set up like a sports bar with more TVs than a TV store.  Prices aren't bad, good chili cheese fries, and food is served all night.
