Great food and service.  As many Yelpers had suggested the Grilled Octopus and the Burrata with Bacon, we started with those.  However, my husband was less than excited about the Octopus as he ate half the Burrata first - my own idea is that the Burrata is a tough act to follow (it was delicious!).  . . We thought we'd be too full if we got a pasta and then an entree as well as we didn't think we were hungry enough, but as we figured portions would be small we thought we should get a little something more than just one pasta each - so we got two each.  And my stomach still hurts the day after! It was delicious though.  The Tagliatelle with oxtail ragu (loved the shredded meaty sauce), Gnocchi with wild boar ragu (pasta balls melted in your mouth), Goat Cheese Ravioli with five lilies  (with lots of grilled yummy garlic), and Orecchiette with sausage &amp; Swiss chard  (herbs were great - wonder if its the same as the fennel sausage used next door - would assume so) were all wonderfu.  Absolutely no room for dessert.  Heck, I'm not sure I have room for dinner the NEXT day!. . And we brought our own wine (from a wine tasting trip in Santa Barbara - Rideau Estate Mourvedre) which was delicious and they treated quite nicely with large balloon glasses and the offer to decant ($20 corkage)
