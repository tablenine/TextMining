YUM!!!!!!  This place is the bomb!  It was my first time here last Friday.  The last was crazy.  When we got there, the hostess told us it would be an hour wait.  We put our name down and waited, and waited, and waited.  An hour passed by and we were coming up to 1-1/2 hour.  Finally, just before 9PM, we got our table.. We ordered a pound of shrimp, a pound of clams, one lobster, corn, sweet potato fries and cajun fries.  Sauce was the whole sha-bang.  It was delicious!!!!  Well worth the wait.  I'm ready to back again.  Maybe this week on a week night...
