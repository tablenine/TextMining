I found the dining experience here to be pretty enjoyable. . My mango margarita was one of the best margaritas I've ever had, which you should expect from a place named Agave. Â The green chile stew is the real deal, which is nice. You can tell the chef has a good handle on southwestern cooking techniques and flavors and interprets them into pleasing dishes.. I had the enchiladas and thought they were pretty decent, if a little lacking on spice. The collard greens were tasty.. Nice waitstaff and nice atmosphere, too. Add the fact that you can get a 2 for 1 coupon in the mail and this is a good value!
