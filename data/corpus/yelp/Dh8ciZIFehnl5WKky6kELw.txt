I really love this place and can't imagine why I'm the last one in the city to tryi it.  The Maza Platter is a beauty to behold.  It has about 9 appetizers/dips.  The hummus was creamy with just the right amount of garlic and lemon juice, the sour cream-dill dip was divine -- thick and creamy. The eggplant salad was very flavorful. I found a new favorite in their Havuc Salatasi (a carrot salad of sorts) with shredded carrots, parsley, dill, yogurt, and spices. It was so good. The tabouli was perfect, as were the babaganush (an eggplant dip), the red bean salad, and everything else on the plate. The grilled pita bread that came on the side was the perfect accompaniment, although the size of the pieces made it very hard to actually get a good chunk of dip onto them. No matter, forks to the rescue and rescue they did.. . The grilled platter came with an assortment of meats: beef and lamb gyros, lamb, chicken, beef, ground lamb. Every bit was as delectable as the next with my mouth sinking into tender, juicy morsels of meat that are full of flavor and grilled perfectly. I haven't had it any better than this.. . But the best came in the form of a Gyro -- grilled soft, warm pita bread topped with tender slices of spit-roasted lamb and beef then topped with fresh shredded lettuce and tzatziki sauce. Tasty. Delicious. And the best in town. . . I love everything about this place and can't wait to come back.
