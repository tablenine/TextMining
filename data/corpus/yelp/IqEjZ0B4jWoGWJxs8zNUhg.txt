I used to visit quite frequently when this place first opened. I think success is it's own demise. They expanded their store front and they are still overwhelmed with demand. It's simply not a pleasant eating environment as you are just rushed to finish your food.  There is also a sense of arrogance among it's staff. Food wise, it is decent. I would certainly not rate it high. The sausage is just about the only thing I order. Crispy chicken is over fried and bland. Drinks are mediocore. Ten Ren is much better. I can't deal with the madness. They've raised their prices a couple of times to divert traffic, but that hasn't worked.  I just order to-go if I am hungry. . The parking lot is just horrible....very hard to find a space in this plaza.
