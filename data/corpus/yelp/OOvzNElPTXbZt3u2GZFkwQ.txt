So, I'm into Japanese food, and for my birthday last year I wanted to try a new so-called Best Japanese restaurant. So I dive into my Zagat guide like everyone else and there it is, Mirai Sushi. So we finally get to go, and it was early summer late spring, and we dined out on the patio, that was quite nice. The atmosphere is very nice, upscale, Hip. There defiantly was a younger crowd here than I expected. If I recall the only Japanese person I saw, was the Sushi chef that we met. Very skilled guy. An Artiste  . . It was a while ago so my recount isn't so vivid, but I know everything was great, and I enjoyed it very much. I think for the four of us we spent about $400 on dinner, we order everything. It was a great birthday, but I don't think it impressed me enough to venture that far on my own. What can I say, I'm spoiled! Then again maybe it's time for a second visit! . . Cheers!
