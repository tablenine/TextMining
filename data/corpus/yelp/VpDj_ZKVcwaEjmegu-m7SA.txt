Restaurant: Harry &amp; Sons
Category: Sushi Bars
Harry &amp; Sons makes some of the best sushi in Atlanta. If you enjoy good sushi, this restaurant is a must try! I've heard bad things about the service here but my experience was pleasant. I waited less than five minutes for a table and our waiter appeared in moments. I ordered soup which came out before my food, so I wasn't starving by the time dinner arrived. I would recommend dining here but perhaps not on Friday or Saturday, as this restaurant is a popular choice for Atlantans. Even if the service is slow, the Â final product is worth the wait!
