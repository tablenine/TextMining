Yes, Please.... . This place was carnivore heaven.  They had a special promotion, Around the Horn in 40 days for $40 (2oz portions of 6 different cuts).  I could actually taste the difference between the 40 day aged beef and the 28 day (40 is the way to go).  My lady friend had the aged bone-in ribeye special which she also loved.  The chorizo mashed potatoes were yummy, but a little greasy and I would definitely go back just for the cheesecake lollipops.  They're little bite size pieces of cheesecake dipped in frosting of some sort.  It's kitschy, but just the right amount to share.  . . The only thing we didn't like were the zucchini/shrimp fritters for an app.  Flavorless and disappointing.  Other than that, an excellent meal!
