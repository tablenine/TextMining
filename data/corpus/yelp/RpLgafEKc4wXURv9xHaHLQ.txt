Read the website before you go on all of the ways Uncommon Ground is focused on maintaining a eco-friendly, local &amp; organic environment. I think it made me appreciate the food / atmosphere that much more. The menu changes seasonally and I'd definitely come back for the summer fare.. . The server knew all of the gluten free options off the top of his head which was reassuring so I had bacon crusted chicken with cheese-y mashed potatoes, broccoli and a side of bbq sauce. Not very innovative but tasty none the less. The 22oz bottle of Organic JK Skrumpys Cider for $12 isn't bad. Typically its $8 at Whole Foods.
