Well, let's start by saying they were NOT SERVING TACOS! Who ever heard of a restaurant not serving tacos because there's "not enough room in the kitchen". So, that pretty much killed our group's order since we were all excited for the tilapia tacos. They also lost our reservation and made us wait for 30 minutes, which made the birthday girl feel bad. AND the waitress seemed actually pissed that we were confused about what to order. I mean, at least tell us you're not serving tacos when you give us the menus. geez. It's too bad because the cactus sope was good, but I'm still never going back.
