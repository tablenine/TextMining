Restaurant: Desta Ethiopian Kitchen
Category: Ethiopian
Before coming to Atlanta, the only time I had Ethiopian food was a restaurant somewhere in West LA. Since then, I did try a couple of places, but they were mostly hall-in-the-walls.. . This one is definitely not the case - at least in comparison with the others.. . I am making this point because in that block, there are actually several Â Ethiopian restaurants (including one hole-in-the-wall I mentioned earlier). Eating in that place, I understood why it managed to hold its own - the presentation of the food as well as the interior was quite nice. . . I had the Kifto-wrap (its like steak tartare wrapped in Injera) which look deceptively light - until the heat start kicking in after you swallow them whole (Thanks goodness for the refreshments). The main course was the rib eye tibs w/collard greens - so good that I didn't need any more spices to add to it.. . Afterwards, just for cooling down the heat, I had the Tiramisu (Which is alright). That threw me off a bit, until I remember that Ethiopia was an Italian colony for a while (I don't think it'll be a good idea to mention that, though). . Definitely will come back to the place. Yay.
