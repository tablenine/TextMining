Restaurant: Grand Lux Cafe
Category: American (New)
I'm a pretty big fan of the Cheesecake Factory, but the Grand Lux Cafe takes it to another level. Its a glorified version of CF, with better quality food. . . The menu here is extensive... Â and like CF, covers a wide variety of foods. I do have to say, that the burgers here are absolutely amazing and the breakfast is probably one of my favorites for a big chain restaurant. . . If you happen to be in the City of Angels, stop by here for a great meal. You won't be disappointed.
