Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
Three for originality.... -It was clean and well kept, good decorations. -The price was around $9 (lunch). -The meat had a odd flavor not good or bad.  just odd and had fat. -Not really a sauce to comment on. -Lots to choose from. -Staff was friendly . -Sides were pretty good. I have had BBQ in Hawaii and this is not to be compared.
