Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Went to the restaurant with my friend.  We had the mediteranean salad and Ugo pizza, we both thought it was really good.  I won't say it's the best I have had, but it definitely hit the spot. The wait staff was pretty attentive and nice, I would eat this meal again, but I'm not fiending for it.
