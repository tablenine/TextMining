Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I went at around 11 at night and waited with my group for about 45 minutes to order. The line was moving slow because the owner at the register is very nice and was greeting every customer and making sure they were being taken care of.... . That's nice and all, but the food was not that great. Too much hype, no delivery. I got the chili dog with some other toppings on top and the chili cheese fries and both were blah...and keep in mind, I was starving.. . I guess it's part of that "experience", but I only needed to go there once and never again unless I'm willing to wait nearly an hour for a hot dog. . . Nothing special here--Costco dogs are better--sad to say.
