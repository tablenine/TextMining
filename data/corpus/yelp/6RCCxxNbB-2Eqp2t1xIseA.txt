not enough bang for my buck.... . okay, i get the hype. since everyone who's someone is talking about it, it's worth trying once. but unless you have a false sense of genuine quality and cool, i guarantee you will never return! . . i learned this lesson the hard way. after my food made me quasi-ill, the waiter overcharged me and i could barely hear my double-dates, i was the idiot who decided to give mr. meyers another shot at brunch. . . i am a connoisseur of very little, but i know my bloodies. and this was like sipping the river styx. eew. (in all fairness, the rest of their drink menu deserves accolades.). . AND who's snobby about breakfast??? we were not allowed to add tomatoes to an omelette. i mean, is that a joke? . . this restaurant deserves a big fat "get over yourself".
