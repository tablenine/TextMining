Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
I have been eating at the wiener's circle since 1982, so I must say I am a bit of a "circle snob".  I grew up one block away and still make afternoon trips there with my parents for a family lunch.. . Don't get me wrong.  I love my Wiener's...but. . I give ZERO STARS to the drunk suburbanites who act like they've never seen a black person before who come to the WC on weekend nights.  . . I also give ZERO STARS to people who think that they are the "super cool" for thinking they are the first to discover the WC.  . . Another ZERO STARS will be given out to anyone who drives in from the burbs after midnight only to yell at people.. . With that said, I refuse to eat hot dogs from anywhere else.  Now that I am out of high-school (this is where we hung out on weekend nights...seriously) I prefer to eat my winers while then sun is still up.. . Just be prepared for amazing fries and dogs...with a serious side of entertainment!!!
