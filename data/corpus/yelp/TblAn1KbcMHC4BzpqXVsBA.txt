Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So I've seen this on Food Network and Travel Channel so I knew I had to try it... We came here tonight and I expected a long, long, long, long line. But the line was only maybe 10 minutes tops.. . There are tons of hot dog combos that it puts Top Dog in Berkeley to Shame!... I got the Mulholland Drive (mushrooms, grilled onions, 3 slices of bacon and nacho cheese) and my sister ordered the Spicy Polish (topped with chili, onions and mustard). We also got fries and onion rings... . Anyway, I really enjoyed each and every bite. My sister's spicy polish was especially tasty. It had a lot of kick and spice that it was almost too much to handle.. . Ugh. Our stomachs hurt right now. Maybe it's just gas. haha
