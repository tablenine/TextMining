This place has maybe the best pizza at least in the state of California. Â Pretty hard to get in here to eat because it is really popular but it is well worth it once you get passed that and the parking situation. Can't go wrong with any of the pizzas or desserts. Great vegetarian options and this will not dissapoint you.
