This place is rather upscale for the EAV scene. I noticed a mix of yuppies and the typical EA tattooed punkers. I met the owner who seemed to be a really nice guy. It is good to see a new restaurant/ bar with an owner overseeing the daily work. . . The first time I went there I met this funny guy who was drunk off his ass and could talk up a freaking tornado about his strained relationships with women. I wanted to say hey man, shush up and quit thinking so much, but then I realized this probably WAS him not thinking too much. He was triple fisting it when I got there. . . Anyway, one dish of the food was good (the cordon blue) and one was bad (the philly). The normal entrees are about 13-18 so they were a little high for me at the time. . . The service was moderate at best (they really need to improve here). The beer selection was good, but pricey (unless you drink PBR).. I would recommend it if you want a nicer kind of place to go to in EAV.
