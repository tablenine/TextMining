LOVED IT!. . Everything I saw on the menu was $8.50 or less.. . Portion size was awesome, well over what I was expecting.. . AND THEY DON'T OVER COOK THEIR TOFU!!!!!!!!! We got the tofu appitizer and it was perfect.  Nice crispy seared outside, yummy warm creamy inside.  . . Walked past the kitchen on the way to the bathroom, and both were impeccably clean which always makes my a happy panda.. . The chili condiments on the table were super flavorful but not all fire which is also a big one in my books.  All the sauces we tried were great actually.  Not overpowering, not all processed and artificial tasting.  Lovely and fresh.. . Servers were on our drinks like white on rice ( ennnh....get it?) and very helpful with describing some of the dishes for my uber picky eater of a wife (love you baby, but its true and you know it).. . We sat outside but the inside was very open, clean and not turbo loud (decor and music) like most of my oriental dinning experiences.  . . Go, go now, trust me.
