Tequila 3-way &amp; a Panty Dropper.....the perfect way to celebrate the adjournment of a 5 hour meeting. Cheap eats, cheap drinks it gets no better then this. Another spot right near my high school. I am amazed at all the places located in this area now, i remember when we got excited over the opening of a Mickey D's...... . I didn't think there were places in NYC with prices this low, hell even McDonald's cost more. . . Great spot to wind down after a long day at work. An order of hot wings, waffle fries with Gold BBQ sauce (LOOOOVE IT) and a Mind Eraser bomb shot.....all for $13, C'mon Son, you can't beat that.. . So whether its Happy Hour after that long day at work or pre-gaming before taking on NYC nightlife, you can go all out without breaking your pockets! 123.....321 Simplicity is Sweet!
