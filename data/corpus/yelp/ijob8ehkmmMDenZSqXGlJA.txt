Restaurant: Gloria&#39;s Cafe
Category: Mexican
I celebrated Cinco de Mayo with my boyfriend and some coworkers a day earlier at Gloria's Cafe on Sunday, May 4th. It was everyone's first time at the restaurant.. . The dim atmosphere and the service was excellent. The restaurant felt real cozy like a home away from home and I was able to talk to everyone at my table without raising my voice. I was surprised that Gloria herself came to greet us and she walked around the restaurant to make sure that everyone else was doing well too. Our table even got to hear a little history about the restaurant after I explained to her how I found her cafe on Yelp and how great everyone had rated her restaurant.. . The Sangria was so good that everyone at the table ordered one. My boyfriend and I tried the Carne Asada Plate and we would've finished it if we hadn't filled up on the chips! We'll definitely be going back again with some more friends. =D. . I took away a star only because parking was so bad that there wasn't any parking in the tiny lot or up the streets on either side of the restaurant for up to two blocks. My car was parked halfway in front of someone else's driveway. My bf carpooled with me, but definitely will need to take less cars next time.
