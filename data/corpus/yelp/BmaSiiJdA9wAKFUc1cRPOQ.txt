Went tonight for a last hurrah before the holiday ends and enjoyed every second. Amazing food, classy ambiance, very friendly (and unpretentious) staff and server - doesn't get much better. We had the trio, but doubled up on the butterfish and left out the salmon, which was a great idea from our server. Also, loved the sunrise roll and lobster dim sum! We read that the chocolate souffle was a can't miss and true enough, it was amazing. Can't wait to go back!
