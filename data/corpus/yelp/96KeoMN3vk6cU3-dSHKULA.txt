The burrito is huge. HUGE. It's like all of the world's burritos joined forces to form one giant superburrito. It must've weighed as much as a small infant. Seriously, it is that big.. . I got a vegetarian burrito for the low, low price of $7.35. Considering that one burrito is like three or four meals for me, that's a fucking bargain. There was no line, and my take-out order was ready in five minutes.. . I was under the impression that "vegetarian" meant veggies, but I think it just meant no meat; there were no veggies other than in the salsa. But the generous amount of guacamole did make it delicious (and perhaps the avocados in the guacamole count as vegetables?).
