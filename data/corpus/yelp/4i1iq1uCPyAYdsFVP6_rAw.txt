Restaurant: Real Food Daily
Category: Vegetarian
I've only been to one vegan restaurant better than Real Food Daily and that's Millennium in San Francisco. Real Food Daily offers delicious, delicious vegan food at a...well it depends on what you consider reasonable price. What I will say is that I would much rather spend money at Real Food Daily than A. Cook or B. Go to some nasty Thai vegan restaurant where everything tastes like sh*t! I have had to pleasure to meet all of the employees and they are all very helpful, even when busy. I highly recommend the following: Not-Cho (previously called Better With Cheddar Nachos), Burger With The Works (regular burger is not worth your time, pay the extra money), Club Sandwich, Taco The Town, Viva La Pasta (which I think is off the menu now, sad sad), Caesar Salad, and basically anything! It's really hard to go wrong here. It's located in a very central location and near an amazing clothing store called Opening Ceremony. BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR WEEKLY SPECIALS, SOME ARE GREAT! I also MUST say that the brunch is the ONLY BRUNCH IN LOS ANGELES, I will go to. I make sure that no matter what is going on in my life, no matter how hungover I am, that I always, ALWAYS go to brunch a RFD!
