Great place for lunch.. be prepared to wait 30 to 45 min to place your order then wait another 30 to 40 min in the community dining hall to be served during peak times... Try the mango jalapeno sausage and the Filipino .. they are great!!  Also, the Belgian fries are great, they remind me of "Pomme Frites"  the place in the East Village, NYC..  a definite must try..
