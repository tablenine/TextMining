Restaurant: El Barco
Category: Mexican
El Barco is extremely hit or miss. The service can be very good or notsomuch depending on when you go. The same goes for the food. The first time I went I was actually depressed because I ordered some type of fish and I swear to you there was not one granule of salt or anything that tasted remotely like seasoning on my plate. . . Today was a completely different story. I ordered the mussels with garlic &amp; wine sauce. OH-EM-GEE. It was soooo goooood. I could seriously get an IV of that broth straight into my veins. My friend ordered shrimp and it was pretty bland, but we decided we would just dip it into the mussel broth and all was right with the world.. . So, I think with this place, you need to just go when it's not too busy and know what to order. It's a little trial and error, but I'll defintitely try this place again.
