Here is another mexican restaurant review from another person who doesn't really like Mexican food. To be honest, I feel like the nicest thing that someone like me can say is, this place serves Mexican food that does not taste like Mexican food I've had anywhere No one with a pot holder .is going to bring you a platter-plate filled with a beany cheesy mess. It is a simple but clean establishment. You will probably see people waiting in the lot for the doors to open. Very kid and people friendly. You order from a cashier and food comes out unbelievably fast. I always order the cole slaw, and fish tacos. TDS is a great example of "less is more". . . PS: no crispy tacos, but there is alcohol.
