Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
The first time I had the pleasure of going to the Magic Castle I was just a kid, and I went with my family for the Sunday brunch. I remember the magic shows, especially the closeup magic, and the place was just so mysterious and interesting. Years later, being an adult, my brother is now a member and I go every so often. It's never a bad night at the castle! Most of the people I have met there randomly are so friendly and interesting to talk to, the bars have great drinks, and the shows are never disappointing. . Only negative thing I could think of, occasionally you'll bump into a member or guest there with a stank-ass "better than thou" attitude, which kind of kills it. It once took a lot out of me to refrain from taking off my high heel and smacking some dumb broad upside the head! Lucky for her, I have at least a little class! *ahem* I could tell by the look on some peoples faces, they were probably thinking of physically harming her too. :P . Other than that, I adore this place! oh, the staff is all wonderfully friendly and amusing too! I wubbb you magic castle!!! Muah! . . Tip: It's a much better idea to go on a weekday. Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights get extremely packed!
