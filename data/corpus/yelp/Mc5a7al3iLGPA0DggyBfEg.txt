Restaurant: Koronet Pizza
Category: Pizza
Pizza quality here ranges from excellent to so-so. At its best, Koronet's reminds me of why I love NYC pizza, but on bad days, it's comparable to Famous Famiglia. Nevertheless, if you are in the mood for cheap, potentially quintessential NYC pizza, Koronet's is a good bet. . . I try to get slice of whatever is fresh out of the oven -- piping hot and delicious. Recently, we ordered two large pizzas for a group of friends and they were a hit; luckily, the pies were fresh out of the oven. Koronet's reheated slices that have been sitting around for a couple of hours remind me of day-old dorm pizza. . . Slices are huge and really affordable.
