Ok we weren't hungry when we got in line but after an hour we were starving!! Omg the veggie (pat morrison) dog was delicious!! Too much guac tho...made this hot dog a cold dog (whomp whomp!!) Next time I'll ask for the guac on the side.....onion rings and french fries are ubber bomb with a Dr. Brown cream soda washing it down!! . . Totally vegetarian friendly (with offering only one dog for us) but it was yummy!!!!
