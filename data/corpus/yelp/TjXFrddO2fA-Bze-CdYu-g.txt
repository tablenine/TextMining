Restaurant: The Foundry On Melrose
Category: American (New)
The Foundry sounded like a fine classic establishment from its coverage in foodie mags and hollywood but through the $44 dineLA experience, the restaurant's reputation seemed over glorified.. . The blues band was setting up to play and the front and patio areas were filled with cocktail drinks.  They were short on staff, so much that Chef Eric Greenspan came out and sat us on this particular Tuesday.  (We got visual confirmation by one of the waiters).  Chef Eric offered us specials on the absinthe drink (the legal version) called the Dragon and Dennis was the only brave one who accepted (it tasted pretty bad).  After this, we didn't see the chef until he came back after the entree arrived and asked how it was.  That was nice of him.. . Instead of a basket of bread, the restaurant served various little in-between-course carbs.  it was a nice touch.  My appetizer of crispy pork belly was quite nice but i wish it was bigger.   The chorizo-crusted jidori chicken was tasty but didn't know what was chorizo-crusted about it.  The chicken did have an odd-textured skin...maybe that's what it was...sausage casing on chicken.  The homemade donut is nothing to tell your friends about.  You can get a better one at your favorite donut store.  The pineapple saffron marmalade and chocolate didn't really pair well, so that was a bit odd.. . Water service was okay, the food was good but on the OK side, and ambiance is also OK.  Not quite worth the $44+tax and tip.  . . I think it might be a nice place to have a light dinner in the summertime when the patio is open-sky and the weather is warm.      . . see pics - start from here: . http://www.yelp.com/bi....
