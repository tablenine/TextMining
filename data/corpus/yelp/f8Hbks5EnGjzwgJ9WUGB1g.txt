I can't really talk about the history of this place because I am not a local. I also can't talk about the environment or the table service since I got my food to-go.. . But I will say that I ate one hell of a corn beef pastrami sandwich on rye.. . It seriously is something I crave for now, every time I go back to LA, I will need to get back there and get me one of the sandwiches. . . One star down because it was a little bit on the expensive side.
