Restaurant: Hashiguchi Jr.
Category: Japanese
More like actual Japan than any restaurant I've eaten at in this hemisphere.  Why?. . - Atmosphere is dead on.  Walk in and there's a little window in front of you and a beaded curtain beside.  Behind is the sushi bar and just a few tables.  It's stark and a little cramped.  Just like Japan.. . - Sushi is SO fresh and yumtastic.  The Chef's choice sashimi offers little nuggets of several different types of fish.  Some I'd order myself, others that I would need a little nudging.  All delicious.. . - Tempura batter is light as a feather, and more delicious (although confess it I've never eaten a feather).  The tempura shrimp is especially delightful.. . - Service is lovely.  I was there at lunch with a party of 7 to celebrate a going away.  The server thought we were celebrating a birthday.  Without asking, she delivered a green tea ice cream, fruit loop, and coco puff sundae complete with chocolate syrup and sprinkles.  Surprisingly delicious!  But especially delicious since we didn't even ask.  THANK YOU!. . I'll go back again and again.  There are so many things that I want to try!
