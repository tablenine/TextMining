Dinner last week was wonderful.  I think we ordered a little bit of everything, but the standouts were the tofu "ceviche", coconut buns with pork belly, duck confit (always my favorite!) and the coconut ice cream.  The few pitchers of sangria worked too.. . Great service and nice to see that Hector is still totally hands-on in the kitchen.
