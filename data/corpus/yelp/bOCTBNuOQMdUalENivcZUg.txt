my boyfriend and i came here on a whim. we were looking for a good place for brunch so i went on yelp and voila this placed popped up. we were surprised at how big the portions were. when we walked in we saw everyone with their pancakes. i was tempted to order one, but i was really in the mood for waffles with strawberry and that's exactly what i got. he ordered something completely diff. he got eggs. potatoes and ham. it was really yummy. there was this cream thing on my waffles that i wasn't too fond of. but the waffles itself were really light and fluffy and the strawberries were really fresh.
