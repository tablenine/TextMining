Restaurant: Buddha Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Chinese Buddha is good comfort food.  Their Chinese Vegetarian / mock meat stuff is really what they are known for. . . They have crazy late hours and delivery times for when you tweakers are dying for dumplings @ 4AM.  . . I'm partial to the dirty old 14th St motel location, but the more upscale digs are more inviting to the less adventurous.. . I order take-out and delivery from here frequently and dine in on occasion.  As much as I order it- it is just a little better (mostly due to veg options) than your average Chin-Chin style place.
