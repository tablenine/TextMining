I haven't read any of the previous reviews, so please excuse me if I repeat more of the same.. . My fiancee and I passed Urban Belly a couple of times before eventually finding it.  Who would've ever thunk it would be right next to a Bubbleland-style laundromat?  I also was not expecting Urban Belly to have a nightclub exterior.   It was a Friday night (7ish), and we had to wait only about 5-7 minutes to be seated.  We were kind of put off by the fact that you sit on stools, and we even noticed they ran out of stools.  Consequently, we saw one poor soul who had to eat ramen while sitting on a large cement bucket.  I guess the idea is to be cozy and close enough to meet others, so just be prepared.  Another oddity is ordering, paying, and tipping BEFORE sitting, tasting, or getting served.  I felt a little cheated with my generous tip since the service was average.. . We ordered 1) pork and cilantro dumplings 2) short rib and scallion rice and 3) udon (shrimp, coriander, and chili lime broth).  All were meh.  4 dumplings for $7 was expensive for regular pan-fried dumplings.  I'd much rather make my own or go to Chinatown.  The rice dish was pretty good, but a little small.  The noodles were better than expected but about triple the price and about half as good as pho in Argyle.. . Overall, we felt the experience of dining at this new hot spot was nice but slightly unsatisfying, especially since when we became hungry again after only 3 hours -- and we are not big eaters.
