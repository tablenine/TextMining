I had the roasted duck breast with sweet potato puree.  It was so juicy and good, it was just perfect!  The star of the night though, was the rosemary ice cream that came with (one of) my dessert(s).  It was so clean and fresh tasting, I loved it!  The lavender creme brulee is also excellent, the taste of lavender is not overwhelming, but adds a nice bit of interest to the dish.  Wonderful!
