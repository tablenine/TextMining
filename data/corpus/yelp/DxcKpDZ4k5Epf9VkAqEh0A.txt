Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Most people are saying there was a long line and usually there is every time you drive by this  place its down the street. But luckily for me, I didnt have more then 10 people in front of me.. I do not think it is something people should go out of the way for. I mean how much different cane a hot dog taste then any other time you make it...!? Plus if you want to stay and eat there... there is not much seating room. . Since it is very famous, everyone has to try it at least once!  :)
