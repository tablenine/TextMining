super good breakfast food, and great location (danzig's house is right down the street. have some pancakes, then lotter at glen danzig's pad). The sevice is pretty good too, all of the servers are really nice and polite. My favorite thing on the menu is the strawberry barret (thick french toast, strawberries and whipped cream). plus this place has the best vegan saussage i've ever had.. . the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because its always crowded and the parking situation is kind of shitty..
