Restaurant: Opart Thai House Restaurant
Category: Thai
I dined here for the first and only time a few weeks ago.  Two appetizers, the Crab Rangoon and a tasty something-or-other with peanut sauce, had us all salivating for more.  However, we had 4 diners and 2 of them were disappointed with their meals.  Apparently our friends, who live in Lincoln Square, had enjoyed many a meal here, but something was off the night we visited.  This seems consistent with the reviews of many recurring patrons- when it's good, it's really good, but when it's not, it's just okay.  There are multiple Thai establishments in the area, so I'm not sure if I'd return to Opart and take a gamble, or try somewhere new and take a gamble.  It's a bit of a Catch-22.
