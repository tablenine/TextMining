Pretty authentic Korean restaurant.  We ordered a pajun, which was pretty good, although a couple of my friends thought it was too flimsy for a pajun.  We also ordered the BBQ bojoke/octopus combo and the BBQ unmarianted sliced beef.  They were also very good.  What's more interesting is that they did kimchi fried rice on the BBQ grill for us afterward.  We've been to more than 15 Korean restaurants in many cities around the country before, and this was the 1st BBQ kimchi fried rice we've had.  I'm not sure if this is authentic, but it was very good.  The only drawback is that the waitress seems to be hurrying us quite along.  But it was a busy night, so we'll give her the benefits of the doubt.  Parking is pretty easy as well for street parking.
