This place has very little going for it.  They are unfriendly, they come off as pretentious and they have horrible service.  Fortunately my group was food hopping and wasn't relying on this place for dinner otherwise we would have starved.  I ordered Coffee, they do serve Intelligentsia which was cool but they really couldn't even get that right, my coffee had grounds it.  Hey Bottega Louie get with the times and start using a Chemex.. . Our group of 10 ordered and only one food order actually showed up after 40+ minutes.  There were also several drink orders which never showed up.  We eventually canceled the order and left after paying the biggest bill of the day.. . Bottega Louie, you can wear all the suits and put your tap water in bottles if you want it doesn't make up for sucking big time.  Get back to basics of taking care of customer service.. . I would avoid this place.
