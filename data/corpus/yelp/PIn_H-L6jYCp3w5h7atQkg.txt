I came here with two buddies around 7:30 p.m. on a Monday with high expectations of what has been called the "best" burger in L.A.  The ambiance seemed to have a "Houstons," dark wood, dimly lit, modern vibe.  We ordered 3 office burgers, prosciutto salad, smoked eel, sweet potato fries, and 3 beers.  The only knock on this place is the amount of time we waited to place our order before finding a seat.  It wasn't terribly busy at that point, but the bartender managed to avoid us for far too long.  Burger was delicious--thick slab of juicy ground beef, arugula, caramelized onions, gruyere, and what tasted like a slightly tangy sweet reduction sauce sandwiched in a toasted french roll.  I'm not sure if it is the best burger in L.A., but I haven't yet had a "gourmet" burger that tops this.  The tempura battered sweet potato fries were addictive and had a delicious tension between saltiness and that slight sweetness of sweet potatoes.  In fact, we had to order a second basket.  The smoked eel reminded me of the taste of "hot smoked" salmon, but was more tender.  My friend said it tasted like a hot dog.  The prosciutto salad was just okay.  We had to order the cheese plate and a second basket of sweet potato fries to fend off the vultures that were creeping up to our table hoping that we were about to leave.  Definitely would return.
