I happened to be in LA on a Cal game day.  Normally I would be at the game...but seeing as I have Maid of Honor duties (dress shopping, venue scouting &amp; sobbing bride-to-be consoling) I had to find a place in Pasadena to watch my Cal Bear Football. . . An Unofficial Cal Alumni group had taken over the upstairs area. The waitress was fun, attentive and helpful. The cocktails were hilariously named and pretty tasty, too. They had a broken blender so the girly girl in the group couldn't oder her daiquiri.  . . Still...it was fun and easy.  . . Two super big gross star deductions though...their bathroom smelled like a dead wet dog. Nasty.
