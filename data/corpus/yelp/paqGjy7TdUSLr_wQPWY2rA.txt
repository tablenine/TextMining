Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Why? What?! I don't get it. . . Tough casings, flavorless dogs, flavorless chili, and a seriously long wait... Why are people into Pink's? I have to admit that the aroma while waiting in line is awesome, it really got my hopes up, but then came the dogs. They just don't come anywhere close to living up to the reputation. My friend Chris and I felt very sick after eating there to boot. That place is seriously nasty.. . I honestly feel that a 7-11 big bite is WAY better.
