I had a good experience here, not great, good.. . The Pros: The food is good. It's a decent standard burger done up in a variety of ways. The meat is good, the bun was fresh and perfect for the burger, and the fries were ok. The server was great. He was friendly, talked us up plenty even though it was packed, and was back checking on us multiple times. The drink list is long and the drinks strong, so another plus for that. . . The Cons: The price was far and away the biggest downside for me. We had 2 burgers and 2 drinks and it was $40. This seems a little high for what is essentially a bar with pretty good burgers. The burgers themselves are good, but I got a tiny pile of warm fries, compounding my issue with the price. It is a crowded, cramped room when it gets busy, so be prepared for that or go early. Also, while it *is* a hamburger joint, I kind of felt they could have moved beyond the standard Bleu Cheese Burger and Bacon Cheddar burger. there are a couple of inventive ideas on the menu, but for the most part there is nothing to draw me back...nothing I couldn't get elsewhere, cheaper.
