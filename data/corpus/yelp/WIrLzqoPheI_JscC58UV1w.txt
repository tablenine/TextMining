3.5 stars.  I've been here several times but never felt the need to Yelp about it until after trying their relatively new brunch offerings this past Sunday.  I have to start with the drinks because they were fab...such a great variety to choose from, not just your typical bloody mary or mimosa.  Their mimosas are made w/their famous Hub punch (which i LOVE), so i knew it was gonna be fab, and it was indeed the best mimosa i've ever had!  Friends had the absolut bloody mary (they said it was really spicy and strong, in a good way), and the bloody mary w/sake.  We were all pleased w/our bevs.. . I had the truffle egg sammie w/brie which was HUGE and really yummy, but it was just not that exciting...like it desperately needed some bacon or some sort of meat to enhance the flavor.  Came with hashbrowns, which looked and tasted like they were the burnt part of the bottom of the pan, and it was only like 4-5 bites.  Hardly a side...that was disappointing.  Friends had the short rib benedict (looked AMAZING, i will get this next time - he loved it), breakfast tacos (also looked great) and fish tacos (know this is a good choice).  Overall, i seemed to have chosen the worst/boring meal, so i wouldn't mind giving Hub another chance at brunch although i won't be going back anytime soon.. . This is one of my fave happy hour spots, and that's prob where i will keep Hub in my repetoire.  Their nachos are the best thing on the menu, the sushi happy hour is fantastic, the Hub punch a favorite, the carrot cake to DIE FOR (and i dont even care for carrot cake really, its all the yummy cream they serve it with) and the atmosphere and service are always top notch.. . Recommendation:  Go for happy hour and/or dinner, pass on brunch...there are SO many other great brunch spots in Chicago.
