Restaurant: Fritti
Category: Italian
The food deserved four stars but because service is a huge part of the dining experience, Fritti gets only three. Our waitress was awful. The calamari definitely needed salt(what's up with everyone forgetting the salt on fried calamari?) but it was cooked perfectly. The dipping sauce actually took away from the squid because it lacked flavor. I ordered the speck e rucola pizza(add olives, artichokes) and it was awesome. $4 double bloody marys+good pizza=a very happy girl.
