First review. Signed up because I had to rate this place. Went there today (Thursday) with a friend for lunch. Normal menu prices are a little above average, but that's to be expected for BBQ. However, they have at least one great special daily and today was half price burgers so my meal (burger/side/pop) was $7 + tip. . To the point though.. . Good Food. Good Vibe. Best Mac N Cheese I've ever had
