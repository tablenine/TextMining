Worst Indian food EVER!!! I'm huge on Indian food and this place is absolutely terrible!!!! A group of friends and I went here the other night only because it was close to everyone. Here's what my boyfriend and I ordered. . . Lamb vindaloo: Lack of spice and flavor! It tasted like they poured marinara sauce over the lamb. Had no flavor!!! Â . . Veggie Korma: Again...lacked flavor! It tasted like nothing really. . . Veggie samosas: Probably the only good thing on the menu. They were crispy and not greasy. The mint sauce and mango chutney were tasty as well. . . Mulagatani soup: Props for even having it on the menu but still not great. Soup was too thin. Should have been slightly creamy.. . All in all... DON'T go unless you enjoy flavorless food. If for some reason I do go back I'll make sure to just order the samosas.
