Category: Wine Bars
Hello, Bluebird of hapiness! Met a few high school friends here for drinks and catching up. The wine and beer lists are extensive, and sitting in the back room was great. There's a fireplace, exposed brick, lowlit candles. It's a perfect spot for a date. . . I was wary about the service here, since I had heard bad things from more than one source. Our server was casual, but took great care of us. I actually commend our server because I would've probably let our service lapse! When we were guffawing and listening to old war stories he didn't interrupt, but circled back in a few minutes. Stupendous!. . Bluebird's menu looks okay for late night noshing to go with your drinks. I had a great first experience and will be back for more.
