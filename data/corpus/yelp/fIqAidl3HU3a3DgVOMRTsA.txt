I have been looking to go here and see what the excitement was about. Plus I love sushi. Located in a strip mall in the Honda plaza. My first suggestion would be to try to come early. The parking lot gets full. I was fortunate enough to find a spot in the side of the mall. This was during lunch time. Place was packed. Well a little overflowing. I have no clue how long the wait was since I met my wife and friend and they were already sitting down. Browsed the menu and looked around on the other tables. I noticed 80% were ordering the sashimi platter. Also noticed that each person is required to order $10 minimum. Most of their stuff is traditional sushi. So you fancy rolls and the eek it's not cooked folks may no find this place to your liking. So me and the wife decided on one sashimi platter and one teriyaki salmon/sashimi combo to share. The food came and we enjoyed every piece and every slice. The teriyaki salmon was cooked just right. The sashimi melts in your mouth and is so fresh. I was surprised because between the sashimi, teriyaki, soup, and rice. I was full and satisfied. I have finally found a gem in Downtown. If your looking for real sushi this is your stop. I will be back over and over again.....
