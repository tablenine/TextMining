I'm kind of shocked to see a lot of people not liking this place.  I really dig their pad thai. Honestly, I think it's the best I've ever had in the city. Try to prove me wrong people!. . I am absolutely obsessed with their Shrimp Noodle Soup, though. The tomato broth with cilantro and bean sprouts with the thin noodles and obviously big pieces of shrimp are heavenly to me.  I usually come in and order it to go but if I do eat in, I haven't had any problems with service.  . . The last time I was there, though, this lady at the table next to me gave me the pleasure of watching her change her daughter's diaper.  Why she didn't use the bathroom, I don't know.
