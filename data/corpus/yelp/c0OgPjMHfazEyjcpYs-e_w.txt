Went back here on a big football night on a Saturday.  Yeah, it was PACKED.  We could only take about four steps in before hitting a wall of people.  It was obvious that we would probably never get any prompt service so abruptly left.  My opinion of the place doesn't change, but I'll be sure not to come here on big game nights.
