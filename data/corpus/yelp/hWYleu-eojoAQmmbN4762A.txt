This place is great!!  Good for a date night or even a night out with your family when they are in town!  The wait can get to be long if you go on a weekend night b/c they don't take reservations, but it's worth it!!  The restaurant is in an old house, and it's very warm and inviting:)  Every meal I have ever had here has been delish and they always have great nightly specials too!!  If anything save room for the strawberries and caramel......to die for!!!!!  Service is great too!!
