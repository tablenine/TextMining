Restaurant: Duck Walk
Category: Thai
Chicken Pad Thai is my gauge to any Thai restaurant, and Duck Walk easily passes the test.  It doesn't stop there though.  Having been to Duck Walk numerous times and done take out just as many, I can't say I've ever had a bad experience or a bad meal.  The staff is always friendly and the food comes out surprisingly quick even on a packed night.  And I guess that brings me to the only negative:  most nights it will be packed and it is tiny.  That said, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table to open up.
