Restaurant: Cameli&#39;s Gourmet Pizza Joint
Category: Pizza
These toppings ARE very "gourmet" the fresh spinach leaves, and basil and all that other bull sh-- on a pizza thats paper thin can be a bit frustrating.. . But it was good, and you got the feeling that it was pretty healthy too. Â This place is right off of ponce near the big azz Kroger.. . It seems like it has a lot of "social events' that go on throughout the week, so I wouldnt be surprised if there is a band that comes through, or they do karaoke.. . Pizza is good....decently priced...and healthy as crap.. . Id go back for sure.
