Who knew such a world-class noodle shop was nestled in a tiny strip mall in Logan square?   I was already prepared for the communal seating which I thought would be a little awkward but turned out to be very cool and created an exciting sense of community-- if you will-- with the other diners. What threw me off however, was having to order at the counter--you don't typically expect to order anything other than standard fare for a particular type of cuisine. Well when I saw the menu I knew this place was anything but standard... and the price was right too.. . Biting into he lamb and brandy dumplings and the short rib and scallion rice can only be described as  a fireworks display for the palate. Soooo good! I would have never thought those flavor combinations would be so yummy. We also had the Udon and the wrinkle beans which were also good. Since its BYOB we brought a nice bottle of wine and proceeded to get our lunch-time tipsy on...I'll be back!
