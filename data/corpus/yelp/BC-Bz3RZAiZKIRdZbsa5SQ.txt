Restaurant: Andie&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Caterers
I was taken here for my birthday by a friend. . . I believe the waiter was drinking all of the coffee that the empty seats were supposed to be drinking... hyper doesn't begin to describe him... hyper with attitude does.. . We originally were just going to do drinks and an hors d'ouvre or two. The waiter was hyper to get us moving and get entrees... . . The two of us and a party of 7 with 4 kids were they only ones in the restaurant.... and naturally they had to seat us beside each other. C'mon... really? You really thought that was a good idea?. . I ordered the basil chicken. I'm not sure how you make chicken dry... but they manage... and shouldn't basil chicken taste like at least one of the words in it's name? It didn't. Although it did taste better the next day... . . I'd have to recommend skipping this place.
