Yes! I love this place. They have a great cold ramen which is perfect in the summer. The noodles are so delicious and fresh with the right amount of salt. Note to vegetarians - the menu is very limited. In fact, the cold ramen is your only choice. Thankfully, it's a good one worth ordering! . . Be prepared for a very long wait. There's always a long line out the door and the average wait time is 45 minutes.
