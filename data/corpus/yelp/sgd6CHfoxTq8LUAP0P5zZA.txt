Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
This is like a smaller LA version of NY's Dean and Delucas!. . The staff is always really nice and they have everything! Of course everything is really expensive because it's gourmet stuff. . . I used to pick up lunch here for my work all the time from this place. The food is always so good and fresh. The mozzarella sandwich on French Bread is really fresh. I love the milanese chicken sandwich! They have good asparagus, and great green pea soup. I could go on and on about the food.. . They also have wonderful holiday menus for two so that you can just pick up and have a romantic evening with your significant other!. . Make note, that it's not really a restaurant. It's more like a gourmet market with a seating area in the middle.
