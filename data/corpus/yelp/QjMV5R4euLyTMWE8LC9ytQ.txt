So. Awesome.  It was empty when E and I went this weekend which probably lead to us having a great experience.  Al (the owner) hooked us up with a sample platter of all the sides they have, e.g. taboule, ezme, hummus, goat cheese, &amp;c.  All were fantastic.  I attempted to order a chicken gyro to which he responded, "What, you don't like beef &amp; lamb? You get chicken next time."  This proved sound advice as it was the best gyro I've had in town so far.  After our meal he brought us a couple bites of baclava (absolutely the best).  . .   I highly recommend you check it out.  Al's philosophy seems to be that you should open yourself up and try new food.  An excellent place to go for a tete-a-tete, to hear a story, and get some great mediterranean food.
