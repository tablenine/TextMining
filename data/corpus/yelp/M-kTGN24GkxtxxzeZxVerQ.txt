Restaurant: Cho Sun Ok Restaurant
Category: Korean
Well first of all, I am Korean.. so my viewpoint might be somewhat biased, but I pick Chosun Ok as one of the best Korean restaurant in US as long as couple of places in LA and SF. . . While living in Michigan in past years, it has been always my first destination whenever I have any chance to go to Chicago. (4-5 Hours of driving is a quick run when you think you can reach this restaurant). . This restaurant is not much a friendly place if you eat in single, but if you are with couple of buddies who loves beef (especially Chadol- the thinest beef cut), this is definite a pig out place to check for.. . Thinking of Chadol and fried rice with stone fan with cold noodle (you can ask the split.. order one dish and ask for spilit in serving) is always making my mouth full of water
