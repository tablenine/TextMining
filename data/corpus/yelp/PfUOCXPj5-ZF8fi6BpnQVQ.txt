Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
From Variety, Aug. 12th, 1991: "The special effects wizards behind Roger Rabbit have completed their second project, Papa Cristos C &amp; K Importing, using advanced holographic projection technology to bring Roger Rabbit-like characters into the real world. Guests will enjoy an animated Papa Cristos, who to this author's trained eye is most certainly a cartoon and not actually a real person of Greek descent, take orders and serve piping hot gyros with a side of charm. The character of Papa, voiced by Robin Williams, takes center stage to a supporting cast of generous portions, quality food, amazing bread, and a wide breadth of offerings in the attached grocery and deli counter."
