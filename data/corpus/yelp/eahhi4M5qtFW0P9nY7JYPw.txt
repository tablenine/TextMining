Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I consider this the best ramen in San Gabriel Valley. Â The service was... entertaining... to say the least. Plenty of Japanese greetings and phrases. I was a bit disappointed though when my "gochisousama deshita" was promptly ignored as I was leaving. . . Nevertheless, the food was good. I enjoyed the option to add extra noodles to the bowl for less than a dollar. I ended up spending about $8 on my bowl and was completely satisfied.. . The most interesting part of the experience though was the slew of choices the waitress offered to determine exactly how the noodles and broth should be cooked. I imagine these choices could be very confusing to the average customer, but to an experienced ramen addict, they are welcome. . . Anyway, this is going to be my default ramen place from now on. Give it a try!
