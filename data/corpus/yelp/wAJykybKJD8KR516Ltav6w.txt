A great place for a warm, delicious meal!. . We came here for dinner on a Saturday evening. We had the soup of the day (creamy tomato with marscapone and basil), caprese salad, ravioli, pollo con crostini, tiramisu and a latte.. . All of the food was just amazing! Such a unique combination of flavors and beautiful food. The chicken (pollo con crostini) was cooked absolutely to perfection. The caprese salad was incredibly fresh - the tomatoes were so full of flavor. . . A minor complaint that the service is slow. Even when they are not busy, people here take their time. Also, my husband ordered a Coca-cola, but our server came back and informed us that they were "out of it". How does a restaurant run out of Coca-cola?
