Restaurant: Heaven On Seven
Category: Southern
I hired Heaven On Seven Events to cater my wedding. Not only was the food and service outstanding, the restaurant dining is fantastic as well. My guests are still talking about how good the food was and what a unique experience the party was. The event planner, Cleetus, is highly knowledgeable and creative and helped me through everything from a dress to flowers. HIghly recommended, listen to Cleetus' suggestions-you will not be disappointed!
