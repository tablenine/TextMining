Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
My favorite prime rib spot. No one has been able to top them. Also, when in season, they have the LARGEST chocolate covered strawberries I have ever had in my life. The wait can be long at times (especially holidays) but I suggest calling in and putting your name down right before you leave for the restaurant.
