Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
You always know what to expect when going to Philippes. Long lines, but relatively quick service, pretty good sandwiches, yummy spicy mustard, passable coleslaw and potato salad. If you're into french dip, it's definitely a good place to try out. They only take cash, so be sure to bring about 10 bucks per person.
