Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
meh, this place is overrated. i mean the hot dog was good, but not good enough to wait an hour and a half for it. i ordered the spicy polish dog. i think it was the best one out of all the hot dogs my friends got.. . it's so easy to make your own pink's hot dogs. just go to costco, buy a polish dog for $1.50, and put your own toppings on it. . . i definitely didnt see what all the rave is about.. . also, the carts outside the clubs with the bacon wrapped hot dogs are DEFINITELY MUCH better than pink's.
