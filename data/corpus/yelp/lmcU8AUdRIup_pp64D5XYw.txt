I'm dropping my rating for Spring because it's been a while and still I haven't seen an improvement.  I'm amazed how a restaurant could possibly attempt to go through the motions of trying and just not hit the mark with the menu.  . . The service 1 star. The atmostphere 1 star. . The star for the dinner was the coconut curry soup. It was delightful, but honestly, coconut curry soup, that to me, doesn't scream epicurean. The main course, tuna was seared - not to perfection - and saltier than a salt lick.  I drank at least a gallon of water the following day, as I was dehydrated. And finally the dessert.  A lovely presentation of butterscotch creme (served warm, how interesting) with waffle slivers and a miso syrup.  The butterscotch creme, was my favorite, yet not.  . . I'll pass.  Please please please, I beg you Spring, prove me wrong.  So many have loved your restaurant and somehow, i can't seem to love you.  Maybe we're just not meant to be.
