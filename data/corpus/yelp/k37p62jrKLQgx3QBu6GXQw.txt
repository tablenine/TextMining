Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
After hearing all the hype, I was definitely underwhelmed by my experience here.  I seriously can't believe everyone stands in line for these tacos!  The tacos are total crap.  An over glorified, overpriced taco bell taco.  The shell was stale and it was filled with unimpressive ground beef and lettuce.  Cheese was 50 cents extra and the salsa was bland.  The chips, like the taco shells, were stale.  . . I don't know about the rest of the menu as I only tried the taco, but with their signature item being a major fail, I doubt it bodes well for the rest of the menu.  With the abundance of great Mexican food in the area, I definitely won't be back for more disappointment.
