Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
A Los Angeles landmark and birthplace of the French dipped sandwich, Philippe's is a great restaurant for a very reasonable price. The sandwiches are consistently good, and the lemon meringue pie is probably the best in LA, tons of meringue. They serve fresh-squeezed lemonade too. The mustard is also famous - a little bit goes a long way. Pre-war decor, including old telephone booths and 1930s-style staff uniforms. Casual dining, sawdust on the floor. Staff is friendly, though the place is always busy (crowded, actually) and the lines can be a little long. Great for dates, groups and kids.
