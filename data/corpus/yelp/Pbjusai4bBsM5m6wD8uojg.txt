i'll keep it simple.. . mojitos and sangrias were YUM. nice place for a drink or happy hour!. . food was oooookay. didn't love it or hate. our party for the 4 course menu meal which was $35 a person ( definitely NOT worth it). . . but all in all, i had a pretty good time here but i think it's cause of the alchy!
