this is my fav AYCE place!!  =)  COME HUNGRY!!!  =D. . yum yum yum!!  love the meat quality, sauces, banchan.  . my fav is the steamed egg.  you can get as many as you want!! . . service is okay.  great for groups.  it's casual.  you will smell like korean bbq when you leave. . . try to find street parking.
