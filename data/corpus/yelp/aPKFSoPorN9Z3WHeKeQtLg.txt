LOVIN' this place!  We went there last night for Girls Night and it was awesome!   Here is why . . .. . 1.  They have a little parking lot in the back which we were fortunate to land the last spot in.. . 2.  The decor and atmosphere are a lot of fun.  It is somewhat loud, but its not unbearable.  Good for groups since you can't hear conversations at other tables, but also good for dates since there's a lot going on in the restaurant so there is plenty to talk about and no awkward silence.. . 3.  Half price bottles of wine on Wednesdays.  Sweet.. . 4.  The food was delicious!  We started with the edamame and crab and asparagus lumpia which was unbelievably delicious.  For dinner I had the pork tenderloin which I loved, someone also had the zarzuela and another had the chicken.  They were all so good.  Cooked well (not dry or flavorless) and very unique.  Dessert was on point too -  we split the creme brulee and raspberry chocolate mousse.. . 5.  Live music was a lot of fun. . 6.  We had great, quick service.  Plus our waiter was really hot.  Brownie points!
