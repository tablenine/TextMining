As a Taiwanese, I gotta give this place props.  Things to get:  sausage with basil, pork chop rice, sticky rice in leaves (zhong-zhe), beef noodle soup, oyster omelet, fried turnip cake and bamboo fatty pork rice.  And finish it off with the best shaved ice this side of the Pacific.  I find myself fighting with my 3-year old daughter over the last boba and flan chunk.  And on top of the great food - the service is amazing.  Like "I can't believe I'm in a Chinese restaurant" amazing.
