Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
Very enjoyable evening, but surprised at how repetitive the magic acts were (all the main shows the evening we went were card trick based). The food was good but it took us an exceptionally long time to order, be served and pay. I appreciate not having a waiter hurry you along, but this was more like the waiter was just MIA. . . Heads up too that the interior feels more like a movie set than an actual vintage hotel. It looks very cool at first glance, but then you notice everything is fairly run down and more of a veneer than actual architectural detail.
