Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
more like 3.75 stars but i'll bump it to 4 since everything that i ate last night tasted good.. . they forgot our pad thai but we didn't mind coz we ordered too much food anyway. i tried a spoonful of their tom kha and it was pretty good. had the pad see ew, shrimp fried rice, beef panang, chicken larb, and grilled beef. like i said, everything tasted good. their menu is huge! so its good to come here in a large group so you can try several dishes. . . still doesn't beat my beloved south pacific in downey but this place is one of the better thai restaurants i've been to in this part of town.
