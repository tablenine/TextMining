The wait was about 50 minutes long (8:40pm to 9:30pm on a Thursday night) but I'm so glad we stuck around.  I have to thank my bf's brother's gf (wow, a mouthful) for taking us here.  5 stars is tough to give because no restaurant is perfect, but I have to give it to Daikokuya. Many ramen restaurants have similar tasting broth and if one is better than another, in a couple of days you can't remember exactly why.  However, Daikokuyu has the best broth I have ever tasted, by a long shot.  There is an extra element that I cannot describe, almost creamy.. egg-y.. and very delicious.  One sip and I knew right away that nothing I had had before comes close and that I will probably never enjoy SF/bay area ramen the way I used to.. . They only have two varieties of ramen: daikoku ramen and another one where the broth comes in a separate bowl.  I had the daikoku ramen (amazing tonkotsu broth).  You can also choose to get the richer broth which is even more amazing.. . The ramen comes with bamboo, a large soft boiled egg, lots of green onion, seaweed, bean sprouts, and some pork.  Each table is equipped with pickled ginger and chopped garlic.  Four spoonfuls of garlic + Daikokuya ramen = pure bliss in mouth.  Mmmmmm.  TOO GOOD.
