came here with some relatives and its pretty good. not too big, not too small (for a sushi place). . had the matsu nigiri lunch, good quality taste and fresh.. . also had the fried oyster, pretty tasty. . this is the place to go for chirashizushi, if you want excellent sashimi go to sushigen.. . woo!
