Restaurant: Miller&#39;s Pub
Category: Steakhouses
Miller's is an old-standby in the Loop that's less on the gourmet fluff and more on good, hearty fare and drinks.. . The place is dark and some might say dated, but by no means dirty.. . Our server was one of the friendliest I've had in a long time. Honestly, Miller's is another reason my I love coming to old-school Greek places. . . I was with 5 people, and everyone enjoyed their meals - blackened chicken salad, pot roast dinner, corned beef on rye, Grecian burger, even lasagna.. . Yes, there's more creative restaurant options in Chicago. However, authentic places like Miller's are slowly disappearing with trendy (and not as satisfying) restaurants or chain eateries.
