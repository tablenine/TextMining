SHORT RIB BURRITO.  I wasn't even hungry and this was delicious.  Also got the spicy pork one which was good but not as epically rich and tasty.  And the kimche really gives these things a unique piquant taste.. . They'd set up in the parking lot for the Brig on Abbot Kinney in Venice, which has some benches.  There was a decent crowd but the wait was only like 10 minutes.. . Definitely a better late night idea than Pink's.
