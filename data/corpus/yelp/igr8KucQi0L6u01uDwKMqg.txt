I tried this place while in town for work, and the food and service were really great. I sat at the counter, and I was greeted immediately. After asking me if it was my first time (it was) I was given a free sampler platter with their hummus and tabouli. I tried the Lamb Shish Kebab "Kuzu Kebab," and the flavor was rich with a lot of depth, and not greasy. After working my way through all of that with a glass of Turkish wine, they gave me a free piece of Baklava for dessert. All of the food was good, but the baklava made the place worth of review. Entire meal with a beer to wash it all down was about $22. Also, luckily for people who work in the area, they are going to start delivery.
