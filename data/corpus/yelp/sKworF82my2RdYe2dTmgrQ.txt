Category: American (New)
a good solid place for a relaxing time.  hub51 is a casual place where the food is good and the atmosphere is a good-old-fashioned sports bar feel - but clean.. . the food - after ordering half of the left and ride side of the menu, i would say most of its dishes are decent.  the spicy tuna &amp; crab roll was great (ask for a side of spicy mayo). followed by less-than-authentic mediocre guacamole, but a good start to a meal.  Then came the seafood salad with jumbo shrimp and fresh crab meat - this was great, light dressing and very healthy. portion size would be perfect as a meal or as a 2-person appetizer salad. next was the steak tacos = Please PASS. this was just awful, i think they should lay off the mexican foods.  this was all followed by the Chillean Sea Bass, Pork Shoulder, and Short Ribs.  Out of the three, the Sea Bass &amp; Short Ribs are the front runners.  The Pork Shoulder - well, it's not worth the money.. . the attire - nice jeans and a polo/nice shirt are appropriate. parking is difficult to come by so the $12 valet or cab ride would be appropropriate.  . . Located across the street from NV lounge, it's locale is a great place to start a Friday/Saturday night. it is within walking distance of other nightime festivities.. . pricing - the dishes are well-priced, but the sea-food and dinner entrees are within the 20-30 price range.
