Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pinks is a place that you would go more to be seen rather than to actually enjoy a hot dog. Speaking of which, who really enjoys a hot dog?. . The amusement park like lines and the sub-par hot dogs are just not for me I guess. Really the only times I'd stop by Pinks was after my late night Hollywood run. Just something you have to do if your in the area I guess. If you really want a good hot dog, just go to Costco and buy some of those spicy sausages. Now your in flavor country!!!
