Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
It's always nice to be part of the Magic Castle especially in the presence of your best friends.. . We had a wonderful evening together and enjoyed the new magic shows, and see new talents as well. The evening was amazing and the food at the bar was real pleasant, well served and great service and attitude from the people behind the counter.. . Will be going back again soon.
