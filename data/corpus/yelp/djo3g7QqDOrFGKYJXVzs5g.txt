I'm sad that no one else likes this place. Now granted it's greasy hole in the wall, but thats the charming part of it. Their texas margaritas are fantastic! No it's not fresh sour mix and no they don't use kosher salt. This is a CHEAP place to eat for crying out loud! What do you expect?! The vegetarian fajitas were great. I love their runny beans :) Maybe it's just personal preference. Plus my hubby got the super combo and for 12 bucks I think that is the most amount of food I have ever seen! Give it another chance! and try the Texas Margs! Oh and you can pretty much expect to inhale exhaust on any patio in this city.
