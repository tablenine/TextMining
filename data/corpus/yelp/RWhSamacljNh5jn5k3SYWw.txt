My favorite sushi place in Chicago.  I don't like rolls so I can't comment on their rolls however their nigiri sushi is definitely one of the best in town.  The shiromi and tuna selection of Mirai is definitely worth it's price.  Usually I sit by the bar and have Kano san (sushi chef) do a omakase sushi/sashimi menu.  The first time when I ordered uni it took me back to the first time I had uni at the Tsukiji market 12 years ago.  On top of that its mirugai and engawa are delicious!!! If you don't know what those are definitely try it if you are an adventurous sushi eater.  When the season is right also get the Aji sashimi, where the chef will carve out the fish and present it like kaiseki ryori.  . . Sunday has 50% off sake.  Do make reservation especially for weekend, and the lounge upstairs is also a cool scene but a bit too hip for me.  I have eaten at Sushi Yasuda and Jewel Bako in NYC this is definitely better.  The sushi at Mirai is definitely on par with Morimoto in Philadelphia.
