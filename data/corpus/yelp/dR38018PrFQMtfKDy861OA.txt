In a nutshell, Rare makes a mean burger!. . Although I don't consider myself a meat lover, I do sometimes have to satisfy my love jones for a juicy, tasty hamburger -- and Rare has never disappointed. Â Here it's all about the burger -- yes, the bun can be on the small side, the beer battered onion rings extra greasy or the fries can sometimes turn out limp -- but the burger alone gets four stars!. . If a bacon burger is your thing, opt for the crispy bacon rather than the double-smoked thick cut (save that for a steak house experience) - there's something magical about biting into crisp, charred bacon along with the thick, juicy, flavor of prime ground beef..... .
