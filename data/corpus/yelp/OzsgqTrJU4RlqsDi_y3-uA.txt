just having watched the movie ramen girl with brittany murphy, and the japanese movie tampopo (about ramen making) within the last month, i had a bigger appreciation for the art of ramen. so i decided for the second time to go back to daikokuya, and the second time i was wowed. it's hands-down the best tasting ramen, with the best noodles, and the best tasting broth i've experienced in a while. plus, you can't overlook the authenticity of it all, with the cooks and waiters being all japanese.  while sitting at the bar, it felt and smelt like a different country. . .  i waited for a whole hour, on a sunday afternoon. while time was ticking away, i saw many a patron leaving with wide smiles..and i knew i was in for greatness.  and i was! . . if you don't know what to get, you can't go wrong with the daikokyu ramen and the fried rice (which has ramen broth in it). both were so scrumptious, i'm sitting here wiping away the drool as i write. (btw, i have tried other ramen places including shin sen gumi, and i find this place a lot better by far)
