When reading this, bear in mind that this is the only place I've eaten in Chicago.  The entree was good, but not impressive, but the dessert did impress me.  We had a chocolate birthday cake and spumoni.   Service was excellent and friendly.  They were very helpful in getting us to our show at Ford's Theatre on time.
