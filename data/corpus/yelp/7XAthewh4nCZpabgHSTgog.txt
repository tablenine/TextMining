Restaurant: One Midtown Kitchen
Category: American (New)
This is by FAR my favorite Restaurant in Atlanta. Actually, I enjoy all of the restaurants in this family of eateries (Concentric restaurant Group is the name i think)... I visited most recently 2 weeks ago. I always start with the calamari and ginger ale. The Calamari is a tad thick, but the sauce is divine!. The pizzas are superb. The lamb is Scrumptious as is the steak. The macaroni with truffles is a tad strong for my taste, but my mom loved it! And of course the BEAUTY of the experience was the $25 coupon (yes! a coupon for $25 to ONE... can you believe it?:-) that was attached to the parking ticket from TWO Urban Licks the prior week when I dined there... And THAT is why I love this family of restaurants!!! plus the ambiance and food are just deLISH!!!
