Now this is a tasty burger. The Royal with Cheese is spectacular! (Zed's dead baby, Zed's dead.) It comes with pastrami, bacon, and chili. There is not too much pastrami or chili, it's perfect. Chili in every bite but not dripping on my hand. Everything I have tried is delicious. They cook your burgers to your specification and nail it every time. The pastrami is very good with the gruyere cheese. The ruben holds with the best of them and has just the right amount of seasoning and salt. I am a big fan of the steak fry but the twice (thrice) cooked fries are crunchy little sticks of goodness. Garlic aioli is yummy to dip fries in or use on sandwiches. They also have plantains just in case you don't want to go the full sugar route with dynamite cupcakes and baked goodies. They make Oinksterade which is kinda like lemonade but it is a sweet and sour tangy treat. If that doesn't have enough kick for you they have BEER on tap and bottled. . . The price is right for the food as it is above most in flavor and quality. Staff is awesome and they bring your food to your table (inside or out). . . I am not a huge fan of homemade ketchup and my only complaint is they don't have Heinz. Good beer and great food make this a win-win.
