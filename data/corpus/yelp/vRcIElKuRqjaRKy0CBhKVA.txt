Trust me, this place may not offer the glamour from the interior, it may lack some curb appeal but I consider it a Hollywood historical diner. I get good vibes from this place and it has left a mark in my late night dinings. In addition to great service, great memories i've shared with friends and delicious classic Jewish cuisine, the pastries are a must have to take home. It is located in Fairfax just a few blocks from ethiopian town.. definitely attracts diverse crowd. And, I have seen Adrien Garner here. And no i won't pick up the name I just dropped. ;-)
