I was very excited to dine here based on the rave reviews......however, it did not meet my expectations. Service was not only slow, but painfully slow!. I tried a wide array of sushi, but none of it was killing me. In fact, Â I thought it was quite average. I will say that the green tea ice cream was delicious, but there is no way I would sit through a 3 hour mediocre dinner again just to have a great dessert. For my money, I'll head back over to Sushi Avenue. I wish I could give this place two and a half stars.
