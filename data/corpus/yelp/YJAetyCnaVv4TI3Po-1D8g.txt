Have to agree with Eric T. on this one!  I, too, stopped in to pick up some deserts to take to a small dinner some friends of mine were having in B Hill's the other evening.. This place is so confusing to me as to "what" it is...???. After spending a substantial amount of money on tasteless deserts I was less than impressed.  I spent the entire evening apologizing to my hosts.... Need I say more?
