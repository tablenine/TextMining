update, gave this place a second try on a late friday night. and much better than the first time which was a hot hot hot sunny summer day in LA like 90s+ and we sat inside right by the stove part facing the door which was even hotter. hot like fire . . anyway, this time, none of that. had the ramen again and also the gyoza, it was pretty aight. esp since i think i hadnt tried shinsengumi until after eating at daikokuya. opposites. shinsengumi sucks daikokuya is somewhere in the middle and at the top is yet to be discovered!. . there were approx 10 groups of 2 ahead of us and so we walked around for about 45 minutes and were promptly seated.
