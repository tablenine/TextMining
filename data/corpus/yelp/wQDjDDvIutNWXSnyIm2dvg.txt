Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Yeah, Johnnie's is a diamond in the rough that I only wish I had known about sooner. Damn place has been sitting there longer than I've been around, and that's saying something. The pastrami dip sandwich is the thing. Get it on the roll with or without Swiss cheese and some hot mustard on the side. You can't lose. Weight that is! As others have observed, it's not the best pastrami, certainly not up to Langer's quality, but it's tender and plentiful. Good fries too. A bit on the pricey side for what it is, but when you're sitting outside by the fireplace at 2am, Johnnie's is a unique L.A. experience that can't be beat.
