First off this is not standard Mexican food, it is Tex-Mex in my book. Any time you see yellow cheese and flour but no corn tortillas you just might be at a Tex-Mex joint. Having said that, I have nothing against Tex-Mex and they have some good dishes. Get something with the beef, it is really outstanding, just as previous reviews have mentioned. Chips are weak, literally, very thin and not suitable for holding a lot of salsa, which by the way is just okay.. . One accidental discovery we made was a drink whose name I can't remember, but basically it was frozen margarita mixed with Mexican beer (either corona or tecate). Sounds weird on paper, but it's great!
