Restaurant: Little Bangkok
Category: Chinese
I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant.  Thai food is one of my favorite cuisines, and this is my favorite Thai place (and I'm a three-city girl right now, so I've been to a bunch.)  The service is friendly and *very* speedy, and the food is to die for and worth way more than they charge.  . . In my first review, I would like to make a confession: I am one cheap biyatch.  I mean it; sometimes it scares me how much I hate to spend money.  Blame it on nature or nurture, but you will hear from me repeatedly how much I love a good deal.  And I often feel when I leave this place that I've somehow just ripped them off.. . My boyfriend and I can finish a hot pot of Tom Ka soup between the two of us plus our entrees, and it's the best I've ever had.  I crave it.  Constantly.  I've also tried both their Chinese and Thai food and I have not been disappointed with anything.  . . You've GOT to try: Fancy fried rice, Mandarin chicken, Lard Nar, Pad Thai, Tom Ka, Nam Sod, cheese rolls... I need to stop this now; I'm getting hungry.  . . Little Bangkok is sneaky.  If you're driving down Cheshire Bridge you'll probably look right past it.  You would never suspect that this strip-mall restaurant with such cheesy decor would be so wonderful.  . . Tip:  They have a plethora of lunch combo specials.  It's a huge amount of food for under $6.  . . Also, the parking lot is indeed tiny and hard to back out of.  Do not let this stop you.  It's worth it.
