Restaurant: La Crêperie
Category: French
I went here a while back and was pretty disappointed.. I really wanted to like the place and it has all the features of a fantastic little restaurant: comfortable atmosphere, great neighborhood feel, reasonably priced french food and wine, good service.  Unfortunately, on both occasions I have been here, I was served what are probably the worst crepes I've ever eaten.. . I'm a sucker for savory crepes (not the sweet ones).  Here, they were just bland and loaded with entirely too much cheese.  It was so bad I had to return it.  The waiter was really cool about it, but the next crepe was no better and now consisted of nothing but mushrooms inside the crepe.. . I may go back because I like the restaurant, but I will not try another crepe here unless they start doing something very differently.
