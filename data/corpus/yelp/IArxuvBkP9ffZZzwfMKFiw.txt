Recently my husband and I have been coming to Devon every Sunday night.  Our young adults group over at Holy Name Cathedral meet over at the bar area every Sunday night.   The staff has been really great and they always rope off an area for us and even give us all separate bills.  . . The happy hour menu offers cheap and delicious appetizers, such as the tuna tartare, focaccia cheddar burger, and goat cheese bruschetta- only $6.50 each.  There are great drink deals too.  . . I've had brunch here too and the brunch options are great.  Moderately priced and very generous portions. I loved the biscuits that they serve.  . . Devon also offers tons of discounts ($10 off your next bill, etc).  So all in all Devon is a great place for lunch, dinner, or happy hour.  It's not too expensive and the service is great.
