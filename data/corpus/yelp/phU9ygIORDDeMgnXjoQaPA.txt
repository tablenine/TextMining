Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Lawry's is pretty much like house of prime rib in SF.  Except I can't remember if HOPR had that yorkshire pudding thing.  They do however have the same amazing salad with their own house dressing.  The creamiest cream of spinach and of course the Prime Rib was freaking bomb!
