Super cute place with nicely painted lime green fencing on the outside. It looks like it used to be a house converted into a restaurant. I love the cozy. very LA feel of this place. My friends and I had brunch here on a very nice sunny day which had a cool breeze, perfect for sitting outside. . . Our waitress and other staff memebers were very nice and attentive. Always had a smile on their faces and came up to us several times just to see if we needed anything even when the place got packed. Some other restaurants just get your order, serve your food and give you your check. Any other time they pull a disappearing act. . . I had the chicken sausage with tomato and cheese omlet. Very well done! The eggs were not too oily and it was light and fluffy. It wasn't heavy at all like omelets at Denny's or IHOP are. . . I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a nice quiet brunch/breakfast in LA. You can even go by yourself and read a book outside while sipping a cool tall glass of lemonade. ;P
