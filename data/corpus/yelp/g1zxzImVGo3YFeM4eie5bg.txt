Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
One of my friends invited me here and I decided to go just to find out what all the hype was about. I mean the burger was even shown on "The Best Food I Ever Ate" on food network.. so I mean, it's gotta be THE BEST.... right?. . For one thing, I definitely didn't expect the ENTIRE establishment to be more of a BAR than a RESTAURANT. They totally juked me there, esp. since I'm not much of a Bar kind of person. I prefer coffee places, esp. since 90% of the time you're yelling at the person that's sitting next to you, just trying to hold a conversation, of which another 3rd of the conversation is consisting of blank looks and "WHAT? CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN??". . Anyways, back to FO's burger... THE reason I went.. besides the friends of course... . . When I first saw the burger, I was a bit confused. My first thoughts included: "Why's this so small?" and "Why does it look like Banh Mi?" I thought they had made a mistake on my order. But apparently not.. since all the burgers come the same way... . So I took my first a many bites as I sat, ate,  and yelled over people to communicate to the girl that was across from me... Hand signals worked better.. . . My end conclusion.. The burger is good, but I don't think $15 good.  . the onion-molasses-spread is what really distinguishes itself from any other burger and deems it the "Office Burger.". . I'm not a fan of bleu cheese, esp. because it gives you a weird cheese breath afterward. Not cool, Not cool.. . Overall, if you're a fan of the bar scene, go for it.. go to Father's Office and drink up the many varieties of beer! But if you're just there for some food .. don't go there for food. It's not a foodie environment.. its a BAR. . . I can now at least be able to say I've had the burger and it's OK.
