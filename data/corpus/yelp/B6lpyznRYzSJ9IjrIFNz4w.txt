I absolutely LOVE this place. I have been going here for almost 20 years and i have NEVER had a bad experience nor have i had any bad food. . My mom loves this place and i have taken many a friend and girlfriend here and every single one has LOVED it as much as me.. The waiters and waitresses are all top notch as far as service and friendliness. The owner Gus and his son Jim are both great guys and great fun to chat with. I collect Vinyl records and love to chat with Gus about a recent purchase i made down the block at Reckless Records and his son Jim is just as fun to chat with and honestly looks JUST like his father except minus the facial hair lol. . IN the end i can NOT recomend this place any higher. it is a MUST for anyone living on the north side.
