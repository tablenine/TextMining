Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Delicious ramen, but the cramped and stuffy environment plus hit-and-miss parking earns Daikokuya no more than four stars with me.. . My first impression of the place was its dinky size. The restaurant is relatively small, and seating is rather limited, probably no more than 35 customers. This is made worse by the open kitchen, which makes the place a bit stuffy. Of course, most ramen places, especially in Little Tokyo, don't have spectacular interiors, so I didn't have much expectations for Daikokuya on this end. . . Now as for the food, I had the Daikoku Ramen. THE BROTH IS AMAZING! Best ramen soup I've ever had. The noodles were average, but still tasty, though it did somewhat remind me of instant noodles. The slices of pork were great, and as previous reviews have said, they literally melted in my mouth! The hard boiled egg, and everything else in the bowl, were great as well. . . I will definitely return to Daikokuya in the future to try out the other menu items.
