Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
It's a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant that draws EVERYBODY in! People from all walks of life stroll in for some great Mexican food.  Expect a wait.  It's a tiny place and people are waiting outside while others are making take-out orders on the other side.  It's just packed! I am a hearty eater and I can eat only 1/3 of the burrito! It's just that HUGE! It's DELICIOUS, big and CHEAP! You can't complain about that! Great food at great prices and from the crowds, you know you're in the right place! YUMMY!
