I went to Highland Bakery for Sunday brunch. The place is rather small and they don't have a lot of seating so I'd recommend getting there before the traditional brunch rush. The atmosphere is rather quaint and reminds me of a place you'd find in Chelsea. While my friend and I had to wait outside for a good 30+ minutes, I found the experience to be worth the wait. I got the Cowboy Benedict and my friend got the Hopin' Highland and the Granola. While I won't say it was my favorite benedict in Atlanta, it was quite unique with the cheese quesadilla in lieu of the classic english muffin. My friend loved the Granola (it looked awesome) found the Hopin' Highland to be a little bland (its a vegetarian dish though and he's not vegetarian). Before leaving I had to get a red velvet cupcake to go (since I am a baker myself). It was good but I wasn't overly impressed with their buttercream frosting...I think it had a little bit too much cream cheese. . . Overall I would definitely check it out if you are looking for a brunch spot (that doesn't serve mimosa's or bloody's). Haven't been for lunch yet but I plan to check it out at some point.
