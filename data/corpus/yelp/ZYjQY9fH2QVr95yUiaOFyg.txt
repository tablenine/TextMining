I was taken out and about to a casual dinner here before dance lessons once. Dining experience was par. It was pretty crowded for it being a Monday and I noticed a few tables lined with local law enforcement - so it's Culver City PD approved it *has* to be good right? I had the eggplant. Thumbs up. Ambiance - not so much but the good company made up for it.
