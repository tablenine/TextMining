Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I went here with my wife and step daughter on a Sunday afternoon, and despite hearing horror stories about having to wait for a seat, we had no problem sidling up to some bar stools and sitting down.. Growing up in the L.A. area, I had heard my whole life about how good the burgers are at The Apple Pan.  And just a couple of weeks ago I even read an online article stating that not only were they one of the top 10 places in America to get a burger, but might even be the best!. Now I'm not saying they serve a bad burger, but to quote a popular college football chant - "Overrated!, overrated!, overrated!"  I can think of many other places to get a better burger (In-N-Out, Ruby Tuesday, Chili's, Red Robin, a Bacon Western Cheeseburger at Carl's Jr.).  In fact, it mostly reminded me of a Fatburger or Johnny Rockets.. The biggest problem was their secret sauce.  It was a combination of ketchup and sweet relish, and they put so much on it that it took away from the taste of the beef (which is what I'm really looking for when I bite into a burger).  And it caused it to be very messy as well, as the lettuce kept sliding off.. Also, they must have still been in lunch mode because the guy taking our orders rushed us so much that we couldn't even enjoy the dump.  We even said as we were driving away (out of the very tiny parking lot) that it must've been the quickest meal we've ever had!. Even though it seems to get the best reviews on Yelp, we weren't in the mood for pie afterwards, so we skipped it.  Maybe I can review it at a later date if we decide to go back (which would only be for the pie because I'll look elsewhere for a burger from now on).. Finally, The Apple Pan is overpriced for what you get.  For three of us plus a burger to go it was close to $50.. Overrated, overrated, overrated!
