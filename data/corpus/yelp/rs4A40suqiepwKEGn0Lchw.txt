Always enjoyed coming to Moody's Pub. Nice wait staff.. Never had a problem in that department,just put your order. in when you get there. You should have an Idea what your going . to get,Hamburgerss,Beer,Onion Rings,ect....  Love it in the Summer! And other times of year as well! Â Moody's. is a Chicago Institution!!!
