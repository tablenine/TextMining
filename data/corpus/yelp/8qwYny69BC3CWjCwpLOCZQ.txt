Christ almighty, it does exist!  Hallelujah, I FINALLY made contact with the Kogi truck.  Yes, I'm probably the last Angeleno to merely spy the darn thing.  Definitely the last Korean.  Seriously, my mom has even seen it.  Tonight I was riding shotgun and saw the word "kogi" emblazoned on the back of this medium-sized van.  Even though we just had dinner, I wanted to try one of these celebrated things.  The thing was Kogi was on the go and we were en route elsewhere.  Well, what do I do?  I tried to hail Kogi down.  First, I made eye contact with the driver, waved, smiled sugary sweet, and mouthed, "Can you please pull over, ahjusshi?"  Ahjusshi looked confused.  I went to plan B and flailed my arms a little.  Ahjusshi giggled (trust me, this ahjusshi giggled).  My friends said, "dude, it's not an ice cream truck."  Well, if you ask me, they should adopt some of the same principles.  Will update when I actually consume.  For now, I'm just excited to have seen possibly the first coast-to-coast Korean-American celebrity.
