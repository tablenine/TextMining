This place was a disappointment. The pho was a giant clump of noddels . The spice was a side of seracha. The beer was 12 bucks. The spring rolls were bored with themselves. The server was nice but he seemed like he was bored of the spring rolls. So what I'm saying is you can find a bajillion places way better.
