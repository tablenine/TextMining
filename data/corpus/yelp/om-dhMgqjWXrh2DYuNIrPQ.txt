Organic is good.  The flat-breads are really good.. The service was good.  Nice looking place.. But I'm NEVER GOING BACK!. . Everything was good - but come on.. We went for brunch and everyone was hungry - so we all got our on pizza. And it's a good thing we did - they are impossibly small.. We all have one beer or vodka drink.. . The bill for 5 people came to $135!!!!!!. Give me a fucking break. It's an outrage that this place thinks it's that good to charge people $15 for a smaller than small pizza. And $9 for a screwdriver.  Yes! $9 for a vodka screwdriver. PLEASE!. . NEVER GOING BACK!
