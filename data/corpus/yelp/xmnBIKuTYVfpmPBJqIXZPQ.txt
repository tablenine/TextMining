The 5 star rating is only for the milkshakes.  I have not ordered anything else here.  I sat at the bar, ordered some milkshakes, and watched the bartender make them with BlueBell ice cream.  Despite the fact that the whole place was packed, my milkshakes were ready within 4 or 5 minutes.    . . Nutella + burnt marshmallow milkshake - delicious!  The nutella portion of the shake was very creamy and smooth, and the burnt  marshmallows had a great smoky flavor.  Yummy and possibly carcinogenic.  5 stars.. . Orange creamsicle milkshake - tastes exactly like an orange creamsicle (orange popsicle filled with vanilla ice cream).  This brought back fond childhood memories.  4.5 stars. . The music is very loud, and the decor is modern, yuppie, and chic.  There are rock music videos playing on plasma tv screens framed by ornate white ceramic frames.  Expect to queue up for a while if you go here for dinner on a random weekday.. . Good for groups, but definitely make a reservation because the space is limited and popular.
