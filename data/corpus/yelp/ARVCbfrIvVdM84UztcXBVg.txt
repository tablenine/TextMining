I'll be honest, while this place has a great reputation and is always crowded no matter the day of week or time, I'd expect a fantastic sushi experience.  Hide takes no reservations so it's first come first serve only, and twice I've given up trying to eat there because of the wait.  . . I finally went a few months ago and finally getting the chance to sample their menu, I have good and bad things to say.  The ingredients and quality of the fish are simple yet fresh and delicious, and among what they serve, you can't go wrong.  However, being accustomed to many higher end sushi places on the west side, I was somewhat dissapointed by the lack of variety in their nigiri sushi (consisting mainly of traditional standbys) and absence of daily chef's specials, oysters or more unusual seafood.  Still, this is personal bias as what they do serve they serve well and those who want a simple no-frills sushi experience, I highly recommend despite the wait.  If you're looking for a little more, I'd look elsewhere
