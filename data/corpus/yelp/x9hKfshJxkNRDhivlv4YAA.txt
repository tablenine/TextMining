One of my colleagues went to college in GA and told me I HAD to check out South City Kitchen. I also checked it out on Yelp (as usual) and decided it was definitely worth a try. I could not and would not have returned to CA without tasting southern cuisine. South City Kitchen did not disappoint. . . It was a 45 wait to be seated but it was worth the wait. I ordered the fried chicken dish which I heard was their specialty. It came with mashed potatoes and ordered a side of fried green tomatoes and mac &amp; cheese. The fried green tomatoes weren't my style but my other colleague eating with me devoured all of it. So it worked out because there was more for him to consume. . . The fried chicken was juicy and not super oily. It wasn't overly breaded and tasted good. I'm not a huge friend chicken fan and I usually remove the skin (I know I know.... "That's the best part!") but I decided to try it out for this meal. Not bad at all. Crispy and flavorful. I topped off the meal with pecan pie ala mode. YUM!!! Not intensely sweet and paired well with the vanilla ice cream. I left this place feeling satisfied and sedated. Now THAT is what I call southern comfort. =)
