Restaurant: Wishbone
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I visited Wishbone on New Year's Day with a group of friends who had a taste for Southern goodness.  Being that my family all migrated here from the south, I usually have pretty high expectations when it comes to "soul food". However, I realize that the great southern restaurants are not found in posh urban neighborhoods.  That being said, my expectations were met at Wishbone.  I ordered the Shrimp and Grits (as did many of my friends) and my hubs ordered the Pan fried Catfish.  I was thoroughly satisfied with my food, and the hubs was with his.  For a quick "southern, soulfood" kick, Wishbone is a nice place to visit.  I will be back.
