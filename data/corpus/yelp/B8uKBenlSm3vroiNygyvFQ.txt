Fun atmosphere and great guacomole. The music and ambience felt like we were in midtown or buckhead. Nice to have a place like that up in Roswell.. . We ordered the guacamole and cheese dip appetizers. The guacamole was excellent and as creamy as the other reviewers describe. I'll pass on the cheese dip next time, it doesn't compare to La Parilla's (currently my favorite cheese dip).. . I ordered the fish tacos after reading someone's reviews about it, I was expecting something along the lines of Loca Luna's fish tacos (flour tortilla with steamed tilapia)... The fish was deep fried tilapia and were served with a bed of cole slaw and some kind of tartar sauce. The sauce completely masked any flavor or delicacies of the fish. The corn torillas added a nice texture but I don't think that corn tortillas + fried fish work very well.... . I'll return again to try different dishes and a margarita.
