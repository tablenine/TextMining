Restaurant: Little Five Corner Tavern
Category: Bars
For me, Corner Tavern is just ok. They have pool tables, if you like that. They have dart boards, which I do sometimes partake in. But otherwise, it's just average. . . I like that it's open air up front, that's pretty cool, but what I think turns me off about this place is the service. The waiters are a bit slow and they always seem annoyed to be taking your order. And as other reviewers have mentioned, it's not usually that crowded, so they don't have the excuse of being super busy. . . It's worth noting that I've only been here to hang out and drink, never to eat.
