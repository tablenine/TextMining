Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
Went for a first time visit with some friends recently and was really impressed. . . If you are looking for great, reasonably priced BBQ, Smokedaddy is the place. Their pulled pork and beef brisket are top notch and their macaroni &amp; cheese and corn bread is also highly recommended.. . The restaurant itself is a little cramped space wise, but its well worth it for the food. They also have live blues &amp; jazz if thats your thing. If thats not your thing then you might want to take it to go.
