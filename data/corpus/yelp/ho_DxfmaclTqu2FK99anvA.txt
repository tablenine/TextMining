Ladies and Gentlemen, be ready to bow down to Portos Bakery, because it lived up to the big hype.. Pricing - For a small $10.70, my boyfriend and I gluttonously ordered 2 pasteles de carne, 2 pasteles de guayaba y queso, 1 pan con lechon, and 1ramkin of tres leches.  That's 6 items for just 2 personas!  What a steal! . Now for the mouth watering part.  Every single bite of those cuban pasteles was like heaven: warm, flaky, fresh, and flavorful.  *drool*   The pan con lechon would have gotten a perfect 10 had they served it quicker, but because of the slow delivery, the cuban bread came out a bit soggy.  Nonetheless, the lechon, garlic mojo, and onions was DELICIOUS!   And lastly, the sole reason why this place is rated 4.5 stars instead of 5 stars is because of the disappointing tres leches.  This popular Latino dessert simply lacked texture and milkiness...AND it was topped with too much whip cream.  . So overall, hail to Portos!  You are the king of the LA's latino bakeries.
