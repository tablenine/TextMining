Meh, s'ok. . . I was a little surprised at how limited the menu was.  I'm an avid eater of salads, and there was really one choice that was truly a salad.  The polenta would have been exceptional, but they kind of flubbed the mushroom sauce that topped it.  All in all, I'd say this place is more convenient than good.  . . The staff''s usually pretty friendly, but not the most normal set of individuals on the planet.. . Three stars
