Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Everyone always talks about this place like it's a must if you're visiting LA. I agree. If you've never been to Roscoe's, you have to at least try it once! . . Surprisingly, on a Friday morning, this place wasn't packed and there was no wait. My party ordered a bunch of #1's and #2's. Everyone loved their meal. I can't speak for how yummy the chicken is because mine was dippin' in their gravy (I had a #2), but the gravy made my chicken fantastic. The waffles were good, but nothing special. The service, meh. . . I found it funny when we were handed our bill and the waitress wrote on a separate piece of paper, "This is your total w/ TIP $82.75" and stapled it to the front of our bill.
