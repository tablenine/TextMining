Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Mexican
OVERALL: Given the choice, I would never say Mexican ... it's just usually not my thing, but Rosa Mexicano was very very good.  I don't know if the food was fusion, but the ambiance certainly felt like it, and as a non-Mexican, it worked for me.  The water wall (although I'm convinced I've seen it elsewhere) at the entrance with figurine divers in various diving formation all over was interesting.  . . FOOD:  The guacamole was nice and chunky, and tomitilo salsa perfectly spicy.  Enchiladas suizas - really good!.. . MINUS 1/2 STAR:  Be sure to check in with the desk to see if your table is ready.  We stood right outside with our buzzer which did not go off, and apparently missed our "turn."  I was not impressed that they made no effort to come ask around outside.  . . Ladies... just hold it, the bathroom was disgusting. They really need to remedy this.
