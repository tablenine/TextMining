Love the burgers here, but they're pricey and I've gotten attitude from the service every time I've been there.  Yes, I understand the dinning room is small and that you're always busy and crowded, that doesn't give you the right to be short with your costumers.  But the burgers and sides are worth it so I keep coming back.  I had the Casablanca burger last time (lamb) with the malt liquor onion rings.  Definitely recommended.  They also don't serve alcohol so BYOB
