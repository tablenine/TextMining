Restaurant: The Shed at Glenwood
Category: American (New)
Shed is, if nothing else, unique. . . The restaurant certainly feels upscale, but this atmosphere is immediately juxtaposed with a bowl of popcorn to munch on before the meal. They also served us delicious scoops of cantaloupe sorbet before we ate, but I'm not sure if that is always done. . . I ordered three small plates: the beet salad, tilapia ceviche, and gazpacho. None was bad, but none was amazing, either. This was the second time I'd ordered beet salad at a "fancy" restaurant, and both times I was slightly let down by the dish. It just seemed like something I could make myself. The ceviche was decent--A for presentation, B- for flavor. And the gazpacho was also OK, but it tasted more like salsa than soup. . . My brother got the chicken salad, which looked quite good. The only problem was that it had bacon mixed in, which the menu failed to mention. The fries served with his sandwich were delicious, however.. . Shed's worth a try, but it may not blow your mind. . . Its wine list is far more varied than its food list, but I can only comment on the food.
