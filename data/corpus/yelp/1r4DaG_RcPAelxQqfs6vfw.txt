Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
I love italian, and I love brazilian and this place is a lot of both and super delicious. The pastas are all well seasoned, the sandwiches are fabulous. I recommend the Sunset pasta with Fettucine, or the chicken copacabana with mashed potatoes...OOh but you really have to try the Chicken Stroganoff! So much flavor, I wonder how Brazilians ever leave the house, I'd just sit and eat all day. . . The prices are really reasonable for the amount of food you get. $8 - $12 for almost everything, and I defy you to finish it in one sitting.. . P.S. the service sucks...I always order out.
