Restaurant: The Tavern at Phipps
Category: Bars
I don't really care too much if the Tavern at Phipps insists on marketing itself as a gastropub.  They can call themselves whatever they want as far as I'm concerned, because I know what they are and what they aren't.. . Maybe I'm being a snobby Californian by saying this, but this place just exudes affluence without a corresponding level of class.  Let's face it, the food is hit or miss at best, there aren't enough beers on tap for this place to seriously think of itself as a pub of any kind, and this place seems to host a nightly douchebag convention in the bar and outdoor patio area.. . So what draws people back to this place?  You know what it is, and I don't need to tell you.  Bottom line is you're not going to ask any of these ladies how they feel about the relative merits of fiscal vs. monetary policy in correcting an economic downturn.  In fact, you won't talk to them very much at all because they tend to hover all over the sexually frustrated middle aged men that seem to come here regularly and tip far more generously than young guys like me.  For those older guys, I'm sure it's a nightly stop on the way home to the tender wife and kids in Marietta.. . But in the evening, after a long day at the office, you can come here with one or two buddies, hopefully get a table outside, and just sit back, have a few beers, talk a little sports, and watch the scenery.  And when you're ready for dinner, head around the corner to Dantanna's.
