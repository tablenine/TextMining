Restaurant: Maggiano&#39;s Little Italy
Category: Italian
Two words: Family Style!. . This is a great place for large groups to enjoy lots of food with plenty of variety.  They know how to handle the crowd.  I've been to several group meals here - before semiformals and for my college graduation.  Considering the quality and amount of food that you get, the price is pretty reasonable.  We even managed a couple of times to get a few days worth of leftovers - you just ask for another tray of food, and then take just a few items off and ask with puppy dog eyes to take it with you so that it's not thrown away.. . I recommend the Maggiano's Salad and Chicken Parmesan - a very delicious combination, ones that everyone loves.. . I like the decor, even if it's somewhat contrived - it's what I think of when I think of an old-school Italian place in Chicago (for whatever reason), without being too cheesy or over done.  Also the spinach under the salmon is excellent (I'm not that much of a salmon lover).. . I've been before with just the in-laws for dinner, and while the food and service was still good, the portions were just too big, so that we felt like we were paying for way more food than we wanted, even considering that you can take it home.
