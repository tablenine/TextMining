Right when you walk into Ben Pao, you know you're in for a great dining experience.  They obviously paid attention to the details when decorating the restaurant.  Done up in sexy and urban red and black Asian design, it is beautiful.  Diners have to cross a little bridge over an inside river to enter the main seating area, which consists of mostly tables and a few booths in solid black wood with red napkins, sleek white plates and chic glassware.. . As everyone says, the old world eggrolls are phenomenal.  I think it's peanuts that give them their extra punch.  We also ordered the veggie and chicken potstickers.  Not my favorite, but my dining companions ate 'em up!. . Entrees are served family style, so confer with the table and decide on a few things you'll all want to sample.  The Mongolian beef was tender and flavorful.  The sauce is a bit thicker than I normally prefer, but it worked.  We also ordered the Sesame Chicken.  OUTSTANDING.  How the chef gets chicken to be so crispy on the outside and tender on the inside is beyond me.  Perhaps that's why I'm not a chef?  Our server was kind enough to ask the chef to prepare an eggplant and tofu dish that is no longer on the menu.  And because we didn't already order enough food to feed a small army, my group decided to upgrade our basic brown rice to the veggie fried brown rice.  What a treat to have veggie fried rice with large pieces of fresh vegetables you can see and taste!  . . The servic really needs to be mentioned as well.  Our server took such great care of us last night.  He worked with the chef to provide an item no longer on the menu, gave great suggestions and even sold my friend a bag of their stellar mango iced tea!  He gave her detailed instructions on how to brew it at home to achieve the best flavor.  . . All in all, a great experience.
