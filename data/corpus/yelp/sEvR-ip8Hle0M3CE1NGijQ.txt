Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
Pops is a fabulous small plate restaurant.  The staff is very knowledgeable and the champagne is excellent.  They do make other drinks but why would you bother?  The cheese fondue is a must have.  I went with a group of seven and we were all comfortable and taken care of.  We ordered a magnum which is the way to go with a big group, plus the presentation is very cool.
