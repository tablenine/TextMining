So after all this time. I have finally eaten at a kogi truck. By chance it was parked next to the get shaved truck, so after getting shaved ice, figured. Why not give it a shot.. . Because of all the hype and long lines when kogi first came out, I thought this truck wouldn't be able to shed the Â dreaded "overrated" label and the all hype with a soso product.. . . But in actuality, their food is actually quite tasty.. I had the kalbi burrito and the blackjack quesdilla with pork,, and i'd eat both again.. as long as there's no crazy lines... but with so many trucks.. i don't think they have that problem anymore..
