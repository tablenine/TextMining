This place was fabulous and its 4.5 star rating is well-deserved!  I found this place through Yelp and decided to give it a try.  All of the meats were high-grade and melts in your mouth.  As a party of 6 we ordered Combo Dinner A, which served 5 people, and included various cuts of beef including rib eye steak.  In addition, we ordered Combo Dinner D; this included marinated chicken, pork belly and beef ribs, and served 2.  Included with these combo meals are a drink (choice of beer, soju or soda), salad, stew, and all of my favorite Korean sides (different types of kim chee and more!).  The staff was friendly and fast, and the place was very clean.  We all loved it!
