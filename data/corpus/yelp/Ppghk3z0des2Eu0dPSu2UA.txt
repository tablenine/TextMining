Huh. I didn't review Langer's yet?. . This isn't cheap, but the mounds of food on your plate will give you either leftovers or a bellyache! Langer's has the feel of an old fashioned east coast diner. Not Perkins, Yankee Doodle Diner. Homey, old fashioned, good bad coffee, patrons who know the waitresses names, hostesses who aren't 15 year old actress/model/singers. NICE PEOPLE. . . And the sammiches!!!!!!!!!! GLORIOUS! I don't even like cole sla and I loved this. As a vegetarian I had some trepidation about asking for a vegi reuben..the waitress and I made one up with their homemade colesla, swiss cheese, sauerkraut and delicious dressing on rye. It was amazing! YAY! I've been back since then, had potato pancakes, they're yum as well.  My meat eating friends drool at the mention.. . Best visited late morning/early afternoon, especially if you're wimpy about neighborhoods.  Yup, looks dirty and sketchy. Nope, never had a problem here, and I used to live walking distance (again, east coast walking distance, not LA walking distance!).
