Interesting concept with seemingly infinite choices on how to build your burger. A little on the expensive side, but what do you really expect from a trendy burger boutique? Burgers are very tall and somewhat of a challenge to eat, but generally a pretty tasty experience and I'm sure I'll return in the future.
