I came here for lunch today so this review is limited to lunchtime service only.  . . This restaurant is enormous &amp; very nicely decorated.  It has an Asian/Fusion decor, soft lighting, backlit shelves of fancy sake &amp; liquor bottles, and a low hum of Asian fusion music.. . The service was swift and efficient, but highly impersonal.  I can't even remember our server's face!  I kind of felt like I was in a lunch factory, because within seconds of of my last bite the check was on the table and the plates were scooped up.. . The food was okay, nothing terribly special.  I ordered the basil chicken, which was supposed to be spicy, but turned out to be a kind of bland mix of soggy vegetables and sliced chicken.  The lunch menu was pretty extensive and most items were under $8, which was nice.. . Come here for a quick, reasonably priced lunch in a lovely ambiance but don't expect much from the food.  I'd give this place 2 1/2 stars if we were allowed to rate with half stars!
