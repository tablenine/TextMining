Why the change of heart?  Well, first of all, they expanded their joint and added a wing that looks more moderns and of course, bigger --- which is a good thing.  That's not why I changed my rating. . . My friend went there recently for lunch.  After paying and tipping, they left.  Once they got outside the door on the way to their car, they were stopped by one of the waitresses accusing them of leaving without paying.  There were 3 of them who all chipped in for the bill and remembered clearly tha tthey left the money on the tray.  So my friend spoke with the manager and eventually told them they can go and they don't have to pay but still sticking with their story and believing the silly waitress that my friends did not pay.  SO, my point is, ARE THEY REALLY SERIOUS?  That was a bad move on their part.  . . These are business people who work about 20 minutes away - if they really wanted to ditch the food without paying, would they have wasted their gas to have lunch at some cheap dumpling house in Arcadia???? SERIOUSLY????  Cmon...don't make me laugh!  . . Oh well.....
