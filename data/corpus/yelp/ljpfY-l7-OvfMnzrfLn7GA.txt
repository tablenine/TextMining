The food is fantastic. It's a little pricey because it's fantastic, get over it. The servers are hipsters, so what? Get over it. They card you when you walk in because it's a bar AND a restaurant, get over it. They keep your ID when you start a tab because they don't want to pay it when your drunk ass walks off on them, get over it. The booze is cheap, the atmosphere is dope, the place is cool looking and the food is great.
