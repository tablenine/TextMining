3.5 stars.... . . 4.5 for service. 4.0 for venue. 2.0 for food . . This place is actually pretty nice as the service was friendly, the venue was trendy but the main pitfall was the food.  My friend said cause it was a sunday night and only foodies know not to eat sushi on a sundays... (we can debate this forever) but the party bombs that we had there did not taste fresh at all.   The fish was soaked in some sauce or had a slight smell.... Overall its a great concept to have those sushi peices set up as bite size hors d'oeuvres.. . The prices were relatively cheap compared to the city but I will definitely give this place another shot
