I gathered with some girls here for a friend's Birthday, and I was very impressed with the quality of the food. I had a chicken Caesar salad with real, fresh lettuce; very crisp and refreshing. I also stuffed my face with some fries/chips, sprinkled with salt and vinegar, washing all of it down with a Strongbow Apple Cider and a seasonal ale with hints of honey. . . My exuberance was heightened by the outdoor seating area, with a great view of downtown Decatur's greenspace, a light breeze rustling the trees and my fries. . . Too bad it was a Monday night, or we would've hit up the Metalsome karaoke, too...
