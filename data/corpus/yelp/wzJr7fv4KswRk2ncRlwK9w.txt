Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
We were out looking for some breakfast and since the place around the corner was packed we decided on Dunlays. I ordered the breakfast burrito which was excellent and I especially liked the hash brown casserole. It definitely had some secret ingredients in it. The girlfriend had the spinach, bacon, and mushroom omelette which was good. It did seem a little pricey for just breakfast but otherwise I will definitely go again. Service was good.
