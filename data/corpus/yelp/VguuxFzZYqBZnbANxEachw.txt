Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
I've got nothing really creative to say.  All I can simply say is DB's lunch menu has to be one of the best values in the city.  You get a 3 course meal for basically the price of an entree.  I started with the kobe beef sashimi on top of a Himalayan salt block, followed by 7 oz Delmonico steak, and finished with a chocolate creme brulee.. . Another thing I like about DB Primehouse is it's not the traditional and predictable meat and potatoes menu.  I don't know why but I feel so old dining at  traditional steak houses.  I have this perceived stigma that only old people with the last name Wellington dine there.  Of course it's a false notion because my friends and fellow yelpers like Matt L dine at places like Gibson's, and their last names are certainly not Wellington.. . Anyway all this talk of distinguished steak houses reminds me of a story.  We were supposed to meet up at this steak house for a bipolar disorder presentation.  One of the other students ended up in the wrong private dining room that was a hypertension drug rep meeting full of licensed physicians.  Towards the end of presentation (3rd course), the drug rep asked the student, "So doctor, what is your opinion about drug X?"  He had to play along and stated, "Yes, drug X has had great benefits for my patients in my clinic...". "I concur." -What movie is that statement from?
