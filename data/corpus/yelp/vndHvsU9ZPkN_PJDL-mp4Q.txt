I used to come here more often when I first moved to the city, not knowing about the more extensive variety of vegetarian-friendly restaurants that exist in Chicago.  I've had a handful of things from the menu, but now mainly stick with my favorite when I rarely go - The Bump n' Grinder with a side of fries.  It's a decent stop for a lunch or casual late dinner if you're in the area, especially since they have meat, vegetarian, and vegan options.
