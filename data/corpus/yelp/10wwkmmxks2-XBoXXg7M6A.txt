Category: Sushi Bars
Now I think these high priced sushi dishes ARE worth paying for! . . I went here for a Bachelorette Party dinner, and the wonderful event planner for this (best friend to the bride) had us order off the menu and pay before had, So when we got there all we had to worry about was buying the bride-to-be drinks all night!. . Geisha House made that dinner so easy and painless for our large group... so long we didn't go switching seats on the poor waitress. The service was the best! They had 2 other B-Parties too, so they totally know what they're doing.. . I had the.... Frieghten Geisha: Spicy Tuna And Cucumber Topped With Torched Salmon, Tobiko, Spicy Cream Sauce, Eel Sauce . Over the Rainbow: Crab, Avocado, Cucumber, Topped With Salmon, Yellowtail, Tuna, Albacore, And Shrimp. ...and miso soup.. . I also had some of the Red Rocket (Shrimp Tempura. Crab Topped With Spicy Tuna And Avocado, Eel Sauce And Tempura Flakes), Call 9-1-1 Spicy Tuna (Spicy Tuna And Cucumber), Chicken Karage (fried chicken poppers with sweet/spicy sauce), and some Ocean Dragon (Shrimp Tempura And Crab, Topped With Fresh Water Eel, Avocado, Gold Tobiko, And Eel Sauce). . All super super delish! And of course I stuffed myself!. . And I found out there is one in Santa Ana I SO will be yelping in the near future!
