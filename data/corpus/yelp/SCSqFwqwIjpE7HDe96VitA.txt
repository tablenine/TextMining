Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©

Griddle baby! Listen- here's my tip- go there before you get hungry, right when you're on the cusp of hunger, not once you've gotten to that point cause you will have to wait. Now let's get to the food- cause that's what it's all about. I'm big on finding a great cup of coffee- and the Griddle's got it- French Press. I've been here a couple of times and somehow had the self control not to order pancakes or french toast, but I've seen and tasted them and yes ma'am, they are delicious! I opt for scrambles and omelets- they have a scramble with tomato, basil, mozarella---go there! Or, try the Chili My Soul omelet- also fantastic! Their menu of "griddle items" (pancakes and such) is seemingly never ending and just thinking about it makes me want to go, but alas that god damned line!
