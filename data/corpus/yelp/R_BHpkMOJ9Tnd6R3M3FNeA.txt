I went back again for lunch with my co-worker.. . We didn't have to wait for a table.  We shared clam pizza and macaroni &amp; cheese.. Clam pizza:  loved the cheese.  3 stars.. Macaroni &amp; Cheese: didn't really care for it.  We didn't finish the mac n cheese.  2 stars.. . Of course I had to stop by the bakery and got more goodies.  . Chocolate Caramel Macaron:  still good.  4 stars.. Purple Macaron:  not sure what flavor but not bad.  3 stars.. Honey Orange: haven't tried it but it's supposed to be good with your tea.. . 3 stars!!. . Bottega Louie's chocolate caramel macaron is still yummylicious!!
