This place reminds me of an upscale version of yard house.  The beer selection is awesome.  The burger is pretty good here.  I'm spoiled cuz I've eaten some good burgers in SF.  I like the outdoor seating they have in the patio.  Its nice to be able to have a drink and talk to the people you are hanging out with.  No hot chix here.  -1 star
