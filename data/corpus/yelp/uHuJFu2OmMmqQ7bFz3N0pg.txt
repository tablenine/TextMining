Restaurant: Grindhouse Killer Burgers
Category: Burgers
And onto the bandwagon I hop . . . . . Finally deciding to use my Groupon purchased about 8 years ago, I found my way to Grindhouse Killer Burgers in the Sweet Auburn Curb Market yesterday. And I'm glad I did! This shit was TASTY. Well, at least the burgers were. . . I got a single with American cheese, and it was greasy deliciousness.  Perhaps a tad overpriced, but yummy nonetheless. The single is smaller than I expected, but the grease factor makes it pretty damn filling regardless. I was full for hours after leaving here.. . I also sampled the fries and onion rings.  I actually enjoyed the previously frozen crinkle-cut fries, mainly because I love fries that have some sort of season salt on them, as these do. The onion rings were actually a little disappointing - there's some sort of Italian seasoning in the breading that I thought didn't work for them.. . Service was friendly and fast, and they were showing "The Last Dragon" on the tile wall, which was so hilariously 80s in its appearance that you didn't even need to be able to hear the words.. . The Sweet Auburn Curb Market is pretty awesome in and of itself. There are several different butcher and produce stalls, as well as a couple of other counter restaurants.  And there's some interesting shit in there - cow's feet are the first thing that come to mind. . . I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I will definitely go again the next time I find myself down a quart of grease.
