This place is really close to my apartment--I pass the big sign almost every day.  So when a friend from out out of town came to visit, I thought I should finally try it out, since I'd been to every other brunch spot in a five mile radius.  The interior is dark--brick with very little light streaming in.  They got my friend's order wrong, bringing her a grilled cheese instead of a chicken sandwich.  When she pointed out the error, our server argued with us, insisting that my friend asked for grilled cheese, when I clearly heard her ask for chicken.  They did make her another sandwich, and let us keep the grilled cheese as well, which was nice.  I ordered the specialty french toast--I think that it had raspberry sauce.  Unfortunately, it was dry and sort of flavorless.  The one big highlight of the meal was the sweet potato salad that came with my friend's sandwich.  Delicious!  I still dream about it sometimes--it was that good.  All in all, sort of questionable, but may be worth a second trip, if just for the potato salad.
