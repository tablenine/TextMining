I've only been here once, and never had steak milanesa anywhere else, but definitely don't get it here.  You pay $27 for the cheapest cut of beef you can find, fried in oil without any seasonings.  It comes out tasting like oil and cheap beef - I prefer $4 carne asada at the taco shop to this beef.  At $15 you would expect their signature mojito to have some alcohol in it, but you'd be wrong.  This place is way overpriced, probably on account of the location and the "ambience" but I couldn't care less about those things.  Good food first!
