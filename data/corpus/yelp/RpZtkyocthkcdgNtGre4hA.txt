Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Tucked into a spot on west side Hillhurst Ave, just north of Franklin is the Alcove. Such a cool little coffee and breakfast spot. The fare is standard, but go for the vibe. Hipster hotties and fashionistas get lost in the shuffle here. Fido friendly as well.
