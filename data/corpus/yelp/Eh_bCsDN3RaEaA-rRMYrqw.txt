Pro: Open Seating. MUCH bigger than santa monica location. lots of alcohol. friendly bartenders with humor. . Con: Gets crowded even then... awgh. . Man, I love this location because it's so accessible compared to the one on the westside. parking is SO much easier, it's SO much easier to get in, LESS cramped, and the bathrooms are so cute they make me giggle.
