Not the best sushi in town, but for the price what do you expect.  I think they do have some interesting options which might be better, but nothing on the menu jumps at you.. . Went on a Friday so it was loud and there was some funky dance/house music playing, which is kind of awkward?  On the plus side they kept feeding us free samples, which were good.  . . Avoid the "Gone With the Wind" its hard to eat because of the way its designed.  It's like Voltron of sushi.  A bunch of little rolls combined to form Sushi-tron with a cream cheese center.. . I wouldn't recommend this place for sushi, but if you want to have a pretty good time people watching, could be worth the time.
