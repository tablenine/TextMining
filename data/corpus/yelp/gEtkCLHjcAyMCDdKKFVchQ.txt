Geisha House should really be called GAYsha House. The restaurant breeds douche bag city central. My review probably would have been 5 stars if I was 21.. but that was MUCH long ago. So I'll give it 3. . . The quality of the food actually isn't bad at all.. overpriced, but you are paying for the hot waiter to oogle at. Â The style of service has a a 'too cool for school' type attitude, but they got the job done. I get it, this isn't fine dining, it's spring break.. . I suggest coming here if:. . 1. You plan on running in to "LC" from the Hills.. 2. You want to get drunk off their $12 ginger, peach, lychee, cucumber-melon, unagi martini.
