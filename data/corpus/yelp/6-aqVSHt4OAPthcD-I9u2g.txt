I like this place. It's a little pricey but you can order anything from pizza to a sweet New York steak until 12:00 am. Cozy, warm atmosphere and free parking across the street. Works for me. I'm rating this a 4* only because I can't spend less than $50 bucks for one. But the yummy leftovers are good for lunch or dinner next day so that helps:)
