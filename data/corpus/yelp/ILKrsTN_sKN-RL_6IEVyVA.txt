Had seared sea scallops with barbeque'd rice in a lemon grass sauce. Also tasted their filet, mashed potatoes, mushrooms, spicy tuna rolls, California rolls, appetizer sampler and chocolate lava cake. . . Very good food. They earned their four stars for me in the quality of their scallops. Excellent large morsels that didn't taste fishy whatsoever. Shrimp was also an excellent quality, as was the butter fish and fillet. Lava cake is served with a pistachio flavored gelato, which is different. Atmosphere is formal, very uptight and restaurant also lacks in the lighting department. Too bright for such a formal dining experience. Other than that, great.
