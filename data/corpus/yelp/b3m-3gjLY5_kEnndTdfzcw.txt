ZYKA ROCKS!!!!. . This is the best Indian food in Atlanta! I always leave satisfied, they have great vegetarian options. I normally get teh chana masala or bihindi masala, naan, and rice! I love the little bowl of onions and lime that comes with the meals....I just squeeze the lime on the onions and either eat the onions by themselves or pile them of my mixture of rice and massala....oooohhh my mouth just waters as I think about it. But please be warned YOU WILL bleech Zyka for days!! Oh for dessert get the mango lassi! The price is so right here..my bill is normally around $15 and I have left-overs for the next day or later that night.
