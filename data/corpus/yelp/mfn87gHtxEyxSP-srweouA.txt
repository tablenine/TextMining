We just went this friday night for a B-day and its a fun place to come, they spray the B-day person down with champagn and its nice to see the Happy Birthday person soaked wet and have to still sit through dinner with there friends and family, it's esp. funny when they make the birthday person wear googles and them having no clue whats gonna happen.
