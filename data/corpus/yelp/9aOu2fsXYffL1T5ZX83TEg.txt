Best chinese food in the neighborhood,  hands down. Good prices, especially for lunch special. . . Some of my favorite: the lobster, pea sprouts, kung pao chicken, salt &amp; pepper pork chop (warning, plenty of msg on this one), and the fried fish (forgot which one specifically).  . . If you don't need to go in there during peak dining hours, especially on weekends on holidays, I suggest going at another time, unless you don't mind hour-long wait. Went on either Christmas or New Year's night one time, and the wait was ~1.5h. But the food is worth it either way.
