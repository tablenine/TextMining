Restaurant: Chateau de Saigon
Category: Vietnamese
Being Vietnamese, I would like to think that gives me some credibility on Vietnamese cuisine. . . Chateau de Saigon is definitely the nicest Vietnamese restaurant on Buford Highway. . . While others may choose Pho Back or Pho Dai Loi for pho, I love the pho here. The broth isn't as sweet and the meat tastes fresher than other places. . . For lunch, I usually order a dish that I absolutely crave: Bun Bo Hue. A noodle soup dish from the Hue region of Vietnam. The noodles are a lot thicker than pho noodles and look similar to spaghetti noodles. . . I usually request it without the solidified blood chunks. It's a very native and adventurous dish and reminds me of my mom's home cooking. . . The shrimp paste, though, stinky, lends the broth a slightly salty, fishy flavor. Only think I wished they'd include is some pig knuckles! Then it would be truly authentic!
