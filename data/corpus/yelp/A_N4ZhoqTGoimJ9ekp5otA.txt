Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Soonwon is the real deal.  Had the please of 2 of my Korean friends hosting and it delivered.  The meat blows away both and Chosun (the Disneyland of Korean Places) and Park's.. . The Galbi was the best I've ever had by far.  Amazingly tender and off the bone.  The Bulgogi was also amazing and the best I've had in LA.  The pork Bulgogi was too heavily covered &amp; spiced to enjoy the meat.  That plus skimpy on the pan chan gets it 4 stars, but great nevertheless.. . I feel like a Boa constrictor after eating a crocodile right now.
