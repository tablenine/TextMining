Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I am not too much of a soul food fan but this place is nothing short of phenomenal.  First-timers must try the chicken and waffles combo (Lord Harvey?) with the chicken smothered in the gravy and onions.  The butter melts perfectly on the waffles, and, I never thought I'd say this, but fried chicken and waffles is an awesome combination.  I usually end up craving an encore helping even up to a week after each visit.  . . Service is great and the waitstaff is very friendly and, even when there is a line, it moves quickly.  An establishment like Roscoe's makes me enjoy my visits to L.A. even more and also makes me proud to be a Californian.
