Hands down our favorite brunch spot in the whole city!  This is where we often take our out-of-town guests and friends not in the know to show off some yummy food.  All of the traditional favorites are on there, but revamped in seriously tasty ways.  I really appreciate that they don't drench the food in syrupy sweet sauces like many of the trendy breakfast places do lately - I like salt on my eggs thanks.  The portions are big so you won't leave hungry and you can totally try some of your dining partner's grub.. . Lunch is also very good here - a more traditional and somewhat limited menu, but still good.  Totally diggin on the tortilla soup but the black bean burger lacked flavor the last time I had it.. . They lose two stars because dinner is boring and expensive when compared to brunch.  I like the butternut squash ravioli and their cocktails are AMAZING but I always leave feeling that dinner should have been a bit better because the brunch is just sooo good.. . However, they gain a star back through carry-out and delivery with online ordering options.  And a stellar patio.  And almost always prompt and polite service.
