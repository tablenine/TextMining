What can you do to say that you're sorry and know that you'll be forgiven?. . Take them to The Little Door.. . I did something bad (I won't say what... but if I don't say, will everyone's imagination go wild and think of something that was a hundred times worse then what I actually did?).. . I needed a way to say that I'm sorry.  So, headed out to The Little Door (and on the way, got lost, because I mis-wrote the address... damn, when I crash, I crash and burn).. . But when we actually made it to The Little Door, everything fell perfectly into place.  Found parking near the front (and no, I did not park in the valet area and not leave my keys).  Went in, checked my reservations, and got seated promptly.. . Waiter was actually French (or so he said, but I can't tell a bad French accent from an authentic one, and neither can my friend, and so it's all good), and he was friendly, funny, and (what's another adjective that starts with an "f"... uhm, a positive one).  . . Food was excellent, the wine was perfectly matched and the dessert was just incredible (and I rarely care for desserts).. . And on top of all that, I was forgiven and all is right with the world.
