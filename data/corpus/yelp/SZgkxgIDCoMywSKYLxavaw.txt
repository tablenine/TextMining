First time I had ever had Cuban food and I must say I wasn't disappointed. Ordered the famed garlic chicken and I can honestly say it was the best chicken I have ever tasted. Juicy, not dry, tender, and I never realized anything could be so flavorful that I was literally soaking the meat in the juice pools on my plate before I ate it because it was that yummy. Keep in mind that this chicken is really full of flavor so don't order it if you don't think you can handle all excess of cirtrus, garlic, and onion goodness.. . The only downside was that the chicken is for big meat eaters as it is A LOT of meat. Didn't have enough rice and beans in the side and I ended up eating only half of my chicken and bringing the rest home because I couldn't finish it. It did make for some pretty good leftovers though.. . Oh and I LOVED the plaintans! I don't even like bananas but these were so tasty! Pretty good quality food for your money, and sometimes I have HUGE cravings for that chicken. Oh man, it's just that good!
