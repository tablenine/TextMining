Restaurant: Fortune Cookie Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Tasty or not?  Here's my list:. . 1) Steamed pot stickers- Tasty, but very skinny and might have stayed in the steamer a little too long.. . 2) crab rangoon- Tasty with a very cute presentation.  They looked like 4 tentacled octopuses. . . 3) Vegetable spring roll- Tasty, but lacked something.... . 4) Kung pau shrimp- Very tasty!  The sauce was thick and the flavor was amazing!  I would order again.. . 5) Sesame chicken- Not so tasty, except the sauce.  The texture was very bean curd like, but hard to chew.  . . 6) Chicken lo mein- Tasty!  The noodles were cooked just right.  Not too soft like some places I've eaten at.. . Overall, the food was good.  But somewhere, in another Chinese kitchen, there are chopsticks.  Yes, chopsticks.  I was not happy about not seeing a set of chopsticks at the table.  I understand that some people prefer forks, but chopsticks are a must if you have a Chinese restaurant.  Don't half ass your culture!. . The service was good!  My water glass was never empty, half empty or half full.. . Overall, I would try Fortune Cookie again. . ... and ask for chopsticks with my meal!
