Hmmm. What to say, what to say...that hasn't already been said. . . Decent food, decent margaritas (a girl can appreciate a good drink) but it's the patio that gets the 3 stars. lol Great during the summer time. I mean you're in midtown on a busy street and although you've got the noise of the cars wizzing by you can still get caught up in the silliness that may take place between you and your friends while dining or drinking on the patio. . . People watching can be prettttty interesting too. There was once a man who made his way around N Highland and Ponce I don't know, some 10 times, and we swear he wasn't jogging. lol Wasn't really sure why he did a couple of laps around the block but it entertained us. lol Did I mention we entertain easily?! I'll blame that on the maragritas...and note to self, no margaritas after a night on the town. The sugar in those suckers will make you feel as though death is upon you after a night out. Hair of the dog ..baddd; water with lemon.....goodddd. . . All in the all this place is average, but the atmosphere is cool
