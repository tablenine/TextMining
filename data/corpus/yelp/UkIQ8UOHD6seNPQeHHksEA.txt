I was introduced to Bite by a friend who lived nearby, about three years ago.  Everything I've had there has been fresh and delicious; it's never off my radar for long, even though I don't live terribly close by. . . The boy and I went last Saturday, for brunch; I had the cornbread French toast (asked for the fresh blueberry sauce - with whole berries in it - on the side; I like just a little, and apparently it usually comes pre-poured.  That would've been blueberry overload for me.)  Sweet Jesus, was it delicious...fantastic texture too.  The butter on the side was cinnamon achiote, and it was amazing. . . We ordered a piece of plum upside down cake to go, and devoured it later that day.  Mmmm.  . . I found myself in need of dinner tonight, and decided to go back to Bite.  I had the house-made watermelon lemonade, and a double veggie cheeseburger, which was one of the best veggie burgers ever to pass these lips.  For a side dish, I tried the summer slaw - cabbage, zucchini, and carrots (I think) with a lovely vinegary sauce.  . . That would have ordinarily been more than enough...but since I'm pregnant (that's an acceptable excuse, right?) I ordered dessert too.  Cherry cornbread cobbler a la mode.  It was marvelous. . . I generally am not one to eat until I'm stuffed...but as I sit here, three hours after my dinner, I couldn't suck in my stomach if you paid me.  I have a food baby AND a regular baby in there.  And you know what? I'd do it all over again. . . P.S. I have only ever had one server at Bite - a woman with glasses and a ponytail, I believe.  She was perfectly delightful and very attentive.
