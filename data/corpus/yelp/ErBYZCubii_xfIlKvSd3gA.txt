Had a real good time here tonight.  Didn't make it on half price roll night, so will have to do that next time.  I noticed that a lot of the rolls have mayo in them and I'm not a huge mayo fan, but did you can always ask to have that left off.  The Empire roll was real good.. . Oh, here was a good bonus... It was $5 Martini night... woohoo.. . The staff was very friendly and it was easy to grab a seat.  I'm sure Monday's are slower, but still good to mention.. . Will go back again and likely update the review at that point as well.
