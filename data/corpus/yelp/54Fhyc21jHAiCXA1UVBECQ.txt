Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
As a carnviorous member of this Earth, it is seldom i go to a vegetable restaurant.  However, i really did enjoy my meal.. . As a carnivore, i must say, stay away from the fake meat.  It tastes like cardboard.  I ordered both chicken and beef to see if it tasted good.  The answer is no.. . The vegetables are all very fresh and cooked simply.  My favorite dish was the kale, it was both simple and elegant simultaneously.  The chili was also well seasoned, and i didn't miss not having beef or turkey in it.
