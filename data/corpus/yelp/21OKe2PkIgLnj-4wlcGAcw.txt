The nachos!!!  The nachos!!!  The nachos!!!. . I looove the nachos here...  Burger with the works is oh so good, too...  . . Not a fan of the breakfast burrito... but yes, get the nachos...  . . It's a nice place to catch up with friends over a nice warm plate of nachos and lattes!  :)  . . Not a lot of my friends like to come here with me since the idea of eating at an "organic, vegetarian" restaurant freaks them out...  I usually come here with my vegetarian friend - she enjoys this place as much as I do, but she moved to New York and so I don't get to enjoy the delicious nachos here as often as I'd love to.  But listen, you don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy this place, I am not a vegetarian and I actually really like it...  . So yes, give it a try!
