Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I waited in the infamous line.  Yes, I did!  Was it worth it?  Hmm.... Don't think so.  I was so pumped up to eat this famous hot dog that everyone raves about.  I even saw it on the food network.  I ate a chili dog and my friend ordered something with mushrooms and swiss.  First of all, Tommy's has better chili and my friends mushrooms were canned.  Yuk!  I just didn't feel the magic that everyone else is talking about.
