This place is absolutely fantastic. Its right down the street from the Beverly Center, so do your shopping and head on over! I love the decor. Very cluttered with wall art from over the many years of being in business and table tents for a little intimacy. But yet very romantic if you're on a date...makes for a great conversation starter. And of course all the garlic in the world must come thru here first. But it surprisingly, it doesnt reak of garlic so thats a good thing. . . I had the pleasure of having the Forty Clove Garlic Chicken...SUPERB. and the Garlic French Fries were fabulous! Hold the ketchup on these guys, you'll kill it otherwise. You should definitely stop by the this place when you're in LA. Its a must!
