I took my boy here for his birthday and it was nothing short of AMAZING!  . . We were there on a Tuesday night so it was pretty quiet, mostly business men discussing their golf game.  Our waiter was excellent, attentive but laid-back and the bubbly sommelier was able to recommend a delicious syrah that didn't break the bank (good thing since I was paying).  Excellent service through out the night, capped off with a free slice of prime chocolate cake to celebrate the happy occasion.. . The food was amazing! To start, we had the kobe beef sashimi, tableside caesar, and the corn and sea scallop chowder.  The sashimi came on a beautiful block of pink himalayan salt with a to-die-for truffle mayo and the hot chowder was poured over slices of sea scallop, instantly cooking them to the perfect tenderness.  The caesar...ehhh.  . . Onto the meat, my boy had the 35 day aged KC sirloin and I had the 28 day aged rib-eye; both cooked to perfection and delicious.  He declared it the best steak he ever had and thoroughly enjoyed the rest of my rib-eye the next day.  Not sure if the taste was due to the grass-fed free range or to the aging, but it was outstanding.  . . We ended with coffee and the lollipop tree.  I was hesitant to order it since it seemed gimmicky, plus the boy is a chocolate FIEND.  But in the end, we just had to see what the thing was and we were not disappointed.  The cheesecake is creamy, covered in different kinds of chocolate with a seriously sinful raspberry mousse.  GET IT!  Great coffee too, btw.  A true treat for the steak lover, even I had a great time :)
