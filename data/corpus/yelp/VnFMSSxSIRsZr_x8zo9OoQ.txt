Overrated, sure. The only thing on their menu worth waiting an hour in line for is their xiao long bao. Everything else, the rice, the noodles, the desserts...I've had better and cheaper. But their xiao long bao truly beats every other restaurant's out of the park. The meat filling is juicy and delicious and the outer wrapping is paper thin. I encourage everyone to try this place at least once!
