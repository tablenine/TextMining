As with others, I agree that Yamashiro's has the best view of LA and Hollywood.  Their sushi is not the best I've had but it's good.  This place is a good compromise for me and my husband since he doesn't care for sushi and they offer steak and other dinners.  It's not cheap so make sure you're ready for the bill when it comes.  It's been awhile since we've been there but I'd definitely like to go back soon.
