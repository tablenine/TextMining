Rating strictly based on the bakery, specifically the cupcakes.  Good, but not my favorite.  Would I eat them again, YES.  Would I drive there from OC to subdue my cravings, NO.  . . Its a fun little place with happy staff.  LA weirdo's are out and about so beware.  Not the dangerous ones, the fufu ones.
