I had a very nice brunch here with the parentals.  There are no prices on the special father's day brunch, so I thought "uh oh."  But it all ended up being around (I think a little less than) $25pp.  The menu had a normal assortment of "higher end" brunch options, with the requisite salads, benedicts, and griddle fare.  The food was quite good, and the service was attentive while not being intrusive.  The ambiance in the dining room was both simple and elegant (if a bit boring).  . . I also discovered that they have one of my favorite pinot noirs from Napa! It's very limited and thus, I enjoy any restaurant that has it on their wine list!  I look forward to coming back for dinner.  The dinner menu looks great by the way.  With lots of fish, kurobuta, and steak frites.  Yum yum.  Give. it. to. me.. . N.B. they have valet, but this is Culver City and parking is a cinch with the municipal garages.
