This place has it all... the food is great, the service is great the view is great!!!  I enjoyed the entire experience at Yamashiro.  I have only been there and would love to go back soon!. . After or before you sit down you can walk through there indoor or outdoor garden and it smells great and looks beautiful!. . The inside is just as amazing with there beautiful furniture and floors to the ceiling and lamps.  Talk about Feng Shui.. They have it all...
