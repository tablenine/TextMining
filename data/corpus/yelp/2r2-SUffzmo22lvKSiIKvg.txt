Their classic with pork broth is my favorite ramen in LA, with Santouka's "hot miso" a close second. The intensity of their meaty broth always sends my pork receptors into overload; and the crispy fried onions sprinkled on top is the perfect complement. Great on cold days, perfect when hung over. While their other dishes were tasty (crispy sesame chicken, pork soft-bun sandwiches), it's going to be the _pork_ ramen (not the chicken nor miso) that you'll remember. Don't understand the comparison to the flavorless broth at Asahi (or Ramenya, which is only slightly better); they must be compensating with the larger portions (unfortuntately, more is not better).
