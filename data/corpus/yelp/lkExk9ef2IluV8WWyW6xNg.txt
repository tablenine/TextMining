Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
At first sight I thought Taste was going to be some obnoxiously trendy, overly priced restaurant.  Luckily, I was absolutely wrong!  The atomosphere is cozy and intimate,  the wait staff is friendly and helpful and the food is absolutely amazinggggg.  I've been here multipile times with mutliple friends and we are always more than satisfied with the food.  I would definitely recommend trying the Cumin Spiced Pork Chops and the Bread Pudding.  Whether for a casual Sunday brunch, or a nice Friday night dinner, Taste is definitely one of my favs.
