Yumsville! I got a salad that was only so-so, but the really that's not the main show here, is it? The bread and pastry section is so vast I just picked a few items close to the register. I quite agree the guava cheese pastry is delicious. Not too sweet with a generous amount of guava. The cinnamon roll I got was dry and not particularly inspired, but that was no great tragedy considering my third purchase, a big fluffy challah bread. So delicious and fresh. For the bread, pastry and roll the total was less than $4. Amazing. I will definitely go back for more - and soon!
