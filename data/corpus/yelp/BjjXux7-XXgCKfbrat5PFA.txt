Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Everyone hypes the Chicken and Waffles, but I have yet to try the fried chicken. I usually get the Jeanne Jones Omelette with no cheese or little cheese with onions and tomatoes. It's really good and it comes with fries or a waffle. The waffle is great with syrup and jelly and the fries are great too. The thing that stands out most to me here is the Mac N' Cheese. It is probably the best I've had. . . The atmosphere is alright, I'm used to booth seating in cafes and Asians, but this is cool too. It's definitely different, and maybe even good in its own way.
