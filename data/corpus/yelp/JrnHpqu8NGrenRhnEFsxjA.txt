Okay, so this is my second time @ Loca Luna. My first visit was actually last summer for my cousin's bachelorette party. From what I can remember, the food was pretty decent and we had an okay time.. . However, my four stars are coming from the great time I had Friday night. A friend and I decided we wanted to hear some music and maybe dance after dinner on Fri night, then I remembered Loca Luna.. . No Cover, Valet Parking and Live Music &amp; a DJ. It was great. I think some people must be confused, because Loca Luna is definitely not a club, but it did have all the elements (liquor flowing, people dancing, great music). Â Oh yes, as Courtney C. said, there were definitley cute guys in the building ;). . The drinks are good also. Of course I ordered up a Mojito, but for some reason I wasn't feeling much of a buzz after I had finished my second one. So I asked the bartender (Jennifer) if she could suggest something a little stronger. Thats when she made me a Passion Fruit Caipirinha that knocked my socks off. After my second one, I was in the middle of the dance floor working up a sweat (and a hangover)!. . I'm planning on going back Wed for Ladies Night, where they have free Salsa lessons and the apps are 1/2 off.
