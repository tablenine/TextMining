Man, I just love pizza. I don't cake if it's east coast, west coast or Chicago style. But the NY style with the over-sized pie slices, San Tullos is amazing. They're tomato sauce is tasty with a touch of zing and they're delivery service is spot on. They sometimes can put you on hold for a couple of moments longer than other places - but let's hope it's because they are that busy! If you live in Wicker Park - Bucktown, this is your pizza place. And yeah, they have other things like salads and stuff, it's middle of the road, nothing you can't make at home.
