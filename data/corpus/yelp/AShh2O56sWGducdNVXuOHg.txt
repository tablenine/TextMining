Looks like it would be good from the outside as well as from the menu, but the food and service leave a lot to be desired.  My food was dry and lacked much taste.  To top it off, our waitress tried to double-dip on tips by charging me extra on my card after I had left her tip in cash.  I'd like to think it was a mistake, but finding an extra charge on my card was shady.
