Californian meets European cuisine. It's my favorite brunch place in Los Feliz!  You have to order at the counter and get your own table though,which, even on the weekends, is not that bad. And it's a little pricey (about $15-20 for breakfast) but other than that it deserves 5 stars.. I always spot celebs here too, just sayin'.... . My favorites: the "smoked salmon breakfast stack" (two potato pancakes with smoked salmon, crème fraîche, poached eggs and fruit salad on the side) and the banana/fruit/nutella crepes...yummmm
