Alright so let me give you the BAD: . . Go on a weekend and you'll easily wait an hour to find a table...lines out the door curling around the Director's Guild building. Miss your name being called and be prepared to be scratched off the list and hear "you are dead to me." The feeling is like a nightclub for pancakes and french toast. The host may even give you a time limit on your meal (rare, but happens). Couldn't help but feel they were trying to turnover our table as quickly as possible.. . OK, now the GOOD:. . You will have one of the best breakfast meals of your life. The pancakes and french toast are ridiculously, and beautifully, huge! They have blueberry and banana pancakes (two different dishes) that were delicious.  I also had the famous Chicago Charlies Scramble that included Italian sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell peppers, mozzarella cheese, garlic, basil, and lots of onions (with a side of garlic bread).. . They also have a great coffee press, which seemed very popular. . . Beyond the food, the blues music was great and they had two TV's playing sports...a must for weekends (Golf, Baseball, NBA on ABC).. . It was a lot like chilling in a southern city, eating a hearty and tasty breakfast, with some LA attitude thrown in at the door.. . Overall, I loved it very much. My advice for the long wait...grab a coffee across the street at the Coffee Bean and chill while you wait...just don't stray far or you will "be dead" to the host and get bumped. Another suggestion, go during the week and not face the wait...best of both worlds.
