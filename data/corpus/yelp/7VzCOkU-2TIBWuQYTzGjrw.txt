Not a Ruth Chris or Smith &amp; Wollensky style restaurant, but pretty good. Â I ordered the Bison Delmonico and was very impressed.. The only issue was the meat came warm and under cooked from what I requested. They quickly fixed the problem and bought me a drink. The pepper onion rings were great.
