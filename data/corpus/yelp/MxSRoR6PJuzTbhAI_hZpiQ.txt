Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Overhyped, so people easily get disappointed.  Their toppings and specialty dogs are delicious.  Nice and greasy.  The dirty kind of greasy.  There was grease and fat dripping from their ceiling fan.  Yummy.. . Worth the visit, but not if there's a 2 hour long wait.  Don't go on Friday nights.
