I was definitely not impressed.  The hibiscus punch tasted like prune juice, if you like that kind of drink.  The Duck Sausage Breakfast Burrito (duck confit, scrambled duck eggs, sweet potatoes, onions and peppers with a side of Tomatillo salsa, $15) was salty.  The sausage and shredded duck pieces were way too salty.  I liked the sweet potatoes inside the burrito.  It was definitely no worth $15.  The Ebelskivers (Stuffed pancakes with a side of breakfast sausage and maple syrup, $12) was good. The pancakes are mini puff balls stuffed with either strawberry jam, apricot jam, pumpkin butter... I personally didn't like the strawberry jam that was inside the pancakes.   I also didn't really like how the outside was over cooked.  It was not burnt, but brown and crispy.  The inside was fluffy and eggy which was good.  My sausage didn't have any flavor.  The French style quiche ($10)  was also nothing special  The crust was crispy like a pie crust and the inside was on the bland side.  The tomatoes brought out the flavor.  The mushroom mac &amp; cheese was good.  It was a tad on the watery side but the flavors were good.  The cheese was nice and creamy.  The beignet w hot chocolate was not bad.  The hot chocolate sauce came in a mini mug w/ a marshmallow.  There was also a creamy sauce that looked like it had ground espresso beans.  I didn't find the beignet to be amazing.  It was just ok.   Even though the mac and cheese was good, I wouldn't come all the way here just for that.. . 3 brunch entrees, mac and cheese, iced tea, hibiscus punch, lemonade, beignet for $75 excluding tip.  didn't think it was worth it.  Plus the service was WAY too slow.
