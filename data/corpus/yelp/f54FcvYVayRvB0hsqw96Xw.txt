I was not impressed with Uncommon Ground which was disappointing as I have heard so many great things about it. I visited them for a Sunday morning brunch. I ordered the House Made Chorizo Chilaquiles which was very bland and seemed to be missing any Chorizo flavor.  The coffee was fine and the service was just alright.  . . I might try them again for dinner or just to hang out but will not be back for breakfast as there are too many other great choices in the area.
