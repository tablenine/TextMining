I love this place. I've been going since I was a 19 or 20 year old intern that was forced to use my fake ID to pick up food for my co-workers. I was scared the first time I went to the Santa Monica one because I didn't know if they would take my ID... but it was definitely worth it. I'm a regular now, at the Culver City location (because it's a bigger space and next to my apt).. . I almost always get the Father's Office Burger. It's delicious - the dry-aged angus beef is so juicy and tender. The bun could be better prepared. But the main problem is that they don't allow substitutions or modifications. I'd recommend pairing this with either regular fries or sweet potato fries. FYI, they don't serve ketchup, which is a big problem for most, but not for me. I'm a fan of their mayo dipping sauce. I'd also recommend their braised short ribs (very tender).. . To go along with an amazing burger, they also have an amazing beer selection. Craft brewed beers from across the country, I was so happy once I started liking beer. If you don't know beer, they are always willing to help you pair the beer with your food. With the burger, I'd recommend pairing with the Alesmith Anvil ESB Ale. Other beers I am a fan of here: Russian River Pliny the Elder, Lost Coast Great White, and the light drinkers (you know who you are) LOVE the Lindemans PÃªche Lambic.... its very fruity.. . Biggest problem at both locations (although Culver City is much bigger) is finding a table to eat at. DO not try to go in big groups (like more than 8) if you want to all sit together.
