Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Wow.. First I must say that I'm from St. Louis (go cards!) and had only visited the most talked about (in St. Louis) pizzerias in Chicago: Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, and Due.  . . My experience was near-perfect, we parked on the street, walked in, were pleasantly greeted and then were ushered to our seats.  Service was great and the pizza was even better.  While I will concede that the 35 minute wait time seems like an eternity, that comes with the deep-dish territory.. . My Advice:. -If you're in Chicago and are in search for some fantastic pizza go to Lou Malnati's.  Don't bother with ordering the thin crust, that is St. Louis' specialty, Imo's is thin crust pizza.. -Come hungry even the most ravenous of appetites will struggle to make it past two heaping slices.. -Go for the Buttercrust.
