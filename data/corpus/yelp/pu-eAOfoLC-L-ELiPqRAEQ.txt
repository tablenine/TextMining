My husband and I stopped here for dinner while running errands on a Wed. night.  We were seated immediately and as soon as we sat down had menus, water, and bread.  . . We each started with a glass of wine.  I started with their South African Chenin Blanc and my husband got a glass of their Spanish red.  Actually, his only complaint about the meal is that he wished he'd gone with a white wine.  . . We ended up ordering the Escargot, Black Bean Cakes, and Pumpkin Ravioli.  Wow.  The Escargot was incredible.  The cream sauce that it came with was inspired.  After eating that dish, my husband said that he would come back just for that sauce.  Then we started in on the Black Bean Cakes.  They were so great.  The spicy chipotle mayo used on those was perfect.  Just spicy enough for my husband's brave palette, but still softened enough for me to enjoy.  The avocado between the two cakes is a nice touch and is a great addition of texture.  The Pumpkin Ravioli was awesome.  It comes with a brown butter sauce that is to die for.  We were actually planning on ordering a dessert to share until we tried this ravioli.  It was really, really rich and the pumpkin added a delightful sweetness.  We will definetely be coming back here to try some more of their menu.
