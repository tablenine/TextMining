I just had VEGGIE ROYAL BURGER today.. It was one of the best veggie burger I ever had before!. . Yes, I love Mac Daddy &amp; Cheese, and other stuff that other people writes. Also don't try their steak (dinner dishes). It's disappointed.. . But today, I mainly talk about VEGGIE ROYAL BURGER and EGG IN THE HOLE.. . Veggie Royal Burger doesn't have those fake vegetable patty. It had grilled onion, boiled tomatoes and cabbage with dressing. The grilled onion dominated the taste.. Personally, I LOOOVE sweet grilled onion. I love eating left over grilled onion after finished eating steak. I even picked my friends left over grilled onion on their steak dishes. So that may be why I love Veggie Royal Burger. Unlike other veggie burger, thanks to this onion, it brought me I-ate-meat fullness.. . And EGG IN THE HOLE. I just loved that they put sunny-face down egg in the middle of bread (you can choose the type of bread). I don't know why but I just love that concept.. . By using knife and folk, when I just love dipping bread into egg and eat it. It gives me the sense of luxury and richness. . . Unfortunately, I've never been to Fred 62 in the morning. And I'll never intend to go there in the morning. And I only come to Fred 62 because after midnight. But EGG IN THE HOLE is one of my breakfast recommendation at Fred 62.
