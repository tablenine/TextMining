I was thinking, what the hype about? Why did my friend write this address on a sticky note and post it on my fridge? Hainan Chicken... That's why! Wow. This place was worth the trip. . How do they make that rice with the chicken? Butter and Garlic? The entire dish is absolutely delicious! Chicken so tender! Those three little sauces were just perfect. I have to go baaaack!
