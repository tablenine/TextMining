Decided to come back here one more time (because I told my girlfriend how good this place was, but it was pricey for the amount of food you get).. . Man am I glad I came back!!!. . My sandwich increased by 50%. I couldn't believe it. it was huge and I was so full after eating it. When paying at the register, I noticed someone ordered the same sandwich (#19) and their sandwich was much smaller than mine.. . Must have been my lucky day. I'm a fan of #19 as long as it comes out big!
