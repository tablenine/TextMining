When the truck showed up at the 4100 bar in Silverlake, I figured it was the perfect time to finally see what all the hype is about, since the bar is maybe a mile or two away from my house. I waited in line with a buddy (who is a chef) for over an hour. When I finally ordered, I figure I would order everything they offered, including stuff on the secret menu. I tried everything on the main menu, and the kim-chee quesadilla, but they didn't have any of the sliders. It's sad to say that the quesadilla was the best thing they served. It's not that the tacos or burritos in all the meats offered was awful, but they just didn't cut it. The only thing making them appetizing was the coleslaw thing they put on top of all their tacos and burritos. Couple that with the absurd waiting time, as well as the exorbitant pricing for what you get, the truck doesn't deserve any love when it comes to the taste quality. But, it's not so bad if you want to try something new. I guess the appeal of waiting in line at random places for "Koreanexican" food is where the true significance of the kogi comes into play.
