Margarita Heaven!. I love getting a pre-night start at this little spot. I admire its decor and the fact that it is not too conceited crowd wise. I wish it did better with music, but their food and drinks are top notch. Not a great place to go during the later hours, but great for when the sun is starting to set. I recommend the Highland Margarita pitcher.
