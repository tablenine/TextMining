Category: Burgers
just a quick one to say: this place rocks, especially on a game night (TVs inside). The food is incredible and is served at incredible prices - $6 for a 1/4 chicken, black beans, belgian fries!! I'm happy to see this place has more stars than Umami Burger - I would say Oinkster out-umamis Umami any day of the week. Do be prepared for a line, but it moves very quickly, and the service is super-friendly. they also have $4 draft beers (good ones) and a 20% discount (on beer too) for KCRW members!
