This is a downtown jewel. It's become one of my favorite dinner spots in LA. Â There's such good food and the high ceilings and white walls with pillars makes it seem like heaven in there.. . The little "deli" before the restaurant is quaint and charming. There are such good pastries and sweets they sell (their pistachio and strawberry macarons are amazing!) and very good customer service. . . Their fettuccine belmondo is delicious! You could totally taste how fresh the pasta was and the simple, light ingredients of cherry tomatoes, garlic, arugula, extra virgin olive oil &amp; Reggiano parmesan was perfect. I enjoyed every bite.. . Their roasted chicken is also very good. Well seasoned and the perfect moisture.. . Their chicken parmesan is also good. A little on the salty side for my palate, but nonetheless very good. The tomato sauce was very fresh- I could tell they used fresh ingredients. . . I totally recommend this place. It's a little loud, so not necessarily the best place for a date, but good to meet up with friends!
