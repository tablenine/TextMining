Absolutely, hands down one of the best values for your buck in terms of sushi!!!  And I eats me a lot...A LOT...of fishies so I knows what I'm talkin' 'bout here people.. . For about $100 for 2 people we had:. 1 order of Toro Sushi. 1 order of the Salmon Sushi. 2 orders of the special Blue Fin Tuna Sushi. 1 order of the spicy Tuna with Crispy Rice. 1 order of the Seared Albacore with Crispy Onions. 1 order of Blue Crab Roll. 1 order of the Yellow Tail with Jalepenos. 1 BOTTLE of cold sake, Jiz (something or other...I just like saying "we're drinking JIZ! lol...found it funny...I'm juvenile like that) . 1 LARGE bottle of Asahi. ...and two oranges at the end as a dessert!!. . And I can't speak ONE bad word about ANYTHING we had!!  It was phenomenal.  The Blue Fin was even BETTER than the Toro...one of the chefs recommended it and we got more.  I'd suggest asking them which of the specials they recommend that day...you can't go wrong. . . We walked right in sporting casual attire (I had on flip flops!) around 6pm on a Wednesday and had NO problem getting seated at the sushi bar (our chef's name was Smitti...we liked him!!).  When we left around 7-7:30 the place was beginning to get a tad loud and filled up.. . Valet is available...good for a small group...don't have to dress up but you can if ya want...it won't set you back like Sushi Roku and is just as good if not BETTER (rolls around $4-12, sushi around the same)...the service is GREAT...the fish FRESH...the sake, soju, beer selection: LARGE.. . Can't go wrong enjoying a meal here...you just can't. :)
