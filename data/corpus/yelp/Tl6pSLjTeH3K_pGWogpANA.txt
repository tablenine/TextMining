Love the classic feel to this place.  Great burger.  They serve you your drink in paper cones and use a really really really old register.  it can be a bit tricky though when it's crowded because there are no hostesses and no lines really ... you just kind of have to know who got there first and be polite about sitting down when it's your turn.  The burger is good, but I give this place 4 stars purely for the classic authentic feel of it.
