We had to check this place out before Food Network aired their good review! It's like stepping back to the early 80's for me since that's as far back as I remember. Great table service deli/resturant! I was pleasantly surprised at their quality meats, breads, homemade pickles, chili, and even the cheeses! You can really taste the difference by paying just a little more for this place but it's well worth it. The service is a little tired. They look tired and they are ho-hum but it's alright, I'd be tired too if I had to be a waitress at a busy-busy place.
