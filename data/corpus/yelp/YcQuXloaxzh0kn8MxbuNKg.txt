I would have given this another star but something really bothered me. As I was at the register about to pay, another customer asked the Manager, "When will the other half of my party be seated?" He told her that it would be 20 minutes. She said, "But you told me that 20 minutes ago." He explained it was really busy -you could see he was losing his patience. Now, my back was to her so I'm not sure what she did exactly but I think she got upset and just went back to her table. All of the sudden, he told her and her entire party to leave. I was kind of offended by that. It just seemed like a really extreme reaction to a customer complaint. Couldn't he have perhaps offered a free appetizer or something in the name of customer service? That really left a mark with me. The food was good enough, and they did get us a table in about 20 min despite the crowds. Was it awesome enough food to go back. Hmmm, it was OK. Just as good as other places I've been to. I'm just not sure I would be back based on principle, given how easily the manager was upset and the spectacle he created when he kicked those people out. They left quietly and without further "drama" and I remember the woman involved outside with her family saying, "I can't believe that just happened." The situation has left such an impression, I felt the need to vent it here. Hopefully, he will learn from his quick temper and think of a more diplomatic way to handle conflict the next time around.
