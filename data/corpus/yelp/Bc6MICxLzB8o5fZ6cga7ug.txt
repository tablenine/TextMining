Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
Great spot to hang out with your friends.  Good wait staff.  Unfortunately, the food looked better than it actually tasted.. . I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato dipping sauce (I love grilled cheese).  I think something was missing....it wasn't very flavorful and the bread was a bit overtoasted.  The tomato sauce didn't taste very...tasty.   . . Two of my friends ordered the crabcake benedict.  While the presentation was great, they both commented that it tasted a bit bland.. . As for parking:  You can park on the street or pay for valet parking (around $4.50).
