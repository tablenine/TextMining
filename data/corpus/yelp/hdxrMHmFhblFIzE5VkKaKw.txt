I'm not a vegan.  I do like to eat healthy, but I also love yummy food.  That's why I love this place!  You can splurge without feeling guilty.  The food is delicious, especially the house salad dressing.  The thing that annoys me is they keep changing their menu, and cutting my favorite menu items.  They seem to redecorate a lot, too, which is unnecessary.  The decor is (generally) bright and somewhat industrial.  The waiters are friendly enough.  I was a little taken aback when I found a worm on my salad, and my waitress's only response was:  "That's what happens when you have organic food.". . If you happen to be there on a night when they have banana cream pie, order it with chocolate syrup.  YUM!
