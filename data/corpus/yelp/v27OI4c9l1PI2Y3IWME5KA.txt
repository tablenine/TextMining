from the outside.. i've always thought.. I COULD NEVER AFFORD TO EAT THERE.. but after hearing all the 50% off happy hours from 5-10 pm everyday.. i gave it a try.. boy i'd never think id be paying those prices for that place. . walked in and mmm aroma of sushi!! the decor was like.. wow this is a hipster's place.. its like a mix of.. nice/hipster.. you can definately imagine students being there. . i think the quality beats all the other 50% off sushi competitors in the westwood village area! they aren't as skimpy! each roll runs about 6-7 bucks.. 5 pieces sashimi for around 5 bucks.. and its not all small pieces like it was a ami's or mura's (which closed down). . best sushi in the ucla area in my opinion.. but honestly service is NOT GREAT.. we were barely attended to.. and the waiter looked like he could care less.. but what do you expect ..
