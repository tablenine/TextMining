Such a tantalizing array of flavors and visual stimuli! When I am given the opportunity to grill my own meat I feel as though I am in kitchen stadium! The ingredients are fresh and the condiments are abundant! The meat must be marinated in Snuggle over night! This is the only valid answer I can come up with to the question "how is your meat so soft"? Often times I feel as though I am Kim Jung il with the way I am treated at this establishment! If I was a contestant in a buzz in game show I would lose! I only had to push the magic button twice, and both time were to satisfy the groups alcoholic tendencies for the night. One of the short ribs were so long and full of white marbling that it reminded me of the flying white dog from the never ending story! Speaking of never ending story the meat seemed to never end their mission of jumping on the grill! It is not very hard to be a pessimist at this establishment either  as our shot glasses were always full!  Last but not least the two young ladies working the front booth make the women in the maxim magazines look like women in the national geographic magazine. Like Arnold said... I'll be back!
