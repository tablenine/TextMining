Went to this place after a friend saw it on the Food Network Chanel. We were prepared to go to a total dive, but oh did we get so much more!!!. For being out in Eagle Rock on a Tuesday night at 8pm I thought it would be dead, it was packed with Lakers fans and people who know how to eat alike.. I CANNOT GIVE THIS PLACE ENOUGH STARS, there menu is great. I ordered the Burger (my area of expertice)and it was an exceptional burger. My friends ordered the Pastrami sandwhich and the Pulled Pork sandwhich. Needless to say everyone was pleased!!! We ordered the fries that came with the most amazing garlic aoli!!They had a bunch of fun self serve dipping sauces. Chipotle Ketchup., Honyey BBQ, spicy mustard, the works:). P.S. YOU CAN ALSO GET BEER:). The waitstaff was fun and cheery, even though it was busy. When I went back up to get dessert for the ladies the waiter came and took my order so I didnt have to stand in the long line all over again. Very sweet. PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY CUPCAKES = heaven.... albnsolutely perfect!! Brought one home for the boy, he loved me for it:). I definatly recomend trying this place:) Its fun, laid back, and some good greasy food:)
