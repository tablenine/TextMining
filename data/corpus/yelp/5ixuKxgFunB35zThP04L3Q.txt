OMG - I love this place.  I think everything about it is amazing..I love the ambiance, the views, the food..everything!. . I had the vegetable tempura which was awesome and my husband had the beef terryaki..both of us loved our selections  This place is very romantic and I'd recommend it for a first date.  . . Cameron Diaz was dining next to us when we were there..which made it even more interesting.
