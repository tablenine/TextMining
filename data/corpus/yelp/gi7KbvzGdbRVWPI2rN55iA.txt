Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Canters may have been awesome in the 50's but it's not so awesome anymore. I used to come here in high school since it was open 24 hours and less boring than Denny's or IHOP.. . My gfs and I came here the other day for dinner and we were excited about the endless selection of food. You can have anything from hamburgers to matzo ball soup to chicken pita.. They have everything.. . The service was slow, the food was mediocre (my beef has looked like a brick and tasted like cardboard, the broth for the matzo ball soup was too salty, etc.) and it was just disappointing. The baked goods are not too bad but some are overcooked and dry.. . This place used to be good but these days, I prefer Greenblatt's on Sunset over Canter's any day.
