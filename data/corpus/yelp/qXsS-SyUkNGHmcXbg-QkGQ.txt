It's amazing to see a full menu of Chinese food where I can eat anything I want. It's even more amazing that it's a 60 second drive from my apartment.  . . Everything was really flavorful, but I would caution against getting too many dishes with a sweet sauce in one meal.  The stuffed zucchini appetizer is excellent.  The mock meat dish I had didn't taste or look like the "real" version I've had in the past, but I think it's good that they're not trying too hard to force the veggie version to be identical. Service was very nice as well.. . It scared me how empty the place was. I've been told not to get too attached to Atlanta restaurants.  If Green Sprout closes, I'll be very sad. So go there!
