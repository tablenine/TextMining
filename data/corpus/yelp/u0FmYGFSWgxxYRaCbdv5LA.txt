Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
There are 2 things that are keeping me away from MILK; their prices and the fact that I'm trying to keep my girlish figure. . . My intentions were good; buy something for my mom and nothing for myself but with the bubbly staff and all those dessert tempting me, I gave in. I bought the Blue Velvet (of course) which was good, but what really got me was the ice cream. The guy behind the counter offered me 3 types of ice cream to try, there were:. Chocolate- "Mmmmm". Honey comb- "That's very good". Banana Dulce De Leche- "Oh...my...god!". . I was told that they make all of their ice cream right in the store and it was probably the best I've had. I just really, really wish that the parking situation was better and and if they dropped the prices on their desserts. Ahh well, one can dream..
