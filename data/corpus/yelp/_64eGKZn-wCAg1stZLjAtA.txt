I had to physically be carried out of this place like a sack of potatoes!. I'm definitely coming back and encourage any sushi/drinking lover to celebrate their birthday here. It's especially designed for large parties and crazies who like to dance on chairs. 5 stars! Beware you may pass out from all the sake bombs but you will get SLOSHED.
