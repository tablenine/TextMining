Was just there over the weekend and was reminded what a cute, quaint cozy place this is. Coffee is just how you want it to be. Pancakes are DELICIOUS. I ordered the salmon hash and it was just okay. My bf had the fish and grits which was decent as well but we've had better. The issue is that the service isn't that great and you are definitely going to have to wait. I would say go early and have the pancakes!
