I went here for lunch one Sunday b/c I wanted to try the noodles. Big fan of Japanese noodles and always like the fancy ones better than my home-cooked ramen or udon. I tried the pork belly appetizer. It was pretty tasted but a tad salty. For my entree, I had the shoyu ramen that also had pork belly. The noodles were really good but I though the broth and the pork belly, again, was really salty. I don't know if it was off that day or if my taste buds were extra sensitive to salt or what... but I really would have to say that the food was mediocre. I think it is a similar concept to Urban Belly and I thought that it just wasn't as good. I probably wouldn't go back for lunch but would still love to try the dinner menu as I have heard it is wonderful.
