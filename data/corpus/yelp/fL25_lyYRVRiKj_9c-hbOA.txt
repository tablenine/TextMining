My place of work recently moved but this was THE place before the move. . . Sooo amazing. My friend and I would buy sugar cookies by the dozen just for ourselves. The pizzas and paninis take a bit but are so well worth the wait.. . Also, the star here is their veggie chili. My work partner and I never missed a day on this. We'd call right at 10:02 every morning because we realized it was at this time that they had a good idea of what their soup would be for the day. If they had veggie chili we'd order in bulk. . . It got to the point where we'd actually lie to office people and tell them that they did not have veggie chili on certain days because so many people from the office would order that they'd run out. The soup nazi has nothing on Letizia's.. . Their website says it all... . http://superyummy.com. . . PS- Get their ice cream... it's also fabulous and all natural...but try not to drip any in your co-workers car on the way back to work... they will be mad at you.
