Restaurant: SinBala Restaurant

Sinbala is really nothing special, but it's GOOD. They are famous for their sausage rice, but I'm not a huge fan, though I am totally intrigued by the sweet selections (sausage with chocolate?? What??). My favorite item on the menu is the Spicy Beef Noodle - very well-done and flavorful. And of course, shaved ice with brown sugar syrup. . . I would skip the boba drinks here. Definitely not the stars.
