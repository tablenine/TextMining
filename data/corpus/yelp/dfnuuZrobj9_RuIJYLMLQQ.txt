Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
After living in Japan for five years, this place is the closest I've been able to find great ramen that doesn't cost me a thousand dollar plane ticket!  My ramen has been perfect every time, and the waitresses are really friendly.  They take cash only for orders under $20, and they have an ATM inside.  The actual restaurant is pretty small, so it's not a great place for a large group of people.  It's clean though, and the food arrives promptly and the food temperature is perfect.  Every time I've been I order up on the specials - I started at 7 and last time I had a 4.  The food is delicious.  :)
