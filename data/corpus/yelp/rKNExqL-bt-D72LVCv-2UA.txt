I used to go here regularly just cause I lived so close by.  Then the food took a turn for the WORSE.  But still it was cheap to pick up a bowl of pho to go now &amp; then.. . But when I went to pick up my order one day, the lady said our order wasn't ready. Then I noticed what looked like our order behind her &amp; politely asked about it.  She actually SCREAMed at me to get back and wait.  I was shocked and of course, that ORDER WAS OURS we found out when she called us back up.  My regret it actually paying for it and leaving, when i should of shoved it back at her.  . . When I complained to the managers they acted like it was no big deal and yelling at customers should be expected.  And THAT ended my relationship with Gingergrass.  From then on it was Pho Cafe all the way.
