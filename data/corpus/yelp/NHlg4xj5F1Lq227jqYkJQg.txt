Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I had dinner with one set of friends elsewhere and agreed to meet another group of old friends at Manna as they were finishing up.  On the way over, I must have made 20+ redials but couldn't get through to confirm whether they had bounced.  Where is everyone?!  So my friends drop me off in front of this hopping outdoor locale, and judging by the Lambda party-like clamor, base bumping from inside, I understood how my calls could have been drowned out.  Didn't recognize a single face -- my smiles were met with cold stares behind puffs of cigarette smoke or the patently b!^@hy head to toe glance-overs. Oookay!  I walk in and scan the area for my friends.  Nowhere in sight.  Crap!   I'm calling them, phone glued to the side of my head as I aimlessly did, I kid you not, 6 laps around the "outdoor" bbq grill restaurant garnering more stares.  Awesome!  I wanted to cry and now I reek of kalbi.  Finally, my friend (who had eaten with the Manna group, but left early to pick up another friend at LAX...confused yet?) called me back and over the phone, walked me through the step by step directions to finding their table:  "Go all the way to the back. The patio area. (Um, everything is in the patio, girl).  Do you see the host's desk at the entrance? Turn left. Take about 10 steps forward then take a right and go about 20 steps. Oh, what's that? You can't take a right? You don't see them? They're all the way in the back.  Okay, wait. Walk back to the front.  Turn left. Take FIVE steps forward, do you see the restrooms..."  Director's call: *and fade out* . . You get the idea...  . . This place is CRAZY and LOUD on the weekends, but from the looks of it, it is *the* place to eat and be seen if you're a current MTV gen junkie.
