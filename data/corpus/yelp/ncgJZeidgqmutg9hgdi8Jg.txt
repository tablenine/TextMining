Restaurant: Ciudad
Category: Latin American
Ciudad is one of my favorite dress up spots. This place does red meat well and drinks even better. . I love the lentil soup, the fresh fruit mojitos, the seasonal desserts that come with homemade marshmallows and whatever this beautiful woman in the kitchen is willing to throw at me. . . The menu is seasonal and the summertime comes with fresh watermelon juice. The empanadas are top notch, the soup is comforting, the parking is a little stressful but the live music on the weekends makes up for it. . . I took the ex here in a weak moment of rethinking the ex part. The room is very sexy and the music can send your soul into overdrive. Combine all of this with lick the plate good food, mint sugar and rum and what have you got? That's right. . Take a date here if you want to get frisky in the car on the way home. . . To my new friend, fellow Dem, my comrade in heavy heart and fellow freedom fighter: Let this review be an invitation to dinner, my treat.
