I'd only come for the cupcakes, so I'm not sure about the actual meals. They were delicious, though. I'd probably prefer Joan's just a little down the street, but Toast has a lot more variety. They had good frosting, and they're very soft, enough that they sort of melted in my hand -- I guess M&amp;M-Mars is going to come after them and enforce the junk food rules.
