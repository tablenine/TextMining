Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
My review is based on 3 trips to Taste, twice for dinner and once for brunch.. . The food on all three trips was good, but not great. It is flavorful but the quality of ingredients doesn't seem as high as I would expect from a place charging more than $20/plate. I'd give the food itself 4 stars on quality but since it's not cheap I'd give it 3 stars for value.. . I got the "bottomless" champagne at brunch but the pours were few and far between. I live within walking distance of this place and wanted to enjoy a leisurely and inebriated meal. Our food came out rather quickly, which normally isn't a bad thing, but we only got one glass of champagne before we started eating. After eating we sat and talked a while, got a couple more glasses and eventually left, stone cold sober. To their credit we weren't pressured to leave on that slow Sunday morning so we could have stayed longer, but asking for champagne refills long after your meal is gone feels tacky. I've had better brunch food for less and more generous champagne for less so for brunch this gets 2 stars.. . Like the other reviewers have said, the truffle oil mac n cheese is good, but I think the best thing I've had their is the fruit and cheese and plate. Bleu cheese plus dates? Yes please.. . I gave this place a shot because I got some groupons for it. When my groupons run out I don't think I will remain a regular.
