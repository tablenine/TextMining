One of the best meals I have had in the city of Chicago!!. . There late Latin lunch is a STEAL.   For $29. 95 you get a full sized appetizer, entree, dessert and two drinks!!!!  Orders need to be placed by 6:15pm for the deal to be honored but it is certainly worth the early dinner.. . The place was pretty empty early but I could see how it would be a hott place for an evening out.  They had a live musician and the staff was friendly and attractive.  The service was good but I don't think it matched the quality of the restaurant.  . . We started out with a complimentary bite-sized appetizer that was a mouth- watering.   It definitely got me excited for the meal to come.  I stuck with the red sangria and it was a lot stronger than expected, just the way I like it.  The pineapple sangria was good but the pomegranate was way too sweet.  . . For the appetizer, we all ordered ceviches.  I got the shrimp and scallop ceviche and it was amazing.  It was cool and refreshing and the citrus juices and avocado gave it almost a guacamole taste.  For the main course we all got the Pork Cubano dish and it was AMAZING.  The pork was soo tender and the plantains mixed with the rice and orange sauce made it a unique dish.  For dessert we got the Cuatro Chocolates dessert and while it was a chocolate lover's dream dessert, it was way to much after a few bites.  The Kaluha milkshake type drink on the side was a great touch.. . Overall, the meal was one of the most memorable that I have had in a while and I look forward to going back, trying the various Latin tapas they offer and enjoying the nightlife of the restaurant.
