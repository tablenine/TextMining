Restaurant: Elements Caf√©
Category: American (New)
Elements is quite literally one of probably three truly worthwhile restaurants in Pasadena, and the only can-be-under-$20/head venue. Ingredients are incredibly fresh and seasonal; preparations are creative and modern. The love is very evident and much appreciated. Sure, things aren't totally perfect, but I can't possibly ask for more for the price.. . I really wish they'd get a bigger place and start serving dinner again.
