i love this place.  it's my stand-by "let's meet for breakfast place."   honestly, everything is delicious... from granola, to hot cereal, coffee cake, muffins, frittatas, and salads, i have never been disappointed.  and i love the big, simple, white coffee mugs.. . the ONLY thing that keeps it as 4 stars is that although the waitstaff and management are cool people, the service is so slow and careless.  i've waited over twenty minutes for a coffee or water refill.  not cool.. . nonetheless i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this charming locale to anyone who is passionate about breakfast and quality food.  . . you can't lose here with the food and atmosphere.  just bring your patience.
