Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
O-VER-RATED. got here right at noon on a weekday, so we didn't have to wait as long as expected. ordered the martha stewart dog, a guadalajara dog, a slaw dog and chili cheese fries. wasn't a huge fan of their chili, and was kind of surprised by how skinny their hot dogs are. lots of bread with each bite. pink's is an LA institution, and i'm glad i tried it, but i've definitely experienced better! tally a few extra points for having a nice outdoor seating area.
