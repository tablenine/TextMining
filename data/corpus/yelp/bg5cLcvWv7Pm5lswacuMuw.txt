Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
We went to the restaurant on a Sat Night. The hostess was very snobby. She told us to wait even though we had a reservation and all our parties were there. I mean c'mon, it was      only 7 pm. She didn't even told us about the waiting area and a group of us just stand there stupidly blocking the entrance. The service was slow, the food was nothing to write home about. All the tables were cramp together, you are literally elbow to elbow with other diners. you know its really bad when even the waiter has a hard time getting to food to you. The three "geisha" were only some Asian girls in Geisha costumes. They didn't even try to look like Geisha,  one was wearing Hoochi hoop earrings. There was a ridiculous "cake cutting fee" of $25 dollars. the drinks were bad and overpriced...They misses two of our rolls and the waitress was unfriendly and thought we were cheating her, good thing that i took a picture of the food. Will never go back again.
