Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
The broth at orochon is decent, but was a little bit salty. The Cha Sui Bao slice was really tender and nice. But I have to say that the noodles could have been of better quality. With ramen, I think that broth is much more important than the actual noodles, but the quality of the noodles was a little distracting. Overall its a decent place for late night eating if daikokuya was too busy or closed.
