Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
3.5. . Granted, this isn't the best din tai fung i've ever had. or best dumplings ever. you have to love that atmosphere. fast paced. always busy.. . we try to stop here when we head down or up from LA/SD..i remember one time we went, we had to make our order before we sat down and could not make any changes after.. . The regular xiaolung bao. crab one. chicken soup. and an order of the sung gao for dessert. and i'm good to go!. . the fried rice is good too. can't wait to go back
