Lovely, foldable slices of margherita pizza (Thursday special) for $4?  I was satisfied and did not feel like I was being ripped off; it was enough food to fill me up &amp; it was tasty to boot.. . I had a bite of the boyfriend's mac &amp; cheese, which funnily enough, did not appear to contain cheese.  . . The place was pretty clean for an establishment where you bus your own table, and the women's bathroom was very clean.  Maybe that had something to do with the creepy sign they have up telling you to think twice before you tag the bathroom as they are watching you.  . . Oh, and ordering a beer takes your mind off the negligible wait for your slice.
