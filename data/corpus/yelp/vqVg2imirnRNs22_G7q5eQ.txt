Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
I'm not into swanky trendy LA places but my friends wanted to try this place so we went here for a girls night out.. . The restaurant is surprisingly super small.  There's an outside patio, but it was like 90 degrees yesterday, so no thanks.  Our server was the nicest, friendliest, overly-outgoing waitress ever.  Took her 5 mins to describe the specials in its entirety, hand gestures and all.  We shared a truffle mac and cheese and I ordered the kobe beef cheeseburger fully loaded (white cheddar, bacon, avocado, grilled onions and mushrooms).  The mac and cheese was amazing.  It tasted like smoked gouda and I loved how the cheese was so gooey that it stretched from the dish to my plate.  The burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had!  It was HUGE!  I couldn't fit that in my mouth (insert pervert comment here).  The patty was perfectly cooked, pink on the inside and well-seasoned.  They don't mess around with the avocado either, there had to have been at least 8 slices in there.  The pomme frites were awesome, I love seasoned fries!. . Don't get the caramel creme brulee.  It tasted like warm melted pudding.  The waitress saw the look of disgust on my face and offered to bring a different creme brulee because apparently the caramel makes the custard watery.  By that time I was so stuffed that I told her it's no big deal.  Will definitely come back here to try their brunch, I hear they serve nutella!. . p.s. no need to valet, there's meter parking everywhere on the street
