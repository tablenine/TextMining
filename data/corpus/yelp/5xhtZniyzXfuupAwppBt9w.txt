Ah, the focus of my love-hate in Park Slope. . . Let's start with the Love. Firstly, the summer and fall salad with fresh local wonderful vegetables is miraculous, with long ribbons of perfectly sliced zucchini and heirloom tomatoes. The carpaccio is quality and the malfati has a brown butter-sage finish that's as good as I've had anywhere. The rabbit is quality, a close second to my favorite lagomorph-on-polenta dish on this street. You will not go wrong with the food and wine here. . . Let's move on to the Hate. Firstly, I have yet to experience anything like kindness, graciousness, or warmth from the hostess. She either hates me, my husband, or her job. Not a great way to welcome people who are going to spend money in your establishment! Second, your host(ess) will encourage you to wait in the wine bar -- which is great, though feels contrived. (Ask to be seated there if there's room. The ambiance is a little less strange down there and your wait may be less.) Thirdly, no reservations. A difficult point of navigation; this fine food establishment has lost me to its competitors a number of times because I enjoy reliability in my ability to dine with friends and family at a reasonable hour without waiting forever. In the cold. Standing (when there's a lack of seating at the wine bar). I want to lavish my love and credit cards upon you, o AlDi! Why do you mock me so?. . Of course, I will return. The food draws me in. But the waiting game and welcome wagon fight me every time. I fear I will soon tire of both and stick to friendlier skies.
