I like it, I love it I want more of it.  I wish I could convince all my friends that decapitating mud bugs is not cruel or unusual punishment.  The crawfish comes boiled in a bag and you pick your condiments....Please pick the whole shebang but watch the spicyness.  I always order crawfish, shrimp and corn....3 corns for me please....when you go you'll know why I order 3 for me.  My friends are partial to the sausage but I don't eat red meat so there goes that but I hear it is fabulous.  Oh yeah don't forget to get a beer...it's just not the same without it.
