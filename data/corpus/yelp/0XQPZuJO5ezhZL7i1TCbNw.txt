Restaurant: Cameli&#39;s Gourmet Pizza Joint
Category: Pizza
Was in the n'hood and couldn't pass up another round of Cameli's.  Ordered 2 "big" slices which arrived at my table fresh and hot.  Favorite aspects are cripsy crust and delicious tomato sauce!  Yum.  Again, just the right amount of cheese to sauce to crust.  I am quickly becoming a big fan of this place when in the mood for "pizza by the slice".
