Restaurant: Fat Matt&#39;s Rib Shack
Category: Barbeque
Didn't have to wait in line (went around 2 p.m.). Ordered the 3 main things on the menu. Ribs, chicken, and pork sandwiches. The food came out approximately 2 minutes after ordering. . The ribs and chicken meat were juicy and fell right off the bones. The pork sandwich was really good too. Comes with white bread and plenty of sauce.
