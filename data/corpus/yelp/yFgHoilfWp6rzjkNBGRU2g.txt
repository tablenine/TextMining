BOOOOOO!!!! I am so disappointed! As you can see in the pictures I've uploaded that I have made 2 attempts to investigate the reason for this Kogi phenomenon... needless to say I have failed... TWICE!. . I got so excited when I found out Kogi was making its appearance in my neighborhood, so I made my way there 15 minutes before its scheduled 10pm arrival.  We pulled up and much to my dismay, already there were a minimum of what looked mostly like high school and college kids awaiting Kogi's arrival. Of course, since my time actually is of some value, I decided to postpone my Kogi journey to the following day where its scheduled 12pm arrival at market lofts on 9th street in downtown may be a much likely success since I work closeby.  . . So the day finally arrived, and I got really psyched about getting one step closer to getting my hands on those highly anticipated Kogi tacos.  15 minutes before its scheduled 12pm arrival, I made the almost 7 block pilgrimage from my office to the market loft.... by foot!!!  . . At last, I finally arrived only to wait another fifteen minutes because Kogi was late, not to mention that it would be another 30 minutes because the food needed to be prepped and cooked, and another who knows how long of a wait for the line to move along as lunch gets served!!!  WTF?  . . So my point is this, if you have the time to wait over an hour to pay for overly priced underportioned korean bbq tacos, be my guest!!!  But if you're like me where your time is of value, please spare yourself of some respect and not feed into this overrated phenomenon.
