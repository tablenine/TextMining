Love, Love, love it! From the moment you walk up to the restaurant and see the words LOUIE on the building you know something is to come from something that welcoming. We came on a spontaneous luncheon detouring from the usual Pasadena restaurants and heading downtown. There was about a 10 min wait no worries head to the bar and enjoy some libations in no time at all we were seated near the window which was cool to be able to check out the inside and out during lunch. Service was speedy, We had salads and loved them especially with the bread at the table. Love the little special touches like tap water inside these antique looking jugs. Next time will try the delicious little grilled cheese croquet we saw looking so yummy in the take out.
