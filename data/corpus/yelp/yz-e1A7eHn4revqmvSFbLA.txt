I USED to love this place for happy hour. Key words - USED TO. The fries here used to be AMAZING, perfectly crispy and soft, but now it's just over fried and you feel gross after. The drinks are still good, so that's a plus, but the fries are what I used to go there for, so it was disappointing. The mac and cheese this time was too salty, before they used to be delicious. Also, the shrimp cocktail is good, I just wish it had a few more shrimp in it. The carne asada pizza is delicious! That's more than worth it. The menu itself is quite pricey if you eat there during normal hours. Personally, I don't think it's worth it. I wouldn't go back to this place, which is unfortunate because I used to like this place a lot.
