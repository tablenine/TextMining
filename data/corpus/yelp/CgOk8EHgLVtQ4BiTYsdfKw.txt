Sorry fellas, this place gets worse every time I go.  The first time I went I woulda given it a 4 star because I had their steak.  The second time I woulda given it a 3 star because I had some good pasta.  The most recent time completely ruined it for me.  I asked which salad was most recommended and I think it was their specialty salad.  IT WAS GROSS.  . . Have you ever ordered a 2-item combo at Panda Express, and some of the items spill over the other section, like the rice mixing with chow mein?  Or rice sticking onto your orange chicken.  Or if you've ever gotten those teriyaki combo sets, they come with salad, and your rice spills over into the lettuce and the dressing?  . . I'm Asian.   I like rice with my soup, with my vegetables, with my curry, with my chicken, with my meat, but I didn't like finding rice pieces in my SALAD.  . . I felt like I got screwed.  LIke I got my rice tossed with my salad.  And usually that's supposed to an accident, 'cept here, it was intentional.  . . HOWEVER their CHIMICHURI  sauce (dunno if that's the right sp)  is the best ever.  I would PAY for a loaf of bread and their chimi churi sauce.
