Some of the best sushi I have enjoyed was in denver, so just because a city is inland doesn't mean it has to suffer with this cuisine.  Still my foray into this food during my trips to Atlanta has resulted in mediocre to just plain bad sushi.  This place is definitely the former.  But it's in a mall, so not sure I should have expected better.. . The service though was good, as was the manager who responded quickly and appropriately to an issue with my meal - so extra kudos for that.. . But I am starting to wonder if restaurant groups are starting to pump out "Applebees with local charm". Sure the food varies from one joint to the next within the group - but there's almost a corporate-influenced generic kick added to attract the masses, and inevitably affect a review
