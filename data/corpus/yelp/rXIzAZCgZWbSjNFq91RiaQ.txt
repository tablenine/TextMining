Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
You must love beef. That is a requirement to enjoy Fogo. The restaurant looks very nice, a greatttt wine selection and quite a delicious system of beef eating. Overall the quality of meat is good, but the picanha really takes the cake. I always promise myself that I wont waste time with the salad bar and save more room for the beef but it too is quite wonderful. That along with fried bananas and the cheeseball bread and you are good to go. The fact that it is all you can eat without compromising flavor and quality is quite notable. How frequently does that combo not go hand in hand???
