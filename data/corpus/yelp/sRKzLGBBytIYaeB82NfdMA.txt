I almost never give five stars after a single experience, but this one has a lot to do with the mood.  I was treating my younger brother and sister to a weekend in New York in February, and all three of us had weather-related travel nightmares.  Miraculously, we all managed to arrive around the same time, albeit late, and immediately headed out to celebrate my sister's birthday.  I wanted someplace classy but not pretentious, and Ilili definitely fit the bill.  . . They have a handsome space, roomy and almost expansive.  It was very dim, as we got there pretty late, and the music was a bit louder than I would usually prefer.  It was as if they were halfway through converting to a club for the night.  We waited only about ten minutes for a table, sidling up to the stylish bar and ordering a tipple.  Throughout the evening, the service was impeccable--hostess, coat check, bartender, server, bus staff.. . My sister and I were trying to expand my brother's food horizons, so we decided to order several mezzas:  the hummus and baba ghannouj were very good.  The server brought complimentary petit fours.  Our next dishes were crispy calamari and chicken touk, and we revved up the adventure element with duck shawarma.  I had never encountered duck in Middle Eastern cooking, but it was excellently done.  . . For dessert, the server brought complimentary sorbets, and we ordered the Ilili "candy bar," a crunchy, ganache-y wonder.  All of the food was B+ or better and collectively, it was one of the best meals I've ever eaten.  Creative but familiar, carefully prepared, and most importantly, delicious.  My brother approved of almost everything, and believe me, that is a hell of a trick.  We had a fabulous time here:  what a great way to kick off our weekend.
