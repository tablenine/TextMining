Unbelievable Singaporean/Chinese Hainan Chicken! . Less than $10 bucks with Tax and Tip!. . ~Hainan Chicken. The Rice: What a pleasure the rice was and I truly appreciated it. It was broken rice that apparently was boiled with chicken or in chicken broth with some other ingredients. This was delightful and actually became the main dish for me with the chicken only complimenting it. . . The Chicken: Well, for 2 bucks more you can opt for all dark meat. Our server said she would give me mostly dark for no charge, since it was my first visit. Indeed she did. It was moist, tender and not a single bone!. . The red/orangish sauce they gave was definately a major component of this meal. I have never had this and I became addicted at my first taste. This was also accompanied by a ginger sauce. Both were delightful additions to this meal.. . ~Service? . Just great. Friendly and Accomadating. I can't express enough appreciation for the staff in accomadating our large party with such a popular and busy place. . . If you know a better place in LA, let me know..otherwise this place is 5 stars in my book!. . So, all of Los Angeles has already been here and posted. Something like 25 of my yelp buddies have already posted. I usually do not write reviews when there is nothing left to write. But in this case there was one last thing to write about...Thanks to everyone who posted but especially Maggie and Jolie. . . ~I really, really, liked this place. Maggie told me this was her favorite place to come for "comfort food." Â Thanks for urging me to come here. It may have been months and months before I tried it and possibly never got around to trying it at all. THANK YOU! 5 Additional Stars to you!
