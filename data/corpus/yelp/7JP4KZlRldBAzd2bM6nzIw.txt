I had a very tasty lunch at Rosa Mexicano the other day. I know high end Mexican food is hard for a lot of people, but the quality truly was there, IMO. I had the tacos al asador and it had soo much flavor. My husband had the chicken enchiladas and they were so huge, he did not even eat them all and that is saying a lot!. They don't do the traditional chips and salsa, but our waiter brought us some chips with a thick red and green sauce. The red sauce was pretty hot, but again had great flavor. Â . Rosa's might not be for everyone, but the Sunday we were there, the place was pretty busy.
