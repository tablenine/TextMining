Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This place oozes Southwestern influence, but the decor is decidedly bohemian.  That's pretty obvious after a glance of its menu, the food, the digs and the music (think moody indie folk rock).  . . After seeing the Yelp reviews I thought I would like this place.  I'm glad I made the venture out here from when I could have just as easily gone somewhere closeby downtown where I was staying.  . . Flo is definitely worth the trip, and I'm glad I went on a weekday.  Luckily, we didn't have to endure any waits.  Service was quick and prompt and the food was delicious.. . I am a sucker for this type of breakfast food (chorizo, especially).  Usually on a brunch menu I go straight for the Southwestern entrees.  And that's exactly what I did this time, and I was impressed.  I ordered the chorizo scramble with spicy home fries and black beans.  Holy crap.  I LOVE chorizo and black beans together, and this plate was delicious!  My friend's Lowrider frittata was pretty good, but I was all about my chorizo scramble this morning was raving about Flo for quite a while.
