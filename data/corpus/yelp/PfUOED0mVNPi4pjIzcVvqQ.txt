Gonna agree with the posters who commented on the "hip, cool" thing. Food was good.  The decor was nice, but the positives stop there.  . . 1) Seating for a table for 4 at 9:30 on a Tuesday night, caused utter confusion between the 3 host/hostesses manning the station.. . 2) Our waitress lacked any awareness of empty drink glasses after our first round.. . 3) Any time you have to describe how you are different...well, you are a loser.  Wine in barrels? HOW AWESOME! puh-lease!. . 4) I actually enjoy speaking to my dinner-mates.  Two Urban--well, they apparently don't. Music is so loud and if I had to hear one more plate/dish dropped in the exposed kitchen I was going to scream.. . Go alone...so you can have intelligent conversation with yourself and tell the wait-staff you have been there a million times and you may not have to hear the "hip" schpeel!
