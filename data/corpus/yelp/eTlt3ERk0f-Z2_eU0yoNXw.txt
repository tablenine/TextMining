Restaurant: Sura Thai Bistro
Category: Thai
Used to be a regular at Ping Pong but not since they decreased their portion sizes and got super snippy when I asked about it.  . . Had a yen for some good curry the other night and ordered from Sura, it was wonderful (altho I did miss the brown rice because I just didn't think of asking them in time- yes, they have it)-  It was delicious and a good value for upscale Asian food.  For still good Thai food at a very reasonable price let me also recommend Joy's which is just up Broadway.
