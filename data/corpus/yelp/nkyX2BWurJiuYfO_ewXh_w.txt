While the idea of Kogi is fun (and delicious), I always end up a bit disappointed. And here's why:. . You never get enough for what you pay for.. . My typical Kogi experience for me consists of: finding the truck, looking for parking, waiting in too long of a line, and paying a semi-expensive price. So is the food actually good? HECK YEA it is. But the portions are WAAAY too small for what you pay for. And call me old-fashioned, but i'd rather eat some normal korean food or a normal mexican burrito. . . But what Kogi is best at, is for providing something 'fun to do' whenever you're out with friends.
