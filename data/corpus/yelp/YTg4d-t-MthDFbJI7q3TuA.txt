This place brings back so many memories.  I met teh subject of my most erotic summer romace her a few years ago and we used to go back there every friday night for the whole sumemr to enjoy the view and the food and the drinks.  I have not gone back for years now, but all I remember is that the food and the peopel and drinks were all so sexy...or was it that i was in love ...or in lust.  There is something about the view and beautiful people that makes you want to go home and make love.
