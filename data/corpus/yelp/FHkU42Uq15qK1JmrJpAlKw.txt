Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I don't usually eat Ramen, but I must say it's pretty good. A popular hangout among locals looking for good, authentic Japanese-style Ramen noodles. You can even get your picture on the wall if you finish eating one of their Top 2 spicy ramen bowls. Excellent noodles, flavorful broth, and a variety of spice levels (I know it's a bit gimmicky but it's so freaking good!) Be warned, this place is highly addictive.
