My husband and I love Kogi! Our favorite is the short rib taco. The tofu taco, spicy pork taco, and the sliders are also good. The burrito is kind of dry for our taste, the kimchi quesadilla is a little too rich, and the Kogi dog is very average. I feel like a pig whenever I get Kogi! My husband and I would order about 8 tacos, and 2 other items (burrito or dog or quesadilla or sliders). The line can get very long - tonight we got there at 8:15, ordered at 8:55, got food at 9:05ish. But it was worth it :)
