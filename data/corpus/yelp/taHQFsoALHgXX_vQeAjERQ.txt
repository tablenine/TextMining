I love the way this place smells. That is what drew some friends and myself there one night...too bad it was packed! So we tried again another night...packed again. So then we got hip and made reservations....Delicious! The smoke can be a bit much when you are actually inside. The parking guys sucked! We waited over 20 minutes for our car and the parking lot is not that large. I would have given 4 stars because the meat and service was great but the whole parking issue was crazy insane. . Make a reservation, go early and park outside the lot and you will be golden.
