Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
To me, Orochon tastes like packaged ramen. Boo! By the time you add meat or eggs with your ramen, you end up paying wayyy too much for ramen that you can make at home. I make better ramen than this with better ingredients.. . Really, I think the reason this place is popular is because you can take pics and show off to other people how spicy you can eat your ramen. Go to this place for the novelty aspect and if you like spicy, msg loaded ramen.. . I tried giving this place a chance, I went 2-3 times ordering their shoyu or miso ramen....but blehhh....it's too much msg, overly salty, and no depth to the flavor.. . I recommend ordering their fried rice and their spicy scallop appetizer instead. It's the only thing that's decent for me when I go to Orochon.
