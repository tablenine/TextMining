I would categorize their food as upscale TexMex.  The food was really good with decent sized portions.  I had the Camarónes Alambres which were very tasty!  The margaritas are really good and strong.. . The service was very friendly and prompt.  The interior is very interesting - all the furniture and decoration are unproportionally large.. . It's a little pricey, but would definitely recommend for a date night!
