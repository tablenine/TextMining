Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
After living in soCal for the past 5 years, I finally made it to Pink's.  My brother was in town and had heard of this hot dog place so we decided to check it out (plus it was on our way to Griffith Observatory and thought it'd be cheaper and better than their food).. . In the past, the lines were ridiculously long but at around 5 pm today, it took about 30 minutes from the time we got there to the time we got our food.  There were so many options but for the sake of my digestive system and health I kept it simple and ordered a chili cheese dog, as did my sister-in-law.  My brother ordered the same but without the cheese.. . For all the hype of this place, it was just ok.  The hot dog skin was pretty thick, chili was not very flavorful but there was a lot of it.  The hot dog itself was pretty decent and I liked the onions with the chili and cheese.  The price was great for the basic chili cheese dog and in total we spent $13 on three hot dogs and fries.  Not a bad deal.. . 3 stars is for the so-so chili but good pricing.  Not sure about the fancier hot dogs out there.  It's a touristy place - which is why we were there.  Not a regular go to spot for me but not horrible either.
