They have one of the best happy hours I've ever experienced. $2.27 for all you can eat paella and tapas? AND IT'S FRESH AND DELICIOUS?!?! I want to go to there. Repeatedly. . . The night I went the options were their veggie paella, the chicken mole verde and coconut rice, boniato and plantain croquetas and an assortment of fresh chips and salsa rojo. I'll admit I do have one of the more discerning palates in my circle, but I was really impressed with all the offerings. Like Anne S. said, they kept refreshing the empty chafing dishes which was awesome. I never knew I'd love a veggie paella, but it was prolly the highlight of food side of my meal. Our berry mojitos were also perfectly balanced. I hate sweet drinks so I was a little cautious, but I enjoyed every drop. . . One note: Please leave a decent tip on your buffet bill. Due to our insanely cheap tab ($13 for four people... we had a round of free mojitos due to some offer I'd found on teh interwebz), and my prior serving experience, I insisted we fork over $7 each. There's no reason our server should've been so shocked to get a $15 tip for a four-top. But she was. Granted, that may be a bit more generous than is really *necessary*, but with the savings we'd received, it only felt right. . . I think I need to go back some other time and get a bit of latin dancing in. Seems like a beautiful space and their drink menu had me salivating. The food menu also seems pretty solid. I definitely need more of Nacional 27!
