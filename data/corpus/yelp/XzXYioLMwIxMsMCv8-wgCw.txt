Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
Frequency: Often (5-10 times). Tourist-worthy: Big YES!. . Default:.  - Cheese rolls.  - Potato balls.  - A randomly chosen item--all are superb!!. . I used to go to school at UCLA and would trek out here just for their fresh cheese rolls. There's NOTHING like a fresh Porto's cheese roll! The breading is so incredibly soft and delicate (yet crispy!) and the cheese is a nice, light cream filling. Even when brought back up to the Bay the next few days, these cheese rolls' are still incomparable. But please do yourself a favor and eat these FRESH!. . I admit that I didn't know about the potato balls until my latest LA trip. These little guys are AMAZING!! Lightly fried ball of mashed potatoes, stuffed with GROUND BEEF. My dream come. true.. . On my last trip, I also tried 2 of their sandwiches: the grilled chicken and cuban sandwich. The bread was perfect: crispy on the outside, super soft on the inside. . . BOTTOM LINE:. I'm convinced that Porto's is one of the few restaurants where ANY and EVERYTHING you get is PERFECT. They're masters at bread-making and baking. They've got it down, and know exactly what they're doing. And they do it right!
