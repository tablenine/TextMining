Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
There used to be a place with a few locations in the (ugh) Inland Empire called El Taco Nazo, and they made the best fish tacos in or out of Ensenada.  I say this having eaten plenty of the goods down there, and even having stayed with a local fisherman who sells many of the local places their fish (did you know fish tacos dow there are almost all shark meat?).  But the El Taco Nazos I knew closed down, and I got the hell out of the I.E.  So it was with great pleasure that I stumbled upon the Best Fish Taco in Ensenada.  . . Finally there are good fish tacos in L.A.  I used to have to go to Cactus, but their's are small and a little pricey for what you get.  These, however, are the right size, the right price, and there's a loaded bar of different salsas and crema and accoutrements that let you make the tacos exactly what you want them to be.  They may not be the best in Ensenada, or (if there are still more Nazos around) even L.A. County, but they're certainly the best in the city, and that's where I live so I'm Lovin' It!
