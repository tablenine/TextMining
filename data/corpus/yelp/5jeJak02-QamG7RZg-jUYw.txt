Restaurant: De Cero Taqueria
Category: Mexican
After walking through Taste of Randolph and being unimpressed by all the offerings except De Cero, we decided to walk down to the actual restaurant and get some grub there. . . Best Decision of the Week.. . We got there at 10 to 5, right before they opened. The host was more than happy to put us at a table outside and we had water before he even walked away. Our waitress showed up instantly, and the drinks followed. The service was of this caliber the entire time we were there.. . The duck nachos were possibly the best food I've had in months (except for Cornelia's shitake mushroom pancakes!), and while the Peach Chamomile Colada was tasty (I had 3 of them!), they're lacking in the booze dept.--I didn't even feel a buzz. The margaritas and black beans deserve an honorable mention. The goat cheese tamale, not so much.. . I had no idea this place got such raves from the Yelp crowd, we'll be going back shortly and I'll be sure to get tacos. :)
