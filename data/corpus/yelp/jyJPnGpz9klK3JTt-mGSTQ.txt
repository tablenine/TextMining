I have been here twice, so shame on me. Its lots of hype with over priced, average tasting everything. What I cant get over is how snobby the people are and how clueless the staff is...with unemployment so high, someone is doing a shitty job of hiring. . . I dont see it making it but the owners certainly have the cash to keep this upscale bar louie open. I cant say that I will never go back but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine/drink there.
