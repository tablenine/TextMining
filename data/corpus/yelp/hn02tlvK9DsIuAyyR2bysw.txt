Even if I hadn't Yelped this place before showing up, the GIGANTIC crowd of people outside this tiny restaurant might have tipped me off.  We looked at the maybe 15 seats inside, and then at the 20 people waiting, and thought, should we even bother?  Before we had a chance to discuss it, our name was called.  Somehow.  Don't ask me how.. . Anyway, the little voice on my shoulder remembered to order me to order the Hainan chicken, but it forgot any other recommendations that it saw, so we supplemented that with the shrimp rolls and the daily special, Vietnamese crab noodle soup.. . Okay, honest?  The Vietnamese crab noodle soup was disgusting.  It had that fishy taste peculiar to tuna-flavored cat food and any fish that's more than a week old unfrozen.  I spit out numerous pieces of crab because they tasted wrong and I don't like to mess around with old shellfish.  None of us could finish it.. . The shrimp rolls were perfectly acceptable - nothing mindblowing, but acceptable.. . The Hainan chicken?  Yes, yes, Yelp, you are absolutely right.  Out of this world.  How can such a boring looking dish taste so good?  We should have just ordered 3 of this for all we fought over the last bites.  Though we each had our own preferences for eating it (my mom likes an ton of ginger and Dan pours his soy sauce over the rice - I just dip each bite in both, plus the chili sauce of course) we all went crazy over it.  Mmmm, I want some now, but I am - of course - 950 miles away.
