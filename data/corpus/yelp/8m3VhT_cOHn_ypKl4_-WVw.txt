Spago is better than ever.. . We went last night for my brother's birthday.. Seated on a great table in the patio.. . My brother and father had a Cote-du-boef.. Others had the agnolotti (to die for) the tagliatelle, an order of the lamb and a fish.. To start beets, salmon pizza, Pumpkin soup .... Paired with a Qupe white and a Barbera D'Alba red.. Both wines were excellent.. . If I could afford to, I would eat there every day.
