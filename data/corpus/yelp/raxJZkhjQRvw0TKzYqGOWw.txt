I ate at Tin Drum today and I was so bored. I've eaten there too much because I'm always in Tech Square. Tim Drum is kind of like Mama Fu's or Thai Bowl. Everything tastes pretty good, but nothing is quite authentic. But you can eat a lot of food for under $10, so that's really good if $$ is tight. Â The lines can get very long at lunch time during the school year. It moves, but not too fast. . . Some pretty good things on the menu:. Penang Curry. Basil rice w/ chicken. Salad w/ chicken satay. . Not so good:. Pad Thai - waaaay too sweet. Singapore noodle - bland. Pho - this is a no no
