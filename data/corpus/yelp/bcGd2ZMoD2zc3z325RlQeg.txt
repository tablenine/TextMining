Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
Cafe' where you can sit on the floor--great.  The front end of the store has small tables low to the floor with comfy pillows surrounding so you can enjoy laying around while you sip your coffee/tea &amp; eat their tasty food.  Love the decor &amp; feel of Kopi--it has got a hip vibe to it without being overly pretentious.  The place is much bigger than you would expect just looking from the outside.  . . Food is good, coffee strong &amp; I hear the tea is good (I do not like tea).  The servers are attentive most especially if it is not packed in there.  They also make really good suggestions if you are stuck on what to order.  . . As a person who enjoys travel, there is something being in there that I just love. The gift shop in the back has all sorts of books, journals, jewelry, and maps to keep you busy while you wait for your food.  . . The outside seating is a major plus, although how can you not have it when you are located in Andersonville?
