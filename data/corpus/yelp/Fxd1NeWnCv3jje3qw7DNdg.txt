Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Indoor &amp; outdoor dining available. Fast, very efficient, friendly service. I like how they have the earpiece walkie talkie looking all professional and all. Lots of long tables good for large groups. Live singing while you dine.. . Kee Mao Noodle: pretty good, not too greasy, lots of veggies. Thai Sausage: nothing sour about it. fried sausage basically. Thai Iced Tea: nice blend of tea &amp; milk
