Category: Bakeries
The matza ball soup was nice but the roasted chicken was overcooked, dry and shriveled up. Â Some of the servers were great but what really ruined the experience for me was the owner's blatant prejudice for the people I had brought in for lunch once and dinner on another. His attitude towards them were consistent and something I cannot stand. Whatever good I had to say about the place was trumped by the owner's awful prejudice and attitude.
