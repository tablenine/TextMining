Since I totally already reviewed the Robertson location, I wasn't going to beat you all over the head with my Bossa Nova love.  . . But I can't help it!!!. It's so awesome!!!. . Last weekend, getting here was not easy.  After the damn-fool GPS wouldn't enter the address correctly, I started getting irritable.  After my bf asked me for the tenth time if there was going to be a parking lot (PLEASE!  It's LA!) my head started to feel woozy.  But once I stepped in and realized that we didn't have to wait to be seated, I calmed down.. The food is the same, obviously.  I got the grilled fish like usual, bf ordered lamb and our guests ordered salmon and some spicy chicken.  Everything was amazing!  I was soooo excited to eat plantains.  I can't even tell you.  I obsess over these plantains and the only thing that was better than the plantains was our server.. . Yimmy was the shit.  I can't even explain to you how amazing she is.  She's funny, helpful, nice and when confronted with 3 tables sat at the same time...she bitch-slapped that task like it was nothing!. . Everything about our meal was amazing, I was also super excited to be able to order the pitcher of sangria for the first time!  . How exciting!
