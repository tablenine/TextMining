Restaurant: Kamehachi
Category: Sushi Bars
You'll find trendier sushi spots in town, but Kamehachi is one of the better ones in my opinion because their fish truly is fresh. The decor varies - upstairs is more dimly lit and 'funkier', compared to the downstairs which is a bit crowded and a bit lacking in atmosphere. However, my favorite spot is their outdoor patio in the summer. I guess I've grown to love this place so mush as it's a regular standyby being a few doors down from my apartment. . Now for the food...as others have mentioned, I'm obsessed with the Green Turtle Roll! They stuff the rice with eel and its sweet brown sauce along with crunchy tempura flakes. On the outside, they lay a piece of ebi (shrimp) over the rice and drizzle the whole thing with a creamy wasabi sauce (to die for!) and green tobiko. It somehow combines every taste combination in one go - sweet, spicy, creamy, crunchy - it's a must!
