This place is really nice ~ quick and casual sit down for lunch or dinner.  They have nice big garage door windows that open up to let all the nice fresh air in - I love that.  The servers/employees are all nice and friendly.  . . You can either get a burger or a burger in a bowl (w/o the bun) - at 1/3, 2/3, or 1 whole lb!!!  I suggest the 1/3 lb...it was huge - I can't even imagine what the 2/3lb and 1lb burgers were like!  Either choose their burger or make your own by selecting all your options on a clipboard!  Choose your cheese, toppings, and from 3 different burger buns.  I chose the regular hamburger bun and it wasn't my fave - something was missing or something...I think different buns would make it a whole lot better.  But it's a good burger place.. . The 50/50 combo of fries and onion strings is awesome...altho' I wish it was more like 75/25 b/c I liked the fries better but the onion strings are still good.  The fries come with ranch sauce, bbq sauce, and of course ketchup at the table.  That's awesome.  :) . . I would check this place out.  They also have beer and wine!  Maybe it was a full bar...not sure.  Plus dessert and shakes/malts.  I think I will be back if I'm around!
