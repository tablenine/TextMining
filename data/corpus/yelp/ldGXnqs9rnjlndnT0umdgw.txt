I've been here a few times, especially for breakfast after working graveyard shifts. . Their pastries are amazing!!!! . . Came here again after a leisurely walk for "Race for the Cure" and ordered the breakfast burrito. Wish I would've been more daring, but I wanted to be safe. The burrito was fine...It tasted like any other breakfast burrito. Everyone elses' looked way better. Truly jealous. . They have a beautiful front patio and a private back room for larger groups. . . Parking is another story. Good luck with that especially on a Saturday and Sunday lunch. It gets crowded there.
