Really, is there any debate of where the best pastrami sandwich in LA is?. . Langers has plenty of negatives:. . - Lousy neighborhood. - Closes early. - Not open on Sunday. - Rest of the menu only okay. . But the pastrami alone is worth treking out to. Five stars for the pastrami itself - otherwise, its maybe 2 stars...
