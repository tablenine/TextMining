no one should ever put a strawberry on top of maki. it isn't right. the rolls are inventive and brave, but a little off. i wasn't wildly impressed with any of the fusions. the flavors weren't balanced. like trying to ride a bike after you spin around for a few minutes. but i'll try it again because the sushi itself was fresh and well prepared. beware of the sake, the decent, tiny bottles set you back $24.
