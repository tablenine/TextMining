Food was ok, i think, too much hype was given to the "garlic noodles". when after the second bite all you could taste was butter, i guess, they stuck to the belief that you can't go wrong with anything with too much butter in it. We had to wait 40 mins even with reservation. Avoid going here if you believe you are claustrophobic because, man, it felt like the people around us were sharing the same table with us, it's that cramped!. The band in my opinion was too load, good thing we were seated away from it. I think the crab was good, we enjoyed that one..   .    :)--- good crowd, some nice crab dishes..    :(--- street parking/ valet, garage parking, pricey glorified greasy noodles
