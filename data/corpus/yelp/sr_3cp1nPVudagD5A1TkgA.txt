We were trying to find a place to eat and I remember hearing about this place. They say its the next best thing to Umami. We went to try it out. The venue was nice. Full on pub style with a side of food. We went on a saturday night. Be aware, this place is a 21+. They card at the door. As the guy was carding me, he asks if we have ever been here before. I say no. I didnt think it was a big deal. Turns out, you have to find your own seat and order at the bar. Luckily our friends happened to get there before us. . . It was pretty packed for 9pm. Food selection is good. They even have specials too. And they have REAL coke in a bottle! I noticed the die down around 11pm. It gets pretty empty by 12am. . . So my suggestion: Come either really EARLY to reserve a table, or come after midnight. Its hard to enjoy yourself in a small booth.
