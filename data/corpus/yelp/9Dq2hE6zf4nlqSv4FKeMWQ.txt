I have been to Daikokuya for several times and I became a fan of this tiny ramen shop.. Here are the pros and cons. Pros:. - Good Ramen( the soup, noodle, cha-shu, pickled egg incorporate all together, it's so good that you want to go back there again and again,,,). - Good appetizers(the gyoza is great). - friendly service. . Cons:. -Huge lines. But it's worth waiting.
