Don't even look at the menu, go straight for #19: Pastrami, Swiss Cheese, and Cole Slaw.. . Pros:. -Delicious, thick cut pastrami with fat, yeah!. -Yummy and light slaw that complements the pastrami well. -Quick service. . Cons:. -Not a good value at $13.45. -Shady neighborhood (even kind of scary during the day). Next time, I'll bring 2 bodyguards to protect me &amp; my car while I eat.
