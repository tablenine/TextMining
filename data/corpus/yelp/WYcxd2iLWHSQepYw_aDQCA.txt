I'm not 100% sure how to pronounce the name of this place, but I enjoyed visiting it! Some girlfriends and I went for appetizers and drinks last weekend. Now that I've read some other yelpers' reviews I guess it's kind of a go-to place for a girl's night (guys - take note). I was pleasantly surprised by the lounge-ish feel to the place. It's kind of dark and, in addition to tables and bar seats, there are couches to sit on. Usually I need more action in a bar but this place is good for hanging out, sipping some wine, and chatting with friends. . . We ordered several items on the menu, all appetizers.. . Cold Cuts: 3 meats with red peppers and some kind of spread that was really tasty. Not the biggest cold cut fan at any restaurant but they were adequate. . . Samosas: This was the best thing we tried. They were a little spicier that I imagined but in a good way. I really liked the texture of the pastries - fluffy yet durable. Accompanying salsa was nice.. . Calamari: Pretty good but nothing to write home about. . . Pommes Frites AKA french fries: Pretty standard. . . Lamb Potstickers: Very good. Flavor was different and a good combo.. . The wine I tried was really good. Can't remember the name but it was something you don't see everywhere and had a fruity but full flavor. . . In summary, we had a good time. It's nice to have an evening just to unwind and catch up and P'cheen has the perfect atmosphere for just that.
