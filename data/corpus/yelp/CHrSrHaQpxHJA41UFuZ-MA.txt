The drinks are still solid, but I think my opinon of their drinks dropped from 5-star to 4-star.. . I love me my whiskey.  And this place makes a solid Manhattan.  It gots the Bourbon that is soaking with Costa Rican Cigars to give it a nice added layer of flavor.  But this last time.... bam a marachino cherry.  WTF????  This place used you have home made Cinnamon Bourbon soaked cherries that were freaking amazing.  I don't want a canned sugar bomb in my drink.  Bring me back my high quality cherries and I will give you the 5th star.
