I only give them 3 stars because of the quality of the waitstaff.  Too many times have friends or family and I gone and we have been ignored.  I have never seen a waitress take 15 minutes to get you a drink refill, and in the end the busboy notices and just does it for her.  I have noticed that the staff seems to care ore about goofing off and gossiping with each other than they do about the people they are their to serve.  . . There was one day we went, and a waitress chased out her table and yelled at them for not leaving her a tip.  The people told her to her face that she was an awful waitress and that she did no deserve one as she did not earn it.  They then informed her that they tipped the cooks instead, because the food was excellent.  . . I can say after hearing that I knew that while I love the Med, the service always sucks and it never seems to get better.  I also noticed some of the staff play favorites with customers.  I over heard a group of girls laughing about how they were going to make one table wait because they didn't like the girl sitting with the group.  Hopefully management removes these people because that does not make for a pleasant environment.. . ANYWAY....food is good, service sucks, a bit overpriced, but worth it most days...ALWAYS CARRY OUT OR GET DELIVERY!!  The drivers are fast and really friendly!!  Medici gets 4 1/2 stars for food and 2 for service.
