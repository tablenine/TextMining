Decent sushi, but mostly filled with out-of-towners and power lunchers who somehow have in their mind that this is 'the' sushi place in little tokyo.  Not true.  The wait is way too long, both in waiting to get seated and for the food to get prepared.  Decent food -- but not the best.  All native little tokyo'ers know,  cross the street instead and find the frosted white glass restaurant called Hamakawa right on the corner of 2nd and Central.  Open only after 5pm and closed on Tuesdays, but offers a much tastier, prompter, cheaper and more genuine sushi eating experience.  I've been going to both Sushi Gen and Hamakawa for years and can say that while both are good, Hamakawa is the best. . . Also i've been reading some people are complaining about a *fishy* smell.   . . One key thing to keep in mind: . ** Fresh sushi/sashimi smells like the ocean. . ** Bad sushi/sashimi smells fishy/stinky because of bacteria (which can make you sick) . . Keep that in mind when evaluating sushi restaurants.
