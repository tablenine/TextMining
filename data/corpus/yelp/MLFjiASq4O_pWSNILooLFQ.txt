They actually DO deliver.  But it's...questionable.  Their delivery hours are "whenever he shows up" to "whenever he goes home."  So you can call, place an order for delivery, call back after an hour to find out where your food is, only to be told the driver still hasn't come in to work.  Not so much about the communication at Canter's!. . You hang up and vow to never place another order.  Never again will you deal with this madness!  You swear!  But when the food finally does arrive (seven years later) you realize why you put up with this shit.  And why you'll continue to.. . That first spoonful of Matzo ball soup and that first bite of the Brooklyn Avenue with extra dressing and you're willing to sell your soul to them.  And those pickles!  Those damn pickles.  So bitter and dry and indescribable yet completely addictive.  You know you'll be calling again.  And again and again.  . . And while you have them on the phone for your lunch (or dinner by the time they arrive) order, you might as well add on a few pounds of pastrami and corned beef.  And turkey.  And a sliced loaf of the corn rye.  Oh, and a few more of those pickles.  You'll regret it if you don't...believe me.
