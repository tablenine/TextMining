so-so spot. honestly, i might've liked it more if i were a guac-girl. unfortunately, i'm not really into avocadoes, and, therefore, didn't experience one of the things adobo's known-for. we had some drinks, which were pretty good, as well as the assorted salsa appetizer, which was decent. it was fun to try out the different salsa flavors and see who could hang with the hottest, but the cuisine wasn't exactly spectacular. honestly, this place is better for those seeking a cool atmosphere and casual drinks, rather than those looking for a good meal. if you're on your way to second city and need a place to kill some time, it works.
