Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
I've only had a few dishes only because I've been here a few times.   . . Their filet mignon (around $22) is good because the sauce they give you with it goes great with the steak.  Tender and comes in a sizzling, hot plate.  It is already cut in small strips for you.   . . Their sushi is good also ... nothing specific I can recommend. . . The drinks are made well. . . Atmosphere fits more of a bar/club ... I can't say this is the place for fine dining, but everything else besides that works with the venue. . . The entertainment consist of people watching and the Geishas that walk around in the restaurant.  They serve no real purpose ... just an affirmation of the name of the restaurant - 'Geisha' House. . . Drinks are worth the price, but not the sushi. . . [stars and comments are subject to change with each visit (^_^) ]
