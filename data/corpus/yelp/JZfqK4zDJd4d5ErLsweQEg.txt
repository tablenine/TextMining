The only thing I will say about this place is that 1.) Yes it is overpriced but 2.) You are paying for the experience. And what is that experience you may ask? 3.) The "gold" aka sweet potato crust . . Ok so yah, $30+ for a pizza sounds absolutely ridiculous, but you also have to figure, are you really going to ask the guy at Pizza Hut to stuff the crust with warm sweet potato and top it with random sauces like...salsa and cream sauce? Probably not, so just go here knowing you're going to pay a bit more to try what I think they're so popular for. For some reason the last three times I've been here I keep trying the one with crab on it (the first "gold" choice on the menu) thinking that I haven't tried it yet. It's tasty, but if you're one of those people that measures the value of food by its cost than you may end up being disappointed it's not actually filled with gold.
