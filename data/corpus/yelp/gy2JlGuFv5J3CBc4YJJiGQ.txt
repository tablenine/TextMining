an hour and a half wait. was expecting greatness and beyond. somehow i got "it was good but not that gooddddd". . i've actually never stepped foot in little tokyo before and this cute little town totally resembles japan!!! we ordered the ramen and shredded pork bowl, and gyoza (?).. . the shredded pork bowl was absolutely divine!!! melted in my mouth and i savored every single bite. it was sooooo yummilcious! and the salad that came with the combo...friggin good too! just simple cabbage with dressing but oh my....it was perfection in a little bowl. that's about all that i liked there. the ramen was good but not an hour and a half wait good. i much preferred ramen at shin sen gumi back home in orange county. . . glad i came and tried it. however, won't be seeing me here again.. . p.s. couples galore here. get a room kids!
