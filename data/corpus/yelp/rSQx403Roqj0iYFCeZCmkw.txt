Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
"Good business is the best art" - Andy Warhol. . Cut has all the elements of the artful, great business. The elegant and modern room vibes well with the clientele which include Hollywood stars and starlets as well as athletes and foodies from around the world. The restaurants combines reputation, ambience, and service to make a successful venture. Mr. Wolfgang Puck chats with every table. That's good business and excellent PR. . . The food: 100% Japanese Wagyu Kobe Rib Eye, bone marrow flan, and cheese puffs were great. The sweet summer corn was great. Everything else was less than memorable. . . Cut is "all it can be" as a complete dining experience, but can be lacking in certain areas. I concur with my comrade Kenny K: 4 stars.
