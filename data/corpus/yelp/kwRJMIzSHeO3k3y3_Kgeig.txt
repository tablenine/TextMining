Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
literally, this restaurant Hide, is hidden. we drove in circles trying to find this place because we couldnt find the restaurant name on its doors or windows or anything. its not fancy either. no bells, whistles, or neon lights all up in your face, but when you walk in, everyone is having a good time..it was so crowded on a saturday night.. . so this is the real deal japanese sushi. authentic. you don't have those fancy rolls with fancy names here. here, you get the precision cut pieces of fish and a whole list to choose from. and the prices are reasonable. i ordered the nigiri sushi dinner, which had 8 pieces, uni, and jellyfish. i had to try the jellyfish.. and i survived! would i order it again? maybe not. . . all in all, im happy we found this place. . . oh yea.. it's cash only. dolla dolla bills yall!
