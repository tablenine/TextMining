Beers - I love the that the new location has larger brewing space allowing Crawford to have more beers on tap. There is something for everyone here.. . Food - I love the expanded menu. As always, the pizzas are the best. I've NEVER had a bad meal from Chef Dave. . . Atmosphere - The main level can be noisy as it is a large room and noise bounces around and around and around. . . If we could give half stars, I would, but only because of the noise problem. Upstairs and the patio areas are much better. . . 4.5 out of 5 stars.
