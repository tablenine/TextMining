I heart this place. Its great to go to lunch with your girls or to go on a date and have a romantic dinner.  Its quite small but love the atomosphere. The food is delicious and big enough to share. I totally recommend the banana spring rolls! TO DIE FOR!  Please note that this is fusion Vietnamese food not the hard-core authenitc stuff! . ICYC(In Case You Care): Last time I ate there I saw Karen O from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the time before that I saw Jessica Alba and Giovanni Ribisi.  I totally recommend the place!
