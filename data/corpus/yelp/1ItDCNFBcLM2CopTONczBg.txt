Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I wanted so much to love this place, but it's a total shit hole.  The Apple Pan is cramped, dirty and smelly, there are about 10 counter seats, (no tables), and people are crammed into corners waiting for seats to open up.  The ambiance is nonexistent--I don't care if it's a historic landmark, it might as well be a truck stop.  The filthy plaid wallpaper is peeling off of the walls, the unwashed cups that hold the tiny ass paper cones they serve drinks in are covered in the leftover remnants of someone else's meal, the service is curt, the food is overpriced and under par. We left wishing we had saved ourselves money and misery and just gone to In N' Out.
