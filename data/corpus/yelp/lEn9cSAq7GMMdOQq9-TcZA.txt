Wow I am surprised by all the bad reviews lately -- seems like these guys are victims of their own success.. . I hit these guys up when they come to Santa Monica. The wait has been fine, and the tofu tacos I crave and love. I don't eat any meat so I am super grateful that the Kogi guys are thinking of me.. . The guys in the truck are so cute and nice - I'm a big fan. I'm totally fine with $2+ per taco - I know the Mexican ones on Lincoln are cheaper, but they also don't feed the veggies/ vegans in the crowd. . . Two comments: . 1 - If you want the killer carne asada for $1.25, you know where to go, right? Maybe Kogi isn't for you. . 2 - It's pretty clear from the people walking away from the window what size the tacos are. So...in theory you would be able to figure out how many you need prior to ordering to avoid disappointment, right??. . Last observation: due to the hype, these guys seem to be attracting folks who aren't used to the taco truck thing - i.e they want to use their credit cards, need a menu, etc. If this is you, then check their site out in advance and figure out what you want. And hit an ATM.. . It's a cool concept -- the Twitter connection and the fluid calendar. I'm totally into supporting them; not hard to do because I love the food.
