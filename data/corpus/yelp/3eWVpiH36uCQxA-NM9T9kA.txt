Knocking down my rating to 3 stars because on our last visit here:. . 1. I asked for my burger to be cooked to medium doneness and the thing practically mooed at me when I bit into it. . . 2. They forgot a topping but still charged me for it.. . 3. I ordered a banana split shake (which has booze) and got a regular banana shake (which doesn't have booze). Plus they put it in 2 glasses. It was a nice gesture but I wasn't planning on sharing, thanks.. . 4. Our change was $12 and the waitress gave us a ten instead of two fives. A little presumptuous. . . It seems like if they're busy at all, there's a good chance something will get screwed up. I do like the Counter but I think I'll stick to it as a lunch/early dinner spot. It's overpriced and the service is spotty but I like the toppings and whatever.
