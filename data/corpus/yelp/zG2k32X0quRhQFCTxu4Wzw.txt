Hands Down~! . Awesome Experience A Great Diner Place Can Offer~. . Honestly, it was my very first encounter of the famous D.T.F. of my life~. Ironically speaking, I walked the origin of this world famous place many times, when I resident in Taipei. . . Anyway~ the experience blown me away!. Food~ you really don't need a ding-dung food credit like me, to tell you.. from the crowded waiting line..... from the mass media coverage... you got the idea.... . Service~ from the shift manager to services personnel were really helpful and patient with us, especially during their nightly rush hour. . . Environment~ Honestly, throughout the dinner, other then spot any available dumplings on the table for me to snatch~ . the Posters of TWN were another source kept on locking my eyes.... . This great place is the pride of TWN~ . And this place isn't shy about it as well~ . . Anyways~ as a group, after manager had almost lost track with our total basket count, the cost per each person is another highlight of the night. . . I love this place, and I am sure millions agree with me as well. . . You outta swing by here, and check this place out!. Then you know what the heck all the hype is about!
