Had lunch with my dad here today.  It was good and bad,  The Onion rings rocked as an app, my dad had oysters and said they were great.  The chopped pork was really quality meat.  Mac and cheese was ok, trying too hard with a staple sometimes comes out too contrived.  (Do you really need three cheeses for mac and cheese?).  My Dad had the grilled portobello mushroom sandwich and raved about it and he usually doesn't' say much about his food.  If this was it, it would be about 3.5 stars.  Now onto the disappointing aspects.  The service was good, but really long.  Our server was really nice, but it took a long time to get our food and it wasn't crowded.  . . The barbecue sauce almost made me throw up.  Thank god I tried it on an onion ring first or my sandwich would have been ruined.  They have a little label on the bottle that says "made with bacon."  It should say, "made with bacon fat and red food coloring...enjoy."  DISGUSTING!  I was informed that they sometimes have vegetarian bbq sauce which seemed weird, but they were out.  . . Overall, the quality of the meat and apparently wonderful portobello mushroom sandwich gives them stars, but until I have a craving for a mushroom sandwich or bacon grease, I don't think I will be back.
