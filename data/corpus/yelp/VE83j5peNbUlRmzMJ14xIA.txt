Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
my breath reeeeked of garlic. and i didn't mind at all. definitely a garlic lovers heaven..like my dad. . the stinking rose has a casual atmosphere.  it had random decorations, very homey feel.  their calamari is something to rave about, soft, chewy and very tasty.  the table had ready to use garlic sauce with garlic chunks which you can put on your bread, or add more to your entree, etc. i kept using it through-out my entire meal, couldn't get enough of it.  . ordered the Prime Rib which came with mashed potatas and spinach.  the prime was not garlic-ful as anticipated, but the 40 clove chicken was spectacular, tender and so FULL of flavor in every bite.  ended dinner with garlic flavored ice cream, which is truly what it is.. garlic flavored ice cream! ..bizarre but glad i tried it.  and since it was for my bday celebration, they sang to me and i wore the garlic clove hat and they sang to me "happy birthday you stinker.."
