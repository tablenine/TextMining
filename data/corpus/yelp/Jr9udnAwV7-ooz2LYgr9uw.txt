I love this place.  They cram you in, so don't expect a quiet dining experience or any conversational privacy.  The menu is absolutely HUGE, so there is something for everyone.  Be sure to take full advantage of their amazing selection of fresh fruit smoothies and bubble teas.  The food is full of flavor and you'll likely leave the restaurant very satisfied.
