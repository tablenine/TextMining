Just chiming in since I'm the 81st review or something like that. . . I look at the posters on the wall as I am eating my tender and delicious lamb kebab, Greek salad, roasted potatoes, and dipping my pita into the tzatziki and wish I were in Santorini or Mykonos. Â  . . Sometimes I grab some spanakopita, baklava or galactobaklava (baklava with custard) and household stuff like olive oil soap from the deli/grocery store connected to the resturant to take home .. . Come to the Byzantine-Latino Quarter for a meal at Papa Cristo's!
