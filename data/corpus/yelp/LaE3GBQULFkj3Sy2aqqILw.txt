breakfast sandwich, and the afterschool special can't be beat. . .  I've been in and out of LA for a long time, but only made it out here recently since I almost religiously hit la dijonaise for non-dim sum breakfast east of my house ( nice qualifiers eh?) but I gotta say I've got another place on the list. . What kills me is the parking and the wait, between doughboys and toast it's a bitch and a half to get a spot, so you've gotta valet it, and then you're talkin about a Â 20 min wait for your table.
