What a great Kogi experience. The truck was due to arrive at 6 o'clock (pacific standard time) and two blocks away from my house! Magnificent! So we got there about 30 minutes early and played the waiting game. We make eye contact with other's waiting and lightning strikes. It's anyone's game at this point.. . Around 6:05 (the truck is late) a line begins to form where someone THINKS the truck will park, but we stand strong. (Never go with the crowd.) Oh, what's this? Oh, what a perfect spot for the truck, and wait, is that the truck I see? Oh rejoice! We were first in line and that was my first Kogi experience. . . Now for the food. Seeing as I wasn't that hungry before, I got three tacos (Short Rib, Spicy Pork and Chicken.) The chicken is their weakest of the three, it's very bleh. The Spicy Pork makes you happy like a little school girl who just found out Little Jimmy has a crush on her and would like to take her to the Merry Winter Ball. That leaves us with the Short Rib. Oh boy, that Short Rib is divine. It's tender, so none of that rough, angry chewing. It's perfectly flavored, so no condiments are needed. It's perfect. For anyone going to the Kogi for the first time, skip everything and get everything that has Short Rib in it, you'll thank me later.
