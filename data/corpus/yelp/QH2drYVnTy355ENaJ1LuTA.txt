I love the half portion salads, perfect size to fill an empty stomach - the chicken fresca is fabulous, no lettuce, just delicousness surrounded by strips of warm chicken.....outdoor seating is key here, great for people watching - the bakery looked amazing and will definitley be my next stop for a red (or blue) velvet cupcake!
