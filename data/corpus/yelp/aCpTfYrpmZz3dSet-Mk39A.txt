Everything I had here was delicious. I intended to just try one Bellini Croupette but think I ended up with 3 and unfortunately never tried any of the other cocktails which all sounded great. Ordered the fois gras and epoisses and was in food heaven. It was pretty crowded on a Saturday night but the service was still good. Loved the music too.
