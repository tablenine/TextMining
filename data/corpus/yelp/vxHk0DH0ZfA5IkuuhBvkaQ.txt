Restaurant: Twisted Taco
Category: Mexican
Ok so I wasn't really feeling the Twisted Taco in Midtown, but man did I love the one in Roswell. We headed over there for some bullriding and boy was it a BLAST!!! We got there, ate some dinner, had some margaritas, and geared up for some good ole fashion bullriding!!! Me and one of my buddies were SO good, we won a pitcher of beer....can't complain with that!!! Â If you get a chance, you should definitely check it out on the bullriding night, because you'll just have so much fun drinking beer and/or margaritas and laughing at all those poor souls who attempt to ride........
