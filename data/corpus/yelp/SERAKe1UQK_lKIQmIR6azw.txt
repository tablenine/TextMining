***Restaurant***. . Nice art deco'ish exterior with an "order a the counter we'll bring your food out" kind of operation.  Bright and clean...almost sterile when you think of it.  TINY dining area on the inside with tables outdoors on the sidewalk (weather permitting).  There's a small lot *across* the street on Poinsettia.  Usually no probs finding street parking.. . ***Food***. . So why would a lactose intolerant boy be leaving a review for a joint called "Milk" of all things?  One thing...I...frickin'...LOVE...their cobb salad!  Crisp greens tossed in a light n' zesty dressing (not quite the classic cobb french dressing), topped with very generous amounts of  cheese, tomatoes, avocado, boiled egg, and luscious crumbles of thick cut crispy bacon that makes this pork dork blush every time!  Oh...and the cheese bread crisp thing?  I need a big bag of them, please!. . I usually get the salad-soup combo, with the pazole as my choice of soup.  Although I'm not a big fan of whole garbanzo beans (probably because they look like the severed butts of aborted fetuses...but I digress), this soup is spiced just right with nice chunks of shredded pork.  Dump in the diced onions and cilantro, and you got yourself some solid comfort food!. . Ice cream looks good.  Too bad I keep forgetting to bring lactaid pills.. . ***Service***. . Not much to say really.  You order at the counter, they give you a number and bring your food to you.   No probs so far.. . ***Summary***. . I've been eating the cobb salad at Milk for years, and it's the only rabbit food dish I actually crave some days.  So long as the cobb is still boss, I'll keep going!
