I think everyone I know has been to Eats. It is sooooo cheap! I must say that the food is not bad. I love the lemon chicken with a side of collards and mac-n-cheese. Also the pasta is not so bad but I always find myself in the chicken line. Oh...the people who work there are funny. Full of tattoos and why the hell do I work at Eats attitude!
