Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Joan's on Third is your quintessential Los Angeles Café. Fancy cars, well-dressed clientele, and epicurean food served in a place with an eco-chic modern design.  . . I had no problem finding parking and parallel parked my friend's 95' Suzuki Esteem in between a Bentley and a Porsche right in front of Joan's. I know, one of these things is not like the other...       . . Among an impressive selection of cured meats and cheeses, Joan's also impresses with a large display of prepared foods and reasonably priced sandwiches.  And I may have neglected to mention an endless array of Cupcakes, Cookies, Cakes, and Macarons.  Pretty much, I wished I lived here. . . We shared a slice of the Hazelnut Meringue with Apricot Crème.  This dessert was as close to perfection as a slice of cake can get.  So delicious, that we agreed that there would be no sharing next time and that we would probably need an entire slice each in the future.        . . Paired the dessert with a rich/flavorful Americano and the lady had a cup of Mighty Leaf Earl Grey Tea.  Overall, a flawless dessert outing.  . . I resisted all urges to go to town on all the other beautiful looking desserts, as I promised someone I'd pick up some Red Velvet Cake from Doughboys just a few blocks away.  And that was delicious to.  But worry not Joan's on Third, I will return with a vengeance and perhaps armed with some insulin. . . Highly Recommended
