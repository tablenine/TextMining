Restaurant: El Carmen
Category: Bars
I've only been here twice, but I really like El Carmen.  The doormen are really cool, and if you're nice to them, they'll treat you with respect.  Once you walk indoors, you'll notice the decor -- it's decorated with Mexican Lucha masks and random thingies.  I likes!. . The food is decent.  This was my first time trying fish tacos.. my immediate thought when my roomie suggested those was "yuck".  But boy, was I wrong.  The fish tacos are heavenly and I have been craving them since!  The drinks are nice, too, gets me feeling all warm and snuggly inside.  The two times I've been there, I haven't had to pay for drinks so I don't exactly know the pricing, but I'm guessing it's not any different from any bar in West Hollywood.  . . The only complaint I have is that this bar is too small and it gets too crowded too fast.
