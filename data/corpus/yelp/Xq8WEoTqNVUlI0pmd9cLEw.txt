wth..i dont kno what these idiots are talking about...iv been here just a few times in 6 years and i still dream of their delicious  pizza.   best iv ever had....try the cheese pizza its all you need. gone there with a huge group and havnt had a problem with seating..altho they do open at 4pm and thers usually a line around 5. but honestly dont go there for a comparison to your pizza hut meat lovers pizza..try the cheese only and youll see what im talking about.... only beer is bottled pironi and another italian but theyr a bit expensive.dotn take the food to go, take the time to sit and enjoy
