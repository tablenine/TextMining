Thank you Mark and Roy! Because of you, I've given up my addiction to crackberry, and VH1 celeb-reality in hopes that I will one day hunt down the truck and manage to enslave you and your staff as my personal feeders.  . Let me first say that the idea of this truck is AMAZING! I heard about it months ago and it's since been like a myth... (Like the unicorn in Harold and Kumar 2 (BADDD movie)).  It's become a shining oasis wherever it parks and it's a beacon to the foodies that stalk it like a cougar would a mid twenties male.. I caught up with the truck last in Rosemead at the Glendon a little over a week ago.  I brought 5 friends who were unsure of the "myth" and like many others, we were all made believers.  . I made it a point to order everything I possibly could.. 3 short rib tacos, 3 spicy pork tacos, 1 spicy chicken, 1 tofu taco, 1 spam slider, and the kimchee quesadilla.  And that was just for me!  Other things around us included a short rib burrito and some sort of torta that I wish I had the presence of mind to order.. Each taco was amazing! Neither of the variations tasted alike and each new flavor was a journey and a discovery into what a taco could be.  Gone are the ideas of meat slapped into corn tortillas w/ pico and masked with the flavor of red or green sauce.  These tacos had a complete twist to them.  Each taco embodied all of my favorite things about Korean BBQ and did so without the smell.  The salad in the tacos never over powered the choice of meat.  The quesadilla was topped in a hot sauce that looks in the face of siracha and laughs with pity.  The spam slider was awesome topped with kimchee and toasted to snack heaven perfection.. It's easy to say that I love this truck.  I'm following it on Twitter and I like many others are eternally grateful for the genius of this truck, it's staff and its creators.
