Its only taken me what seems like forever to dine here. While its not nearly as thrilling as I expected, the food was definitely pleasing to the palate. . . The interior is attractive. I love the booth areas with their white sheer drapes flowing from the ceiling. The floor seating area may looked cramped, but once you sit down, its not so bad. . . Our waitress was really friendly and patient. I was so overwhelmed by everything she told me. There was way too much that she needed to explain which should have been printed on the menu. . . When we finally made up our minds, we settled on something easy, the 4-course party menu. For $37 each, I thought it was a hell of a deal...and just enough for two people. The menu included: . -1 glass each of passion ginger sangria (d-lish and a lovely way to end the meal) . -gazpacho shooters (surprisingly awesome!) . -guacamole (good...but I could tell that it had been sitting there...you know how guac turns that dark green when its been out??) . -A trio tapas plate of shrimp adobado, boniato and sweet plantain croquetas, and smoked chicken empanadas (the croquetas were the best!) . -ensalada verde . -grilled south pacific salmon (my mouth is still watering) . -marinated BBQ skirt steak (good but could have done without the potatoes...you get mashed potatoes on the side so its a little too much) . -grilled veggies . . As for drinks...I LOVE the fact that you actually get a big glass. I had the passion colado mojito. I'm not even kidding you, it tasted like cake batter. A bit weird at first, but after a while, I love it. I also tried the mojitonico. Yum. . . There's definitely a lot more that I'm curious to try here. Given that the 4 course meal was so good, I think I'll definitely take a trip back to Nacional 27.
