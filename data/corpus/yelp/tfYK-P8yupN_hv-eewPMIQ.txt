Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
LA has the best selection when it comes to variety in cuisines. Coming to Lala's was my first time trying Argentinian food and it won't be my last. Thank goodness my friend has fantastic taste because we cruised over here on a weekday and were seated immediately in the patio section. Let the grubbin' begin! . . Started off with a few heavy poured drinks and the complimentary bread with a dipping sauce full of bold olive oil flavor. Now onto the entrees. I ordered the A la Provenzal ($10) - grilled chicken topped with at least a bulbs worth of sauteed garlic and parsley. It was slightly dry but the flavors made up for it. My side request was a green salad with the best house dressing. There was no heat or spice in my dish but it was still full-flavored .... just how I like 'em! . . Service was attentive from the waiter and servers. The only minor problem was the spacing between the tables; little bit too close for comfort. No sharing secrets here! . . Overall, the restaurant and night was excellent!
