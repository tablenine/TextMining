Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Overrated. I've been here twice and both times I have been unimpressed. Pink's Hot Dogs definitely does not live up to its hype. I think people only come here because it's a well-known hollywood landmark. That's the only reason why I came here at least. . . The line gets really, really long. Do not come here if you're short on time because you'll probably have to wait over 30 minutes. It's self-seating and there's actually plenty of seats available both on the inside and out back so no problems there.. . They do have a wide selection of hot dogs but I don't eat pork so my only choice was the Pat Morrison vegetarian dog. Okay fine, so maybe it's my own fault for ordering a vegetarian dog, but it still tasted like rubber.. and my other friends who did order actual hot dogs said it was just okay too. I did like the fries and onion rings though!
