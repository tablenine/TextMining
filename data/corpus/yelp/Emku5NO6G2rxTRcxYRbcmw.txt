Category: Mexican
I am generous with stars...sometimes. This was truly a three star restaurant. . We called ahead to make reservations at Uncle Julio's a day before so that we didn't have to wait. We corral our group to come in and they hand us one of those "wait until this thing starts frantically buzzing and lighting up" devices. Are you serious? Why did you take our reservation in the first place if you were going to have us wait? WHY!? . . We were seated a bit too close together for my liking. Our server comes and brings the chips and salsa. I must admit, it was really good. The chips tasted fresh and the salsa was just right. My coworkers looked like they enjoyed those frozen swirls(frozen margarita swirled with frozen sangria). . . I ordered the 3 enchilada plate, then my coworkers ordered theirs. Tell me why EVERYONE else got their food and mine was 10 minutes behind them. 10 MINUTES! The enchiladas weren't anything to talk about, so I won't. Everyone else seemed to think the same. So we all wrapped up the remainder of our food and some people didn't even want to bother taking this crap home. . . The prices are outrageous for Mexican food. Parking was valet only. They also added 20% gratuity to our tab. I am sorry but 20% gratuity is a perk not a necessity. I can honestly say, I will not recommend this place nor will I EVER return. Sorry Uncle Julio.
