Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
I just got back from lunch at Tepeyac, where I put my body through the cardiovascular equivalent of a triathlon. As I type this, I'm debating whether to close the door to my office and sleep it off for an hour, or just call it a day and head to gym to atone for my gluttony.. . To be fair, I have no one to blame but myself. I come here every couple of months for lunch with coworkers, and we all gorge ourselves beyond the point of discomfort. It's a barbaric ritual that I'm not entirely proud of.. . The funny thing is, I'm not a fan of burritos and the food here is inconsistent at best. So why keep coming back? For the same reason that I serve dry turkey every Thanksgiving -- it's comforting.. . A couple of words of wisdom. First, order the machaca burrito or machaca plate. Machaca is the name of the game at El Tepeyac.. . Secondly, and it's clear that I'm incapable of following my own advice here, draw a line down the center of your plate and eat only half.  Take the rest home.  There's no shame in restraint.
