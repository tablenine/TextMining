Restaurant: Cakes &amp; Ale
Category: American (New)
We had a delicious meal here when I was in town visiting from CA. I would love to give it 4 stars but can't for reasons I'll explain in a minute. I started with the bresaola salad which was a great combination of flavors.. savory cured meat, super fresh greens and tangy lemony dressing. I ordered the Branzino, asking first if it was a local fish - wanting to experience the locally sourced cuisine Cakes &amp; Ale promotes. The server said it was and I believed him. When I returned home and told a chef friend about my yummy local fish dish he told me branzino is a european sea bass and it was most likely farmed AND imported. I had such a nice time at Cakes &amp; Ale... good food, good service, nice atmosphere... so i was pretty upset to find I was misinformed about the fish. One of the reasons i'm willing to drop extra cash at places like this is because I believe in the mission of eating locally and sustainably and want to see more of it. If restaurants make this claim and assume customers are too ignorant to really know the difference, they do damage to the cause and to all of those who are working to be true to the idea and practice of caring for our planet through our food choices.
