I worship this bakery! Haha seriously, this is the most amazing place I have ever found. My first reaction walking in is anger (where have they been all my life?) which is then replaced with extreme happiness as soon as I see the array of assortments including: Éclairs, cheesecake, crème Brule, cupcakes, cheese rolls, cakes, cookies, muffins, bread.... (Mine! It's all mine!) . . I'm from the Bay area and we do not have a place like this, they have every kind of dessert you could ever dream of and it's delicious! Forget what I said about any other place, this is my one and only! The staff is super friendly, well organized and the line can reach out the door at times (which is how I discovered it) but it's soO worth it! . Try it and you'll understand.
