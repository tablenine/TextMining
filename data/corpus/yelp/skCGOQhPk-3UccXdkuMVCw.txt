It's about three stars. Got the bistec and adobada. . . The bistec wasn't full of onions. I got the idea it'd be like Versailles. Came with black beans and rice. Edible. Sauce was tangy.. . The adobada was super salty. Full-bodied smokey sauce with dry carnitas. Came with pinto beans and rice. Really hard to eat the leftovers even with some lime.. . Wonderful warm tortillas and crispy, oily chips with a mild and medium salsa. Love those. . . Waited at the bar for our Cinco de Mayo dinner to go. Sangria is drinkable. No fruit in the glass. Regia tasted like piss water according to my date. Well, that's a lager for you. Drinks were under $11 total. . . iono. These home-cookin' Latin American plates just don't do it for me so I'm sorry if this review is biased. I'll come back for the sopa and tamales as I don't care for pupusas. Probably not for a very long time after the DDD episode airs... Food network just ruins everything. hmph. . P.S. Ms. Gloria is super sweet and cute but that still doesn't make up for it. Can't wait to see the episode.
