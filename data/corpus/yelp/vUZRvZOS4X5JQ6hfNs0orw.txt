I dig the cheesy Dracula theme, but the food was just ok. I dont even remember what I ate aside it had a ton of garlic. We were seated in the "Lovers Lane" which was like being in a circus tent with weird people a few feet away. After we ate we took a stroll into Dracula's grotto which was kinda campy but had a really misplaced painting of Kramer. That was totally weird. Anyway, my favorite part of the night is when we tried to leave and the valet told us there was a $4.50 parking fee. We had $3 which we planned on giving him as a tip. He made us get out of the car and go to the ATM. Seriously? We just ate in the restaurant and he car jacked us for $1.50. Needless to say it was very funny looking back on it. Regardless of being car jacked, I probably wouldnt go back, it's corny but fun to get your fangs on for a visit.
