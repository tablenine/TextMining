Last Saturday night we had a friend from Ireland visiting us. Where to take him??  He balked at the "typical Irish-American tourist trap". He was proven wrong!! He loved it. He (used to) insist that you couldn't get good Guinness anywhere but Ireland. He loved his pints at The Grange. "A feckin' good pour" I believe was the quote. He commented that the taps must be cleaned constantly to get a good Guinness like that - good to know here in the ATL.  The food was delicious, the prices were good and the building is very cozy and pub-like. The beer selection offers a lot of choice - but if you can please an Irishman with his Guinness you have it made! We'll be back.
