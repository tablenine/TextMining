food is good but whatever. here's a star for that, you boners. their pr/blogger chick either has to shape up or ship out. i don't care if she's choi's sister. she writes like she's 14 and she's the reason i don't follow kogi on twitter. im not asking for AP style but just stop capitalizing your goddamn L's!!!!!!!! that's worth two stars right there.. . ALSO: i live in long beach, ever since kogi brought in the naranja truck they all of the sudden seem to think they don't need to come here anymore. guess what! i'm not driving to westminister or torrance just for your stupid expensive tacos! what shit!
