There's always a 45+ minute wait, even at 3 in the afternoon on a sweltering hot summer day. Because their ramen is just that good. We brave the crowds every once in a while -- and then go across the street for fresh almond mochi for dessert -- and always get one Ramen &amp; one Ramen + Tuna Sashimi combo. We always have at least SOME leftover soup -- which we bring home + heat up on the stove with not-so-fresh ramen (&amp; still tastes good). Oh yeah - I don't really like their ramen noodles themselves -- too al dente for me. But still a great find / local fave. It's an LA institution. The tuna here is much fresher / better than at the other branches as well - you eat the fresh tuna, I'll take the shorter wait over in Monterey Park...
