Restaurant: Baohaus
Category: Taiwanese
This is a pretty neat place. Interesting decor with some old family photos of the owners growing up. The prices are a little bit high for the food they offer, but it's tasty enough. I wouldn't be back to the LES just for Baohaus though.. . Is it authentic Taiwanese? I get mixed reviews from my Taiwanese friends. But it doesn't really matter. It's tasty enough and probably something most people haven't ever had in this country.
