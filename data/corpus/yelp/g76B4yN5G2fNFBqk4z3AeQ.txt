I admired the mac n' cheese but we bought a dozen cupcakes and verjus instead.  Its annoying to be in line behind someone who takes your selections.  My family said the cupcakes were dry and not as good as Sprinkles.  Some lady behind me came just to have her midwestern friends taste the chocolate marshmallow cupcakes so I left those alone.  They ask you how many cupcakes you want so they can choose an appropriate box but I didn't know.
