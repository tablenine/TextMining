The best of this restaurant is the kurobuta chashu in their noodles. It was close enough to tonkotsu ramen you could have in Japan because we are in LA, again sadly, but this place would be mediocre in Japan.. . Tonkotsu broth is not flavorful enough. The noodle doesn't have strong enough texture. Very very close though.. . I can only give this place 3 stars here because service sucks and the furnitures here are not comfortable. They don't want you to stay there for a long time, that's why. The server that was working at that time, who was very impressive being fluent in Japanese and English and all, but he can't  assume that people won't understand him when he keeps yelling "I'm soooooooo hungry damn!" in Japanese..... . For all the ramen fans on yelp, if you ever go to Japan, Tokyo area, do not miss the "Ramen Museum" in Yokohama. You will love it, and try one of the restaurants there that specializes in the tonkotsu soup.  Then you will know what I was talking about :)
