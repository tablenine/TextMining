I am really torn between giving Veerasway three stars versus four stars.  The menu has a lot variation to it, making it a great place to bring someone who has never tried Indian cuisine before.  I went here for Valentine's day with another couple who didn't claim to be huge fans of Indian food, but they found themselves ordering from the "Indo-American" creations section of the menu and they seemed to enjoy everything quite well.  Perhaps they are on the path to enlightenment.. . For myself, I was torn between too many options on the menu, so I decided to try two of the smaller dishes.  I had the rajma channa and masoor lentils.  The rajma channa was extremely flavorful with the perfect amount of hotness.  It paired excellently with the garlic naan.  The masoor lentils left me wanting something more; it was a bit watery and bland.  Not exactly what I expected.  The food generally tasted authentic and of good quality.  I wanted the portions to be larger, but I knew not to expect large portions at an Indian restaurant.. . The servers here seem to be extremely knowledgeable about the menu while at the same time lacking that sort of arrogance you would expect from a more upscale establishment.  Being a younger adult, I'm accustomed to receiving less than substantial service, but this was not the case at Veerasway.  Our server was happy to recommend Indo-American dishes to my friends as well as her favorite kind of espresso.  She seemed genuinely helpful to all of the tables she was serving, and for this reason I am giving Veerasway four stars.
