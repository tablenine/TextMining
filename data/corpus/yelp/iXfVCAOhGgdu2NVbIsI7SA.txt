If you are looking for cheap, good sushi, probably your best bet.  Not particularly imaginative or varied, and you will have to wait, but can get out for less than $20 per person.  Has the basic sushi selection, with good quality due to a very high turnover of fish.  Won't bowl you over like some of the higher-end places in and around Sawtelle, but much cheaper.
