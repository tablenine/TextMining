Being from Nor-Cal, we don't get too much glam... so walking into this place all I can sing in my head was... G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S! . . We were hoping to see Lauren Conrad or someone from the Hills because they hit up all the DolceGroup hotspots.  . . Sadly, we didn't run into anyone famous.  Its ok though, we had a fabulous time!  Our Geisha was mighty nice and its interesting to watch the wannabe Hollywood scene.. . The food and service at Geisha was outstanding.  We were seated promptly for our 9:30 reservation thanks to . http://opentable.com. .. . Despite the wack DJ, his attempts were recognized.   I guess he had to cater to the diversity in the crowd.  . . I loved the beats, but his transitions were no good!  Lucky for him, half the crowd was intoxicated by the atmosphere, not to mention the $12 cocktails.. . We enjoyed the food!. . FIVE stars for.... -Strawberry Fields. -Geisha Roll. -Heaven Roll. -Coconut Creme Brule!. . Thanks Geisha House for a hella good time!
