I came here with a couple of friends after work on a Friday evening around 7 PM and the place was packed! A sure sign they're doing something right! The portions are huge and the service is quick and friendly. I ordered one of their pasta dishes and a side of plantains and had enough leftovers to last me an additional 2 meals! 3 meals for under $20 (including tax and tip)? Not bad at all!. . Like all the other yelpers mentioned, if you come, you MUST order the plantains! Don't leave without trying them.
