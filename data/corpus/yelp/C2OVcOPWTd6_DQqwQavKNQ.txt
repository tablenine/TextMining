This is THE place to go for burgers in the city.  Whether it's during the summer and you sit outside in their huge tree covered beer garden or during the winter when you sit next to a roaring fireplace.  Consistently good burgers, fries, sloppy joes, onion rings and beer.  Service has always been great and prices have stayed reasonable for years.  If you're in the market for a good burger and want to experience one of Chicago's staples, check this place out.  Note: CASH ONLY
