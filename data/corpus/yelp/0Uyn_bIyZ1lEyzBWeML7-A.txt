Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
Friend and I walking around on a gorgeous Chicago afternoon ran into this cute restaurant that had outdoor seating. We weren't too hungry so we shared an appetizer: Roy's Canoe Appetizer for Two Tempura Spicy Tuna Roll (soooo delicious!), Vegetable Spring Rolls (good), Coconut Shrimp(also very good), Wild Mushroom Raviolis (delicious!).. . If anything, the trip was all worth it for the Chocolate Souffl√©. AMAZING.
