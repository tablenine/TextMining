As a true indication of how broke I am, the only reviews I have to write lately involve either Restaurant Week or Groupons. So, this is one of the Groupon reviews. This one couldn't have turned out better. Veerasway is solidly in my top 3 Chicago meals ever list. The food was perfectly cooked. We had the scallops appetizer, one of the speciality naans and a lamb dish. All were recommended by our server and I love it when servers make really strong &amp; dead-on recos. Loved the atmosphere, food, service and location. No room for improvement at Veerasway!
