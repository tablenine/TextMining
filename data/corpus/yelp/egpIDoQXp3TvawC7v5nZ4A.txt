I went here 2+ years ago, for a Yelp event and got completely hammered on cucumber Martinis. Um, yeah.. . I went here last week, not the least bit hammered, with my seven star companion. I noticed the interior was different. No more hanging chairs, and it doesn't look so "futuristic" anymore. It just looks kind of dingy and smeared. I was unsure how this white, shiny interior was going to age if it wasn't scrupulously maintained, and I'm thinking I was kind of right. It's starting to look worn out.. . I ask for a raspberry vodka and tonic. Much giggling and three trips back and forth by the waitress until she determines, that yeah, they have Stoli. Thought so, since I can see it sitting right at the bar. This wasn't problematic, as she was friendly and happy and attentive.. . The sushi was fresh and delicious. The rolls were good, except one had a biiiit too much mayo. A little too creamy.. . Overall, it was just solidly average. Though it was pleasant sitting near the open front on a beautiful day, I'm not sure I'd hustle back here. Unless I was in the area. Even then . . . meh.
