Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Ford's Filling Station was only ok.The sore spot for me was the prices, if everything had been, say, 40% less, then I would have given them 3 stars and eat there again. . Aside from being a little over priced, I did enjoy the food and the overall experience. Its in a great location, the mixed drink menu was interesting as was the dinner menu. To start,  I had the cucumber martini, which just delightful, and the table shared the mushroom and fontina flat bread; it was good, not  great. For my entrée I got the duck leg, the duck was a good portion and very tasting but it came with some crazy salad that I didn't like at all, it would have been nice if I had a choice of something else. For dessert we shared the smores, it really wasn't like a smore at all, it was more like some sort of candy bar with marshmallow on top, it wasn't very good. . In summation, I enjoyed my dinner but probably won't be going back.
