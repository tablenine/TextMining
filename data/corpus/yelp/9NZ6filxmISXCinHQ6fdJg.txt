This place is one of the best ive been to since moving to LA.  The ambiance in this place is just enticing. The floors and beautiful, there is a stream running under a glass floor with coy fish.  The bar makes great drinks and the band is usually having fun. But OMG! the garlic noodles.  They are sooooooo good.  I had the lobster mango salad. Yumm! And I ordered the dungeness crab.  The crab was good but a little too peppery for me. I also had the lobster which was succulent and went well with the garlic noodles. It tastes even better when you heat it up the next day and eat the leftovers!
