I have eaten at Rare many times now. Most of the time when I leave I comment that it is the best burger I have ever had. The other times I leave a little disappointed but I keep going back because they have the potential. Oh and the sweet potato fries with the maple dipping sauce is great. Service can be slow but well worth it and the pickles are also tasty.
