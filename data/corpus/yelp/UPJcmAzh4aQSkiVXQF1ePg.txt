Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Alcove was kind of hidden. It has a lot of patio seating and a few smaller tables inside. The weather was perfect for sitting out and enjoying a quiet breakfast with friends.. . Everything looked delish on the menu. I kept changing my mind about what to order. I built my own omelet, including salmon and veggies! In addition to the omelet, I ordered a simple orange juice.. . You go inside to order and pick your food. I wanted to take a picture of the decorations inside, including the HUGE wine glass they used as a vase.  However, I got in "trouble" by one of the workers. Ah well.. . Overall, I enjoyed the food despite the high prices. I'd come back to try it again.
