Yea, there are almost 600 reviews of this place already, but hey, why not? . . We left a wedding reception early because we wanted to make sure we got here before the craziness began.  But we got there too early- 3:30 PM.  Being from out of town, we didn't know that they closed between 2:30 and 5PM.  But since we live in Decatur, GA, we weren't going to leave without some XLB's in our stomachs.  . . So we hung out in the Tutti-Frutti yogurt shop/life plaza bookstore right next to it for a bit until 5PM.... . The die-harders (including us) were packed in the squarish entrance waiting to be let into the restaurant.  We got in, and ordered the following:. . 2 orders of normal XLB- The skin on these guys were pretty close to perfect- thin, elastic, and strong enough to hold a good amount of soup.  The flavoring of the meat and soup were very good- not too salty, but very flavorful. . Score: 4.5. . 1 order of crab XLB- The skin was the same as the above, but the crab filling was not very satisfying.  There wasn't nearly as much soup in these buns.  We wish we didn't order this one at all. . Score: 2.5. . 1 bowl of spicy beef soup- I mistakenly ordered the soup instead of the noodle soup.  My bad.  The taste of this soup was pretty darned good, with enough spiciness to make my head itch.  I wish there were more chunks of beef though.  There were probably 4 total, which were accompanied by boiled spinach. . Score: 4.5. . It's better to come here for lunch- then you have a chance at the small soup XLBs.  I wish we had more time to try those.  But the normal XLBs are good enough on their own to come out here regularly (if I lived here).
