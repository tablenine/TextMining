Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
seriously....i love porto's.  like love it.  i used to drive from orange county practically once a week just for the cuban sandwiches, fruit tarts, mariquitas, tiramisu, and blended vanillas.  . . plus....the bakery shop is awesome.  i've bought multiple cakes for celebrations, had a couple custom made and they were oh so cute.  and you can get a dozen cookies for like two or three bucks.  and who doesn't love choco chip cookies!?!. . oh yeah.  the pastrami sandwich is also oh so yummy.
