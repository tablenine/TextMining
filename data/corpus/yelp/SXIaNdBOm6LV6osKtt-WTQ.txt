Restaurant: The Bluebird
Category: Wine Bars
The Good: I am always happy when a winebar focuses with great intensity on their list.  The Bluebird's winelist is unique, varied, price concious and eco concious.  It is obvious that whoever created it loves it and treats it with the care and affection it deserves.  Their menu, ever changing, is seasonal and really captures the essence of what mother nature is doing at the moment.  Plus, the friendly and knowledgable staff will be more than happy to help you select one of their many glass pours to pair with it.  Their beer list is extensive and expensive, I feel.  While it's true that many of their offerings are exclusive to the Bluebird, I feel that the rest of them are priced a little over what one is used to paying elsewhere.. . The Bad: the kitchen is not always performing at 100%.  While I love their menu, I am always a little hesitant when I place an order.  Nine times out of ten, they deliver.  It's that tenth time that I can't seem to get out of my mind.  The only other issue I have with the place (which is a result of their popularity, hardly their fault and not something that can be changed) is how packed it can get!  Didn't you know I was coming?  Why didn't you save me a seat at the bar, Bluebird?  I guess I'll wait my turn.. . Keep up the good work!  The neighborhood needs you!
