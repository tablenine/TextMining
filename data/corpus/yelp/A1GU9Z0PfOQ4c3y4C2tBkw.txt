I would have figured a place like this, with such good reviews, could have handled a bagel and a coffee.  Both were very uninspired, bagel was dry and forgettable.  And I agree that the place may be shooting for "cozy" but it flirts with cluttered.. . I have lived in the neighborhood for some time, and ended up meeting someone for coffee.  Went in with high hopes and was not impressed.  I will likely venture back and at least give it another chance, but currently I am not sold!
