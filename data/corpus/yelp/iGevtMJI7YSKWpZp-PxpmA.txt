I was first introduced to this place from my friend Tommy. We had a meeting here and talked about the future of a performance theater that he was opening up called the Empire Amusement Hall (which is now closed). . The place was cool, I liked the characters sitting around the place...seems from every walk of life had come out that late night.... . Later I would return from time to time to sample different food. This place really does kinda have something for everyone...the food is actually pretty darn good too!...the staff is friendly and that is a plus considering how much they run around because the place is often packed.. . I really enjoy it here and definitely recommend it for those late night where are we gonna go to grab a bite to eat needs!. . I won't go as far as to say the food is 5 star stuff made by a chef from the kitchens of France...but I have never been dissatisfied, in fact considering this is kinda a diner type place...the food is actually pretty awesome. so far I have eaten their fish n' chips which comes with like 3 different sauces....and burgers...the patty melts are good...and the fried macaroni balls were good.... . other than that...i can only go by what i have seen...sandwiches looked good... . never saw any of their vegetarian stuff yet...but i am sure people eat it there all the time...and the mexican food i haven't seen yet either...
