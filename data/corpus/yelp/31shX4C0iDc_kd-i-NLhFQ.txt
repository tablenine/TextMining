Category: American (Traditional)
Ok I know this may be long in coming but I think others should know.. When HM first opened we were excited, love a good burger, but we don't always feel like sitting in a crowded restaurant. so we stopped in for take-out. Ok ,so the host wouldn't take the order not a big deal and fine the bartender ignored us for a very long time after being told we wanted to order take-out and all the while the drunks pushed us about but that's expected in a bar area, so by no means a down fall and ok fine, they refuse to take phone orders even if you pay prior to pick-up, again not a reason to not return, it doesn't help but not enough for me to take my business elsewhere. Why I have never returned was the response I got when I asked why the difficulty in placing a take-out order and the refusal for phone orders. The GM/Manager was so extremely tactless and stated they didn't that it was difficult to place an -take-out order and they didn't care about losing my business (and I was by no means rude I simply asked why and maybe when it would be easier). granted I am but one person but I never dine alone nor do I forget such arrogance. I spend my money at the other neighborhood businesses.. Food was ok, nothing to write home about but ok. Â 2Stars. Service -1star. ambience 1 star (too many drinks spilled on me).
