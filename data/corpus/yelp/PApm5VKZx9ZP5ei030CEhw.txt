I few months ago I stumbled on a Travel Channel program showing what their 10 best pizza places in the country are.  The Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder was one them.  Now I've been to Chicago three times before seeing this show and never heard a thing about these Pizza Pot Pies... so on my  4th trip to the Windy City during the week of July 4th, I made it a point to head out and try this unique pie!. . Got there around 7pm on Thursday July 5th and was told by the man in the blue shirt that there was a 40 minute wait for my party of four.  Although I expected a wait, I didn't expect the host to remember our name and where to find us... and trust me, I had my doubts... but a mere 20 minutes of sitting at the bar, he found us to take us to our table!  . . From then, service was very prompt and friendly.  We ordered a small Greek salad and Mediterranean Bread and four half pound Pizza Pot Pies!. . The salad was fantastic and served four perfectly!  But WOW, the Mediterranean Bread is soooooooo good! Draping way over the plate, the table acts more as a holder than the plate itself!  Soo soft and warm, perfectly covered with various Mediterranean herbs.  I can't imagine anybody not ordering a bread for the table.. . Then our pot pies arrived!  I personally enjoyed the presentation... they come on a tray looking like mushroom caps, then spooned out of the bowl to your plate in one quick movement.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms and ordered mine without the four huge shrooms.  I was expecting this pie to be greasy, but it wasn't at all!  The crust was a good thickness and chewy, no flakiness at all.  Sauce was very tasty! . . From here on out, all my visits to Chicago will include a meal at the Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder!  Oh Chicago how I love thee!
