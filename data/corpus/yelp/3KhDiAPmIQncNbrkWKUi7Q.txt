Restaurant: Roy&#39;s Restaurant
Category: Asian Fusion
I love Roy's! Love, love, love Roy's. I was introduced to the restaurant this year during restaurant week and have been in love ever since. The food and service is always top notch.  Our server last night was awesome - her name was Molly and the girl knew her sh*t!  I went with 4 others last night and we started with the Lakanilau Roll . and Blue Crab "Dynamite" Scallops (as recommended from our server, Molly). They both were awesome - the scallops especially. Just melt in your mouth goodness with a little bit of spice. SO good! . For an entree, I ordered the Garlic Tiger Prawns that came with gnocchi - it was very good! One of my friends ordered the Roy's Classic Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi and I was very jealous that I didn't order that for myself. It was amazing - so fresh and light, and the nuts gave it the perfect amount of crunchiness and the sauce made it all just melt in your mouth. I had one bite and I now know what I'm going to order the next time I go.  Everyone else enjoyed their dishes as well - this place has great seafood and the short ribs that my aunt ordered were just as awesome as everything else.  . For dessert, of course we had the chocolate souffle. It was good and I'm a huge chocolate dessert person - but I had one bite of this and it burnt my tongue...I guess that is a sign I should stop eating when I'm full! :-) . I will definitely bring friends and family here - it can get expensive after drinks - but $35 for a prix fixe with 3 courses is a great deal.
