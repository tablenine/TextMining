the food is amazing the pizzas don't seem to taste like any other. their tomato sauce tastes like actual tomato. I recommend Sunday brunch and ordering the salmon Benedict. also the arugula pizza is to die for. the finge sandwiches not so awesome but still ok. service is great and park in a nearby lot. the only bad thing is that the room is ridiculously loud and echoy
