Stopped by here for a cocktail the other night after the parking situation at Bar on Buena (our first choice) was making one of my friends go crazy after unsuccessfully looking for parking for 30 minutes.. . To our rescue comes the Fat Cat. Lots of parking right on Broadway. Hooray!  We loved it!  Big space that while busy was not packed. Interestingly diverse clientele and low and behold- three seats at the bar together on a Saturday night just calling out to us!. . They have a pretty good beer list ( what could be wrong with a place that has Delirium Tremens on tap?) and while the food looked good- I had to enjoy it vicariously as I was still stuffed on what I had eaten before our arrival.  The good news?  The food came out fast which was exactly what one of the friends I was with desperately needed. . . Service took a while to get going- but once it did- the bartender was on his game, was friendly, and made some good beer suggestions.. . Great place.  Good beer- a little north of my beaten track- but hey- when I am in the neighborhood?  I just found my new favorite place.
