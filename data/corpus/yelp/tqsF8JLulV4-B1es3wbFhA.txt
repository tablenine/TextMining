now i remember the origins of that gorgeous ass sandwich i had years ago. i was still a kid, remembering the taste of that beef french dip piece of heaven with that hot mustard. holla back!. . geez, this is the second time i ventured into this place. this time around i got the lamb, and since i'm of legal drinking age, got me a fat tire along with that. the time was 11 something, i hesitated and asked myself if it was too early for beer, then came to the conclusion that it's never too early for beer. . . any who, the food was just as awesome as the first time. . and now, that i know where the spot is and i can drive, i'll be sure to make this a regular thing. . . word.
