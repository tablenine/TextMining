Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Mama once told me "never to put my elbows on the table." That was one of my first few experiences with Roscoe's at this very location. I was just a youngster, craving for the well-seasoned (their secretive mix), piping hot, juicy fried chicken along with the sweet and hearty waffles.. . I love going there when they're at their busiest hours. That's when they truely get down to business and serve out fresh and piping hot chicken. That's when they perfect their eclipse, sunrise and sunset. That's when they pour out their "mama" desire to serve their babied fried chicken so well.. . I certainly prefer this location than the one in Pasadena as the service wasn't the same and they tend to mix in my eclipse as I'd rather see it in two layers.. . This is where I went when I visited L.A. from Chi-town for the first time and I loved it, for their chicken, for their uniqueness.. This was where I met Dwane Wade before the Lakers-Heat Christmas game.. "'scoe's #1 or #2 is all I need. Go there and get yourself an order! They're one of my faves for fried chicken and soul food along with M&amp;M.
