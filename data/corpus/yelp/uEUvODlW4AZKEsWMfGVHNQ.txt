I was here on April for my girls birthday, and we had a great experience! the food was a bit late, but it was all worth it. I had the Roasted Duck Breast &amp; Duck Leg Â and my girl had the Couscous "Royale" with Lamb Stew, Lamb Chops, they both were good. The place is very nice! Although we got our dessers, we ended up going for more desserts at "Little Next Door"
