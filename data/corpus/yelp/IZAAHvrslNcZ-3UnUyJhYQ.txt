I love this place. I'm a fishitarian and partner is a meat eater and this place makes us both happy. And I don't usually like salad that much. Seriously, this place is so good it makes me WANT to eat salad. $5 pranquester on tap makes it even better! Other than the beer (I mean, its not a chill and have a few cold ones kind of place) the tomato bread soup, spinach salad, arugula salad, and nicoise salad are among my faves.
