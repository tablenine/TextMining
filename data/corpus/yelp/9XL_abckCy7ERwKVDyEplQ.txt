Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
It's been a couple years since I was at Stinking Rose and boy has it changed.  I should've known when I noticed the restaurant was not as busy as it used.  Our waitress was good, she was nice and checked up on us a few times during the meal.  However, the people they have serving the food were HORRIBLE.  Lets see, the guy who brought out our drinks hovered over me with his tray of cocktails and managed to spill a few drops of each cocktail he handed down the table.  For a total of 7 cocktails!  He didn't feel it necessary to walk around the table to serve us our drinks.   No apology for every time I squeeled that I was getting dripped on.  Then our food comes out and the servers just hovered over our table waiting for us to move plates and appetizers so they could put our food down.  Great service there.  Might as well be a buffet if I'm going to serve myself and clean my own table.  The food was ok, not what it used to be and the portions definitely have changed.  I sure hope the one in San Francisco is as good as it used to be.  I will not be back to this location.
