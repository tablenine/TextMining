Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Milk has a very cute logo. Other than that? It was just O.K.. The baked goods are priced reasonably, and everything looks good, but taste-wise, it's just mediocre.. Nothing wrong with this place - just nothing great about it.. We tried as assortment of goodies, and all were fine. Nothing spectacular, and nothing horrible. Just middle of the road.. :-)
