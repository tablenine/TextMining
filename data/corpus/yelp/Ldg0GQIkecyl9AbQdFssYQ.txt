Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Don't even bother paying a vist to Toast on a Saturday or Sunday morning unless you're ready &amp; willing to wait for awhile. The place is relatively calm on weekday mornings if you're in by 10 or so, and that's the time to go. The staff is always friendly and the small size of the restaurant lends a real feeling of intimacy.. . Of course, it's doesn't hurt that the food is fantastic. They have delicious Eggs Benedict, and my mom swears by the mascarpone-stuffed French toast which is always chock full of stuffing and accompanied with fresh berries and grapes. Prices aren't bad, either, especially compared to most other brunch options in the area. Toast is one of my favorite places for a low-key late breakfast.
