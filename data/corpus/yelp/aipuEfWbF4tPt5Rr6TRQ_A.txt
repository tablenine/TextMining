I really like this place.  I've come here twice so far, and have gotten the fish and chicken "hot plate."  Really fresh and tasty ingredients, and they keep it simple.  Simple, but awesome, is always best in my book.  Their salads, and grilled veggies are really good, too.  That was the first time I've ever had parsnip or brussell sprouts, and I would've thought that I would not have liked brussell sprouts, but they were very good at this place.  . . If you're a fan of healthy eating, then this place is a great place to go.  I know that I will go back, often.
