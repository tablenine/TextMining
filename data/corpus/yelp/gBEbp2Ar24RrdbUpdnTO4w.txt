If you're not using 'free range' chicken, then it's NOT "Hainan Chicken."  It's a plate of mushy, bland chicken and rice.  AND, if this is the only "Hainan Chicken" you've ever had, then you've never REALLY had it.  Also, just take note the next time you go, and ask yourself...  Are there any older Chinese people here?  No?...that because they know this isn't the real deal.
