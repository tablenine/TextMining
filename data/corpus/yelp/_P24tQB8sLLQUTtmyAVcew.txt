Maybe there was too much excitement about this place, but it didnt impress me.  I got the Italian, and the bread was really hard.  The meats and toppings were good, but nothing spectacular.  I plan on trying again based on everyone loving it so much, but everyone at the office agreed the bread was incredibly hard.
