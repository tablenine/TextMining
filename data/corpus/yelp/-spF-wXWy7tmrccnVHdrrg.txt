Twas ok.....  I had a burger "The Juicy Lucy" and it was good.  It was late and not very busy last Sunday night.  1AM.  The waitress took quite a bit to get to me with a menu, because she was chatting away with a table.  But when she finally got to me she did  give me proper service.  They serve good looking shakes.  I say good looking because I didn't have one.  I just watched them make a few.  Its good food, good portions in a nice neighborhood.  I will go there again.....and hopefully have a shake.
