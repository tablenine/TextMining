After all the hype created by Man Vs food about this Sandwich place , we had few friends over who were very eager to eat Â at this place ...after waiting in the line for 45 minutes . We ordered some lamb and beef sandwich . The sandwich lacked taste , the bread was soggy , and the meat looked as if its been cooked long time ago . The pickled egg was nothing but boiled egg with a purple color .. This place was started in 1908 ..maybe during those days this food was extraordinary ..but 100 years certainly not .
