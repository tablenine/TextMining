Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
I walked in here with a friend after getting into the holiday spirit by shopping the streets of Andersonville and found Kopi to be a warm and very welcoming place for us to rest our feet! . . The waiters were extremely friendly, the chai super yummy, and the ambiance was perfect for conversation. Â It was just a perfect place to end a great day with a good friend and I am looking forward to coming back!
