All hype. Simple as that. Unlike most people, I didn't wait hours in line for this crap. My roommate brought over some during a late night run, and I was excited to finally taste what everyone's been raving about. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. There was no balance of sweet and salty flavors, all I tasted was sweet. The tortillas were not tasty at all, but what should I expect with it being an asian taco truck? All in all, I don't understand why people would waste precious time on this place. Perhaps it's just the fun in chasing the truck around LA. If you want tacos, get tacos. If you want Korean BBQ, get Korean BBQ! Don't mix the two then overhype the creation, generating a plethora of brainwashed Asian people claiming it's good just for the sake of pride. It's sad.
