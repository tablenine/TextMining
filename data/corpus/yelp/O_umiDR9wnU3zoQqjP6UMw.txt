After years of not having been here, I made a return visit recently and the pastrami sandwich was as good as I remembered in my head.  People in NYC constantly rave about Katz' Deli's pastrami sandwich, but for me, give me a #19 from Langers anyday.  It's in the ghettos and you really have no reason to be in this area, but make it a note to visit and try their pastrami sandwich.  It's worth it.
