Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Good hot dogs, but not worth the wait.  Expect to wait between 30 min and an hour before your order is taken because the lines are extremely long here.  However, the actual sausages and hot dogs are very flavorful here (they are made in house) and they have a huge variety of tasty toppings...For example my favorite, the mulholland drive dog, is topped with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, nacho cheese and bacon...definitely not for people who are the least bit health-conscious, expect to pass out within 10 minutes and be in a food coma the rest of the day...Overall, a worthwhile experience but I doubt I'll be going back because of the long lines...
