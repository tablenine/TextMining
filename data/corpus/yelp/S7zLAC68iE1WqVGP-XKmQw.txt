Restaurant: Birds Rotisserie Chicken Cafe &amp; Bar
Category: American (New)
I used to spend so much time in this neighborhood and have a very strong fondness for it so it's hard for me to write a completely unbiased review of Birds but I will do my best. The decor of the restaurant itself is IMO great! It's an eclectic mix of stuff that looks like it was hang picked from amazing garage sales and flea markets, mixed with some amazing black and white images of scenes from "The Birds", Alfred Hitchcock and the like. As for seating there are small tables inside along with some good sized booths and outdoor seating as well(this area does indeed offer some of the best people watching if you're into that). The bar, which is located on the southwest wall of the restaurant can tend to get rather crowded and rather loud so if you're looking for peace and quiet it's probably best not to sit at this end of the restaurant.. . The menu consists of mostly "bird" based dishes and classic americana side dishes. The chicken is moist and well cooked on it's own but the delicious side dishes are for me, what make the trip. I have had everything on the menu from chicken pot pies(served in a mug), to wraps(shrimp, chicken, fried chicken, etc...), delicious generously sized salads and the awe inspiring tower of onion rings!. . Beer selection is pretty good and well thought out but the wine list leaves something to be desired... All in all though the staff here is great, food is great and I always leave here full and happy. . . Birds, you have a fan for life!
