Restaurant: Gladys Knight and Ron Winans' Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Chicken - Good. Waffles - Good. Chicken and Waffles - GREAT!. . A true comfort dining experience. A must-have for those visiting Atlanta. It is a weird combination, but trust me you won't regret it.. . The wait time can be a little long and I'm not sure that they take reservations - unless its changed now.. . Cheers!
