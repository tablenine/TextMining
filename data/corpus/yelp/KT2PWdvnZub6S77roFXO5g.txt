Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
The ramen reminded me of Xoco's caldos, spicy and light that discreet juicy broth will FILL you up. Suggestion: stand up half way through your meal, assess your expanding tummy's liquid gorge-ness, take the rest home to avoid urban belly ache!  . . The (4) pork and cilantro dumplings were buttery, popping a plentiful richness of soft, savory pleasantries.. . The ramen plus half the dumplings and a side of kimchi came to $20 a person. You can spin that how you choose. Expensive for the neighborhood where you can get a $2 beer at Clyde's across the street.  Then again, quite on par to Kuma's and reasonable compared to new Bucktown charcuteries.. . But something rubs my belly the wrong way about the location and price point. Maybe it was the Infinity SUV conveniently parked in front of the door. That strip mall parking lot makes it real easy for all the Lincoln Park and Gold Coasters tourists to avoid a stroll past the empty storefronts, the Kennedy viaduct and the discount liquidation warehouse. . . In some ways the modest exterior presents itself as if the inside should be the New China Buffet where kids eat free and adults for 6.99.  Instead you  can get the same bloated potential only on fresh, local (organic?) ingredients, if you can afford it!
