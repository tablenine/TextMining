the rumors are true-the french toast is to die for and their portions are big enough to leave a team of linebackers full for the rest of the day. the bacon could have been crispier for my liking but everything else was worth the 25 minute wait, the servers crashing into my chair, the tight quarters, and yelling into my friend's face so she could hear me over the noise. but i was there for the food, not the customer service or ambiance.
