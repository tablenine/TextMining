Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
This place is hands down the most authentic thai cuisine in the city!  I have spent time in Thailand and lived with a wonderful thai couple.  The best soup is gow low moo sop.  thai northern sausage with sticky rice and beer or white wine is excellent.  byob, and the food is super cheap, so step it up and buy a nice german wine or liter of gruner veltliner.  Save room for dessert.  sweet sticky rice with fresh mangoes is money.. . I would eat here every day if it was closer to my house.
