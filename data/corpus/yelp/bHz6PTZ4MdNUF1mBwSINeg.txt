very elegant and classy restaurant... love how the patio is lit with mainly candles to give it a very romantic atmosphere..but hate the fact that people can smoke while dining in the patio. . . for wine, we had the Cardwell Hill Cellars Willamette Oregon 2006.. something that the waiter suggested because my boyfriend wanted something smooth and light. I usually like my wine more full bodied, but my boyfriend really liked it. so if you like a lighter wine, this is the wine!. . for appetizers, we had the marinated baby artichoke and half a dozen oysters. both very light, and tasty.. . my boyfriend got the rack of lamb, medium rare..and it was EXCELLENT. The lamb was done perfectly. i loved his dish. i had the monk fish and also very much enjoyed my dish. Both were really delicious!!!. . for dessert, we had some kind of flourless chocolate cake..omg. i loved it. it was rich, and dark, just how i like it!. . i would've really loved to have given this place 5 stars, but i was really disappointed at the fact that we made our reservation online for 8:45pm where they even asked us for a credit card in case for a no show. A charge of $25 per person would have been put on the card if we didn't arrive at the time of our reservation. And with that said, when we arrived to the restaurant ON TIME, we still had to wait for about 15 mins to be seated. How annoying. . . So besides the fact that people were smoking around us and that we had to wait. i loved the place. :)
