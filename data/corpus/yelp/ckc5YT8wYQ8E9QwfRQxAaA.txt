Restaurant: Furaibo Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Furaibo has got to be one of the best destinations in LA for a fun, relaxing meal you can enjoy with your crew.  . . While sushi is certainly still king in LA, Furaibo serves up awesome dishes you'd find at izakayas around Japan.  Think tapas style dishes perfect for sharing with selections arranging from grilled skewered meats (yakitori) to steamed egg mousse (chawan mushi) to agedashi tofu.  Paired with a cold Sapporo you and your crew will feast like kings.  And, if the party seems to just be getting started head next door to Blue Karaoke, where a little more liquid courage may have you belting out White Snake on stage in front of a hopefully adoring audience.
