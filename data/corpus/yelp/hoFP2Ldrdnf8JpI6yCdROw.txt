BEST XIAO LONG BAO IN THE USA.. NO MORE LINES.  they just expanded to a unit in back, with 2 floors of seating.  You get a seat pretty much immediately.. . there is no question as to their quality.  Both the normal xlb and crab xlb are awesome.  A/A+ grade.  Most consistently paper-thin skin, always chock full of soup in each dumpling.  perfect filling.  fast service.  All the dumplings there are good, even the non-shanghai dumplings.. . I think the quality has improved at the Arcadia one--the skins are more consistent than before.  The Taipei original store still holds a special place in my heart though, and I still remember them being better there.  But the frequency I get either one is still pretty far apart, so I can't say anymore.  But you don't need to go anywhere else, if you live near arcadia.
