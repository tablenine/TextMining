Wow!  189 total reviews for this place?  Truly popular place and I can see why!. . I had the opportunity to eat here at the UYE sponsored by Nicholas N.  I wanted to try other raumen joints because I've done the pho thing this summer and so I thought I should see what authentic raumen dishes were all about verses the Cup-O-Noodles or instant top ramens I've had over the years!. . I ordered the Daikoku Raumen Special.  I was confused at the spelling of "raumen" as I've always seen it spelled "ramen".  Oh well, you learn something new every day!  My order consisted of raumen noodles, a boiled egg, bamboo shoots, green onions, bean sprouts and black pork which is known for its tenderness.  The broth is made by boiling pork bones in soy sauce for a whole day.  Somebody was slaving over a hot kitchen stove!!!  Although the result was definitely worth it because the broth was pretty tasty!  . . The place is a hole in the wall and got really crowded with people waiting inside and outside the restaurant so it was good we got there at 5:00 when the wait wasn't that long.  The motif is done in a 60s theme with 60s movie posters and the wait staff was friendly and attentive enough.  I'd go back to try other stuff on the menu as Daikokuya does raumen up right!  I'd highly recommend trying this eatery.  Really good eats!  Thank you Nicholas for turning me on to this gem!
