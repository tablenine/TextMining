Restaurant: Green Sprout
Category: Vegetarian
I don't know why it took me so long to try Green Sprout. Thinking about how much time and money I've wasted on other, lesser chinese restaurants makes me a little ill.. . I went to Green Sprout last night for the first time. I had been putting off trying it for months, because I was under the impression that it was a little pricey. WRONG. Dishes average about $7. I got the vegetarian sesame beef. My friend got the tofu skins stuffed with bean sprouts. We both had a bowl of hot and sour soup. It was all delicious and the total bill was $21.. . I'm never going to another local chinese restaurant. Green Sprout is where it's at.
