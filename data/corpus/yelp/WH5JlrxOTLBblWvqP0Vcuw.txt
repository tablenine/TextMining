Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
Papi's Midtown is the true deal for Cuban food in Atlanta. Born and raised in Miami, I've eaten Cuban food all my life. Imagine my disappointment when I came up to the ATL and found Mexican food everywhere but not a single Cuban place. Today was a good day. . . Papi's menu is short and sweet, and has all the things that remind me of home. I had the Monday special (chicken fricasee with arroz con frijoles) and yuca with mojo, which was delicious. I can't wait to go back and try the other things. They also have platanos, ropa vieja, medianoches, cuban sandwiches, bistec, platanos, and best of all, croquetas!!! Prices are affordable, with almost all the entrees and sandwiches under $10. And while I was leaving, I saw them carrying in cases of Jupina, the pineapple soda. I was soo excited because I drank that stuff growing up and I haven't been able to find it outside of Miami.. . I highly recommend Papi's for Cuban food. It's no Versailles, but it's really good!
