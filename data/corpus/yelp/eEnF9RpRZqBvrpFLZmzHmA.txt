Despite some of the other reviews for this place I went, because some of the choices of sausages enticed me. I ordered the duck, bacon and jalapeno sausge which was pretty good, but it seemed too much of an amalgamation of flavors to distinguish them from each other. It still had a unique flavor and tasted great with the bleu cheese, bacon dip. The beer selection here is great. I hardly see any places on the west coast with belgian ales on tap, unless it's a snazzy overpriced bar. The employees are nice and I heard they will be expanding soon, which will be interesting.. . I would really give this a 4.5, because although my sausage wasn't drop-dead good, my gf had the chicken, mango jalapeno which was incredible. I believe I will try the alligator pork next time.
