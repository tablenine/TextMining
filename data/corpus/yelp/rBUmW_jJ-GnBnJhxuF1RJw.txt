Maybe I was a little too excited to eat here, because it didn't meet my expectations.  But, regardless, the food was good, and at restaurant week prices ($44 for dinner, originally $58), I was glad I got to try it.. . 1st course: salad bar. . There was a wide variety of salads, potato salads, veggies, etc.  They even had salami and cheese!  But, there was no corn....or eggs...and the asparagus looked like it was on steroids.  I don't know...something just seemed...incomplete.  . . 2nd course: MEAT. . Oh. So. Much. Meat.  Cheese encrusted pork, sirloin, filet, pork sausages, chicken sausage, beef and pork ribs, etc. etc.  Wow.  My favorites were the pork ribs and all different sirloins.  The pork sausage was pretty good too.  But honestly, the meat wasn't all that SPECTACULAR.  For $44, I would expect a little more to tell you the truth.  But, I'm being nit-picky here.  It was good.  Just not $58 good.. . The fried bananas WERE SO GOOD.  5 stars just for that.. . 3rd course: dessert. . I tried the flan and the tres leches.  Yum!  The flan was ok, but the tres leches was awesome.. . Definitely an experience, but I think once is enough for this meat lover.  Oh and valet is a ZOO.
