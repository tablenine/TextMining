Ordering straight off the menu can be the kiss of death at a sushi place, but in all honesty why?  I don't have to tell the chef at a French restaurant what kinds of meat I like.  Certainly sushi is best when you've created a rapport with the chef making it, but Sushi Gen has shown me the glowering hole that is table service at all too many sushi places.. . It's not that any of the fish was bad, it's just that other than my wife telling me her toro was fantastic, this place was no better than any of a hundred of other sushi dinners I've had around LA.  Fish was fresh but boring.  My sashimi dinner was half tuna pieces of varying sizes in three separate areas on my plate--not including the spicy tuna.. . The price wasn't as high as I'd expected, but I won't be going back anytime soon.  If the other four or five places in the area don't hold up I'll just skip sushi in Little Tokyo all together.. . Again, not bad, just not special.
