I'd read a decent review in Creative Loafing, and decided to check this place out. Strangely, on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, the restaurant had almost no customers (maybe three tables were sat around 1pm). . . We sat outside, at a flimsy table on the patio. We ordered the ceviche appetizer. The menu didn't specify what exactly was in the ceviche, and I didn't think to ask (I'm used to tilapia or other white fishes). It turned out do be octopus, which I don't like to eat. It would be nice if the server made it a point to tell her customers about the octopus, since it's not a commonly eaten food. . . The service was poor in other respects, too--no water refills and infrequent visits. The food was OK, but nothing special. They hardly give any salsa for dipping, which was quite disappointing for a Mexican restaurant.
