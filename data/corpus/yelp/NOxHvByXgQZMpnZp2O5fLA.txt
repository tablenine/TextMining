Loved this place!  I tried it for the first time on Saturday night and was pleasantly surprised.  I liked the communal seating, trying the different types of finger foods and tasting a good variety of wines.  Service was attentive and we even caught a glimpse of Kevin Rathbun making a quick visit.  The crowd was a bit more yuppy and Buckhead than I expected, but they didn't ruin the experience fortunately.  The selection of 3 cheeses plate was yummy and the meat plate did provide you with a rather large portion.  I will definitely be heading back.
