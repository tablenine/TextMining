Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I've been here several times. For some reason, it's not the experience of eating a Pink's hot dog that I usually remember. It's the feeling before and after.. . Before: hungry, confused, wtf-line?. . After: nauseous.. . The whole in-between: pretty average. Just one of those places you "have to go" while in LA. If ever you want to take someone from out of town to a good dog place, take them to Wurstkuche in downtown. A helluva more fulfilling experience.
