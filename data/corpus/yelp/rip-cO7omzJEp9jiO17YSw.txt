Pho is without a doubt my favorite food on le planet.  Let it be known that I am half Jewish, half Chicana, but pho trumps burritos AND matzoh balls in my opinion.  Pho real.  Menudo for hangovers?  Yeah no it's pho.. First of all, even when it's 9:00 on a Friday and every table is taken, there's hefty amount of folks spilling out of front door into the SMALLEST PARKING LOT OF ALL TIME I don't think I've ever waited more than 10 mins max.  Service is lightening fast, even during aforementioned circumstances.  I feel bad reviewing WHOLE menu as I generally stick to the pho.  However, cold vermicelli noodles w/ lemongrass steak????  Heh-vun.  And the fact that it comes con spring roll, well!  My favorite phos (phos??? ) are the chicken and the tofu.  I am more than meat friendly but sometimes I prefer a veg option. like in the summer when it's hot.  The broth is perfectly salty and savory, full of anise and lemongrass flavor.  The quickly deliverd plate of basil, limes, and the raw jalapenos is bountiful.  It's a lot of flavor packed into one big bowl.  One of the reasons I stamp 4 stars vs. 5 is that the amount of chicken in the chicken pho is meager at best.  They need to add just a smidgen (see?  half Jewish) more white meat in that broth.  Tofu same.  On rare occasions I do enjoy the raw meat that cooks in the hot pho broth, but rare-ly do I stray from the chicken.  Another reason for 4 vs. 5?  They don't take my visa/MasterCard debit cards!!!  This is so frustrating I considered typing in all caps!  If I carried more cash, I'd eat there more often... who carries cash anymore????  Pho Cafe's PHOne number is phogrammed in my mobile PHOne.  Menu in the glove box.  Any questions?
