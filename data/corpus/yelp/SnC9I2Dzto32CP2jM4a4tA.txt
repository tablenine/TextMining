I went here on a weekday night. We got seated right away, and I have say that the evening was an extremely relaxed, pleasant, delicious one. . . The food was expensive, in that "everything is tapas so that we can feel justified in charging you entree prices for tapas portions" way. But all of the food that we had (and we had a lot) really was complex, unique, and delicious - food that clearly took a lot of thought and effort, rather than "Yo. Here's your sauteed mushrooms - sucker!!!" . . The service was excellent (minus a little inexplicable "oh, I'll just stick this piece of bread in my armpit while I perform this small table rearranging task, then attempt to serve this piece of bread to someone at your table" on the part of the bread guy. Keep an eye on the bread guy if you're armpit skittish.) Â . . Rather inexplicably, they did have one fish entree (sorry - did I say entree? I'm sure it is about thimble sized, once you actually order it.) Perhaps to appease all the vegetarians who eat fish and chicken all the time, and who don't understand the lack of dead animal at an ostensibly "vegetarian" restaurant?. . So, I guess this is the reverse of most restaurants. Instead of one vegetarian entree and 8 meat ones, the tables are turned so that any vegetarian-loving carnivores get a taste of what it's like to attend Every Other Restaurant On Earth?
