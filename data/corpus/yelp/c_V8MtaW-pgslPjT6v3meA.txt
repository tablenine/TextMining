Pretty laid back place to grab breakfast or brunch.  Egg croissant sandwich is tasty.  Don't get the pancakes with fruit cooked in it.  It creates a very soggy pancake.  Ask for the fruit on the side if you want it.  Otherwise, the taste and texture of the pancake is good.  Overall a good breakfast/brunch place.
