I really wanted to like this place because it is so charming.  But the service was super slow.  I mean SLOooooooW!  It took forever for someone to take our drink orders, and then actually get them.  And when we finally got our food - the eggs on my eggs benedict were well done, as hard as a rock.  I didn't send it back because we were running late (due to the slow service).  Not a good way to start the day :o(
