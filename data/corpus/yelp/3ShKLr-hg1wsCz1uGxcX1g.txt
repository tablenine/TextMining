Restaurant: CUT
Category: Steakhouses
CUT is fine dining, but the atmosphere is pretty casual.  As part of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, this Wolfgang Puck restaurant doesn't seem to have a dress code and plays pop music.  I liked that the experience wasn't stuffy.  Our server was relatively young, but he was polite, accommodating, and relaxed.. . As for the food, I really liked the appetizers because that's where Puck shows his talents.  I had the Bone Marrow Flan.  Two cut bones filled with creamy beefy flan, topped with a small salad of onions, cilantro, and capers, and garnished with a mushroom chutney thing.  Spread it on toast, and it was great.  My friend, Kumar, got a warm asparagus appetizer that he enjoyed.  It came with a fried egg!  Jenn got a tasty apple salad with pomegranate and blue cheddar cheese.  . . We all got Nebraska corn-fed beef for our steaks.  Yeah yeah, we didn't dish out for $120 Wagyu, but nonetheless, any steak here should be good.  It definitely wasn't the best steak I had (the best steak belongs to Mastro's).  Jenn really liked her petit New York strip.  The steak was good when it came out hot, but as it cooled down, it toughened up.  It wasn't as tender as others I've had.  And for $50+ a steak, it should have been better.  I suspect the zip code dictated the price in this case.  A comparably-priced steak at the Costa Mesa Mastro's is far more tender and flavorful.. . We opted out of dessert, but we stayed to converse over Scotch and Port wine.  The server was nice to bring out some pieces of chocolate, peanut brittle, and ginger lemon tarts.  Tasty, free dessert!  Atmosphere and appetizers were the highlights here.  With the steaks, unless you go for the $100+ Wagyu stuff, go somewhere else.
