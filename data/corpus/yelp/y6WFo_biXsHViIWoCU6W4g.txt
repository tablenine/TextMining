This is Satan's new favorite place.  Satan likes pretty courtyard setting and atmosphere in general.  Very different than where Satan lives. . . Satan think food is very tasty at Alcove.  Brunch very popular with Satan, because Satan don't have anything else to do Sunday morning.  Very large portions and friendly servers.  Satan also like to come here at night for coffee and dessert.  Red velvet cake best dessert Satan try.. . Only thing Satan dislikes is lack of parking in Los Feliz area.
