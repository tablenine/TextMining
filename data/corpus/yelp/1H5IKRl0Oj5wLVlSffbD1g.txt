The ramen here is pretty fantastic.  The broth is tasty and the pork is tender and flavorful (I don't normally like pork).   I would give this place a 5 but there are a couple things that could make it better....  The wait takes FOR-EV-ER... Make sure you prepare to wait awhile.  The parking around there sucks, but it is downtown, what can you do?  And finally I like my ramen spicy, you don't really get that option here.  By the way, what is with the sign in the window that says No outside food or drink... Does anyone do this???
