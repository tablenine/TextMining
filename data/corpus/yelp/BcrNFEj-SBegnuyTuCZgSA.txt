I went back to BONDST this past weekend after not having gone for a while (I used to live in NOHO and would go allll the time). This place is amazing. Best plates include the Spicy Tuna and Lobster Tempura Roll, the Sea Bass and the Chinese Walnut Shrimp, oh and the Spicy Crispy Shrimp appetizer is definitely good to start with (I like spicy food fyi though). For desert, I pretty much always get the Lychee Panna Cotta and it never disappoints.. . Only downside to this place is it is pretty expensive, but for what you get there, don't think twice about going. One of my favorites.
