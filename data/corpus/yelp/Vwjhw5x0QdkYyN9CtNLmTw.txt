Ice cream, pastries, chocolate, cupcakes and cake, oh my!  This place is fantastic and all homemade!  Try the Triple Chocolate Shake and the blue velvet cake, but really once you go in you might leave with 5 or more items. . Their salads and sandwiches are good too.  The goddess dressing for the cobb salad is outstanding.  I wish they sold it by itself.
