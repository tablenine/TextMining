I just love this place.  Have gone here when I lived in Glendale, and now that I do not live in the area anymore, I always stop here now when I pass through town.. . I love the potato balls, I love the homemade juices, I love the pastries, I really like the empanadas.. . I really enjoy Portos!!!  You gotta try if for yourself to understand!
