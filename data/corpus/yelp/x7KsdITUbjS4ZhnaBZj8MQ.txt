okay... warning, walk PAST the bakery section and have your meal first because if you don't, you'll end up buying everything on display.. . that being said... here's what to order:  potato pancake (trust me on this one, its GOOD), any of their mile-high stacked sandwiches... hell, everything I've had there is good.  Good for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night!!!
