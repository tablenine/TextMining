Restaurant: Trader Vic&#39;s
Category: Hawaiian
It's five o'clock somewhere- oh, at Trader Vic's!. . I adore the tiki theme.  My friend who dined with me ordered a drink and the drink came with the cutest naked Hawaiian man.  Not a real human (lol), but a miniature decoration.  Now, that's a treat I won't resist any day.. . My mom always used to say, "You cannot go too wrong with decent hotel restaurants."  Likewise, their food is quite impressive.  I ordered the Trader Vic's Prawn Curry, which blew me away.  It comes with 7 toppings and you can mix them up in your curry.  Curry was a bit spicy for me, but my friend didn't have any problem with the spice.  For dessert, I highly recommend the Polynesian Snowball, if you like coconut and vanilla ice cream!
