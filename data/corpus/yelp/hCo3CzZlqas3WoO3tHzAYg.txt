Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
The pho is not that great.  I went on a sunday afternoon and i felt like the broth was watered down.  The noodles were overcooked.  The grilled pork chop rice dish is an excellent choice for people not desiring Pho.  Great menu selection - this is a good place to take people who are new to vietnamese cuisine.  . Very hard to find a table if you go during rush hours.  Its always packed on the weekend.
