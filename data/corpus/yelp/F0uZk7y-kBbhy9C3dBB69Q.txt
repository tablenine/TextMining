Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
At one time, I thought that this place was the best Shabu Shabu restaurant in LA. But then came Kagaya. But still, I guess I can say that Shabu Shabu House is the second best. Sure, the joint is a whole in the wall type of a place, and overcrowded as hell. But the quality of their beef and vegetables are very top notch, more so than many other Shabu Shabu places. They have pretty fresh slabs of meats that are bought and grinded daily, so it doesn't have that frozen quality to it at all. What's also great is that their dipping sauces are also very good, especially the sesame peanut sauce. Seriously, that sesame peanut sauce is their secret weapon because it has a pretty addictive taste when matched together with the cooked beef. Wow, talk about delicious.. . I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is tasty, hearty, and it's pretty darn cheap as well. The only con is that the line really can take up to 90 minutes at times. But my 4 star rating goes to food taste/quality only.
