So I have been reading about this famous burger for a while now.  Even in NYC, I heard mention of the H&amp;F burger.. . Last weekend I decided that it was time to put aside my fear of cramming myself in to the tiny space of Holeman and Finch, and give the burger a try.  The burger was so perfect;  the flavor, the moistness of the meat, the melted cheese, onions, pickles.  MMMmmmmm.  Oh, and that house made ketchup and mustard!  True perfection!  The fries were also made to perfection as well.  . . Now for my drink;  It was an amazing Champagne Cocktail which included Champagne with fresh lemon juice, a geranium liqueur and rum.  You would think that based on the ingredients, this would be a very sweet concoction, but it was light, slightly tart and very refreshing with just the perfect hint of sweetness.  LOVED it!!. . Can't wait to go back and let the mixologist mix up another fantastic beverage for my consumption!!. . On another note;  So sorry to hear that H&amp;F Bread has closed.  We were on our way there today and decided to look for a menu online when we read that they are now only open for wholesale business.
