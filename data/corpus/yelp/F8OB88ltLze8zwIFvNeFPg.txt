Ann Sather is great, and it's right around the corner from my apartment, which makes it extra-great.  Go for the cinnamon rolls.  The cinnamon rolls are undeniably spectacular. 2 OF THEM. COME. WITH YOUR MEAL. (if you order an egg dish).  How can you beat that?? It's like 2 brunches in one.  Who could eat all of that?? And the rest of their food is good too.  My parents always get the lingonberry pancakes and seem to like them quite a bit.  It can get very busy, but I have gone probably 10 times and have never had to wait more than 15 minutes. I don't know how, but there it is.  Plus, I like the bustling atmosphere. It's a good solid breakfast place.
