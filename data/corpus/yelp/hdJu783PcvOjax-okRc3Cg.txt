We were hesitant to give it a shot.. dont be hesitant!!!!  This place is amazing.  The quality of food is unbelievable, and it arrives in like 5 minutes.  We got to meet the chef Bill Kim, soooo nice.  I agree with him, you can't find this food anywhere in the country.. I've had almost everything.. korean bbq amazing, meatball sandwich superb, plaintain chicken sandwich on tuesdays special.. to die for.. love the atmosphere
