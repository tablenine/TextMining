Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
This place should be called Moody's Dank Pub. It has to be one of the darkest dismal caves I mean pubs I've been too in awhile. I wonder if it so dark for a reason. Makes me a little scared to know what I've eaten there!??! Even the garden is well hidden from the sun. It must be where mole people go.. . The Garden is an adventure on it's own, you go blind walking between the bar and outside with the sun out, you have to fight to get the waitresses attention, you have to fight your own stomach because it takes awhile for the food, and then you have to fight the squirrels and pigeons for your food.. . I don't recommend the chicken sandwich cause it's nothing to rave about. I gave them a star for being within walking distance and a star for being able to hold a large capacity of a crowd inside and out.
