Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
My friend, Erin, recommended this place cuz she said the food was good and the prices were great.  She was right.  I loved the place as soon as I walked in just because half of the restaurants walls were windows and the art on the other walls called my attention.  So what was awkward when the waiter came was that he had a friend who I insisted I knew!!!! Then I realized she used to work at Veggiebite and the first time I went there she was my cashier. Hehehe. Small world. . . We started with appetizers.  I ordered the crispy rolls  and my friend ordered the japanese gyoza.  We were both happy with what we got. I fell in love with the crispy rolls and the sweet sour sauce that accompanied them. YUM!!!!  For the main dish I ordered the Red Curry Rice plate with tofu and my friend got the pad thai.  So I wasnt too excited about my rice and tofu.  It wasnt as spicy as I expected and the coconut milk sauce was overpowering!!!  My friend described her pad thai as "different." LOL. . . I liked the place overall but next time Im just gonna try something without coconut milk because that was a real turnoff. The smell of it simply bugged me.
