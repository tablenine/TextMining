Restaurant: Ria&#39;s Bluebird
Category: Southern
Best breakfast in town hands down. Has something for EVERYBODY! I'm a vegetarian going on 14 years. i enjoy the tempeh \tofu dishes as well as the egg dishes. Ria has created her own type of southern breakfast cuisine that dominates all other imitators. a true Atlanta staple for someone who's seeking true southern cooking. . ps. best service Ive ever had.
