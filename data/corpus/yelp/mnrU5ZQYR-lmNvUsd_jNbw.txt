Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
I heart ramen.. . The ramen here is legit, authentic &amp; cooked to order...they ask how you want your noodles prepared, if oil is ok, what base you want for your ramen, if you want onions &amp; ginger. I ordered the Hakata ramen w/ wontons (for an additional $2) &amp; spinach ($1). It was super oiishi &amp; for an extra bowl of noodles (kadaema) its only $0.50 more!!! what what!!! Everything was cooked to perfection! =) the base wasn't too salty or oily &amp; the noodles were very tasty.. . For appetizers, the japanese onion pancake w/ ketchup sauce is really yummy for only $4! i'll have to come here for lunch next time for the lunch combos!. . The prices are pretty reasonable &amp; the service here is great! You're greeted by everyone once you walk through the door w/ "IRRASHAIMASE!!!!" &amp; when you leave they make sure to say "ARIGATO GOZAIMASU!!!!" =)
