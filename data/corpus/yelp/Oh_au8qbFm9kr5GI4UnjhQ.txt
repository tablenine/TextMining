Seriously don't get the hype. It's decent, super cheap junk food, but it's definitely not extraordinary and not close to the best hot dog I've ever had. The hot dog is smoooothered in soggy fries, which basically dominate the meal. I usually only come here because I'm dragged along by friends... It's a 10-15 minute drive from where I live. Don't bother coming out here if you have to travel any farther than that, I'm sure there's equally good (or better) hot dogs somewhere out by you.. . Big eye roll at their no ketchup rule, by the way. You have no room to be pretentious when your establishment is run by a dozen ex-cons. No, seriously... Straight up ex-con lookin' motherfuckers. Is it a gimmick or something? So bizarre.. . The fanatical hype around this place is yet another fine example of how people are sheep, in my opinion.
