Groan. Creak. Ouch. Meat.. Groan. . Meat.. They keep it coming, it's good, the salad bar gives you that teeny bit of legitimacy (hey! I'm gettin' mah greens!).   And ah, those skewers.  I love it when Zorro serves me my food. Ah, the tender tastes of filet mignon, the bite-sized chicken hearts, the gamine goat bits (yes, I meant to say gamine...it works for me).  Things have a way of getting out of hand here...it's all very Tom Jones (rent the movie on Netflix if you're a foodie).. In any case, I'm still recovering, but in a good, meaty, macho girl way. . Go early enough to still have all the selections in the salad bar, but late enough to miss the grubby kiddies and their meat-induced hyperactivity (it's worse than a sugar high, I found).  There will be no room for desert, and your body will work at slowly transmogrifying the protein to fat over the next three or four days.  But life is short and Brazilian Buffets help make it worth living, so throw caution to the wind and have a good time at Fogo de Chao.
