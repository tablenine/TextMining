I love this place! Their wings are good, and hooray for me being 21 I get to drink their Kirin beer that comes from a keg! Tastes so much better than the bottled Kirin.. . Their eggplant is so freaking goodlicious along with the steak with the butter.. My damn so good I want to come back already!. . Beware. College students are hungry and they are always crashing this place up! Gotta come early for seats!!!. . And good luck finding parking because it SUCKs!
