After having Texas BBQ few years ago, I've been pretty rough on the Southern BBQ.  In fact, I've pretty much avoided it all together since it never seems to measure up.  Either way, I figured I'd give it a shot since some fellow Yelpers were going too..      Not Texas BBQ, but actually just as enjoyable!  Probably the first good experience with Southern BBQ I've had.  Kyle and I split the pork and chicken plate with Brunswick stew and mac n cheese.  The pork and the Brunswick stew were definitely the stars of the meal.  Probably the best pulled pork I've ever had.  Well smoked, very tender, and perfectly complemented by the house BBQ sauce.  I also love that the sauce had a little heat.  It was one of those meals that left me craving more as soon as I left.  I really hope that I can plan a return trip before I leave Atlanta!
