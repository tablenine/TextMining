Is there anything at all wrong with Rise-N-Dine?  I think not.  I've now been three times and the ONLY thing I don't like is leaving.  The staff is amazingly on point, warm, friendly and FAST.  The food?  It is simply the best breakfast in Atlanta.  And as long as I'm raving...the experience is probably the reason I don't want to leave...I feel home.
