Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
The food was really... OK. But the service was horrible and it was a cluster. I went in with high expectations because of all the reviews and such, but honestly, you can get better dumplings at a similar restaurant in San Gabriel. The only thing they have going for them is the variety in the types of dumplings they have. I don't see myself going back there. I think it's overrated.
