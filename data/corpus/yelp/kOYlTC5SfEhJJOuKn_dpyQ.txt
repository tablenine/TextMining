Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
I went to Sticky Rice after moving a bunch of things into my new apartment, so maybe I was just angry and tired and needed a lot of attention...but I swear, the servers may have been nice but rarely came to the table. Drives me crazy.. . Regardless, the prices are good. Decor is amazing. And honestly, the best, BEST green curry I have ever had in my whole, entire life was the curry I had this night.. . So even thought the service makes me crazy, I'll give four stars. Because the green curry was just. That. Delicious.
