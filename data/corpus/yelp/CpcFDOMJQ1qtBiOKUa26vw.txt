Alcove would get 5 stars if it weren't for the traffic jam at the counter and my DIY-seating anxiety. Fortunately, the two times I've been I've found a table on the patio without a hitch. And once I did take a seat,  I realized the serene, largely shaded patio was well worth the sweat I broke to get there. . . I had the crab cake benedict on both occasions. Although the second time they committed a cardinal sin by slightly over poaching the eggs, it still was delicious. And the side of fruit was top notch.. . Did I mention, their desserts look amazing! I brought home two of their cupcakes on my first visit--one chocolate and one red velvet. The frosting was a little too sweet on each, but I was glad they put vanilla frosting on their red velvet instead of cream cheese frosting. (I'm not a big fan of cream cheese frosting. Sneer if you must.). . A friend of mine saw Kirstie Alley here once. Makes sense--there's a Scientology Center across the street.
