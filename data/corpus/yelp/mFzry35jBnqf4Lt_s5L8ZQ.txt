I had the spicy lemon grass chicken over rice. It tasted like the chicken was microwaved (very chewy) and it wouldn't be surprising since it came out very fast. It wasn't spicy and I didn't taste any lemon grass. The rice was hard like it had been sitting for a while, which is odd because I ate at noon when there were a ton of people. Overall the dish just plain sucked. . The service was okay, but I had to wait to get a refill for a while. The place was completely cramped. The unfriendly waitress was very pushy with the speed of me filling out the gratuity box on the credit card receipt. Did some kind of budget deficit prevent them from buying more than one pen, or something? Like, what do they do when that one runs out of ink?. . Food Quality/Taste = 1 Star. Portion Size Given Price = 4 Stars, you got a lot of rice. Price = 3 Stars. Service = 2 Stars. Experience with Staff = 1 Stars. Decor = 2 Stars
