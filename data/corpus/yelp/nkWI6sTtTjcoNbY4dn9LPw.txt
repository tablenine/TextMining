Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I have been wanting to try this place for ages but I just don't find myself in the area very often. I finally got the opportunity last weekend when the plans my mom and I had fell through.. . I have to say, fried chicken and waffles do go together very well. The salty, the sweet, the crispy, the syrupy - it's a delicious combination. That said, Roscoe's had neither the best fried chicken nor the best waffles I've ever had. . . I ordered the thigh and waffle. My mom had the breast and waffle with a side order of gizzards. The chicken pieces had a bit of that "overfried" flavor. The waffles, on the other hand, could have used some crisping up. If there weren't so soft, they would have been delicious. My mom said the gizzards were too rubbery for her - they didn't trim off the chewiest parts, just breaded them whole and threw them into the fryer.. . FYI, they have valet parking. It's $6.50.
