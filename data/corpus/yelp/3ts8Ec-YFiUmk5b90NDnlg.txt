It's always too crowded. I hate waiting forever to eat. The general idea of cheese and cake together scares me. The prices can be a bit too much. With all of that said, I really like this place. The menu is huge so you're bound to find something you like. Plus the portions are big so you'll leave full or have something to eat for lunch tomorrow. Its a great place for a group of friends or for enteraining out of towners.
