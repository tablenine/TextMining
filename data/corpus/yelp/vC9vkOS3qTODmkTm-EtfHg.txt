Boy, has this place gone downhill.  One of my favorites here was the yellowtail collar, but the one last night was flavorless.  The yellowtail and salmon sashimi were middling quality at best, though we liked the tempura.  Prices are low, but the wait is cattle-like.  Too many decent sushi places to have to wait like this for mediocre food.   I was really disappointed after telling my wife this was one of the bargains in Los Angeles.  Too bad.
