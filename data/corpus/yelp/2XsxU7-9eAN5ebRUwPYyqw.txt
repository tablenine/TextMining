Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
there is so much to like about BFTIE. the only things on the menu are shrimp taco ($2.00), fish taco ($1.50), and drink ($1.00). this includes tax, so it's easy to pay for and figure out how many you can buy with what's in your pocket at the time. i love the salsa bar and always load up on the avocado salsa, hot mango, shredded lettuce, and the cream sauce. when you are hungry for something delicious, quick, and easy, you can find easy street parking, get in and out in 15-20 mins with a big smile on your face. the only problem is that they are addicting and you might find yourself back the next day.
