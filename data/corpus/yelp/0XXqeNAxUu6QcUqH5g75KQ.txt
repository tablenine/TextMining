Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I would say the ramen at Orochon is good, but not great. Like others who've reviewed this ramen house, I would come here if I have the craving for spicy ramen.  If I crave traditional style ramen, I would go elsewhere. So far, I've worked my way up to #1 (not Speical #1) which is pretty darn spicy.  I can't imagine someone simply enjoying the Special #1/#2, it's more for the sake of claim.. . As for the service, sub-par. Not even halfway through our meal and our server drops the check off with a quick/ingenuine, "Thank you...." Unfortunately, this has happened each of the 3 times I've been there. I understand the need to keep business moving, but dropping off a check before one can begin to enjoy their meal is irritating.
