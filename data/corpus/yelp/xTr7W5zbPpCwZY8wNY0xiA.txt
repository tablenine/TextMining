Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
I love this Dunlay's.  Brunch is SO GOOD as is all of their food.  I love their wines and beers and sangria, the staff is really friendly and make you feel at home, and they are fun to stop by at the bar or just get a $5 burger on a Wednesday, or Sunday brunch.  They are a TAD pricey but if you go for the deals, of which there are many, you will be a-ok.  Yay Dunlay's!. . Also you can bring your dog to the beer garden in the summer and they sell bones for him/her.  :)  The beer garden is a little bit icky, they should put the plants out there or something.  But that's being picky.
