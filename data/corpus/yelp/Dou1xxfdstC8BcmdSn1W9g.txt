I always go there for one thing .. Prawn Noodle! Penang's prawn noodle  is out of the world.. also partly because I cant find any other Malaysian Prawn noodle elsewhere.. I have tried their curry noodle.. which to me  is just okay.. service is generally good.. and overall a good family dining place ...
