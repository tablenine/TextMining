My girlfriend brought me here for a celebration of sort and I must say, I was fairly impressed!  With a reservation, there was no wait and upon being seated, the waiter promptly familiarize me with their wine selections and suggested to me the best method to go about the salads and their choice of meats.  I was most impressed by their services though.  There was never a wait for more meat and the salads were very fresh.  The waitress had a great sense of humor and that was a plus.  Every employee on the floor worked in unison and there was never a time where I needed to hunt for my waiter/waitresses.. . I would summarize this place by saying:   Being a voracious meat eater myself, I got to agree that this was more than a great share of heaven brought down to the mortals from high above.  I guess this is as close as it gets to the famed food for the gods, Ambrosia.  Though, their services were great and their choice of meats were excellent, Alexanders in San Jose still tops as my all time favorite steak house.    . . The downside to my dining experience and hence the 4 stars and not the 5 was that the tables were closely packed together.  I didn't like how I needed to make an effort to avoid bumping into my neighboring diners just to access the salads.  Otherwise, a great dining experience overall.
