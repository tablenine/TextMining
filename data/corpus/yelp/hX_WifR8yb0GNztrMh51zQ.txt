Restaurant: Taqueria Del Sol - Decatur
Category: Tex-Mex
Okay Kit F.'s review was freakin' hilarious.. That being said, I disagree.. . Yes, there's a line much of the time. And the hours...I heard rumors about this place having shut down simply because people were confused from strange hours/days when it was closed.. A horrible, terrible rumor. . Taqueria has delicious soft tacos. You will be quite satisfied with 3 of them, which runs you under $6.. I enjoy that much of the menu is composed of specials (when it's for a limited time you want it that much more), my favorite being the fried chicken taco. . I hear the fish tacos are popular - but I will never find out (not that there's anything wrong with it! - Seinfeld rocks my world).. . This place is nice for the multiple locations. The Cheshire Bridge one, previously called Taqueria Sunrise (or maybe Sundown, given the part of town) is now Taqueria Del Sol also.. . It's tough getting a table though. And orders come to you sort of haphazardly; I think we've probably accepted random tacos we hadn't ordered, in the craziness of it (sucks for that other table).. . You definitely need to hit this place up if you're a big soft taco person. I say so.
