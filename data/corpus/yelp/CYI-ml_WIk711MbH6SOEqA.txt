This bright green colored, cheery falafel eatery is a great addition to the neighborhood. Affordable, tasty, and fast, it is a great place to grab a meal on the go or a snack while zipping through busy Union Square. The falafels are small but dense with a crispy coating that is surprisingly not that greasy when it comes to falafels. The salad bar allows you to customize, adding toppings to your falafel sandwich or salad box and smothering them with as much yogurt and garlic sauce as you want. Thirsty? Get some fresh squeezed juice for a healthy kick to your meal. While not the best falafel in New York, Maoz is clean, easy, tasty, and fast and a great addition to the neighborhood.
