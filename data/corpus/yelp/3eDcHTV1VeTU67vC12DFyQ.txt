Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
We all have a Rosco's chicken and Waffles story to tell.  I didn't realize mine would be the fact that I set out to review a different chicken joint with another reviewer.  When we got to the place it was, um, not quite what we expected (think Chicken and Chinese under the same roof).  So we headed to Roscoe's in lieu of my embarrassment.. . The decor of the front room of Roscoe's reminds me of a pot head who found Jesus and then redecorated it to look like the family room with the latest in wall paneling circa 1970.. . It's not fancy but I liked it. Ordered the Scoe's #2 which came with chicken smothered with gravy and onions and a side of waffles.  Goopy gravy but how can you not like all that fat heaped on chicken?  Chicken could have been slightly less skimpy. A half a chicken was small for two of us (the hearty eaters we are) but the sides were just O.K.  Somehow though, chicken and waffles goes together like Chocolate and Peanut butter; Fred and Ethel; Yin and Yang.  Better place to eat breakfast than dinner in my opinion though.  The best part of the meal - sharing it with new friends, so thank you:). . **MY TIP:  I am told Tuesday nights are less crowded at Roscoe's
