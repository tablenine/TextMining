Absolutely delicious, took Â a co worker there and they loved it and wanted to make it a regular stop.. . We had two Tuna Steaks with Japanese Salsa, Tuna Sashimi with Arugula salad, Tempera Shrimp rolls, and a interesting salmon California style roll (salmon in the middle, fresh sliced avo on top and a dob of creamy sauce on top). . Two people for lunch $90 including tip plus the valet guy.
