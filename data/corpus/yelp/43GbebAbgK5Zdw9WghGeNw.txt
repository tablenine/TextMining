Category: Delis
Great sandwiches, great pickles, great service.  Not a lot else to say about this place.  A little too much sauerkraut on the reuben for me... don't say I didn't warn you.  It is kind of expensive... I think you'll probably end up spending around 20 bucks for a sandwich, fries, and a drink, but it's well worth it.. . Park in the lot on Westlake and 7th, or order the curbside pickup, and be glad the restaurant's windows are thick enough to muffle the constantly blaring ranchero music.
