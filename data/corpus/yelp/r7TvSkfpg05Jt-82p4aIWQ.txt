This place is my irresistable temptress.. . Environment: Cozy, small indoor area and much larger outdoor area with lots of seating. Honestly, sitting inside sucks. You have to be outside to appreciate its charm.. . Food: So far, every dish I've tried has been... what's the word..... ahh yes... freakin' awesome. They make use of brie in many of their dishes, and everyone knows brie is the Jesus of all cheeses. I should also add, I'm very picky when it comes to salads and they have some pretty amazing ingredient combos on theirs. . . But most importantly, friends, you MUST leave room for either coffee or tea and a slice of one of their cakes. I don't drink coffee, but my friends who do definitely give a sigh of approval. They have some interesting blends of tea (so far, Velvet is my fave). The cakes are giant orgasm-inducing, head-turning slices. Every time I watch someone bite into one of these they roll their eyes and moan with satisfaction. I'm just sayin'.... . Prices are fair. . . The only negative is parking. SOMETIMES you might get lucky and find parking on the street, but most of the time it's best just to give in and use their valet (it's $3.50 plus tip the poor guy).
