Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
They moved to a new location at 101 freeway and Hollywood Blvd.. The place is big, clean with a lot of staffs. The staffs are really coordinated, they look like MIB with the headphones on, but they are great.. . You cant go wrong when you walk in to Palms Thai, most of their dishes are good, but these are my favorite.. . 1. Crab Fried Rice, its very delicious, the aroma of the rice, the crap and the egg is fantastic, this dish is a must for everyone. No spice, it Â just taste like a restaurant by the ocean in Thailand.. . 2. Pra kung, its like a grilled shrimp salad with a lot of thin slice lemon grass and other Thai herb. The aroma of the lemon grass really make this dish stand out from others.. . 3. BBQ Duck Red Curry, this place is the best!!!!! Sounds odd but they put BBQ duck in the red curry with pineapple, yess pineapple. The first time I had this dish it thought it was yukki, but pineapple with red curry is the best. Its a MUST!! dish if you come to Palms, they make a really good one.. . 4. Tom Yum and Tom Kha Gai taste great.. . 5. Pad-Thai is fine.. . The dish that I would not recommended are Lad-nar. I am actually a big big big Lad-nar fan, every time when I go to a Thai restaurant I have to order a Lad-nar, it is such a simple dish but its hard to make it delicious. The Lad-nar here is not impressive.. . It is sooo funny that people really think that Thai Elvis Rocks.... I try to avoid when he was there.
