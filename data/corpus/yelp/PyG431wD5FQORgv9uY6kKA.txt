I don't know what's not to like about Baoguette.. . The sandwiches are not expensive.  They make the sandwich quickly.  The baguette is fantastic.  The mix of meat, vegetables and herbs were fantastic.  . . I guess the only complaint you might find is the lack of seating (they have about 7 stools next to a counter), but I didn't find this to be a problem.
