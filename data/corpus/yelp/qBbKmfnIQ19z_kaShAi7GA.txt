Amazing restaurant!  Great beer brewed from old German laws, good food, and great service. . . Was there for NYE and they had an open bar and buffet with appetizers. They cleared the place out and set up a DJ and had plenty of staff on hand to keep your cups full. It's my second year in a row... and if you gotta be in ATL for NYE there's no other place I'd rather be. . . I go there fairly regularly when I just want to chill after work and have a beer.  It's close to the FOX, so you can always grab a nice dinner before a show... or pregame for your local sporting event! Definitely something there for everyone. . . I give it 5 stars!
