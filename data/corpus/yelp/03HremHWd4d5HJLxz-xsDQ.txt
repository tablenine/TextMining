Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
After living in LA for nearly 5 years, I finally made it to Roscoe's.  While my vegan/gluten-free girlfriend was working (!) I decided to sneak away and dive into sin.. . I decided to go for the standard fare: 1/4 chicken (fried) with 2 waffles.  The waffles were superb.  A hint of cinnamon, thin, and a butter and syrup magnet!  These were awesome.. . The chicken was good, but not great.  It was a TAD dry, but it was damn tasty and complemented the sweet waffles very well.. . It was hard for me to decide between the fried or the smothered chicken...oh well I guess Iill have to come back.. . The doorman was awesome, and my waitress and water dude/busser were nice also...the cashier seemed to have a 'tude though.. . Very good.  I can see myself craving that sweet/savory combination again...yup, in fact, right now it sounds pretty damn good...
