Meh. Not impressed. I love mexican food, upscale, street style, whatever. The food was fine, nothing out of this world. The service was good. But for the ambience I give it 2 stars. Now, I know I'm going to sound like a senior citizen at the age of 25, but it was SOO loud. I mean SO loud you were literally shouting. That's not fun, maybe in a bar, but not sitting down for dinner on a Thurs night. . . The margarita was bad. I definitely expected more- head to Adobo for a serious margarita. This one tasted like it was made from Margarita mix- YUCK. I sent back that glass of gut rot and traded it for a glass of wine. . . As for everyone's rave reviews on the guac- I don't know what guacamole you're used to, but I make some bomb guacamole and this was totally fine, but not the most amazing guacamole of all time or anything. If you want to make it yourself- take a couple avacados, mash it with a fork, then grate a little bit of onion in it (gives you the flavor without the chunks), finely chop a clove or two of garlic, squeeze as much lime as you want, and then season with salt and pepper. Voila, amazing guacamole. Some like to add diced tomatoes, jalapenos, or cilantro, do whatever you like.
