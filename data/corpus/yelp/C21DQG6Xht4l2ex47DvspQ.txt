Restaurant: Houston&#39;s Restaurant
Category: American (New)
At one end of the Century City Shopping Center, this is one packed Houston's where you can expect a serious wait at lunch and dinner.  The drinks are good, but it's just not the same now that we can't request to be in Kim's section.. . Vegan Report: Houston's is a meaty restaurant.  However, they offer this crazy veggie burger that they stain red with beet juice and it looks frieghteningly un-vegetarian.  But it's actually quite tasty.
