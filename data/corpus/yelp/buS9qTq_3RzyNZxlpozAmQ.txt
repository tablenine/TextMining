Not worth the hype.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good but way too pricey.  Went with my husband and we have a hearty appetite, so we ordered alot.  The chicken salad was really good, maybe too much dressing.  I think we would go back with a group so we could try a bit of everything.  But I think Ben Pao is just as good, without the high price.
