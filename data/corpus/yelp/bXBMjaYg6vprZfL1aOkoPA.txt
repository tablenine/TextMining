This place looks like Howard Finster designed it with some help from Sanford and Son.  The decor is reminiscient of some of my hippy friends' apartments.  Overall, I'd say the atmosphere is the main reason for checking this place out.  And it doesn't hurt that it's open 24 hours a day and not much else is in the area.  . . Having only been there a couple of times, I haven't had the opportunity to really explore the menu.  With that said, I wasn't all that impressed with what I've eaten there.  It is a bit pricey in my opinion but not outrageous.  It's an interesting alternative to the Waffle House and all the other diners in town and undoubtedly a lot healthier.
