Lots of variety here. You can be boring and order bratwurst, or you can interesting and order a rattlesnake and rabbit sausage. I chose the duck and bacon with jalapeno peppers.. . Honestly, it's good, but I couldn't taste duck nor bacon. My friend tried the snake and bunny, and he said, "It just taste like meat." Which isn't to say it's not good. It's a great sausage, full of flavor.. . The vibe is similar to Father's Office; Young urban professionals downing beers, eating sausages, downing more beers. It's located near the Arts District (I didn't know there was such a thing), and while the neighboring blocks can be kinda seedy, it's not so bad.. . Definitely worth a try.
