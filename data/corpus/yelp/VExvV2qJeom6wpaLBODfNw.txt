Came here yesterday night for dessert after dinner at Chaya downtown. I was really excited to come here because I wanted to check it out after all the hype on Yelp.. . We got two red velvet cupcakes, one chocolate one, and the berry tart. They were all delicious! We were there for about a hour and half and people were constantly coming in and out of the store. It's very spacious and open... there's a restaurant portion and when you walk in, it's like a marketplace. . . It's pretty pricey (the small berry tart was $7) but worth it :) Instead of the usual yellow filing... it was a vanilla bean custard which was a nice surprise.. . I would love to come back to check out the food!
