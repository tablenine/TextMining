Awesome bakery as has been mentioned by 5485602384 other people on here so there's really not much left for me to stay. One of the best bakeries in the city and definitely the best Cuban inspired bakery I've ever encountered. Cheese rolls and sandwiches are a usual combo during my visits. Potato balls, rum babas and basically any other cake out there is insanely good. One thing I will not take points off for like many people have here are long lines. I guess that somewhat a pet peeve for me is people constantly giving bad ratings based on long lines. I understand if the line is not worth the wait or poor service is the cause, but popularity causes long lines and you'd think people would be more aware of that or be prepared because I'm sure people read it on yelp. No lines or long lines, this is a must try.. . The gist.... . High points: Its a bakery that bakes stuff...and bakes it good. . . Low points: Parking in the back requires change and sometimes i forget to bring a quarter or two. That and annoying little kinds who hug the glass of the displays leaving all these oily hand prints.
