My boyfriend and I got some serious food poisoning by "risking" the Tuna Carpaccio here last week. Our bad, I guess. As if that wasn't enough------- while it looks well designed and hip at first glance, your wait of at least an hour (ours was 1 and a half hours) has you picking out all of the cracks in the white marble facade of the place. The service was a few notches below what I would expect from a place that boasts such a pristine look. You also even notice how the flow and use of space in the place is a nightmare. Perhaps more tables would be too much for the staff to handle though. Gordon Ramsay would have a fit here. One of the staff members was even unable to tell us what one of the dipping sauces was, claiming that the management doesn't have the entire staff taste/know the menu and it's variations. Blah, I say. Everyone running the ship should be educated on the products!! Too picky? Not after having waited as long as we did!. The only reason I didn't give a one star rating was the fact that the prices actually aren't too bad.
