the tuna tartare salad was so yummy....generally i like it spicey and its done this way at most places... but here it was the complete opposite....had a light creamy dressing - similar to a very light roumalade.....served with deep fried wontons to scoup it with..... . also we had an assortment of sashimi which didnt really stand out for me....this is something that many sushi places do well...only requirement is fresh fish!  . . what would make it stand out is if they had a special sauce to go along with it ......something similar to a korean hot chile sauce which is my fav....made with chile paste which is garlicky, vinegary and sweet with a touch of wasabi.....giving them ideas.  :)
