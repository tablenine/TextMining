Restaurant: Flo
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I've been a regular at Flo for two years.  Although it's better known as a brunch spot, it is my go-to restuarant for dinner.  It has a very different vibe at night than it does during the day.  The ambiance is great and the playlist never lets me down. The service is friendly and fast.  The food and drinks are outstanding.  I especially enjoy the salads and the fish tacos.  I've brought several guests there and they've also had a great experience.  All around a wonderful place!
