Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
If Colorado Wine Company was first base, then this place is definitely second in my budding love affair with Eagle Rock.  With some many reviews though, why get long-winded.  I really like the pizza - it's my style, lots of toppings, lots of sauce, chewy crust.  Nice staff.  Late night hours -  i don't really mind the cash only thing.  Plus, I feel very bohemian drinking their Classico Chianti, especially when I'm already drunk.  Good thing I don't live within walking distance of this place, much of my life might get spent waiting for pizza (it's very crowded and takes a while) and getting fat.  Hmm, how much does a house in ER cost?. . I don't know, maybe I just had  too much wine.... -------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------. The more I think about this place, the more I feel I was too generous.  As Ericka Sparkles says, two words "Canned Mushrooms" - I really believe now that I was so drunk off wine from Colorado Wine Company that they could have served me Totinos and I would have been happy about it.  Down to 3-stars...
