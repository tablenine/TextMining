Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
When I used to come here as a little kid I hated it. Why? Because I had to wait so damn long. I was a kid so I'd get bored and I was hungry and there was always a wait. But when we'd sit down I'd forget about that because I then focused on the biggest burritos I'd ever seen. My brother and I would always ask if we could get our own Manuel's special and, with a firm "NO" we would end up sharing it and still not be able to finish it. My dad would eat everything it seemed, including what was left of our burrito. . . Sure there's other stuff on the menu. But who cares. You need to come here, order a big ass burrito, lay back in your chair upon eating what you can, take a deep breath, hold it for a sec, then exhale. You have just completed consuming a piece of Southern California history.
