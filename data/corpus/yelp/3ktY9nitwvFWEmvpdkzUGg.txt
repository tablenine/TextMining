Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
As a newbie to L.A., EVERYONE told me that I had to go to Pink's.   To be fair, I've gone twice and quite honestly this is the most overrated place in L.A.   The hot dogs weren't that great, the chili to top the dogs was mediocre at best.   These hot dogs are not worth waiting the 20 minutes in line for.  Do yourself a favor and get a better tasting hot dog (with a soda) for only $1.50 at your local Costco.
