Since I didn't grow up on the east coast I knew deli through the Canter family's eyes.  Yeah...  Every family occasion wouldn't be complete without a Canters deli or fish platter.  The Bagels, pastries and deli counter is superb and I usually will take food back up to SF with me when I visit the folks.  I've had almost everything on the menu.... . The best:  Corned beef...  Slaw... Russian Dressing on what else.... Fresh Canters Rye bread!. . The potato salad takes me in a way back machine.  If chopped liver is your thing it's fantastic as well.. . A trip to LA isn't complete with a visit to the institution on Jewish fine dining.
