Restaurant: Mediterranean Grill
Category: Greek
A year ago, my newly eloped husband and I threw a little "weddinged" party for friends and family at the bar/music venue where we met. To feed our hungry guests, we opted for something casual, inexpensive and different than your typical "chicken or steak?" wedding fare. The Mediterranean Grill was our choice - a perfect choice.. . We ordered pretty much some of everything they cater (which is pretty much everything they serve at their restaurants). The delivery was prompt, the delivery guy helped set up the food service, and the food was so excellent. Even my country in-laws, people who don't know kufta from a hole in the head chowed down heartily. The best part, however, was the ordering process, wherein the manager of the Midtown store walked me through the calculations necessary to get enough, but not too much, food for our 200 or so guests. . . I've loved this place since it opened in Midtown (even though it took the place of one of my favorite Italian Delis. Boo). I'd whole-heartedly recommend both eating here, and asking them to bring their food to you in mass quantities.
