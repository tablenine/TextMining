Quite good but you're no Eichigo. . Came here for lunch with the wifey.  Great deal for lunch.. . She got the Sashimi combo - 15 bucks for a lot of fish.  Good too.. . I got the Sushi Deluxe - 15 bucks for a decent spread, including a very good unagi.. . However, there is a wait.  I arrived at 11:10, just after they opened.  The line was out the door and we didn't get seated until nearly noon.  Was it worth the wait?  probably, especially for the value.. . However, still not quite as good as Eichigo.. . Or Tokyo...
