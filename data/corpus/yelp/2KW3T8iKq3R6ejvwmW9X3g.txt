This place is sooooo good!!!!  It's right down the street from my place and I used to come here all the time back in the day when they first opened like 4 years ago.  But, not too much has changed and it's still a personal favorite of mine:). .   I must give a shout out to my favorite server there....Miss Jennifer. B.  You are the best!!!!  U always give amazing service and great suggestions!  I am also really glad that they finally got rid of those HUGE and heavy wooden menus.....wouza.  It was like lugging the bible around or somethin.  The Fundido is awesome....a staple in fact....and everything I have had there is wonderful.  Great atmosphere.....tasty drinks and makes for a great date place for sure!  They also play great chill, eclectic  music...not super loud either so you can still carry on a conversation with your people....U should for sure check it out!!  It's good for brunch too!!!  Ask for Jen to be your server and you won't be sorry!!!!
