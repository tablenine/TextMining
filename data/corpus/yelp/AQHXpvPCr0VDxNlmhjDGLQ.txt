I like the dogs.... . BUT SHUT THE HELL UP ABOUT IT ALREADY! Jesus Christ, you would have thought Gene and Jude's invented the hot dog. Do they sprinkle crack on the hot dogs or something and they happened to skip mine?. . I get it... they are cheap hot dogs with fries on top. They're good. Okay, but they are no better than any other decent hot dog I've had. I am sick of people crapping their pants over this place!
