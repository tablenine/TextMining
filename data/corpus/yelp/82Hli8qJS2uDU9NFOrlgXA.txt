mmm, wonderful pulled pork sandwiches and delightful belgian fries with so many delicious dipping sauces.   it's the first time i've had belgian fries.  where have i been???  this overshadows american fries BIG time.   . . seating is very limited so get there early or else wait for a table to clear. . maybe i'm a cupcake snob but the cupcakes look kind of old for me to try.
