pretty good experience here.  #1, they take reservations.  #2, they try very hard to accommodate even non asian people!  i came here with a bunch of co-workers and they were super super nice to us.  the food was great- the seafood was reasonably priced and they even gave me a free soda, but i suspect that was because we ordered a whole bunch of stuff.  . . clams with basil.  mmmmmmmmm.
