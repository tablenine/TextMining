Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I am a big fan of Culver City and Fathers Office (part deux) makes it even better in my book!I went with the man. We didn't have to wait outside to get in as there was no line (it was 8PM on a Monday night).The bouncer on the door was very sweet, even when he yelled after us " Hey, you are both over 21 right?" (rather funny, as the man is well into his 40's). . . The bar atmosphere is cool. Very laid back, people slowly drinking beers and tucking into burgers and baskets of fries.We quickly found a table. The famous burger, is great in my opinion! Filling though, I couldn't eat anything else apart from that! What I was most impressed by however, was the wine. I had the cheapest Pinot Noir on the menu and it was SUBLIME. Smooth, velvety, amazing! I am also just so glad that the menu here is short and you can't amend it it.There is so much choice in and around LA that it sometimes gives you brainache!You just want someone to say "You have a choice of five things and that's that!" and Fathers Office, well, it does just that.
