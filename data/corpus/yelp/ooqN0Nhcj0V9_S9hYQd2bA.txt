The pork over rice is the reason why I have given Daikokuya 5 stars.  I could not get enough of it.  It is just the perfect balance of onions, pork, rice, sauce, and ginger.  I am literally craving it right now as I write this review.  Only bad thing about this place is that during the summer, it can get really hot, especially when sitting at the bar.. . I keep telling myself that I will try the ramen next time, but I know for fact that I won't.  I'll just end up getting the pork over rice.  Good night.
