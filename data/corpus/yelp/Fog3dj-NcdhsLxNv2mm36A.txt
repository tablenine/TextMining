Restaurant: Co&#39;m Vietnamese Grill
Category: Vietnamese
Grilled dishes are the star at this Vietnamese restaurant on Buford Highway. Beef spring rolls and squares of flat rice vermicelli with smoky meat and bright herbs never fail to satisfy and won't leave you feeling guilty. They've opened a new location in Dunwoody, but the original is the better of the two.
