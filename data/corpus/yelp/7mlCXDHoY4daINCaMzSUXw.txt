3.5, so pricey and a bit overrated!. . so i came here for the burger. while it was good, it was not worth $16. i asked for medium rare, and it came back medium well to well. not a good sign. BUT despite the well-doneness of the burger, it was enjoyable. you can tell that the ingredients were good. i kinda wished that the bun was a little bigger, but it was good. i think they rely on the blue cheese too much to make the burger flavorful, but i wished they spiced the meat more. . . yummy onion rings! not too heavily battered, and does not pull out of the batter when you bite it! that is because they do really fry their rings and after about 15 minutes it's evident how greasy it was, but it was still good.. . $5 for a pyramid, but it took them longer than it should have to bring it out to me.. . my friend had the fish and chips and he said that the fish and the sauce left something to be desired.... . a bit too foofy for me to lunch here all the time, but i bet it'd be a good culver-city-date place for a nice casual bite.
