I Love, LOVE Panes and I'm pretty picky. Â I stumbled upon this place because my best friends lived across the street. Was really sick of Chicago's pizza so this was a life saver. I usually get the turkey turkey which is one of the best things I have ever tasted. I moved away and I miss this sandwich! The ham and cheese it amazing as well. No matter what time you go there will be a wait, especially since they put some time into making them. Downfall like most said was that it's cash only, it definately is worth a trip to the ATM
