I've never been let down by Doc Chey's. Every time I go here I end up ordering the same thing (not because there aren't other appetizing options, but because I suppose I'm a creature of habit), the Thai Peanut Salad. I get it with tofu and it's so so yummy, and very refreshing. I've also had the crispy spring rolls, lettuce wraps with tofu, as well as the edamame--all of which were very good. I suppose you could go to Chinese Buddha or Chin Chin for fancy Chinese food, but I like Doc Chey's variation on everything.
