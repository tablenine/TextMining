Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
3.5 stars.. . My BFF went here during DineLA's Restaurant Week.  We've been meaning to go since it opened, so we finally decided to just go for it.  It's a quaint place, nice atmosphere.  It wasn't too crowded when we got there and it did fill up just a little bit.  Definitely no waiting without a reservation.  . . So we opted for the prix fie menu.  I ordered the moroccan lamb with a couscous.  It was very tasty.  It was also very fiery - as in I think flames came out of my mouth!  I'm not like some crazy chick who eats habanero chiles like it's candy, but I'd say I have a higher tolerance for heat than the average person.  I mean, no tears...and it wasn't bad enough to have to send it back.  But I wouldn't be surprised if they had a few complaints that evening.  My best friend's meal was 'eh' she said.  She ordered the rosemary lasagna, and I tasted it too, and I'd have to agree with her that it was 'eh'.  Appetizers and desserts were good.  One of the desserts we ordered had a bacon caramel with it which my BFF loved and I thought it was too salty.  . . The service was okay.  I mean, it was good.  I expected more from them.  Our server was very sweet, but not as attentive as I would have expected being that it wasn't too busy there.. . I would go back at another time....but I wouldn't be too upset if I never went back.
