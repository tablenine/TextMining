Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
super low key location across from a church &amp; right in the middle of a working class super latino (mostly mexican as this is boyle heights) neighborhood. . the tiny SUV-shunning parking lot is always full but streets parking ample &amp; not intimidating.. lines are always annoying long (think The Pantry on a sun morning) even for takeout!. theres probably 20 tables &amp; its small inside so celebrity fit club will NOT be taping an episode in here any time... yes the manuel special burrito is $17 &amp; yes its huge &amp; no its not enough for 4 people as the menu suggests... me &amp; my bf inhaled this thing in 15 minutes.... yes, we're stuffed right now, &amp; desperately wanna nap the afternoon away but we just scarfed down a pound of mahatma rice it seems like so i'll sit on my cozy computer chair for a half hour or so till the bloating-ness leaves me... any whooo if youre a native angeleno then you've been here.. . if you just arrived from ohio and barely moved into your fountain ave/western blvd studio well come down here cuz its not the viper room &amp; weekday auditions that will authenticate your LA status.. its a meal at El Tepeyac....
