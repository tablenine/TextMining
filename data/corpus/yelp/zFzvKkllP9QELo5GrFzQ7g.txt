I first went here on a rainy rainy downtown day with a workmate for lunch. The tiny storefront was PACKED with diners waiting for a table or counter stool.. . We both got the standard ramen with pork and, boy was it DE-LISH-ISSSSSSS! I understood immediately why we had to wait. The pork slices are insanely tender and the ramen noodles cooked to perfection. If you add some of the spicy sauce, it's heaven in a bowl. Just what I was looking for on a dreary, besoaked afternoon.. . I would give this place 5 stars, but the lunch wait can be upwards of 1/2 hour. While it's worth it, it does take a chunk out of your lunch hour.
