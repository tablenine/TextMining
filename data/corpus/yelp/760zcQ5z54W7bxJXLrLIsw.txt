Strong drinks and creative cuisine, 'nough said...but I'll say more.  This is a nice place in a busy complex.  David Lentz is a culinary genius and I suspect my mother recruited him to sneak veggies into every dish and make it taste delicious.  I totally don't understand why picky eaters even dine out, and view the atypical combination of foods as weird, and not creative or innovative.  This is the kind of place true foodies will appreciate.  Those of you with a more simple palette, step back.
