Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
stumbled onto this place after my wife's tatt consult at onizuka and had the first real ramen i've ever eaten. definitely a fan. i've got no clue if it's authentic or if it's even decent. but i like asian food and i loved this. noodles were al dente, broth was salty and the dumplings were chewy. what else do you want? . . not to worry you can get ramen with no spice and add it to taste at the table. service wasn't stellar but they were slammed. i was easily able to talk and ask in english. all in all it added up to a memorable experience. it'll be tough not to go back if i find myself in the area again.
