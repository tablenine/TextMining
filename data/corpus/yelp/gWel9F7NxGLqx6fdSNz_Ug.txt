My best friends hosted an engagement party for me at this location and let me tell you- they went above and beyond. The wait staff was amazing. Phillip was amazing and he was able to keep all the tabs straight and under control... which is hard when there are 15 tabs between all of us.  I highly highly recommend the corn pups.  So good.  Just thinking about it right now is making my mouth water.. . My only complaint is that the parking sucks and the directions and address on the website are unclear.  I had many of my guests get lost trying to find it.  But once we got there, and the drinks were flowing.. it was all good times.
