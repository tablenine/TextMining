Savoyy...ohh savoy...This place is small but packed. The most popular dish is hainam chicken rice. The portion is generous and I like their chili and ginger sauce that come with the chicken rice. I think without it, the chicken rice won't taste that good. So far this is a pretty good place for hainam chicken rice in LA .
