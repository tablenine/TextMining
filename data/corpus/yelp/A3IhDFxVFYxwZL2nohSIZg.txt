Category: Chinese
I normally don't write reviews about places that I go to at yelp events, since so Â many of you guys are writing them - what's so special about that?!. . But Friendship stands apart from the typical yelp event place. While most (or all) are nice, Friendship is the OMG kind of place. Even, OMFG would be a better description. . . I don't smoke, but I thought I'd need a cigarette and a nap after nibbling on another yelper's Hong Kong Beef. It was like butter! I thought most meat at Chinese food places were tough like rawhide. Talk about a foodgasm! I thought I was going to pass out from the ecstasy of flavors. I didn't even need a cuddle afterwards. It was THAT good.. . I had the Lemon Chicken. It was good quality food, but WAY too sweet for me. But they deserve 6 stars for the yummy Hong Kong Beef.
