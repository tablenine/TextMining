Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
So I was craving KBBQ and we yelped, and found this place. So, we head over, arrive, parking lot is small, but they do valet for you. Once arrived, you are seated by host, it gets super crowded around 7-8. The restaurant is really clean and simple. We ordered the beef bulgogi, and chicken bulgogi, kimchi and tofu soup in a stone bowl. First, they bring you out a bowl of their house salad, and it's bottemless, so you can get more if you want, and then they bring you out these little dishes of different vegetables... kimchee, bean sprouts, potatoes (my fav!) potatoe cakes?, clear noodles, brocoli, and im sure there's more im missing. THENNN the meat comes out, and they put it on the grill for you and they keep checking on it for you. The meat was delicioussss!!! The soup was hot and spicy and tasted great. My boyfriend got Soju and he loved it. I think it comes complimentary if you order the combo or something?. . Definitely will be back here.
