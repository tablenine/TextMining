I love taco trucks but I especially love taco trucks that don't serve you a disease as a side dish. I tried this place for the first time during an Art Walk in LA. The line was long but well worth it, my only regret is not ordering more. Make sure you think your order out because chances are, you can't get back in line again. The short ribs taco is a must have.
