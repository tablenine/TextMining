Hellz ya! Git mi one! Sloppy, small burger but it kicks ass! As a long time customer, getting their burger has always been such a pleasure. Apple pie ala mode then wash it down with their 2oz. Bottles of soda! I know it sounds like a sin, but I have had their tuna sandwiches there and its really good! Fries on their saucer dishes are a must and dont forget to say hi to the friendly ca-ca-roashes.
