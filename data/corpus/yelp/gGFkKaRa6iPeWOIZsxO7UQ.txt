BEST RAMEN EVER!!! this is the closest you will have to authentic Japanese ramen straight from Japan. i've been to a lot of ramen houses all over the US and in Canada and nothing compares to this. this is proven by the enormous line outside the restaurant no matter what time or day it is. try it and you wont regret it!!
