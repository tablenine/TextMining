Yeah, yeah, it's cheap, but you get what you pay for.. . We came here today for a lunch and I was actually expecting something decent since my friends said it was a good place.. . Alas, it was quite a disappointment. . . I ordered the 2 item bento box which came with salad, rice and miso soup. My 2 items were salmon teriyaki and sushi. One of my friends ordered a bento box as well. The other one had the nabeyaki udon.. . First out is the salad and soup. Salad was pretty bleh, basically iceberg lettuce with dressing. I dislike iceberg lettuce. The miso soup was okay, nothing special. . . 5 minutes later my friends get their entrees. I'm expecting mine to show up momentarily. Did it? HELL NO. I'm sitting there waiting, starving and salivating watching them dig in. The waitress doesn't even bother to come by till at least 10-15 minutes later to say that my food is indeed coming out shortly. . . WTF. Did they forget? How can they serve a table of 3 with 2 entrees and not bring out the 3rd one? That's just bullshit.. . Finally, my food comes out and the salmon is pretty damn small. The sushi was alright, 3 pieces of california roll and 3 pieces of sushi nigri. . . I highly doubt I will be returning here. $13 for lunch. San Sai is better than this. Don't hate. I'm just being truthful.
