Obviously they have a great rooftop deck, which I think makes it totally worthwhile to visit. I've never been impressed with any other aspect of the place though. The food is okay and the beer doesn't really stand out to me. I could go to any bar with a nice beer garden and get a Hacker Pschorr or Blue Moon and be perfectly content.
