Been a fan for years.  Never wrote a review, because I knew others would do them good.  But, I must say this - if someone were to ask what the #1 LA venue to eat...it's here.  The biggest bang for your buck.  I always order the the cheese tomatoes fig appetizer.  Then it's the Gyro plate.  All yum yum!  Don't be a douche bag.  Be adventurous and travel east of LaBrea.  Plenty of parking on their lot.
