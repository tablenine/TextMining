Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Very overrated Mexican food joint. Tacos are greasy and not very fresh. Bark is definitely bigger than it's bite (no pun intended). You should eat there at least once just to say you've done it but other than that Taco Bell is about the same...............
