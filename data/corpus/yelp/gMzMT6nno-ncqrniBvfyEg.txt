My parents have been talking about this place for years, about how they need to go back for a french dip.  I had seen it on tv a few years back and have been wanting to try it myself.  We packed up the car, the whole family on a Saturday and decided to go.  This place gets packed on the weekends!  Luckily we found parking near by and got in the long line which was almost out the front door. . .  I had been reading the reviews, so I already knew what I wanted to get ahead of time.  I decided to go with the roast beef, double dipped with blue cheese and an order of potato salad.  There are too many desert options though, I wanted one of everything.  I finally decided on a baked apple, since they only have them for a limited time and a slice of berry pie.  Luckily I was able to talk everyone else into getting something different for me to sample.  . . Now I know why this place has been around for 100 years and will be around for another 100 more!
