Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
A place I've been going to for near a decade. The ambiance has it's highs (the stone fireplace outside, mini-jukeboxes with oldies at each table), and lows (tiny old bathrooms, a little-run down). The waitresses have been there forever, and are very friendly.. About the food: the pastrami sandwiches are excellent, as are the chili-cheese fries. The food comes faster than any other place... you sit down, and within 5 minutes you have a delicious sandwich in your hands.. They're open very late on the weekends, and is the perfect post-drinking place to get a bite. One thing though... the food is quite expensive.
