Don't rely on their official address, 1080 Peachtree Street, Â to see the place. It's located at the back of a very large building, and while it shares the address of the building on Peachtree Street, the pub is located closer to Crescent street and 13th Street. You'll never see it from Peachtree Street! . . I sat outside on their small, but lovely patio on a cool Fall evening. My dinner, a stew with Guinness beer and a salad, was quite nice. I don't have much to say here. The interior is very beautiful as the bar is very authentic, the place is large. I've always been a fan of irish pubs - this place is a great addition to the city. I'd meet you for a beer there anytime.
