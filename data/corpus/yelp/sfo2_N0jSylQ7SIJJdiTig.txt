Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
I've been waiting to be invited to the Magic Castle since i arrived in LA and the place was described to me. Screw Disneyland, this place is true magic!. . Ok, so many say the restaurant isn't all that....well what do you expect when they've got fairies and witches making this shit. c'mon. Personally, I haven't eatin there yet...so I shouldn't comment. . . What I can say is that this building is a laberynth of mirth and whimsy. Cluttered with goofy little bits of nostalgia and contraptions (you can't enter without saying hello to a dusty owl), tiny rooms with magicians of varying degrees of experteeese and posters of Doug Henning. Old timers sit at bar tables demonstrating card and coin tricks and whatnot. Better wear your best smoking jacket and double-winsored tie, cause jeans aint allowed. Drinks are small and expensive...but you'd pay the same for some watered down pepsi at California Adventure, so again quit your yappin.. . Too many things to describe here. Find yourself a person to get you on the list and spend the night checking out the different acts.. . Word has it that the lease on the place may be up soon and not renewed...so get yourself there before it closes, this is why i love Los Angeles.
