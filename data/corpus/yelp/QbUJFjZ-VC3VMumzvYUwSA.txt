Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I tried Tito's Taco for the first time and I have to say that I am very disappointed. I've been wanting to try this place for the longest time since it got tons of good reviews online. Their famous hard shell taco is just a better version of Taco Bell's taco. It consist of a little shredded beef, lettuce and cheese. To me, rather than Mexican food, it taste a lot more like American fast food. The taco is way to greasy for my taste since it is deep fried. I could still taste the oil after 2 cups of tea after my meal. I have no idea what's with all the hypes. It is definitely not the best taco place in L.A. It is not horrible, I wouldn't mind eating it. However, I would not make special trips for it, nor waiting 45min in line for it.
