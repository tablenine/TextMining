This is truly an LA classic.  Everyone comes here before the Dodger games to grab some yummy food! . . They're known for their french dipped sandwiches, which they dip themselves (no cup of au jus on the side for you).  the beef is definitely the way to go.  The beef is nicely seasoned and tender.  And at $5.95 per sandwich, it can't be beat.  it's not the same quality as a houston's french dipped, but for a fraction of the price it's awesome!. . and you can't beat the 75 cent lemonade and 65 cent iced tea =). . parking is a bit difficult and it gets busy, especially before a game.  the place has a lot of charm.  the place looks like it did a few decades ago, it's decorated with railroad pictures, and the floors are covered in saw dust.  a fun stop in down town LA
