I finally went to Bob San after walking by it once or twice every day for the last 3 years.  Keeping me from going there were mediocre reviews and the impression that it was overpriced.. . Indeed, I found that the sushi was just mediocre when I finally went.  However, the maki was actually more reasonably priced than I expected.  Most rolls were 6 pieces and cost around 6 or 7 dollars - fairly standard.  None of the three rolls I tried impressed me though.  The fried yellowfin roll tasted too fishy for my liking (I think the fish was overcooked).  The tempura crunch roll was the best of the three, but still nothing that amazing.. . The décor was both odd and hum-drum at the same time.  Not sure how that is possible.  An modern art installation on one wall was reminiscent of sperm impregnating an egg.  Service was standard.. . In the future, if a friend suggests going to Bob San, I would go along, but I would never make this suggestion myself.
