Ooooh, my fav restaurant in all of L.A. i think!!   The atmosphere is fantastic, the prices are very reasonable (especially considering the cheapest entree is probably the best on the menu).  The service is great &amp; always happy to help you.. . The chimichurri sauce/dip deserves its own paragraph.  add some salt and a dash of balsamic and you will have to be careful to not fill up on it before dinner arrives! =). . Great for a date, great with friends, great for groups.. . the valley location suffers from the location, but the Melrose location is absolutely phenomenal!
