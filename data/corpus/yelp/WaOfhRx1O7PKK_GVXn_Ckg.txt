Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Ok, now just hold on to your britches.  Let's just note that I was converted to being a Chicago Hot Dog aficiando.  I don't think it's fair to review Pink's with those standards.  So I'm going to review it as if you've never had a Chicago Hot Dog.  If you have, then just don't read anymore and/or don't go to Pink's if you're going to be all judgemental (ie, anyone I know from Chicago including my husband).. . Pink's had an incredibly extensive menu - any kind of dog in the world is here.  Except to have a dog with mustard, onion and relish (i told you I was converted) I had to special order it.  The buns are not steamed, but were nice and fresh.  It was good. Yes, just good.. . However, the ambience, the crazy menu combos and the fact that I could get onion rings or french fries if I wanted them and I did want them, but was sticking to weight watchers that day...) was a dandy thing.. . We only had about 15 people in front of us.  I'd have to say that I just wouldn't wait if there were more than 25 (the line moved fast).  I mean it is what is is - a hot dog place.  Johnny Depp isn't waiting on you, despite the fact that you're in Hollywood.  I mean really....
