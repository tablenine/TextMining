For wine lovers who are also adventurers -- go there and try the wine flights paired perfectly with a range of cheeses, from mild to really stinky.  The hangar steak is lovely as is the tuna if you're looking for a more substantial meal.  Decor is sleek yet comfortable.  A total win-win for wine connoisseurs.
