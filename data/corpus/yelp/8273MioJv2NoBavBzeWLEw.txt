Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
It was my first experience in a place like this one and it was good. I mean , I have been to korean barbeque restaurants  before , but not at this level. I went with my bf and everyone was loud , and seemingly under the influence. You get a lot of food for under $20. If its your birthday , the staff gets to drench you with cheap champagne and blares loud music . Its pretty funny to watch but like other yelpers said, it get old and annoying fast  after you see 10 birthdays back to back.  But for the amount of food and the price, its a good place to go if all you wanna do is stuff your face and people watch.
