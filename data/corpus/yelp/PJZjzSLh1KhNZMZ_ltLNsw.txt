I really love the food at Uncommon Ground, but I prefer the ambiance at the Devon location. Still, this place is great for a younger, hip crowd--especially if you like live music--and the staff is just really friendly and nice. The sausage sampler, artichoke dip, potato soup, meatloaf, pumpkin ravioli and mac &amp; cheese are just yummy. For dessert I'd go with the apple crisp or the s'more. The wines by the glass are also great.
