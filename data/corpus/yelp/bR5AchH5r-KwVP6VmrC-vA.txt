Why cant we have star fractions yelp?! I might have given DBA 3.5 stars but then again maybe not. There was nothing really remarkable about it. We had a slight miscommunication with our server which was made well in the end. The menu is as follows:. Pulled chicken - very moist and flavorful. smoked wings -  good but plain, maybe tossed in bbq sauce they would better. pulled bbq - not the best or worst i have had. baby back ribs - the best meat we had, lots of meat and flavor. whole fried okra - plain and tasteless, a little salt int he batter would go a long way. mac n cheese - creamy and good. Brunswick stew - it was very chunky, with big pieces of potato, i like my stew more of a fine texture i guess. fries - very good . after writing all this the 3 sticks, no point 5 needed.  Just an average experience although the staff was pretty nice. This is located where Vine used to be for those who don't know. Parking was not an issue.
