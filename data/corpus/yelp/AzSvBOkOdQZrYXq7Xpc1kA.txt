This place was amazing! I had a ice cream sandwich with 2 ooey gooey chocolate cookies with coffee toffee ice cream.  The cookies were out of this world and the ice cream was delicious! I also tried a little bit of the blondie.  It was nutty and very buttery.  I also tried the chocolate chip cookie with walnuts (which was forgettable), as well as the chocolate cookie studded with white chocolate chunks (which was amazing!!).  I would definitely recommend this place for a huge dessert splurge!
