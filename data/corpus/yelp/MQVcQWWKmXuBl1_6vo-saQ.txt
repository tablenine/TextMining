Reputedly the best &amp; freshest sushi place in LA (I hear alot of unsubstantiated rumors from all sorts of sources), &amp; I must agree. The fish is SUPER fresh. The quality of ALL the dishes from the complimentary appetizer (there's more than the usual) to the combo plates is fantastic. And the price for what you get is a little unbelieveable. My only problem each &amp; every time we go (&amp; I have alot of patience) is THE WAIT, usually an hour to an hour &amp; a half no matter what time we arrive...though we've only gone for lunch each time. Once we arrived about 30 minutes early just to wait in line for the doors to open, &amp; only waited 5 minutes to be seated.. . (4.5 stars)
