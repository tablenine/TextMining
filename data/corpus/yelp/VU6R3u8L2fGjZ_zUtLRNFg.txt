Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
What can I say that hasn't already been mumbled incoherently by millions of beef and au jus-addled patrons of this establishment. The mustard is legendary, the jus thick and flavorful, the coffee cheap. Big ups for selling cheap wine as well. A telling sign of greatness: I went to a training session a while ago to work at a local restaurant. We did an icebreaker where all of us (around 150) had to say what our favorite food was. About fifteen people said their favorite food was the beef dip sandwich at Phillipe's. Two said the lamb sandwich. The macaroni salad is also quite tasty.
