Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
the food is decent here. tried the pizza and had a taste of the chantrelle mushroom polenta. the bar has a good selection of cocktails and beers on tap. the only thing i didn't like about this spot is that it is way too loud inside. like deafening at times.. . what makes bottega louie for me isn't the food, it's the deli/bakery section. i absolutely love the submarine sized multi-grain loaf and the selection of cheeses, while small, is very good. i made it a point to stop by before my trip back north to pick up a half loaf of bread. i'm surprised it made the trek back.
