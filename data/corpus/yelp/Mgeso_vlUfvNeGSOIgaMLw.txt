It was a rainy night.  We got soaked on the walk over to El Barco.  (Honestly, we were trying to eat at Mariscos El Veneto across the street, but their wait was too long, so we headed over to El Barco.)  . . It was crowded and busy, but the folks at El Barco wasted no time in getting us a table.  Our server was friendly, if not a little flustered by the level of activity in the dining room.  Plus, her fingernails were the most blinged-out fingernails I think I've ever seen.  It was like she bedazzled herself before the dinner shift.  . . We ordered the seafood Parrillada for 2 people.  WAYYYY too much food!  There was shrimp, calamari, crab legs, steak (!), chicken, mussels, potatoes, tons of garlic, fried fish, grilled fish, and tons of other stuff.  It was so good.  . . Midway through the meal, the rain water started to leak through the ceiling right next to me.  It definitely added to the memorability factor.  That and a crab claw took a chunk out of my thumb last night.  Ouchie. . . All in all, definitely an experience.  I'd probably go back.. . Oh yea!  One other thing.  The guacamole is disarmingly spicy.  It will surprise you.
