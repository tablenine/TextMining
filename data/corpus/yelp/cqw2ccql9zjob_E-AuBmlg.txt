Restaurant: Panes Bread Cafe
Category: Sandwiches
I frequent Panes regularly, as my office is 2 blocks away. This place is a gem like you cannot believe! It really never gets old, either. The menu has many options and the daily specials never let me down. I am a big fan the Super Panes sandwich or the Tortilla Salad. Or the Sloppy Pollo! The Monster cookie and PB balls are to die for.. Yes, it can be quite chaotic during the lunch rush. But, the staff is very friendly and this place aims to please. Karen(and her husband) are the owners- Karen is very funny and friendly and she knows her regulars!. The menu is inexpensive and they only take cash or check! Which is slightly annoying, but I will forgive them because they just might have the best sweet french bread in America.. See you next week, Panes!
