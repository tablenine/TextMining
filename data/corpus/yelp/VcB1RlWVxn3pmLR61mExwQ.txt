For my first trip it was cool- it was GNO and I am assuming the waiter was just dumbfounded by all the beauty at the table and that is why he got most if not all ordes wrong. I will not say that it was because the DJ was blaring the cool music way too loud.  He was not at all concerned when the orders came and it was not what many had ordered.. . Besides that the food was okay- beinga lover of all Thai/ Fusion foods- the Singaporean food was much better than their versions or replicas of Thai inspired dishes.  However- the urban decor, people watching, and drinks made up for  all errors that night. . . On the second round we did apps and drinks- much more pleasant wait staff and music was great.   If  you feel like it - it is in walking distance to many other hot spots to continue your evening of enjoyment. . . Good for dates or GNO for a party no more than 5...especially if yoru group of girls is not into splitting bills equally.
