Seriously, one of the best places for sushi I've ever been. Super fresh fish, awesome atmosphere and hot towelettes :) Try the Godzilla roll and the Yellow tail jalapeno roll. . . My boyfriend had a serious hatred to sushi, after a bad experience, and he even liked this place!! . . Wang's, the bar attached next door, is a great place to hang and get a drink while waiting for your table. Dark, red, and decorated in vintage Japanese art, its a stark difference to the more organic feel of Wakamono. Expect to have a drink or 2 here, because it seems like there is always some sort of a wait for the deliciousness of Wakamono.
