I think the best burgers Ive ever had.  . . My current boyfriend took me here on our first date.... He picked me up at my house with a bouquet of gorgeous long stemmed red roses. I was dressed in a satin brown halter top dress and my hair was down, the air was sticky and saturated with mositure.  We started off on the West Side, worked our way to Times Square, and then downtown.... sadly he didn't impress me with a plan that first night. He lacked a plan completely.... which i thought was kind of cute, until I started sweating, and got uncomfortable.  We finally happened upon Rare after I remembered a friend discussing it a few weeks back and how good it was.  When we finally got there I was mortified at how sweaty i was and so uncomfortable I couldn't even think of sitting down.  I excused myself directly to the bathroom before we even sat down.  When I arrived at the table I had a mojito waiting, and what a mojito it was.... perhaps it was the stickiness of the night or perhaps it was just the experience of the bartender but that mojito was the most refreshing thing I could have asked for at the moment.  . . Four stars for the sheer brilliance of the burgers... kobe beef with tequila, filet mignon with jack daniels and gruyere cheese, the best cut meats ground and made with the top shelf liquor and cheeses that are out of this world.... then there are the sides... sweet potato fries for my bf and white truffle fries for me.... shoe string style, yum!. . I couldn't have asked for a better all american meal.  Definitely come for the burgers and food.  The service wasn't what I would have expected but the atmosphere was chill (especially since it was 10pm) and relaxed.  I enjoyed myself thoroughly and was completely immersed in my date.
