Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Been hearing a ton of buzz about this place.. and with the advent of the new fine burger trend; I had to dust of my burger tasting tour hat from a couple summers ago to check these places out.. . Burger: Good.  Had the Umami Burger. The crispy parmesan was a great touch to combine the cheese/crispy texture.  Ovendried tomato was a nice flair from the regular tomato.  The shitake mushroom added a unique asian flair and flavor.  Bun was well done too. Where did this burger fall?  The beef could've been a little more well seasoned; but more importantly, this burger could've definitely used a better sear.  At first bite, this burger just spills and leak precious beef juice allllll over your plate!  The right sear could keep this from happening; kept the bun dry; and your plate clean.. . My 2nd gripe: The fries.  Don't get me wrong..these were verrrry well crafted fries.  I would put these fries up in the tops of my fries love bracket.  They are boiled (to get some of the starch out), and then fried, and then friend again.  Technique is top notch.  So what's wrong?  . . It's always wrong when I can count the number of fries served... and when that number is about the number of fingers you have?  Even more wrong!  I don't mind coming to a place like this and paying a premium for an experience, but when the potato is such a cheap commodity (what, not more than a dime or two?)... HOOK IT UP!  I don't need a mountain; but maybe enough for me to pace through my burger would be nice?. . On the plus side-- I do want to report that there is no corkage fee; so booze it up! . . Conclusion:  Ehhhh... good, but didn't knock my socks off.  I might come back if I was around the area, but probably not specifically for this place.
