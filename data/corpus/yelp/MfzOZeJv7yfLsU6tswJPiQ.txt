Nom Nom Nom dessserrrtt~~!! My friends always talked about this place so i decided to give it a go.  It is a bit pricey but TOOTTAALLLYY worth it! The coconut ice cream is AMAZING!  The place is relatively small but there are chairs and tables outside(excellent for people who loooovee to talk and be loud may I add ).  and yes because the place is amazing there is a line, but it move fairly quickly.  Nooommm Milk~ what better way to end the day~?
