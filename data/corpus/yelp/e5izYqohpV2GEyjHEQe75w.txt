Restaurant: Barney&#39;s Beanery
Category: Bars
Barney's was a great place for me and my 8 ridiculously drunk friends. We were all in town for a pseudo spring break and got to pregaming in the hotel room. The hotel shuttle (which we nicknamed "The Party Bus featuring Javier the Party God") dropped us off right in front so we didn't make tooo much commotion on our way in to Barney's.. . We ate upstairs next to our pool table and our waitress, Jen, was very helpful, friendly, and patient. The menu is overwhelmingly long, but still doesn't have that much diversity. You can get potato skins about 40 different ways, which doesn't do a whole lot for me. Still, it was a good spot to share a couple of pitchers of beer and eat a bunch of greasy food to help out our livers a bit. It may have been a mistake, but our "large" pizza definitely looked sized for an individual-- only 4 pieces. . . For those of your who may have been trying to have a nice, relaxing meal last Friday night, I apologize profusely.
