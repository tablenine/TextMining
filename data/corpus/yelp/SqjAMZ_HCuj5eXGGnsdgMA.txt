So I had been hearing about the Kogi BBQ truck, so when I checked out their website and saw they would be in my neck of the woods here near Burbank I decided to go with the family and check it out. . . The truck was easy to find and suprisingly no long lines, which I have heard others complain about. I think it's because the truck was parked here in the San Fernando Valley area which probably isn't as crazy as Los Angeles. In order to try a bit of everything, and because there were 5 of us, we ordered a few burritos, at least one of each kind of meat, a few tacos and the kimchee quesadillas. This way the five of us had a chance to try a bit of everything. . . First impressions, pretty good and cheap. I do think the burritos would have been even better if Â kimchee had been added to it inside. Instead I felt like I had to eat my burrito with a bite of quesadilla to get my Korean meal out of it since we Koreans tend to eat kimchee with everything. . . Although I myself ordered the Kogi burrito, I think I might prefer the spicy chicken since I like a bit of heat in my food. . . This isn't something I would eat all the time, but I can see myself occasionally having a craving for it. It's worth checking out.
