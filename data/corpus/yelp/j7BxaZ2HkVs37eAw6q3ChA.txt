Pre-theater choice for restaurant- I went here before going to a show at the Fox Theater about a block away.  I sat at the lively bar, and got a delicious and generous-sized pizza- ham, artichokes, mushrooms, fontina cheese.  The bartender recommended a great wine to go with it.  Overall, convenient, pretty tasty pizza.   It's crowded pre-theater so make a reservation if you are on a time schedule.
