Hipsters servin' up some damn good pizza, on a PBR drinker's budget.. . I got a nice big slice of New York-style Goat Cheese and Roasted Red Pepper and a side of potato salad for $5.18.  The pizza was delicious, not too heavy on the sauce like most Chicago joints.  The potato salad was cheap ($1.50) but not very good (too salty, not sweet enough).. . For those that commented on the hostile hipster vibes, of course you're going to get a little 'tude here, hell the whole neighborhood economy thrives on it: high quality goods and services with a salty demeanor.  So the LP crowd and the suburbanites think they're getting "Chicago with an edge".  Whatever.  Their sandwiches are good too, but I haven't had one in years so I can't really comment.  . . They're open until 3am on weekends, so if you've ever found yourself wasted in Wicker Park on a late night (which means everyone besides Mother Theresa), you can suck down some greasy food here.
