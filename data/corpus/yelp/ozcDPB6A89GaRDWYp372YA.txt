I think Fred 62 is a pretty great place to eat.. the stuff that i've had there is excellent.. . we had a great waiter there a couple weeks ago.. he was on top of things.. really friendly.. . i went a few days ago though and we had terrible service!. we were sitting outside.. the waitress came out to take our order and we weren't all ready.. she got a little attitude and said she'd come back.. . our drinks never got re-filled.. and when i asked for some water she completely forgot and when i asked again she refilled it from the pitcher that had clearly been sitting outside on a cart. . it was lukewarm and tasted weird.. she continued to be M.I.A. for most of our meal.. . later when she passed by us... i stopped her and asked for some water WITH ice.. SHE ROLLED HER EYES.. i'm not kidding.. . she basically treated us like she was doing us a favor the whole time.. not a good experience.
