I came here with a friend. There was no parking, so we had to use the Â 5 dollar valet. Whatev... So, there was a man at the door checking IDs. Mine is 2 months expired but he said it was ok. We went in, and we wait 20 minutes for a table. Decide to order some drinks at the bar. Nw the bartender asks for my ID, even though I had already been IDed by the doorman. He takes it to the black light and is squinting at it. Uhhh.. ok. He starts making a fuss behind the bar and calls two people over. He comes back and asks if I have any other ID. I find, another Drivers License that is 6 months expired, state ID with my photo and birthday, school ID with photo and birthday, social security card, insurance papers and cards with birthdate, at least 20 random credit/debit cards with my name on them, Medi-Cal cards with name and birthdate, etc. I plop at least 20 of these cards out. Suddenly this huge latina lady with large hoop earrings decides to go on a powertrip and says they can't serve me. The couple next to me even starts laughing and calling the lady ridiculous. Then, they proceed to kick us out of the entire restaurant. When I told the doorman he had checked my ID and I had been waiting for over 20 mins inside, he said it was the latina chick's fault.. Then we had to go through murder with the valet, and the chip-on-her-shoulder-the-size-of-a-boulder, hoop-earring-chick came out of the restaurant to glare at us.. Huge waste of time.
