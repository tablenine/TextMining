Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
I live just down the street from Kopi and I go there regularly.  This place is awesome, for many reasons.. The service:  Always friendly, prompt.  I never felt rushed and was quite comfortable lounging for a few hours and drinking tea.. The food:  Fabulous!  I've had a number of different things there, and it's always good, fresh, and hot.  The desserts are divine--that chocolate mousse cake is so rich and delicious!. The drinks:  They have an awesome tea list.  I highly recommend the Russian tea--tea with a sour cherry compote on the bottom.  Just make sure to take the tea bag out right away, or else it gets bitter.  I've also had their smoothies, which were good and refreshing.. The atmosphere:  Eclectic and interesting.  The little store in the back is worth checking out, although I've never bought anything there.  The seating up front (on the floor) is nice, but it does get uncomfortable after awhile.. . The only caveats:  This place isn't really geared towards the wifi/computer user.  There aren't very many outlets, and they don't have wifi.  Near the front of the cafe, you can pick up wifi from other places, but again--not many outlets, and I've run out of power there before.  But it's great for studying, hanging out, or burying yourself in a good book.
