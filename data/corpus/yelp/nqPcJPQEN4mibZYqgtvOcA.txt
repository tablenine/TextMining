My group of 18 had a post-wedding brunch here one Sunday morning and the staff was wonderful.  They were so attentive to our mostly hung over and sluggish group.  They gave us amazing toasted pita-type bread to munch on and kept it coming as we all tried to combat the hangover.  My water glass was never empty and the coffee was really good!  The brunch menu was pretty standard, unfortunately my stomach couldn't take Middle Eastern dishes that early.  The ambiance is open and breezy with high ceilings. Seriously recommend this place!
