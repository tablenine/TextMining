I didn't eat much but tasted enough for a review. The broth and meat in the ramen was really really yummy. The noodles...kinda chewy...almost as if they're undercooked but not because it's good. All in all...very tastey. . . Atmosphere-wise...very cute, quaint old fashion looking ramen house. The line to get in is pretty crazy. Don't cut it too close to closing because they're super strict not to let any one in.
