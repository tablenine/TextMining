IF I was a bad and evil foodie and I died and went to restaurant hell, this would be the place I would end up.  . . When you come on time for your reservation, be sure to be ready to wait at least 30-45 minutes. When you are being shown your table, be sure to notice that the richer and more famous people are sitting near the fountain on the first floor while you are being whisked away to the second floor where it's dark and the service sucks to no end. When you are finally seated, be sure to notice that it is so damn dark, you can't even make out the words on the menu.  . . When you are offered water, make sure you ask for tap water (unless you like wasting 7 bucks on Fiji water that you can buy for 2 bucks). When you pick your wine, be sure to have the sommelier suggest much more expensive bottles for no reason other than to insult your intelligence and assualt your pocketbook.  . . When you order your dungeoness crab be sure to tell the waitress that you can crack your own crab and save the seven dollars that they charge you for cracking it in the kitchen. When you wait for ages for your food to come, be sure to thank the server for letting your food sit at some server wait station, on the second floor, for minutes on end while passersby whisk past your food and make your dishes even that much colder and exposed to the ickies that passersby leave behind. . . When your cold food finally arrives, be sure to enjoy how bitterly salty and oil/butter drenched your crab is. Be sure to notice that your noodles taste like the instant ramen you used to eat in your dorm room, but only not as affordable ($11 for instant ramen, gimme a break).  . . Well, at least the dessert was ok. I had the bread pudding.
