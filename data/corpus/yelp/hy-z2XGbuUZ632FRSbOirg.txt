OK, so I gave in after taking a good 7 year hiatus from DTF.  Who could resist the lovely Marthie D.'s request to try out some Xiao Long Baos?  We arrived at 11AM so there were only 2 other parties beside us inside the dumpling house.  However, within 10 minutes half the tables were taken.  I was like, "Where the heck did these people come from?!". . The nice waitress came by and handed us a checklist menu and a pen.  We ordered the famed XLB and chicken dumpling.  Each came with 10 dumplings and cost less than $8.  The piping hot dumplings came within 10 minutes of us ordering and were extremely juicy.  I liked the chicken dumplings a lot because they were twice the size of the XLB and in my opinion had more soup.  I highly recommend them for any newbies.  As for the XLB, if you are a first timer, you should try them just to say you tried them.  Otherwise, I'd skip them.  They aren't THAT special and cost more than other mom and pop dumpling houses who make them tastier.. . I saw a lot of people order the "appetizer" ($3.50), and was a little curious about what it was, but the waitress didn't give me a good answer.  She just said it was the appetizer and asked if I wanted to order a plate.  I decided to pass in order to save room for dessert at Genki Living.. . All in all, I had a good time this morning and left DTF feeling full, but not overstuffed.  I'm very glad to have arrived early because when I walked by DTF around 1:30PM, there were at least 15 people outside waiting for a coveted spot.  So yeah, the early bird gets the dumpling (and parking spot)!
