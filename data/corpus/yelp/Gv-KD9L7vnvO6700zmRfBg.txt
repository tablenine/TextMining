Hmmm...I'm conflicted. My entree was quite delicious, but there are many negatives about this place.. . When you sit down they immediately push the pomegranate margarita and fresh guacamole. Normally not one to get something without looking at the price, I impulsively ordered the guac. A man came by our table with the guacamole cart, and proceeded to crush the fresh ingredients with a mortar and pestle. The guac tasted good, but it wasn't spectacular, and there wasn't all that much of it. So I was incredibly shocked when we finally got the menus, only to learn that it had cost $12! What a huge rip-off. Do not get it!. . My table ordered the goat tacos (good) and the mole chicken enchiladas (rich and yummy). Prices for the entrees were also high, but not as exorbitant as the guacamole. Overall the food was good, but you can spend half as much and get nearly as tasty food at many other places in the city.
