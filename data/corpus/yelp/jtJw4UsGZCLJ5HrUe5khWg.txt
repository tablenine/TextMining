I tried everything on the menu.  The short rib taco/burrito was probably the best.  The kimchi quesadilla wasn't bad, just different.  Yeah, i didnt like the quesadilla =). . Why are they getting 3 stars from me?  The wait.  It was about 2+hrs.  They have the flavors down but its just not worth the wait.  You have people standing in the front of the line and their friends come later.  You also have people taking huge orders.  I'm okay standing in line as long as it moves.  If you like standing in a non-moving line, give this place a shot.
