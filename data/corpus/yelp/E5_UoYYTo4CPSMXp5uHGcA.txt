Category: Sandwiches
As I was saying, going here hungry is like going to the grocery store stoned.  Too many great weird combinations, either order em all or have remorse.  By the time I get in to my sandwich, all the confusion and regrets are gone and I can enjoy a great sandwich and beer.  . . It takes a while to get through the menu, there are so many different sandwiches I found myself choosing the best 4 things I read and combining them to make my own.  I've been here a couple of times on weekend afternoons and found good service and super fast sandwich delivery action.  yes.
