I really don't know what to say about this place.  It's in an amazing neighborhood, the coffee is great, and the food is light but satisfying.  The service, however, is atrocious.  I have waited, more than once, a ridiculous amount of time to order, receive my coffee/food, and get my check.  It's frustrating.
