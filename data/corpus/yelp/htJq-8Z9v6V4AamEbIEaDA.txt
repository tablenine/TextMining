Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Give me extra garlic, 'nuff said.... . Lou Malnati's is absolutely one of Chicago's best pizza establishments, but this particular location is by far the best out of any pizza place in Chicagoland. Come grab a table on the sidewalk during the summer and enjoy the scenery in this Lincoln Park neighborhood.. . I always get a deep dish, and it's never failed me. What's even better is, if there is a line you can place your order while you wait for a table so it doesn't take forever once you sit down.. . Definitly a must have!
