Going to Virginia Highlands on weekend nights is something of which my nightmares are made. Chinos are an abomination &amp; on sight, make me feel like when that lady from The Ring comes outta the TV. So I am not at all familiar with the scene on Friday nights &amp; can't comment.. . But! I used to love the menu at the Lawford pubs. It was Grade A bar food-- brunch, lunch, dinner-- I ate &amp; was happy. Weekend afternoons or lunch on the weekdays, I was in. Mmm, delicious curried chicken salad. Mmm, delicious blue cheese chips. My arteries hate you, but I had to have you. At least twice a month. Your patio is divine &amp; your food was always better than your unnamed next door neighbors.. . Why did you change the menu? It broke my heart. Why did you put those flies without wings (raisins) into your gorgeous curried chicken salad? I know currys are supposed to have those sometimes. But why eff with the perfection you had achieved? . . I can't go back. Yet. I'm still wearing black for your sub par curried chicken salad recipe.. . RIP Curried Chicken Salad.
