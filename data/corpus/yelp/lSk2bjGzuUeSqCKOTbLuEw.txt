Holy mackerel.  For dinner or brunch, this place is a solid option!  The mussels &amp; clams in wine sauce dish is divine (I heart you, stewed tomatoes)!!  I also enjoyed the lemon ricotta pancakes and smoked bacon!  . . It's obvious that they spent a boat load of money for the decor -- so grand and majestic.  This place is always bustling with people, and the energy is amazing - perfect for someone with a short attention span like me.  . . At night, parking is easy and cheap - $3 for the lot around the corner.  Walk in, put your name down on the list, grab a drink at the bar while you wait, and enjoy!. . My only beef with this place?  Food is inconsistent especially when it gets busy (which is all the time).
