Restaurant: Eclipse Di Luna
Category: Tapas Bars
So first off, this place is a hidden gem. Not because it is the best food ever, but because it really is hidden. Don't believe your GPS when it tells you it is in between some antique and furniture stores - go all the way to end of the road past the circle and you'll see it on your left. . So once you circle for hours and find it, hope you have arrived on a Monday because it is all you can eat Tapas for $15 a person. And they are pretty good. You can only order two plates per person at a time but not a problem as the plates are decent sized and delicious. In addition you have live music while you wait/dine and the sangria is awesome (albeit a bit pricey). . Wasn't really a fan of Spanish tapas or Spanish food really, but I'll be back to the Eclipse. One word of advice, make reservations, but make sure you party is not on Latin American time because they won't seat you till you entire party arrives...
