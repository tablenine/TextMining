I went to The Counter for a late lunch one weekday and was pretty happy with both my meal and the service.  I got the smaller burger and it was plenty big. I can't imagine the larger burger.  I didn't go crazy with the toppings because I'm more of a burger purist, but the meat was seasoned well and the cheddar cheese and other ingredients were fresh.  I also tried the garlic parmesean french fries.  They only came in one size-huge.  Very delicious though. They're not quite as good as the garlic parm fries at Red Robin, but good for garlic parm fries of the shoestring variety.  Pleasant and quick service at this place too. I'll probably return if I'm craving a burger and I'm in LP.
