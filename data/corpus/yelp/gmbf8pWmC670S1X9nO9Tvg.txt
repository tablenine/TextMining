Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
The food is good, the service is bad.  Some Korean BBQ places  have more/better side dishes, but this one is a good combination of Cheap, All you can eat, easy to get to, cheap valet, fun atmosphere, and relatively easy to communicate with your server (if you're not korean its impossible at some of the other korean BBQ places I have gone too).  So make a reservation, have fun and just be warned you'll smell like meat for the rest of the night but you'll be so full and happy from the food coma you won't really care :)
