Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
We had the #1 and # 3. I believe it was whoever came up with the idea of chicken and waffles is simply genius. The chicken was not greasy and totally had the homemade feel to it. Waffles were good too. We also had the candied yams (OMG! Almost more for dessert than anything), cornbread was okay better than that stuff from a box, mac was ok for me I still recommend Creole Cafe's mac. Wouldn't drive all the way up to LA for it though but I see why they have alot of fans. Service was GREAT and the food GOOD!
