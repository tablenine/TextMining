Finally got to actually do a sit down dinner (not just apps and drinks). Still keeping the 4 stars. Very helpful waiter and staff. . . Items of note: Scallops in panang curry sauce was delicious and the portion was perfect. . KC Strip Steak: Also was a hit with my wife who is a pretty tough critic on beef... Served with a stuffed, fried poblano with the perfect amount of kick. . . Gulf Shrimp: Overall a good plate but I would steer away from it if you are hungry... Came with 3 shrimp and some delicious homemade bacon ravioli. . . All portions (outside of the shrimp) were perfect and not too much food. Do yourself a favor and order a side of grits. They were Charleston good. . . Corkage is $15 if you are interested in bringing your own bottle of wine.
