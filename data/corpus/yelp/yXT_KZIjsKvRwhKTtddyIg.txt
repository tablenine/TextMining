Category: Pizza
This is by far the BEST CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE in los angeles. Mama Choco is on a hunt to find the best chocolate souffle and Bottega Louie takes first prize hands down thus far. . . Their food is also amazing- great pizzas, lasagna, bread, and salads (although I would advise you to tell them to chop it as it comes as a big piece of lettuce). Â Would go there all the time if I lived closer
