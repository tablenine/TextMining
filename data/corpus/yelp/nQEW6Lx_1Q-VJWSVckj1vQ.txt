Simply awful. I'd recently moved to Chicago a year ago and kept hearing people refer to this place as Chicago's best steakhouse. So when my parents from out-of-town visited I brought them here. Big mistake. My dad loves steak and was looking forward to a good dinner. . . Instead the place was painfully noisy, the meat was either overcooked or undercooked and the vegetables were huge but tasteless. Definitely not worth the huge bill we paid at the end of the meal. Trust me, stick to Morton's. I don't get why people rave about this place.
