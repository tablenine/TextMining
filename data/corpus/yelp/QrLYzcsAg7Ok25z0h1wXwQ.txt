I have never been inside, but ordered delivery several times and it was fantastic every single time! Packaged nicely in microwavable containers (yay for leftovers!), delivered in 30-45 minutes, and the food was AWESOME!!!. . We've ordered from their brunch and dinner menus before and literally everything we had was delicious. Here's the recap of all the orders.. . Brunch - breakfast burrito was huge and had awesome fillings. Eggs royale were super tasty; the hollandaise sauce was just right - not too heavy, not too light, not to sour or strong. The potatoes that come with everything were a little too "fried" tasting for my taste (I think they're actually roasted, not sure), but my boyfriend and brother really liked them. . . Dinner - hot dates are awesome and were surprisingly filling. Mac &amp; cheese are really good, especially for leftovers, if there any left. Also very filling, so be careful with getting appetizers. Chicken chopped salad was great with a ton of white meat chicken and veggies; very fresh. My boyfriend ordered salmon before, which he really enjoyed and chicken breast with herbed goat cheese was also delish.  . . Oh yeah, and last time we ordered desert, which is not on the delivery menu - you have to ask, and it was also very good. We ordered shortcake and a tart (I think blueberry). Shortcake was just meh... decent but nothing to write home about; the tart was lovely.. . The point is that is place is very fresh, very simple,  very good and very consistent.
