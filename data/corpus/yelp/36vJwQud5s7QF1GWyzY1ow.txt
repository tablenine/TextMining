::Door check homies::. . "Do you guys have id?". - "Ya bruh". "Have you guys been here before?". - "Ya tiger". . We get the run down and the look over and head inside for "Stage 2" of the obstacle course.  There are a few bartenders behind the bar... We post up and flag down a betty for a menu.  Suga hooks us up with a menu and keeps it moving.  We flag down another bartender, place our order and pay for it (and yeah, I guess we should tip now that he was kind enough to take our order?).  "Stage 3" involves hunting down and seizing a suitable table. . . Our reward for all of our patience with assh#ol%s is a few tiny burgers made fathers way (and over cooked), a salad, s.p. fries, and a few other recommended selections.  Nothing was to die for.  I've actually craved In N' Out more than FO.  I wont cry about the cost, but if you guys are watching your budget or concerned with value, then don't even bother parking.  . . btw...FO is owned by a paranoid control freak.  If you have any specific dietary or preference of your food prep, I suggest you pull out your cell phone, dial 911, and keep your finger on the "send" button as you're eating.  No substitutions here so keep extra napkins or an empty glass nearby just in case.
