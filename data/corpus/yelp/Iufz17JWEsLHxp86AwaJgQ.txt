Category: Mexican
Is it just me or do some of you find it odd that Tito's won't sell you just a "rice burrito"????. The reason...are you all ready?............."It's hard to fold"(said one of the lady's that has been working there for 40 years.)  Wow...she must be a real (fill in the blank).. . For being a "Mexican" joint....this is the most dumbness thing I've ever heard.. . Go to El Abajeno on Inglewood and Culver Blvd.  REAL Mexican food and if all you want is a rice burrito....honey THEY WILL give you just a rice burrito.  Or just cheese.  Or just sauce.
