Restaurant: A Taste of Heaven
Category: Bakeries
A Taste of Heaven is a great weekend brunch spot for small groups. The quarters are quite cramped, so don't planon more than 4 unless you want to wait a while. In genreal, the food here is delicious, but you pay for the quality.. . I've been here on 2 separate occasions, both on Sunday. The first time, I had biscuits &amp; gravy, which was good, but now awe-inspiring. The second time, I lapped up the Katie Cakes. They're huge and great to split. A bit on the sweet side, but absolutely delicious.. . If you're up in Andersonville and never stopped in, I highly encourage you to give it a shot. I'm excited to visit again.
