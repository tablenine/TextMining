Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Alright, the food here is really good and reasonably priced.  But COME ON!  How can it be worth a 2+ hour wait?. . The funniest thing about the whole experience was observing how this one restaurant was keeping the surrounding restaurants and shops in business with bored patrons trying to pass the time.  The whole village was dead except for the area around Shabu Shabu House.  They should seriously open a movie theater here just so people waiting for shabu shabu have something to do.  It's funny what comes to mind when you're THAT bored.  And hungry.. . The last part of the wait was the worst when I was actually sitting in the restaurant.  We had to watch the two (!!) parties of six (!!!) ahead of us get seated and leisurely eat their shabu shabu for 45 minutes before getting seated.. . Comparing the old guy to the Soup Nazi is kinda unfair.  He was pretty friendly and his rules kept things moving along.
