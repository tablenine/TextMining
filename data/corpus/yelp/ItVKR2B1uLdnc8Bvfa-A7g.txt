they had me at "rice &amp; gravy". . ive been to more than one location but for some reason ive come to this particular location more than the others.. not by choice, but by location convenience.. . i always seem to be "in the area". . seriously, this franchise is THAT good... and you wont really know until you've tried it.. i dont even know where to begin.. or how to describe it... its just SO GOOD, period.. even if fried chicken's not your thing.. it will BECOME your thing.. so just pick the closest location and GO already!!. . [sorry roscoe's but i took a star away cuz of your whole "NO SEPARATE CHECKS" policy..]. . fried chicken, rice &amp; gravy.. with a side of greens. .. now thats what im talkin bout!. . [takes me back to philly..]
