De Cero... what happened?   You used to be one of my favorite go to spots, I loved your margaritas and I loved your tacos and guac.  You left me disappointed tonight.   I wish I could blame the fact that it was Valentines Day, but I cannot, as you were empty at 8:30pm.   Your tacos just aren't up to where they once were, you no longer offer a special taco of the day and you took your salmon pesto off the menu.   You now insist that we order by 2's on the platter... what gives? Your margarita was syrupy and thick, unlike the like refreshing limey-ness it once was.   . . I won't be rushing to go back.  I was so excited to spend Valentines Day here with my husband and we spend the entire time wondering what the hell happened to the love that once was... with you....not us... that's still going strong... . . Just a suggestions... update your menu.  Mix it up a bit, perhaps your staff is bored with the same old same.  A seasonal menu, perhaps?  You've pretty much had the same menu for several years now adding only 2 or 3 and taking one or maybe some away over the years.  You raised your prices and your portions appear smaller and poorer quality... not cool DeCero, not cool at all.
