For those who patron this establishment for the first time, be warned that this is a first come first serve type of place.  One of those situations where you are in the driver seat once you flash your id at the bouncer out front.  So if you're the type of person who needs order and structure, be ready to live a little on the wild side --- ((drum roll)) --- there are no waiters/waitresses greeting you at the front asking you "party of..." and then directing you to an empty table.  Walk in and you should immediately scan the room for an empty table to fit your party and like the quarterback dashing to the end of the field for a touchdown, pray that no one else is eyeing "your" empty table.  Once you've sat down, direct one person in the group to go up to the bar to order your food.  . . Now on to the food....I can't say much for the sweet potato fries but their garlic mayo tartar sauce is divine.  As for the burger --- all the fancy schmancey ingredients make for an above average gourmet burger.  Better than DBGB? I actually like DBGB better but this one is a close contender...more bang for your buck and it has arugula!  What made me not like it as much was the bread, it was a bit over-toasted so when I ate it, it sometimes cut into the roof of my mouth.  . . As for their seafood, a waiter commented that it is overly underrated and after a neighbor ordered mussels and then sent it back to the kitchen as it was "too fishy" i must say that I agree that burgers and seafood do not mix...you are either a burger joint or a seafood joint and this is hands down - burger and beer!!
