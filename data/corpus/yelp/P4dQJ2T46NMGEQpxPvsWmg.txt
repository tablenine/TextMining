The I was fortunate enough to hear about Kogi a year ago before they got all the media coverage.  The food is very, very good, especially the short ribs. Wow.  Great value, and they are easy to find online or with Twitter.  I usually catch them on the westside (santa monica) when I'm in the area.. . FYI: My friend Chef Robert Danhi has been a guest chef on the Kogi truck; check their web site to see when he's scheduled to appear!
