Restaurant: Gladys Knight and Ron Winans' Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I simply can't tell you how much i LOVE fried chicken.. . This review is based on my past experience while I was in Atlanta.. . So, I did my research and came upon Gladys. What actually happened was that my friends and I wanted to eat fried chicken on Sunday while we watched the super-bowl but they didn't deliver, so the craving remained over night and the day after my boyfriend and I headed over there and it was SUCH a great idea.. . Although the food was really good, the area/location is just really sketchy. I didn't feel safe even though I went here for lunch.. . These portions are very generous: I had the Uncle Ron's (Three pieces of dark southern fried chicken) and my boyfriend had the Midnight Train (Four southern fried jumbo chicken wings and one Original waffle).
