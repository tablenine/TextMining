Best cheeseburger on the planet! But really, how have we managed to screw that up anyway? . All original from 1948......even the waiters! I'm not kidding, they started when they were 16 and never left; I love those guys:-). Way over priced, but as I said.....great burgers. You will be lucky to get a plate, especially at the end of the day. They wrap that burger in paper, throw some greasy fries on a paper plate and throw them both at you on the counter. Once you are over the shock of that they give you the bill!..... and ring it up on a cash register that has been there since the place opened. Amazing it still works.......amazing the waiters still work:-)
