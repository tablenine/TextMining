Restaurant: SinBala Restaurant
Category: Taiwanese
It's the place to get some taiwanese food! I like Sinbala and there are various small dishes that we can order and share among friends. . The food here is only okay. Nothing is really stand out as for taste of the food. But I still like to eat here once in a while.. Everytime I come here I always get their crispy chicken, oyster omelette, and sausage rice. All are delicious. Service here is also not too bad, the server is nice. . This place is quite small so it would be easily packed during in peak hours and the wait can get quite long. I would come by here anytime but I would not wait to just eat here.
