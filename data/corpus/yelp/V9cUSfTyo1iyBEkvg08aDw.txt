Last evening my sister and I decided it would be lovely to go to our old haunt's (Cafe Diem) new owner, Eclipse di Sol.  . . We, like everyone, sat out on the lovely covered patio surrounded by well-kept trees, bushes, flowers, and even herbs!  Yes, we identified rosemary growing heartily on the edge of the patio and made jokes about homeless people straggling by at night and deciding to flavor their 40's with sprigs of rosemary for an extra dose of class.  We are demented. . . Anyway, the food here is lovely and well-presented.  They have a good amount of tasty appetizers that we decided to get and just split for dinner.  . . My sister said they have an amazing grapefruit martini that even I would like (not a grapefruit fan.)  It was actually very refreshing and sweeter than I had envisioned it to be.  Very nice.. . They also have a veggie burger that they make themselves and my sister said it is outstanding (it's not vegan so I couldn't try it.). . They do have brunch, but the menu is a little odd- I think it may be one of the poshest brunches I've ever seen- fancy wine-braised pork shoulders, shrimp and peppers with gravy, and fancy grits, just to name a few things I could remember from the menu.  But they have eggs and bacon as well.. . This place is also fun to go to with a group- last time I went there my group just ordered a bunch of appetizers and tried some of their many tasty adult beverages and enjoyed the patio.
