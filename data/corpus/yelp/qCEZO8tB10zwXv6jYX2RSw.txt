Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Okay stop all the madness sheepish fish taco eastside masses. . . It's a good concept, executed simply and certainly dirt cheap.. . BUT, . . they just aren't that awesome and certainly not memorable in any way.  Go to Ensenada or go somewhere for really great fish tacos.  The salsa will be better (it really isn't that great here. . ); the cabbage, etc. will add some flavor; and they at least, like any good fish taco place on earth, will serve them with lime.  Come on, --it's not that hard.  . . I know all you wanna be foodies will say its sacrilege but the truth is that Rubio's salsa is better and at the end of the day has more flavorful fish tacos.
