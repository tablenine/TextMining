Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Friendship Chinese is good in so many ways.. . Their food is fantastic.. The presentation of the food is always a pleasure.. Their service is great.. The ambiance is awesome.. . I love their hot and sour seafood soup.  Sooo good and so wonderfu.  Spicy and tasty, my favorite!   This time we also tried their Duck with Grand Marnier and Shrimp and Scallops.  Go, go to Friendship and order the same.  Yummy yummy.. . During our meal half of the restaurant was also being used as a wedding reception.  We were lucky enough to be sitting in the same area as the reception, but not at all intrusive.    Not only did we get a great meal, but also entertainment.. . Congratulations to the Happy Couple!. . Friendship Chinese is BYOB and there is a liquor store nearby.
