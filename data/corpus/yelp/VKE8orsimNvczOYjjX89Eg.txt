When I first moved to LA, my co-worker would not shut up about this place. So eventually we went and man was I disappointed. We waited an hour on a weekday afternoon, and the food was not all that. I mean it was good but it didn't blow me away. Each time I've gone thereafter has gotten progressively better. The thing I really appreciate about this place is that the service is fast. Â Once they take your order, your first order of dumplings is on the table in about two minutes. It is possible to get in and out of that place full in just half an hour.. . As for the food, get the crab dumplings for sure. They are probably the best thing on the menu. For dessert, get the red bean dumplings. I normally don't like things with red bean, but this is the bomb. The dough is cooked to perfection.
