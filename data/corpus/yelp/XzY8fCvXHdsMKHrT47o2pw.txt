Great neighborhood restaurant (walking distance for me, a rarity in LA.) Extremely friendly host who made sure my GF didn't order the margarita (made with wine since they don't have a liquor license.) Thanks guy, but maybe just take it off the menu. . I tried one of each of their papusas, and while the dough was nice, all the fillings tasted the same. I think this is due to the lack of filling in each. Food was good if unspectacular. Large portions for a fair price make it a good value and the restaurant is clean with a relaxed vibe. Definitely worth checking out.
