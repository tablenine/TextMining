The food here is great! The service sucks! I cannot believe how rude our server was. Blonde, Curly hair. Is she the owners daughter cause she is seriously the worst waitress I have ever had. She made the worst face and snide remarks to me and the person I was dining with. I was seriously amazed just watching the way she was with other tables
