Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
Another restaurant that's sooo LA...only in Lala Land could 50 -year old dudes hit on 20-year olds- and no one would bat an eyelash...but I digress... . . Playfully named "Hungry Cat", this seafood restaurant on Vine is modern and intimate at the same time. The seafood is fresh and served with little inventive touches. . . Me and a girlfriend sat at the raw bar and watched the cook plate all these amazing crudo plates. . . My entree of clams in a sofrito sauce was to die for...the only complaint was that it was a little gritty from the clams, but I soaked up every bit of the tomato-based sauce with my grilled toast. . . The Hungry Cat is not your typical seafood restaurant, and that's why i absolutely love it! Fresh seafood served with a modern twist.
