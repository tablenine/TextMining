Restaurant: Savage Pizza
Category: Pizza
Love this place.  Sometimes the service is a little wonky but typically an awesome place.  The one thing that sucks is that there are NO SLICES after 5 (or maybe 7).  . . Eggplant parm - top notch (and I'm an eggplant snob)!. Calzones - so good.  Especially if you don't put ricotta in it (too runny).. Pizza - very good.  Fellini's and Savage are my top pizza places in ATL... . And there are 4 beers on tap.  Not much to go wrong on.
