I concur with the others that Home Bistro is tip top. From the intimate decor, to the delightful and quirky service to the cuisine. It all coalesces to offer an outstanding experience. The overall theme is one of detail, so you have to be in the mindset to absorb it all. From the customized menu, to the photos, to the knots in the floor. We shared a good number of apps and split a lamb burger amongst a party of three. This allowed for maximum sampling, wine sipping and a thoroughly enjoyable evening.
