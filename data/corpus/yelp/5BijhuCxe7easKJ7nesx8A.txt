Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Like visiting an old friend I haven't seen in a few years, I was hoping my trip to Tito's  would be like old times.  I've had around 200+ tacos (serious) here over the years and we have a long history.  So, it was time to go again after our 3 year separation.. . Everything always looks the same and that wonderful scent of the tacos frying in lard welcomed me with open arms.  Man, I was home again and really excited!. . Ordered a couple of tacos with green salsa plus a bean and cheese burrito.  Got my little box and grabbed a seat.  Took my first bite of the taco and thought it hmmm... not bad, but definitely not as great as I had remembered.  The taco was a bit tough, not that crunchy, the meat tasted ordinary, and even the cheese was rather flat.  The taco wasn't great anymore and it bummed me out all the way home.  Regardless, I'm still going to have tacos here every so often for memories sake.. . You ever try something you loved as a kid that doesn't taste as good when you're older? Maybe that's it.  Objectively, it's just a plain lard fried taco and there is nothing outstanding or unusual about it.  The shell is cooked in too low of a temp so that makes it's tough and hard.  There's not a lot of greens, and the cheese and salsas are weak.  I am not a taco snob and love all kinds of tacos, but even comparing the pics between my taco here and Mexicatessen (check it out on my pics) you can visually see the difference.  It's a sad day as I have to honestly put my old friend Tito on the lower end of my Taco List.  I hate myself for that as I still love that place like an old girlfriend.  What happened to my Tito's Tacos?  Must be that Global Warming thing....
