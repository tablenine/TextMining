Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
An hour and 45 minutes we stood in that line.  Luckily I was with some great people and we managed to enjoy ourselves.. . Martha Stewart dog is a must have!!  Super Yummy!. . Um....Went, Saw, Waited (and waited and waited and waited) ate good hot dogs and fries and had a Strawberry Crush to drink....won't do it again.
