Only been once so far, but you can't but help to check it out.  The first reviewer had it right....it's tres cute.  The ice creams/gelatos look amazing, but I haven't gotten a chance to eat that yet.  Milk also serves up milkshakes which you have GOT to love about a place.  The salads sound and look amazing as well as filling.  BUT of course, I went for the jugular and ordered the media noche:  an American version (although pretty authentic) of the famous and yummy Cuban sandwich.  It's basically a grilled ham and cheese on steroids...there is ham, shredded pork (very tender and yummy), pickles, cheese (I think Manchego), aioli, inside of a grilled/pressed panini....pretty much a dream sandwich.  Will definitely go back for more.  I want to try the other stuff, but I bet I will not be able to stay away from the media noche.  Well, at least I can get a milkshake with my media noche next time.... . ***UPDATE***. I decided to take a jaunt on this nice and sunny day to my local dry cleaners which just happens to be next to MILK.  What's better than a hot sunny day to hit up MILK for some gelato?  Really rich, MILKy gelato but in that light gelato vein (I still don't understand how they get it to be that consistency).  I had a taste of the banana dulce de leche.  But since I had it in my head that I wanted chocolate, I got a scoop of each.  They had a dessert special too: chocolate croissant bread pudding.  I had to restrain myself not to get that to go.  I think I'm going back tomorrow from some more gelato.
