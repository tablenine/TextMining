Restaurant: Nacional 27
Category: Latin American
Nacional 27 has a great ambiance/decor, and decent food.  The most memorable dish was the Chimichurri Bay Scallop Cazuela Tapas.  Other than that, the other tapas were tasty but nothing special. . . I do want to go back on Wed nights where they feature the Chef's tasting menu (5 courses, each course with wine pairing), for $44/person.
