Restaurant: one sixtyblue
Category: American (New)
My husband and I went here for Restaurant Week.  We also went to Naha.  one sixtyblue was by far the superior experience, mostly because of service.  We were treated like royalty at one sixtyblue, even though we were using the deal offered by restaurant week.  Our waiter was peppy, informative, and altogether delightful.. . The food was also outstanding.  I loved the little cheese course before the meal (for which we had to pay extra, but it was so worth it.)  I was especially impressed by the dessert.  The Restaurant Week menu offered two desserts, and my husband put his claim on one of them early, so I had to choose to either order the other dessert, which had a lot of white chocolate, which I don't like, or order the same dessert, which - obviously, that's not an option.  But I loved my white chocolate dessert!  So good job, them.
