Went for early dinner on weekday. Ordered:. - bagel rolls: a little too much cream cheese. - ton-katsu (not the meal): good breading. - agedashi tofu: nothing to write home about. - miso ramen noodles: good amount. - regular udon noodles: good after adding the hot mustard. . Great service. Reasonable price.
