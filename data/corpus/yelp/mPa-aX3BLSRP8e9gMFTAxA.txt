Restaurant: Papi&#39;s Midtown
Category: Cuban
This place was definitely a pleasant surprise. Â The first time I ever had Cuban food was here in ATL at Las Palmeras..boy, I was totally hooked from that point on.. . I didn't know what to expect from this restaurant but was extremely happy with my steak Cuban wraps. They were quite delicious and Papi's knows how to perfectly toast those flour tortilla wraps.. . Good stuff. Our waitress was delightful and she really made sure to tend to us when we need her to!. . I'd return again for those Cuban wraps in a heart beat!. . Mmmm....
