Restaurant: Sun Dial Restaurant

Fantastic view!! . . We were blown away by the view when we got here for lunch. I loved the concept that the whole restaurant rotated around slowly so that you can get a breath taking view of all of Atlanta. Being the nerd I am I thought it was pretty cool that the restaurant took exactly one hour to rotate similar to a sun dial. Pretty fun fact to know when you are there. . . We decided to go here for lunch instead of dinner since most of the yelpers seem not to be impressed with the food. I decided on a spinach chicken wrap while the boy went with the special rainbow trout. I have to admit for $17 bucks the rainbow trout was well worth it! The fish was flavorful and cooked to perfection came with amazing mash potatoes. The mash potatoes were light and buttery - best way you can make them! While the fiance had a good dish mine was just mediocre. I believe my dish was $13 bucks and the wrap was nothing special. It was good but not to the quality I thought this restaurant should have had. . . Overall I was satisfied with my experience. Four stars for the service and view you get.  If you are in Atlanta you have to try this place at least once.  The food isn't great but the view will definately make up for it.
