Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Tito's is polarizing - no doubt about it.  Either you love it or hate it and much debate will rage between the two parties.  I will say that the locals tend to love it, while those not from the area just don't get it.  Whatever - that's one less person to stand in line behind.. . The best parts?  All-meat burrito with cheese, the chips and unique salsa and the fresh guacamole.  The enchiladas are decent also.  I've actually never been a fan of the tacos.. . Tito's is also great road trip food.  Since moving to northern California I'll always stop by and get 6 burritos to go - one for the road and five for home.  The salsa travels well, but the guacamole not so much. . . Tito's is an institution that brings me right back to my childhood and I can't wait until the next trip to get some.
