This is as good as it gets for 6 bucks. 9 bucks if you wanna add an order of bubble tea made of fresh fruit.  I can't complain much about the food at this price. I love their pho. They have a huge menu. I am not sure if everything on it is as  good as their pho. Whenever I order a non-noodle soup item, I end up waiting 40 mins for the food to come out.  I'd stick to noodles.
