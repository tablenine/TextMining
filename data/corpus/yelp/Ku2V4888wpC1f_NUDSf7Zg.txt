Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Been coming here since I was in my mothers womb and my parents been coming here since they were young.  It's simply tradition.  I've had so many fun conversations while waiting in line for the shlop and enjoy the salsa.  Good for To Go and have a cold beer as the game is on at home.  Always ordered 1 Beef, Bean and Cheese burrito w/ 2 tacos w/ cheese.  This is not a 5 star restaurant yet just another nook in L.A.'s tasty list of crannies.
