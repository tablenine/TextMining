[M]ona: 5 Stars. [W]ayne: 4.5 Stars. Average: 4.75 Stars. . + Excellent Service. + Valet Parking. + Good Kalbi. + Lots of Banchans. + Clean. + Accepts Credit Cards. . [W] Mona wanted to check this place out when we were down in LA. This place was conveniently located in no other place than.......KOREAN TOWN!! Who would've thunk it? Heh. Anyways, driving here kind of seemed like we were kind of going into the ghetto from what I can see but when you get to the restaurant, it wasn't like that at all. The private parking lot in front of this restaurant was lively and full of people waiting to get in. The parking was also a valet but don't worry, you don't have to pay for parking other than tipping the driver so that wasn't too bad. There was already people waiting in line to get in, but for some reason, when we walked in, they seated us immediately....SCORE!!. . [M] The restaurant was fully packed but it was surprisingly bright and clean inside. They even had a flat screen TV mounted on the wall so you can enjoy some nice K-Drams. For dinner, we ordered the Spicy Seafood Bibimbop, Kalbi and the Pork Bulgogi [. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ]. The food came very promptly and it was a hefty amount of meat for the both of us to share. One thing I like about Korean restaurants is that they give you about 8-12 little appetizer plates (banchan) for you to sample. It ranges from kimchee, rice cakes, pickles, bean sprouts, tofu cakes, beans, potatoes, etc. Along with the banchan, we were also served a green salad that was very refreshing [. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ].. . [W] There's something special about this place and that is... the people who work here pretty much cooks everything for you! They first started off our meal with cooking the Kalbi over the grill. I guess there were 2 people that were overlooking our area, one guy and one lady. Basically the guy laid out the meat on the grill to start cooking [. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ]. After a couple of minutes the lady would walk by and cut up the meat flip it to cook the other side. This was the same when we had to cook our Pork Bulgogi. All me and Mona pretty much had to do was just......EAT! Haha. They even mixed the Bibimbop [. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ] for us and served it in a bowl to us. I mean, I'm really not used to getting pampered like that and it was actually really nice for a change to not do anything! Pretty much all they had to do left was feed us, that how little work we had to do for our dinner!. . [M] Out of the two meat dishes we ordered, I preferred the Kalbi. It was marinated PERFECTLY. The meat was so flavorful and most importantly juicy and tender! The Pork Bulgogi was good too! Overall the service was very quick and pleasant. We didn't have any issues here tonight and our dinner was very delicious. . . [W] Kudos to this place and I think it's a definite possibility we would stop by here on our next trip to LA.
