I'm a little sad that my first Yelp review isn't going to be a more positive one. My de cero experience started out just fine, we were seated immediately and the hibiscus margarita was very tasty (it was the overwhelming favorite of the table, everyone ended up ordering one at some point). Our group of 8 ordered chips, guac and two taco platters, which worked out to two tacos per person.. . The food was...fine. The catfish taco was good, but how bad can fried fish with creamy sauce possibly be? The duck taco was a dry disappointment. They were bigger than I expected, and two tacos were plenty for me (the menu recommends 3-4 per person).. . The service was...less than fine. Our server was nice but seemed very inexperienced. Drinks took forever and settling the check was a pain, though I didn't realize how much of a pain until the next day. I checked my account online and there were FOUR pending charges from de cero, all for different amounts. Thankfully only one charge (the correct charge) eventually cleared, but the other three charges totaled $150, which was a sizable chunk of my checking account suddenly rendered unavailable for the weekend. I guess that's a risk I assumed by not rolling with enough cash, but really, THREE extra charges? Excessive, de cero, and enough to discourage me from giving you another shot. Three stars because the drinks were good and the food was fine, but I can find fine food and good drinks in plenty of other places.
