Decided to stop by here before an afternoon at the Brooklyn Museum. I waited in line for about 10 minutes, then found out I could skip the line if I wanted a seat by the counter. Sounds good to me! . . I couldn't decide between the harvest pancakes and the sweet potato ones, but in the end opted for sweet potato with blueberries. . . Perfect potion, loved the flavored butters (lime, strawberry, and cinnamon when I went). I didn't really taste much sweet potatoes in my pancakes, but it was a scrumptious and a hearty brunch. I felt like a happy farmer. Plus, the servers were really helpful, and people in line kept pointing at my stack of pancakes...so I can't complain.
