Restaurant: SinBala Restaurant
Category: Taiwanese
SINBALA!!!  come here for shaved ice, a bite to eat, or a meal.. . shaved ice here is awesome because usually there are many toppings...and sometimes you need more ice.  well, at sinbala, all you have to do is ask!!  other places are stingy on giving more ice.. . taiwanese sausage is always delish with the sweet flavor.  they have a huge selection; menu is quite extensive.. . i love the oyster omelette.  YUMMY!!  just like how it's supposed to be in taiwan.  Mmm..  . . they have many drinks on the menu but if you eat a meal...they give you free chinese restaurant tea.
