I've been picking up pastries or ordering takeout lunch from Selmarie for a couple of years, but I only recently went there for brunch.  What was a strong like before turned into love after tasting three of their brunch menu items.  The interior of the dining room is bright and lively, and if it's warm, you can sit outside with a view of the nearby fountain.  I had the breakfast burrito, which was delicious.  My friend had a mushroom? bread pudding that was rich and decadent and we also split the cinnamon orange french toast, which was good but not extraordinary.  The mint and pomegranate mimosas were definitely unique, but started to get  a little too minty halfway through.  Between the atmosphere, breakfast food, and the delicious pastries, cookies and cakes they serve, I have to say Selmarie is pretty sweet.
