Had this place bookmarked for over half a Â year and I finally pushed myself to treat myself to breakfast instead of going to work a half hour early! . . So worth it! . . Kinda pricey, but the ingredients are off the chain! (Incredible for you non-linguistically-adventurous folks)! . Salmon benedict.... on potato pancake (like a cruchier hashbrown) and a salad (instead of more potatoes). Their hollandaise was perfect, and the salmon (lox) was melt in your mouth perfect in texture and flavor. . . Mocha was delish also. Very warm and deep roasted flavor, not too sweet. . Midweek in the early morning, there was no wait. Service was homey and nice.
