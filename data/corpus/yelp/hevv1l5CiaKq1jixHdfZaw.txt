Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
I heart the Grey Dog Cafe.. . No, seriously.  If there was only one restaurant left in the world, I would want it to be the Grey Dog Cafe and I would eat there all the time.. . The food is always good.  The bread on the sandwiches is amazing.  The deserts are enticing and always tasty  And the staff is warm and friendly.
