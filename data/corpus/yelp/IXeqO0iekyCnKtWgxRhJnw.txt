OMG, the duck!! The perfect moist duck with crispy greasy skin! Get in my belly, duck!! . . You have to pre-order the duck, but it's worth it. The waiter carves the duck right in front of you and you get these little buns and accoutrement to make little duck sammies. I just wanted to eat all of the duck skin. (Yeah, I know that sounds gross. I'm a freak like that.) . . I was not a huge fan of the little buns. They were a tad "dough-ey" for my tastes. We ordered the noodles instead of the rice as a side for our duck and they were tasty. The duck soup was YUUUUUMMMYYY!!! I wanted to slurp every last ounce of it! . . I'm sad that they closed, but I've heard that they opened a new location. I can't wait for more duck!!
