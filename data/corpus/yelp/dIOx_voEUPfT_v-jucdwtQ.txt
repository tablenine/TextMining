Mmmm...lomo embuchado (dry-cured pork loin) &amp; cheese on raisin toast, asparagus cloaked in a walnut vinaigrette with shavings of aged Manchego, a Spanish sheep's milk cheese and socca (chickpea pancake). I've also had the roasted beet salad. . . The embuchado was excellent -- the combo of saltiness, cheesiness and sweet from the raisin toast along with the salsa was perfect. Bill came out to $30 for 4 dishes which is average fare for tapas.. . Details:. . Cuisine--Spanish. Rating-- Two Stars. Ambience--Engaging storefront restaurant with a handful of sidewalk tables, banquettes and a wood-burning oven at the back.. Best dishes--Asparagus and Manchego, embuchado, cockles with sidra, albndigas (meatballs), green lentils and jamn, wood-oven roasted mushrooms, roast game hen, grilled skirt steak.. Prices--Tapas, $3-$7. Entradas, $9-$13.. Service--Pleasantly casual.
