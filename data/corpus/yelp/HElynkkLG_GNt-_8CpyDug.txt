Restaurant: Tin Lizzy&#39;s
Category: Mexican
Tin Lizzy's is my old faithful... They probably have the best guacamole in atl (according my my taste buds)... The margaritas are delicious (and strong!) - and if you're only getting plain margaritas I think it's just $15 for a pitcher.  I always get a quesadilla because you can't really go wrong there.  The black bean soup is really good too.  . . Pros - The margaritas are great.  Guacamole is amazing.  The patio is fun to sit and chill at in the summer.  The live band can (sometimes - not often) be entertaining.  . Cons - They recently changed their menu and took off the burritos - which is pretty annoying.  The live band can is pretty loud and sometimes I'm just not in the mood to listen to them (and they don't really ever play any music that I like)... I usually leave spending WAY too much money (I blame the margaritas)... I can get pretty crowded.... . Overall, 2 very enthusiatic thumbs up!!
