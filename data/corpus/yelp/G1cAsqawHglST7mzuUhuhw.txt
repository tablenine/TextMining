Came during happy hour and the cashier was very helpful in advising us what to order to make our bill cheaper.  Nice. We sat outdoors and the wirey looking chairs were surprisingly comfy.  So I got the veggie burger and belgium fries.  Veggie burger was huge and tastey.  It didn't change my life or anything but its good to know I'm not gonna starve at Oinkster.  The garlic aioli was really good and I really liked their house made mustard.  My bf got the pork sandwich with the cabbage in it.  He enjoyed his as well and wants to go back to try the pastrami.
