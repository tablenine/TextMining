Might as well keep it short since it will get buried among these 1000+ reviews.. . Very good pastries.  I bought some guava strudel, chorizo empanada, and guava smoothie.  Everything was great and priced pretty reasonably.. . Since I now work in the area I will definitely come back for more or visit their other location which is better for my commute back home.
