The food is absolutely spectacular.  The drinks are really tasty as well.  Anything with pork is delicious.  It dissolves in your mouth.. . The only thing that begs to be improved is the service.  At a meal once, it took the servers at least 20 minutes in between each visit; to drop off bread, to come back, take a drink order, come back, then come back with the drinks, then leave, come back to take an order.  Then to come again when other people had joined our party to do the same thing all over again.  It was not so busy that this would have been warranted.  Sometimes, a quick check back in just to acknowledge that you haven't been forgotten would have been welcomed.. . The food is so good that I will go back, and continue refer to it as the best Cuban food in the city, but the dining room service still could use a little polishing.
