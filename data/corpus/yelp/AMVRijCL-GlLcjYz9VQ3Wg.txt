This place is the bomb. When I used to work in Burbank, I passed by this place a few times and it was always packed. The potato balls are good (even though I think they're overrated), but all the desserts I had Â from there were the bomb. I've never been inside, I've only had people bring the stuff to work. . . But so far, the fruit torte, red velvet cake, and carrot cake are the bomb. They're the best I ever had.
