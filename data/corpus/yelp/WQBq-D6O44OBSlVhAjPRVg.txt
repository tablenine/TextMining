Food was yummy.  My boy and I went on a Saturday afternoon (he was slightly hungover).  We always have to order Crab Ragoon.  It was different than any crab ragoon I've ever had, but still delicious in its own way.  I had pad thai, which was sweety goodness and my guy had the Tom yum soup w/ pork.  Both were really good and very fresh!  The boy had to go back home and nap after, that's how yummy it was!. . Can't wait for take out
