OH this place is good!. . That fact that generations of a family works here together fills me with love.  Anything my family tries to do together turns into a disaster.. . The Chili Relleno is excellent and I love that they give you warm corn tortillas with the meal.  It comes with beans &amp; rice, and a small salad of shredded lettuce, tomato, onions &amp; avocado.  . . My Husband ordered the Asada Torta.  I don't eat meat but he said it was delicious.  They also have an excellent selection of cervezas which we both were happy with.  . . Prices are good, cheese dip, 2 beers each, a torta &amp; chili relleno came to $37 &amp; we were both stuffed.
