Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
You know, I am surprised at the comments about cruddy service and cruddy food. If this is regular, I must have been in on an irregular night. My mushroom burger was fantastic, my drinks were frothy, my side of potato salad was fabulous, my waiter kept it coming and kept checking in-- and it was a pretty packed night. . . I'm a pretty uptight person as the drag queens presenting Ham Bingo pointed out-- and I ended up having some of the most local fun I had in a while. I really recommend this joint and my picky friends are also hooked. At the very least, Monday seems to be a pretty great night in Hamburger Mary land.
