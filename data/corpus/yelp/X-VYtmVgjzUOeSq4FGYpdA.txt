Restaurant: Lala&#39;s Argentine Grill
Category: Latin American
The patio is cute and what makes it (seem) appealing, but it is filled with cigarette smoke. It's a patio, but it's also a 'closed' patio so they really shouldn't allow for smoking. The crammed, small indoor dining is on either side of the route to the kitchen and the toilets. I hate being seated inside, and outside is nasty. . . What to do, what to do?? Because the parsley-garlic dipping oil, Picante chicken and sangria make a nice dinner. (For an Argentine restaurant their Malbec is disappointingly bad. Stick to the sangria.) . . Anywhere which allows smoking around dining looses points...
