Food- 3.5 stars.. . Service- 2 stars.. . Garlic chicken is the only dish to get here. We ordered a top sirloin steak dish and it was so not worth the $12.95.. . The chicken was tender, juicy and packed with lots of garlicky flavor. I love the mojo sauce it comes with. Wish they gave more though cuz my sis and I were wanting more. If you ask for extra sauce, they will charge you $2. Say what? No thanks. . . Steak was really hard and over-cooked. It's rare for me to say that steak is over done since I like mine medium, but this thing was so hard to chew and cut. Umm yeah.. Forgo the steak. Get the chicken, or better yet, try the oxtail stew. I heard that's a good dish.. . Service was sucky. She seemed unhappy to be there, didn't bring out plates for us till way later even though I asked for them at the beginning. Dude, we need to eat our crumbly garlic bread without getting bread all over the table.. . So, in a nutshell. Get the chicken to go. You can enjoy it at home and not have to worry about garlic breath. Huge portions too, so feel free to share. Or not. . . pix- . http://pandaliciousfor....
