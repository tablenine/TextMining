A lot of care goes into every detail of their food and menu. . Both the pastrami and pulled pork were decently good, with soft, moist bread and just the right condiments.. Good choices of beers and bottled sodas.. A fun variety of sauces and pickled things to throw on yourself.. With desserts, they had things like carrot cupcakes and macadamia nut caramel brownies.. They really do put in the hard work to mix it up.. . On the flip side, they definitely make you pay for that work. Â It's a bit pricey for what it is, but worth the visit to try it out.
