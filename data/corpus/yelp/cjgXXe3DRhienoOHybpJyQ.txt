Went here for my birthday over the summer.  I got the Mediterranean burger, which unfortunately came out moo-ing (I asked for medium-rare and it definitely came out oozing blood instead).  They offered to make me a new one from scratch, which I appreciated, but just asked them to zap it for me because we had waited quite some time for the food already.  When they brought it back to me they brought me another plate of the feta cheese as an apology.  Nothing off my bill though.. . The food was good, the servers were polite, but the cooks are slow.
