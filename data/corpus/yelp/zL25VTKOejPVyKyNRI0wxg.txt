Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
The Daikokuya ramen broth had a lot of pork flavor but it doesn't compare to Hakata Ramen Shinsengumi restaurants. Reason for 4 stars is that the ramen broth had a lot of flavor. The ramen didn't compare to Hakata. Their Chicken teri was pretty good. I liked how the skin was really crunchy but at the same time how it didn't taste like katsu skin. The spicy tuna rolls weren't very tasty. I tried them off my friend's bento box. I'd definitely rather go with Hakata.
