Restaurant: Sura Thai Bistro
Category: Thai
It's like the Jetsons meets Thai.  The entire restaurant is white with small splashes of red, and hints of silver and black.  Super mod decor (think cb2) and eletronic music... I was incredibly tempted to get out of my barstool and dance.  Then I had to remind myself, "Mari, this is a Thai restaurant... not a dance club.. and DO NOT under any circumstances embarrass your friend."  Roooite... I controlled my urges.. . There's outdoor seating, a loungy area (with hecka fun astrobubble chairs), a bar, a couple of high tables, and a large area of normal restaurant seating.  The front wall/window of the restaurant was open, so it felt like we were eating outside.. . Now, before walking into the restaurant I thought, "There's no way in Lakeview that a place that looks this frouffy can serve up a decent dish."  Negative.  I had the lemongrass chicken and it was delish!  My friend's pad thai was also very good.. . Wait... this place gets a little crazier.. . Before we left, a man holding a bunch of canvas bags asked us if we wanted one.. "Um.. no thank you, sir."  My friend and I were super suspicious... why was he trying to sell us bags in a restaurant?. "No, no.  Please.. take one.". "Oh, they're free?"  Seriously?!  This never happens to me... I am a sponge when it comes to free things.. "Yes.. please, take one.  This is a picture of a fruit from Thailand.". "Thank you!"  Aw.. it has a picture of a Thai fruit on it... I'm a sucker for free stuff.. . um... +1 for the bag. =)
