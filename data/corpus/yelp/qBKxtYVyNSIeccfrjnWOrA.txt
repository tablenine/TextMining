Restaurant: Alfredo&#39;s Italian Restaurant
Category: Italian
It was in the Disco era that Ann and I started going to Alfredo's. Back then, we lived WAY OUT, all the way to Shallowford Road and I-85, there was no Olive Garden chain, and moonshine was still being distilled in Lilburn. Even with two skinny longhaired yoots dressed up, with her cocktail dress and my dinner jacket, coming into town to do it up brown. the venerable and dignified waiters were courtly, polite, knowledgeable, professional, and proud of their occupation. I loved their heavenly Mushroom Soup, Braised Veal Shanks, and Tiramisu. Now, 40 years later, in the middle of adult entertainment central, Alfredo's is still proudly maintaining its traditions. I doff my hat from my graying head to you gentlemen.
