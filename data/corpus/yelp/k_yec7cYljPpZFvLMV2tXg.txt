Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Their homemade matzo ball soup is so yummy and comforting. Ordered their turkey with all the fixings plate and it was more than enough to share with my kid. . . Our server was a no-nonsene, serious looking woman who could definitely stand her own ground. She served us right up and was very courteous and always came around to check on us. . . Had to give Canter's 4 stars because they're open around the clock and when I"m in town, I can indulge anytime of the day! . . The food is so good it has soul to it!
