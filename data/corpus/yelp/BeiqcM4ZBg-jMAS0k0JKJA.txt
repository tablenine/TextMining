I've been here a few times....from Sundays by myself when the place was dead to Saturdays and on Fridays when they had a DJ spinning.  When I'm in the mood to play pool I'll stop by, otherwise I would choose another bar in the area.  But thats why I gave it two stars because its the only place I know of in East Atlanta with pool tables. . . As far as the crowd goes its mainly under 30 except for the few exceptions like myself.   I seem to think this might be a bar that people come to on the weekends that dont live in the area, but that just might be my limited experience with the place and the people I've met. The Friday I went in there with the dj playing the music mainly sucked, but I'm not blaming the dj I'm blaming the crowds bad taste and what the dj has probably found gets the crowd up dancing so I can probably say I wont be back here on a Friday even if I'm in the mood for pool.. . Another annoying thing is they charged a cover to watch ultimate fighting this past weekend.  I had no idea this was going on and my friends were already inside so I had to pay the cover.  I can understand a cover for a dj but to watch a tv program?  How cheap is that?. . The bartenders do a really good job serving drinks considering how busy this place can get.  My only gripe comes from this past weekend when they put a few extra drinks on my tab which kinda sucks but I can overlook this as a one time mistake.. . So yeah to sum it up if you like to play pool or like bad dance music I'd check this place out otherwise there are better choices in East Atlanta.
