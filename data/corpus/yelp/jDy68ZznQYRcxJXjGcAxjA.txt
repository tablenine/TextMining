I hate to bash the veggies, but I really can't go to a place where my meal could be hit or miss.  I went to Gobo with a friend and I had a good entree, but his was barely edible.  . . I should just learn to complain more heartily, but I feel responsible when I'm the one who ordered it.  . . That said, I will probably go back as I am more veggie than non and I like the adventure.   . . Kind of noisy, but we sat near the kitchen at this high butcher block counter near the door which was cool.
