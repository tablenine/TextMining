Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
definitely the best fish tacos outside of ensenada :) the salsas are awesome, and with just two choices of taco filling (fish and shrimp) if you're hungry you can (and should) try a bunch of combinations. oh, and enjoy the happy, bright wall color/ paintings, quaint... :)
