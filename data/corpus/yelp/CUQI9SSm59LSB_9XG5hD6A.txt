Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Roscoe's is The Best Place to eat! Man I love it there. It is always packed, but at the same time I feel so welcome somehow. . . I had the chicken with that yummy fried onion gravy stuff. Don't know what they put in it but it was delicious. And the waffles...mmmm...I never would have thought to put the two together. . . Chicken and waffles married in eternal matrimony. Thank goodness!!
