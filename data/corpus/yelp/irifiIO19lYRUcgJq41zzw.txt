Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
Hurry up and open in West Hollywood!. . Every time my boyfriend and I are going near the airport it's mandatory that we stop at Veggie Grill for food.  . . If I'm feeling healthy, I go for the Chinese Chickin' salad.  I didn't realize how good quinoa was until I had it in this salad.  And their chicken product is really good, and really satisfies my craving for chicken.. . Now, if I'm feeling naughty, I go for the Chipotle BBQ sandwich with Sweetheart fries.  OK, OK, I know it's not that bad.  It's still pretty healthy.  But last time I had this, it was so good, and I ate it so fast, I had heartburn for about three days afterward.  I inhaled that sandwich.  The shredded veggie steak is so freakin' good.  And seriously you could put BBQ sauce on anything and I'd eat it.  And this BBQ sauce was perfectly tangy - a little bit sweet, a little smoky, all delicious.. . They're opening a location in WeHo in a few weeks, and I can't wait for this good to be closer to me.  I will definitely be eating there more often!
