Restaurant: Electric Lotus
Category: Indian
So disappointing! Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, I'm used to amazing and amazingly cheap hole-in-the-wall Indian food. Electric Lotus is overpriced and lacking in just about everything but ambiance. I am hesitant to even call Electric Lotus' fare Indian food! One star for its atmosphere and one for serving decent beer.
