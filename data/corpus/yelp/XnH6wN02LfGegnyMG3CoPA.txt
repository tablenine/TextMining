Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Friendship is a Chinese delivery standby for me.  I've actually never been in the place.  The delivery service has always been reasonably fast and friendly.. . Their sweet &amp; sour chicken is AMAZING.  I could drink the sauce.  I also really like the sesame chicken and pot stickers.  The "tofu tofu" dish wasn't great.  I'm also disappointed that they don't have the cigar egg rolls anymore...they were yummy.  I'll be sure to try some of the other dishes recommended on here.
