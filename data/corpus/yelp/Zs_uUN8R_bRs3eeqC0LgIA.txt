It's breakfast time in Taintville ('taint Andersonville, 'taint Lincoln Square.) After driving by this place many times and observing the large number of clients waiting outside, my friend Doug and I thougth we would be clever and get there early on Sunday. Early being 9:30 a.m. or so. There was still a 20 minute wait. We had no trouble selecting the specials of Eggs Benedict with beef and swiss chard, and the creamy crab omelette. The food was superb, and well worth the price. The service efficient and gracious. Our orders arrived amazingly fast. The coffee is rich and served in a perfect diner cup. The only thing which detracted from the overall experience was the bald guy in a white jacket yelling obscenities at the young, naive counter help. In spite of that little touch of unprofessional and uncalled-for behavior, Doug and I will certainly go back. Maybe during the week? Or at 8:30 Sunday morning? I will add this one to my short list of breakfast places where I am happy to wait in line and anticipate one eggscellent breakfast.
