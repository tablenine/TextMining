Restaurant: 5 Seasons Brewing
Category: American (New)
I went to 5 Seasons for a tweet up. We were upstairs in the skybar, and my only complaint is that it's seriously loud up there! I had the Scotch Abbey, which was a good enough for me to drink two. . . Afterwords, we had appetizers in the restaurant. We had the calamari, alligator eggrolls and kari kari, as well as a pear tart for dessert. The food was all pretty delicious, but the sauce pairings were a bit odd. The dipping sauce that came with the calamari is absolutely delicious. Like I would take a bath in it if I could. However, the ponzu sauce for the kari kari and the sauce with the eggrolls were both seemed to overpower the flavor of the food. (We totally used the calamari sauce for everything. It's delicious.) . . I'll definitely be heading back to 5 Seasons to try out more of their beers.
