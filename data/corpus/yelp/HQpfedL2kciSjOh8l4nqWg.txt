Daikokuya has got one of the best ramen ive ever tasted.  I got the Daikoku-ramen.  My girlfriend had the same thing but with the kotteri sauce (porkfat).  The broth was so flavorful, noodles were perfect, and generous portion.  It was amazing compared to Orochon across the street.  At least at Daikokuya you wont get ripped off by paying 2$ for everything extra.  The pork and egg was standard in the Daikoku-ramen.  I noticed that the quality of pork was better than other ramen houses.  I will definitely be back when im in the area again!
