this place wasn't bad at all. yes, i went on an asian night, but i'm asian, so whatever...i do like diversity though. . . the venue is definitely nice. really spacious. there's two different rooms with two different djs. two bars, one inside, one outside. the outside space is spacious too. i had actual space to move...no nasty sweaty backs bumping into me. i don't sweat so it's nasty when girls have sweaty bare backs that touch me, even their arms get sweaty...EWW. saw a drunk birthday girl try humping a chair...ridiculous! but a good laugh.. . i went on a saturday night. the music was alright. me and my girlfriends met some really nice guys that invited us to their table, which we got to drink for free. they didn't even ask us to dance or anything, just wanted us to sit at their table and drink with them, which was definitely nice. most guys expect something, but they didn't at all.
