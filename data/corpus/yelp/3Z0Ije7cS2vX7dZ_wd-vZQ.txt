The last time I came here was to celebrate my birthday two years ago.  I remember how strong their drinks are.  This time, I decided to get a lobster roll to go since I don't come out to this area much and had good memories of the lobster roll I ate last time.  As I read the menu, I was tempted to try the crab cake sandwich with onion rings...Maybe next time.. . The lobster roll isn't very big, but it is filled with chunks of lobster meat and is tasty.  They certainly make the lobster filling nice and moist.  Unfortunately, by the time I got home, the fries in the take out container got steamed/soggy.  I should've opened up the lid for some air.  I guess I'll have to try and crisp them up in the toaster oven.. . This place is located across the way from Zen Zoo Tea in the corner, directly across from Borders.  The parking garage is convenient and they validate the first hour and it costs $2 for every 20 minutes after that.
