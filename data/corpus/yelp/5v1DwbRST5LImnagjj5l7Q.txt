Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
So my brother told me about Orochon Ramen on multiple occasions and suggested that I try it out. I was a little unsure about the restaurant's quality due to the mix reviews I came across here on Yelp. . . My classmate and I went to Orochon during the lunch hour around 11:30 when the restaurant opened. We were promptly seated and were given time to look over the selection. I ordered the soy sauce flavored ramen with a level 3 spicy-ness level and a slice of Cha-su, because I wasn't sure how their scale compared to my level of spicy-ness tolerance. I LOVE spicy food so I was looking forward to it, but I found that it wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. . . The noodles were cooked not too soft or too hard, which is what I liked. I unexpectedly found some mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and pieces of meat hidden in the bottom of the bowl beneath my noodles. I really loved the flavors in this bowl! . . I would totally go back here, although I'm a little wary of the quality of the food the 2nd time around. I hear there's not that much consistency in its food. If you're in the downtown LA/Little Tokyo area, this is a good place to stop by. The cost of the ramen was what I expected, and the portions were pretty good.
