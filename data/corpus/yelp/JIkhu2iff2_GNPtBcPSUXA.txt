Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
I've been to this location of Giordano's twice now and both times I went for lunch. I had the special with sausage, cheese, green peppers, mushrooms &amp; spinach etc, which was great as usual. Â We didn't have to wait at all to be seated, but the pizza took about 45minutes to come out. I was starving, but it hit the spot!
