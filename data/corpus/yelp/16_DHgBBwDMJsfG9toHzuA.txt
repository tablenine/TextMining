Restaurant: Big Star

Good spot always busy so dont roll your flippin eyes when you arrive, Chad, Trixy, Blade, Darzef, ...That being said staff and food are great. Crowd varies on a night to night basis.After hitting Big Star its hard to continue a night out due to mexican food is a late night deal or stay at the crib type food. Garlic and Spicy is intense when trying to push forward. Cant wait to see that patio!
