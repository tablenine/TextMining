Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Had my first visit to famed Daikokuya today for lunch. I tried to go yesterday but the line was too long, did Mr. Ramen a few doors down instead which was very good (Chicken Bamboo Ramen, add spicy &amp; garlic, mmmmmmm). Arrived at 11:30 and still waited almost 20 minutes for a single seat, no worries though. Got seated at the bar on the end next to the container they keep all the ramen spoons in. Order was taken pretty quick and food arrived less than 5 minutes later, nice! Upon slurping my first mouthful of noodles I was expecting ramen enlightenment...but it never came.. The noodles were good and the broth was very tasty but it wasn't anything mind blowing. The meat clearly had been, as they say on the menu, cooking since the day before. It was super tender but remarkably fatty, like more fat than meat. And the broth, albeit tasty, didn't jump out at me. That, combined with being constantly reached over by waitresses getting spoons, didn't make for a shining experience.. I'm assuming my yankee palate can't appreciate the full scale of Daikokuya since the line was incredibly long by the time I left. There was even a girl that arrived a few minutes after me that was still waiting to be seated by the time I walked back out. Oh well, to each his own.
