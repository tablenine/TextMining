Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
River North Runch Pizza! . . For the reasonable price of $6.95, you get an individual size pizza (cheese, sausage or pepperoni), a good sized side salad with a selection of tasty dressings (I went with the creamy lemon garlic), and a can of pop. . . The other pizza place up the street on Wells has a similar special, but the quality of their salad and dressing doesn't compare. I would recommend them only if you prefer their crust over Lou's.. . Otherwise, pizza and deep dish pizza in Chicago is a matter of preference between some of the big names in the area, and Lou's has always been on my short list. Always a good place to take visitors, or to order out from.
