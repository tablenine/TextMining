This place is truly disgusting and speaks directly to the nature of race relations in Chicago. The fact that people find this "gimmick," which consists of drunk Caucasian customers hurling words like coon, spook, and nigger at a predominantly African-American staff as entertaining is repulsive, abominable, and revolting to say the least! The vile and repugnant behavior witnessed here is representative of a startling and iniquitous microcosm reflective of a long segregated city... to see it as anything other than is simply daft and inane!
