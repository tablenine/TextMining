Restaurant: One Midtown Kitchen
Category: American (New)
I have been to One Midtown Kitchen on three occasions. Overall I think it is a nice spot. I think their wine program is pretty cool, I just wish they had some better wines. At $62 a bottle, I expect to find some wines that I do not see at Kroger. I do enjoy the bar area and think this is a good date spot or a place to catch up with a friend.. I have tried almost everything on the menu and while it's good, nothing has made me want to come back for it. By far my favorite item has been the chicken in black truffle sauce. Just always needs a pinch of salt or something.
