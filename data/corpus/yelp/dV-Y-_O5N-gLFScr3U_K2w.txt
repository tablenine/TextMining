Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
Did someone forget to install lights at this place?  Or does "pub" automatically mean expect a dark cave where you can't even see the person you came with?  Maybe if they turned up the lights a bit the waiters/waitresses could actually see what they're doing and provide better service.  Or maybe not.  We actually sat outside on their patio on a warm, sunny day and service was still spotty at best.  . . They do have pretty big juicy burgers for a fairly decent price.  However, the meat lacks any flavor whatsoever and the ingredients they pile on top don't help one bit.  And their selection of burgers is pretty limited.  My boyfriend tried the blue cheese burger though and said that the blue cheese burger might have swayed my opinion.  Will definitely have to try them next time.  Fries are actually pretty decent.. . This place doesnt serve the best burgers but I wouldn't mind coming back during the summer just to hang out at their patio and kick it.
