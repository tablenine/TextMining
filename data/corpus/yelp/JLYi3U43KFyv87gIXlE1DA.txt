Came here the opening week a while back, and haven't been back but once since it opened. It's not that i don't like this spot, because the atmosphere is cool, with what seems like a lot of money well spent, with a nice outdoor area as well. The only thing that keeps me from coming here more often though are the beer prices. They are steep, but I suppose that is what you get when you spend the cash to make it look good. Not bad, just not for me.
