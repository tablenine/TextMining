Restaurant: Dante&#39;s Down the Hatch
Category: Fondue
Prob the best ambiance around - can't beat it. Siting near the jazz is well worth the extra fee because it feels like you are at a personal concert. Food is good and service can't be surpassed! Â . . *the only reason I don't give it that 5th star is because it's fondue...and to be honest what you get for what you for pay pisses me off. .5lb of chicken costs $23 to cook myself - makes no logical sense. But it's america and I paid it.. I will be going back to have drinks and listen to jazz, will pass on the food from this point forward.
