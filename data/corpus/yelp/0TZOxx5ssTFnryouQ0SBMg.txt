I don't know - maybe I got my hopes up too high. I have been reading posts, reviews, and general banter on this and other web sites from all of these people who went here and had the cemita and got blown away by it. Like, they want this for their last meal, its one of the things people HAVE to try when they come to town, etc.. . The cemita is a decent sandwich. I had the milanesa - a breaded, butterflied pork chop on a fresh, soft sesame bun served with avocado, a huge handful of shredded aged cheese, and some sauce. If anything else was on it, I couldn't tell. The only thing I tasted was the sesame bun and the cheese. Oh, the cheese. So much cheese. Really, between the soft bread, the avocado, and all of the cheese, the poor pork chop didn't stand a chance...it was an afterthought. When the sauce on the table is by far the best part of the meal, well, that ain't right.. . The people working here really are great. Everyone I spoke to made me feel like I was beyond welcome, and I will go back. There is so much goodness going on behind the counter that before I even got my food I had made up my mind a few trips would be necessary. I will update this review as needed.
