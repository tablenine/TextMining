Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
This is a small neighborhood restaurant. It gets raves for it's burritos, hard shell beef tacos, taquitos, and chili relleno.. . The food is basic "East Los Angeles." Home style "Chicano" food,  everything is served with refried beans and spanish rice. Most dinners are served on big platter style plates and the meals are generous.. . You'll want to stick with the basics here. Don't get fancy and you won't be disappointed. Stay away from the seafood.....order a burrito or a basic combo plate. Come hungry and eat lots of chips. They also have some of the best guacamole in all Los Angeles.. . This is not gourmet mexican food. Its not "upscale" food. You won't find this stuff all over the city. Just some places. It's meaty, cheesy, greasy, fried,  chili drenched, comfort food goodness. The place is small, cramped, and can get noisy. The jukebox is sometimes too loud with horrible mexican music coming out of it, the waitresses have been working here for years. Pictures of family and locals line the walls...as well as photos of certain Boyle Heights cultural touchstones.. . This place is historic...its part of the fabric of the city. You either "get it" or you don't. If you do...and love a good wet burrito, order an Okie or a Hollenbeck.  You'll be coming back for many years.
