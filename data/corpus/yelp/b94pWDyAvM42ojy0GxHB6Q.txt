Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Once again, GBY. God bless Yelp.  I never, ever, ever would have found this place but for my brother and sister yelpistas.This was our first experience with Korean barbecue and it was a really, really good one.  I ordered the beef tongue -- yeah, I'm weird -- and it was thinly sliced and flavorful. . . Wife had the barbecued chicken, and it was fantastic.  Wait staff cooked it for us on the barbecue right in the middle of the table, and we were constantly being checked in with by the ultra-cute, perfect-English daughter of the owner, and a batallion of helpers and waiters. There were eight or ten Korean appetizers placed on the table, and the cellophane noodles and pickled bean sprouts were the biggest hits, though I developed a real taste for the kimchi.  Quite crowded, not terribly noisy, there's a parking lot there with a two dollar valet.. . Only reason I'm not giving five stars is that I have no basis of comparison yet to other Korean barbecue places.  But I'll come back and revise when I do.  Kudos again to Yelp for steering us here. Oh yea.  With tip, for two, less than fifty dollars. Can't beat it with a truncheon.
