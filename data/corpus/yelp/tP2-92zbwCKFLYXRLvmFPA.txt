PARKING: Ok private lot. Otherwise park onthe street.. PRICE: Compare to like THE HAT, more expensive. SEATING AREA: Not bad. You can seat outside if you want. SERVICE: Friendly. They bring the food to you when the food is ready.. . FOOD: It's ok. pastrami sandwich is small compared to THE HAT and you pay more here. I heard the double fried fries were good. I thought they would be crunchy. However, they weren't all that crazy. The favor of food was ok. It wasn't like wow to me.
