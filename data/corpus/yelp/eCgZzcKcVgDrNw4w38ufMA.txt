Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
Urban Belly lived up to the hype - big time.  We went for dinner this evening and absolutely loved everything, from the counter ordering to the communal seating and especially the food.  So much to choose from - I am already looking forward to my next trip back!. . We sampled the duck and pho spice dumplings, the Urbanbelly Ramen (with pork belly, of course), and the Cold Udon with chicken and lemon grass.  All were delightful, but the broth in the Ramen dish was especially memorable.  Portions are quite large, so I ended up bringing home some udon.  The asian juice beverages are really quite delicious - give them a try!  We spent $40 total for the two of us - a pretty cheap Saturday night date for the quality of food you're getting here!. . I love the atmosphere - from the moment you walk in, you forget you're in a random strip mall on a weird section of California.  Distressed flooring with big communal wooden tables, great color scheme - it's very hip and urban - definitely lives up to its name. :). . We'll be back, and next time we'll bring friends.  We didn't have to wait for a space at a table at around 7:00 on a Saturday night, but at 8:00 it started to get really busy.. . Absolutely terrific Asian fusion in a unique setting.  Go!
