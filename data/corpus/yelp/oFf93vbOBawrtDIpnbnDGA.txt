Restaurant: Little Bangkok
Category: Chinese
I wasn't particularly impressed by Little Bangkok, though I'm a strict vegetarian and I came with a group and didn't want to make a fuss asking a million questions. I got tofu in a spicy sauce. It was decent but not particularly impressive. My friends all enjoyed their food a lot, especially the Tom Kha soup. . . Service is good, but the decor leaves a bit to be desired. . . My friend insists this is the best Thai food he's had, and the reviews are certainly positive, so I'd give Little Bangkok a try for yourself, though I likely won't be back.
