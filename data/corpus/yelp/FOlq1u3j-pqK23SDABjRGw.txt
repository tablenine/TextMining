Things to avoid: the pizza and the vegan mac and cheese.. . Aside from that, yr all clear! The Humbolt County with tofu, potatoes, greens and various other wonderful things is worth every penny and the buffalo tofu is probably one of the best things to exist this side of Jesus and Kittens!. . The waitstaff is extremely friendly and the prices aren't near as bad as some have made them out to be. Minus one point for having to wade through the blockheads and fake and bake tanned girls of the Wrigleyfield/Cubs variety though...
