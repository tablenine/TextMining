Great burger and great milkshake.. . I had the Yankee Style burger which came with shredded lettuce, grilled onions, bacon, and bleu cheese.  The patty was juicy and there was just the right amount of bleu cheese.. The milkshake was thick and creamy and really hit the spot.  . . My friend had the vegetarian burger which took a bit longer to make but she said it was worth the wait. She didn't offer me a bite though.  What's that about? . . Seating is a bit limited though, so keep that in mind.
