This place is my heaven! My soul! My tried and true favorite sushi!. . Staples: Spicy tuna on crispy rice, jalepeno yellowtail sashimi, warm crab handroll, rock shrimp tempura.. . Love affair: sashimi ceviche, baked clams, shishito peppers, green tea ice cream. . Ugh: Mozzarella crab roll. . Make a reservation as even on a Monday night it can be a looong wait.. . Worth every penny/minute.  Oh and NEVER go to the location in Hollywood.  Stick with Studio City, Encino or Izakiya on 3rd.
