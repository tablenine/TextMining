Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
BAR NONE the best French Dip sandwich on earth! It could be the house hot mustard...... Good stuff! Plus, it's a LA landmark saw dust on the floor and all. My god there nothing like Philippe's sandwich after a Dodgers game. Super quick service and lots of parking on both of the parking lot plus street parking. A true Angelenos spot!
