Restaurant: Red Light
Category: Asian Fusion
The best thing about this restaurant is probably the atmosphere. It is visually beautiful and very unique. However, the food is a close second. Excellent and innovative asian fusion food. It's a great place to come on a date because of the way many of the tables for two are set up - you sit next to each other instead of across from each other. It's pricey, but definitely worth a trip for a special occasion.
