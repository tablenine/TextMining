bad brunch! Bad bad brunch. Why? Things just didn't taste good. It was slooooooow the day I was there. I did appreciate the 'brazilian' flair of the menu, but the dishes just didn't deliver. I've had apps there, too, and wasn't impressed. More importantly, I was hit by amnesia the moment I left and I can't remember a thing about it. That's always a bad sign.
