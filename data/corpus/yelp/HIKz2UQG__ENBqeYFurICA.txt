Speedy Gonzales! 6 pm Saturday night and no wait for 3 people. We were parked elsewhere but it looked like they had valet. As we left, (55 minutes later?) it looked like there may have been people starting to wait for table.... . Proabably for good reason. The wait staff was very attentive. The food was good, and fresh tortillas! From an interesting machine! Children seemed to enjoy watching the tortilla machine. There is a little fence in front of it, its cute.. . The food, the people I was with very much enjoyed their chile relleno, chicken enchilada, pork tamale platter. They could not finish it all, so large portions. I got the salad, they have a good house vinagerette. Someone drank a margarita and seemed to enjoy it.. . It's kind of loud in there but I think it adds to the experience. It is not in the slightest bit stuffy, but not dive-y either. Good times.
