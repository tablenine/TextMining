Oh, come on, you know this place.  You like roast beef sandwiches?  Wanna eat in a mess-hall?  Are you one of those peeps who thought "Marge" (from the Carl's Jr. commercials) was kinda cool?  Oh, and...  wanna roast some nose hairs?  Well step on up.  Get yerself a french-dip, tip the kind gal behind the counter, then open up the sandwich and slap on *just a little bit more* of that HELLA spicy horseradish-mustard stuff than you think you can stand.  Take a bite and hold on tight...  . . If you lack the cojones yourself, well then at least it's always a cheap thrill watching your lunch-buddy start sputtering up his food as the mustard tries to burn him a new nostril.. . All said, if you gotta pick an L.A. landmark to chow down at, this one ain't bad.
