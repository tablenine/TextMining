Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
FINALLY got to try this place out over the weekend.  I hear this is their 2nd location (on Hollywood Blvd).  The decor gives you a "loft" feel, not as homey as their other location (so they say).. . Onto the real deal...My friend &amp; I ordered:. . -Sweet Potato Fries. -Original Fries (not the skinny ones). -Tempura Onion Rings. -Umami Burger. -No. 5 Burger. -Hitachino Nest Beer (Amber Ale). -Hitachino Nest Beer (White Ale). . Breakdown, the Sweet Potato Fries were a little too sweet for my taste buds.  Felt like they sprinkled some sugar on them for that "extra sweet" taste...didn't go well with me.. . But I do favor their Tempura Onion Rings (yummy fluffy batter), as well as their fries (steak cuts).  Definitely order a side of their ketchup, it's definitely not Heinz or Del Monte flavor.  Tastes like they put in some siracha or something along the lines of that.. . Umami Burger was DELISH - but I don't know if I liked staring at how raw the beef was.  The No. 5 burger was delish as well, the spices they put in with the pork was memorable and lingers in your mouth  (YUM!).  The buns that surrounds the burger was delicately toasted to give that nice crisp texture when you sink your teeth into the burger. . . Washed it all down with two types of beer.  I personally enjoyed the Amber Ale.  It had a fuller body flavor, compared to its white ale counterpart.. . I really enjoyed the experience, definitely will come back!!
