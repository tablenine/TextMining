Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
As a foodie with a taste for the weird, I really don't know how I had gone my whole life without trying the chicken and waffles combo.  And I'm from the south, too!  ::shrug::  Planning on making up for lost time.. . I made a special trip here on my way back from Laguna Beach and was not dissapointed.  I ordered the one breast (huge piece of meat!), one waffle combo.  The fried chicken is the best I've ever tasted, and the waffle was pretty good.  I've never had a bad waffle, come to think of it.  They also gave us a biscuit and, even though I was absolutely stuffed, I tried it.  It was perfection.  Flaky and buttery and delicious.. . Roscoe's will be added to my growing "when in L.A...." must-do list.
