Business Lunch Plate was 6.49 and came with soda..but the salad is a bit depressing with one tomato.. and the dressing needed abit more salt. Yes, the food is ok, not bad, but it lacked something..maybe mint in the yogurt sauce.. I dunno it just didn't really do it for me.  The meat was juicy, but it didn't look very appetizing, but don't let the look of it scare you... it  tastes better then it looks.  I skipped the rice-o-roni that came with my dish- the rice was a bit overcooked, and it tasted like rice-o-roni (which is not bad.. but not great..) . They gave ample meat.. the meat needed to be more salty..but hey better then too salty I guess.. Overall for 6.49- you should not be complaining- tastes way better then McDonald's and it's healthier for you!
