Insanely long wait. What is the big deal with this place?? It is just OK. The food is OK. The service is OK. It is not even "good"... just OK. . . A couple of my friends are fanatical about this place. I don't like it. I have gone 3 times. It's bland. I like the sesame paste, but you can get that anywhere really. . . ... but they wait for 2 hours sometimes! 2 hours!!!!???? I let one of them go get on the list, then I show up an hour and a half later. . . Don't waste your time.
