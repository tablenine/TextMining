SANGRIA....SANGRIA....SANGRIA....let me enlighten you....what happens is the One True God grows these grapes in the Elysian Fields using a heretofore unused incantation (TM). These grapes are then processed and transported down to this restaurant in the form of wine. The wine is mixed with perfectly chopped pieces of fruit, neither too large nor too small and i am sure some sugar, citrus and few other goodies are thrown in. Then it is served, perfectly chilled and with each sip you wonder, WOW....gimme some more....i might be an alcoholic after drinking this..... . Oh, and the food was really good too...I went with some friends and we shared the matador combo...the chicken was moist and tender and Â delicious. Stick with it as its the best dish on the menu, along with tostones, yuca frites and red beans and rice....and i almost forgot....make sure there is plenty of green sauce as its really flavorful and goes well with everything.... . The only flaw with this place is that the entire meal will cost you less than the pitcher of sangria. We had 2 pitchers and those alone were $44...the cost for food was $37 for 5 of us...the service is a bit off, and the best time to go is around the 6-7:30pm range as it gets really crowded and noisy after....
