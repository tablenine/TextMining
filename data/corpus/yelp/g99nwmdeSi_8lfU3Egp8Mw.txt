This review refers to our Mothers' Day Bunch disaster 2009. We arrived at 1:10 for our 1:15 Mothers' Day Brunch reservation. We were asked to wait while they cleared our table. As 1:15 came and went, and more than 40 minutes passed both my husband and I on separate occasions continued to check with the host to see where our name was on the list and when we could expect to be seated. Clearly, the host knew who our party's name and what we look like. Just as we were becoming certain that we were trapped in that Seinfeld episode about being able to take, but not to keep a reservation, our party of four watched a party of four leave. Great! We were certain we'd be seated next. Not so. Instead another group of four (who arrived after us...and without a reservation) was seated. We thought, well, surely there's a reason for this. When we asked the host, we found out the reason. Turns out the party of four that was seated claimed to be us! And the host seated them. And checked us off as having been seated. Thankfully, we checked with the host that final time. Otherwise, we'd probably still be waiting there. After more waiting, we were FINALLY seated. And La Tavola offered nothing to compensate for this. The food was okay, the atmosphere noisy and not relaxing. You couldn't pay me to return.. . And no, even though we were tempted, we didn't dump anything on our impostors. After all it was Mothers' Day. Which is apparently a totally cut throat holiday.
