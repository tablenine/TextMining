Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I've been waiting to try out this dumpling place for their famous xiao long baos.. . We arrived around 6:30pm and there was already a line waiting. It was about a 20 min wait. It's kind of interesting to watch people making dumplings non-stop through the glass window. . . Service is like any other chinese restaurants, everyone is in a hurry to get you in and out of there. Food arrived quickly after order, we had four orders of dumplings, two of the crabmeat, two of the pork. The skin was made just right and tasty. Of course, the ones in Shanghai are still best! . . The noodle soups were small in portion among the six of us. Â We finished within 30 min as a couple of us were still eating, they started cleaning up dishes around us. I found it a bit rude, but I guess business is business since there is a long wait outside. they should consider expanding the place. Overall, it was alright for me, now that I've been there and done that.
