I have come to think of pork tenderloin as a pretty hum-drum staple at home - Top Flr takes it up more than a couple of notches. Juicy and delicious. Get it.. . There, got that out of the way first.. . Nice layout - can't see the whole place from anywhere - like that kind of an "hey, explore me" kinda place. Palpably mellow groove here - the people, the music, the lighting, the friendly service... it all hangs together nicely.. . Wish I could remember everything else we ate there. Guess I'll have to go back soon!
