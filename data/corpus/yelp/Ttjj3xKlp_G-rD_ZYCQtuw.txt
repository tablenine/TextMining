There must be a very smart cougar in charge of hiring here, because there were some hella fine younger men working this place.. . I suggest you order lunch (try the Pan con Lechon...yummy garlicky pork goodness) and sit directly diagonal from the coffee bar to get the best view of the delicious barrista I have christened "Joaquim" so as to have a name to go with a face when I think about him later.
