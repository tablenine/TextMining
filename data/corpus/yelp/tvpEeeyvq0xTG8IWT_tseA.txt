3.5 stars.. . The ONLY reason I wanted to eat Korean BBQ in LA was for the rice paper.  Seriously.  When I ask for rice paper at Korean BBQ joints in the Bay Area, they have NO idea what I'm talking about.  Maybe it's because they don't speak English - but I'm pretty sure they don't offer it either.  The only place I found with rice paper in the bay area is in San Jose, next to an adult store and a homeless camp.  Pretty sketchy especially at night.. But meat just tastes better wrapped in a giant flat noodle.. . There is a 2 plate minimum when ordering meats for BBQ.  Normally that's fine, but the prices were a little high AND the portions were huge.  Between my boyfriend and I, we were struggling to finish the second plate of meat.  Though the quality of the meats were high, it was expensive AND we could barely finish.. . We had the brisket and the chicken bugolgi.  Yeah, I know, who orders chicken when eating Korean bbq?  But my boyfriend eats too much red meat and needs to cut down.  The brisket was fresh and the bugolgi was perfectly marinated.. . They give you a stack about 7 rice papers.  Not enough!  I could've eaten 3 plates of those at least, but I didn't want to keep asking.. . The meal comes with a soup, salad, and some sort of steamed egg.  I had never had the soup before - it was tasted kind of odd and we didn't finish it.. . At the end of the meal they gave us the dessert drink - they do make it better in LA.  Sigh.
