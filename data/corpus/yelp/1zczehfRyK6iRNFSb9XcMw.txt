Probably the quintessential "hipster" experience, but a great place nonetheless.. . It's simple: they have a variety of very interesting sausages, quite a bit of great beer on tap, and delicious fries. They don't skimp on the salt on the fries either.. . If you love sausage and beer, you'll love this place.. . Yeah the prices are a bit high, but what do you expect next to the Arts District with the Hipster Surcharge? And it's really not that expensive when the #3 Combo at McDonald's is running over $6 these days.
