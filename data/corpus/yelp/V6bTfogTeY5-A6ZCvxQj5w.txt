Came here because we had $25 gift certificates and wanted an excuse to check it out.. . It was Saturday night and the place was packed as expected. The music was good, but loud.I liked how the place was dimly lit with the outside, nightime glare coming in through the window. Pretty live crowd here and everyone seemed to be screaming.. . We tried the flights which were reasonably priced and then we went ahead and ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio. For dessert we had the Creme Brelee which was delicious. The servers were pretty knowledgeable and accommodating, but the only problem I had was they did not give us napkins and we had food. Had a great time here and we wound up closing the place up as time went by without us noticing.. . I also love their red pizza...Suprisingly it was some of the best brick oven pizza ever. Their mimosa flights are pretty good also...You get strawberry, peach, pineapple &amp; pomegrante. Very good stuff. . . .
