Restaurant: Furaibo Restaurant

OMG my mouth is watering. Furaibo is fabulous. I used to live really close this place and would dine in and out on a regular basis. First off, be sure to order the wings, mild or spicy doesn't matter. My other favorites are the beef tataki and the sprouts with bacon. Almost everything I've had here is great and you can sort of compare the size of some of the dishes to a tapas restaurant. I would always get 2-3 things for myself....and want more just because it tastes soooo good. Please mail me some or open one in Boston!
