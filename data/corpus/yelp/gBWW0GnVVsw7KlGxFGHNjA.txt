Restaurant: Raging Burrito &amp; Taco
Category: Mexican
This place is PRETTY good. The staff is friendly. I know they may not have better or higher quality ingredients at, say... Willy's, but their burritos are bigger and their tomatillo sauce rocks my world. So I guess that even though they've got more of a variety at Raging Burrito, it just doesn't get 'er done like some other burrito places. I still like them, though.
