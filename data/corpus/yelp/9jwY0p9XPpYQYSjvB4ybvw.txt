i went here for lunch today with a cousin who is about to join the army--i was taking him out and of all the places, he wanted to go here. . . the most interesting past of our meal was that we sat next to a lady who's been coming here for 50 years. . . i thought the food was ok. it was good, but not $36-good for 2 burgers ($7.50?? each), 2 fries ($2+ each), drinks ($1.50?? each), and a shared apple pie a la mode + tips.. . the economy is bad and/ or i may be just cheap, but i can't see myself going back here. unless, of course, my cousin wants to go here when he's out on vacation.
