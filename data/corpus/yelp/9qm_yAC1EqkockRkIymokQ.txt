Simple and unpretentious, this is one of the best sushi places I've ever been to. No fancy decor or complicated menus; in fact, all specials are presented to your table on a dry erase board with absolutely enticing options.. . They serve the most delectable and supple fish that just slithers onto your tongue and melts in your mouth. Upon receiving the bill, I was blown away by the moderate prices, considering the superb caliber of our food. I don't know about you, but in the past, I've spent a whole lotta money on sushi that's not even comparable to quality here. Favorites include the spicy tuna on crispy rice, albacore topped with fried onions, backed scallops, and jalapeno tuna. Mmmm...
