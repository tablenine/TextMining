Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Middle of the week, middle of the day and the place was packed.. . We waited about twenty minutes for a space at the bar, a table would have been longer.  No biggie.. . The menu, as you've probably heard, is small and simple.  You get a choice of several burgers.  For my first visit I went for the namesake: The Umami Burger.  It was really good.  Cooked perfectly, seasoned just right.. . Prices are not cheap for a burger so maybe that's why I ate mine slowly and delicately.  It was a good thing because I was able to enjoy the subtle flavors of the burger and the spices that supposedly make this place such a draw.. . Everything here is a la carte.  We shared onion rings and fries.  Both very good.  . . Would I race back here, probably not... but I'm glad I've experienced the mysteries of the Umami Burger.
