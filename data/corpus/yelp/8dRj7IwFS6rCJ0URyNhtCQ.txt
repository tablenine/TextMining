Tried to go here last night with a buddy because I got an invite from a promotion company that was promoting an opening party there. Supposed to be food and drink specials, etc. So we show up at 9:30 and the parking lot was deserted. We parked in one of the many open spot in front. On the way in we were greeted by the valet guy. I asked what happened to the party. He said, "Oh, they canceled it because nobody showed up." Ok, we still wanted to check the place out, but as we were walking in, he said, "Hey, I'm going to have to ask you to move your car." Excuse me? The parking lot was empty, the place was empty. We must have said something like "are you kidding" I mean you just admitted that nobody showed up for your opening party and you want the only customers to move their car. Then the valet guy said, "Ok, you can just give me your keys" of course he didn't finsh with, "and then you'll have to tip me to get them back after you tour our empty restaurant." Â We just turned around and left. There is something wrong with letting the valet guy be your customer service rep. I mean, he was the first and only impression we got of the place and he blew it. There should have been a hostess paid to make people feel welcome instead of a kid trying to make a buck representing the restaurant. Anyway, we may go back some day, since it is across from the best coffee shop in the city, but I'm not in a hurry.
