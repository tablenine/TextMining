This place looks kinda filthy.  It's cramped, the seats are old looking.  The area where they cook looks unsanitary.  The broth that they dunk those noodles in looks like polluted water.. . If they call your party and you're not all there, someone else will go ahead of you.  Also, after you get your food and drink, you don't get much attention afterwards.. . It also got a "C" health rating.. . But man I could swim and bathe in that broth.  Kotteri style. And that special chashu?  Like buttah.
