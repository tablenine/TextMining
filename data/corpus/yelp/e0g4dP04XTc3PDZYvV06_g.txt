Restaurant: Rathbun&#39;s
Category: American (New)
Where do I start... I was so excited to finally try Rathbuns. Went last night for Inman Parks Restaurant week. So first impressions - love the decor - our waitress (Alycia) seemed put out by us being there and that we were ordering off the prefix menu - the food was a little too salty as some other reviews have stated... Now all of that being said - I was impressed that the Manager stopped by every table to see how everything was as did Kevin Rathbun. I know that this place is more than capable of putting out great food and will definitely give them another try. May try Rathbuns Steak next time. We did hit KROG before dinner and had great service and great wine as usual!!!
