I loved the eggplant pizza.. Super fresh and super tasty! The environment inside is super cute too. Totally fits in with the surrounding boutiques and restaurants in the area. It's totally different then your normal pizza, so if you are looking for a pepperoni pizza with mozzarella, this place is not really for you. What they do have is fresh light organic deliciousness. I love to try new things and this place was a fun new surprise for sure.
