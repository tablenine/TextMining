Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Salads are so-so, the service is good when you catch their eye, the atmosphere is dingy, but cool (outdoor patio under a cover) - but you are here for one thing only, and that's all-you-can-eat (AYCE) Korean BBQ. Â The platters keep on coming, and the meat is good, and the price is reasonable.
