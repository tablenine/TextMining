I came here for a lunch/job interview. I liked the ambiance. Crowded and noisy, but not too noisy. And the food was reasonably priced so I didn't feel like I had to be careful which entree I ordered. . . Not to mention the food was yummy. Had the chopped fried chicken salad and thought the banana chips were a great touch. The service was good. The coffee was great.
