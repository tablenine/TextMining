The fried shrimp appetizer... reminded me of frozen coconut shrimp from a box, only not as good.  . I took one bite of my entree, left the rest.  The waiter asked if it was ok - I said no, it's too salty to eat (not a matter of taste, but health).  Often times when your food isn't edible you don't need to pay for it, or are at least offered a substitution.  The dish was duck curry - more like dried out overcooked duck leg with salty chef boyardee bright red tomato sauce in a bowl.  I kind of hoped it was a joke,   It was hilarious.  . . I think the times have changed for this theme park - it was recommended by a friend who's usually spot on.
