Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Had their tacos, decent, better than taco bell...not saying much though. . . Had a chicken Tamale, definitely not worth it. Its a spoon of chicken and the rest is corn. Not the most appealing.. . I hear their beef burritos is pretty good, so I might want to try that, but parking is the worst, and also there is an enormous line for no reason. I think Â someone paid them to stand there to make it look like it's a good place.
