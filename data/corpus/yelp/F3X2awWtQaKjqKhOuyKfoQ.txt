don't come here if you don't like garlic, otherwise garlic lovers are more than welcome!!!. . get the garlic french fries for sure!! they are to die for, mmm. and try their garlic ice cream. i thought it would be too strong, but i actually enjoyed it. albeit, some of my friends weren't too fond of it, but i like garlic, so i loved it. i say give something a try at least once, then go from there.. . everything else on their menu seems pretty standard, i don't remember my entree very much, but the fries and ice cream were the hit of the night.. . the restaurant itself is a pretty good experience, their decor is cool, and there are huge bottle of wine everywhere.
