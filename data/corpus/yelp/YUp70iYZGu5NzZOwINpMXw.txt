Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
I posit that *all* dumplings -- regardless of ethnic origin -- suck ass...    . . ...with one exception (which I will get to shortly).  . . Din Tai Fung is simply not it.   . . Now, before I get a slew of hate mail from my Asian brothers and sisters, I must warn you, per Webster's Dicionary:. . dumpling /dmpl/  Show Spelled ["duhmp-ling"] . -noun. 1. A rounded mass of steamed and seasoned dough, often served in soup or with stewed meat. . 2. A dessert consisting of a wrapping of dough enclosing sliced apples or other fruit, boiled or baked. . 3. A short or stout person. . . While #3 is the funniest meaning, #1 and #2 are the most apt for this argument.. . And my friends, if you are creative enough to combine the first and second meaning into a hybrid, you get PORTO'S POTATO BALLS, which UTTERLY SLAY Din Tai Fung dumplings of ALL VARIETIES.    . . I am submitting two letters this evening: One to the fine people at Porto's recommending that they open a restaurant next to this IMPOSTER Din Tai Fung and challenge them to an outright dumpling war.  And the second shall go to Webster's, as well as my US Congressman Adam Schiff, lobbying for the inclusion of a fourth meaning for "dumplings" in the dictionary:  . . 4. Porto's Potato Balls.  . . Church.. . In all seriousness, Din Tai Fung is pretty good.  Porto's is just...well...you can't compete.  Sorry =(.. .
