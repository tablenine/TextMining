My friends &amp; I went on Tues night for the $25 Prix Fixe.  It's a steal!  $25 for any appetizer, any entree and any dessert!  Some entrees are over $25 any other night of the week.   For appetizers we ordered the lobster &amp; pork siu mai, mussels, and Mongolian sticky ribs.  The ribs were my favorite of the three.  For entrees, we ordered the 3-way Peking Duck, Singapore Noodles, and Scallops.  I enjoyed the Singapore Noodles the most.  For dessert, we ordered the trio of sorbet, the trio of creme brulee, and the chocolate assortment.  The flavors of sorbet and creme brulee were unique and delicious.  The portions are the same as any other night.  We were stuffed to the gills.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
