Casual food and environment a bit smokey. I can imagine this place being a great place to relax on a summer night, with the garage door open.. I didn't enjoy the food all that much, but everyone else seemed to really enjoy theirs so it might just be my inner food snob. I enjoyed myself and would go back, but its not my favorite.
