Just went here the other day. It was pretty great. I had a good bowl of udon. I now want to try some of the different types they have. I also had an onigiri,which was kind of like a rice ball. The person I was with had the Wednesday A&amp;B special. It included tempura which was also good. That was my first time seeing octopus(I think, could have been squid)legs as tempura but it was quite tasty. So my main 2 things I look for in restaurants of good and filling food was there. All in all it was only $16 including tax &amp; tip. I could see going back or calling in a take-out soon.. I also have to say for 2 waitresses they sure moved around fast ,friendly and were on top of things.
