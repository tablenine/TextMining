Restaurant: Saigon Grill
Category: Vietnamese
Great prices and selection. I have found the food to be inconsistent though. Whenever I have friends show up unexpectedly (which is quite often) the Saigon Grill has always come to the rescue. Since they are about half of a block away from me, they deliver the food within 20 minutes no matter how much I order.
