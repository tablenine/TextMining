Just one of the many places in LA that is mostly atmosphere than actual substance. If you are looking for a place after the clubs/bars to be where ITS still at, then this would be it; a hipster hangout. If you are just looking for some grub and not feel like waiting 30 min for a seat, go across the street to House of Pies.. . However, Fred 62 does have an awesome breakfast sandwich with sausage, hashbrown, egg, and cheese all between butter toasted buns.. . Note: Don't get the carne asada nachos, it is mediocre compared to Alberto's and other such establishments. But if you are drunk maybe it won't matter. Everything seems to taste good in that state.. . I hate to like places like these, but when I leave the Dresden in a tipsy state, I am so drawn to it.
