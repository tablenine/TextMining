FOODLIFE is amazing! 3 course meal for $10 after 5pm! The options are endless and the food is always fresh and delicious! Ive had food from the chinese and rotissorie section. All was fabulous. Their cupcakes were soooo tasty! One of the best places to eat if your on a budget. So many choices everyone will be able to find something to eat!
