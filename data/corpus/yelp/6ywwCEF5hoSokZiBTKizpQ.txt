Category: Pizza
The deep dish here is a fav. The crust is the best part. It actually has flavor, not like eating a hunk of tasteless hard bread (which I hate). The sauce flavor isn't too strong but has chunky pieces of tomatoes.. It takes awhile (like most deep dish pizzas) but worth the wait.. . I think the thin has decent crust, and cheese is a bit different (but in a good way), but if you aren't really really into meat (as in pork) I'd skip the sausage. They put on huge pieces of this.. . If you're looking for a good family place, try the one on the far north side, Lincolnwood. It's spacious and decorated with tons of interesting sports stuff, no lines.. . I think the deep dish is similar to Gino's East but the crust has a bit better flavor, and is slightly pricier than Gino's East.
