Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
Ordered Coalfire for the first time as a carryout order.  Decided to go with the margherita and a prosciutto.  Order was to be ready in 10 minutes, (oh sh&amp;t!) so we sprinted to my car and headed up.. . The intererior of the place looks nice, and it seems the crazy lines and whatnot have dissipated since the disappearance of BYOB.  Cest la vie.. . Got the pizza back to the place, and it was amazing.  Very light and airy crust, and a mild sauce similar to the pizza I've had in NYC.  While the prosciutto was decent, the margherita blew me away.  Excellent use of fresh mozz and lots of fresh basil.  I guess just order any of the pizzas with fresh mozzarella  as a topping - cause its the worth the $1.50 or whatever.  . . 4 stars for being a unique and delicious slice of pizza in the wonderful city of Chicago.  That elusive 5th would come with a small price break on some of the pies.
