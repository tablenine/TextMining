Yummy!. . Our party of 14 got here at 4 and were seated within 10 minutes. I ordered miso ramen at level 5. Weak. The waitress made it seem like OMG THIS IS HOT STUFF. But I had to add more chili sesame oil to the bowl to get it spicy. Flavor was good. I loved the type of noodle they put in it.. it's a little thicker. I also loved that they put quite a bit of bean sprouts in it. Hubby didn't like that bc he hates sprouts but I liked it.. . YAY!
