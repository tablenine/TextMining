I'm so glad that I found this place.  Though I've only been there a few times, it's quickly become one of my favorite places in the city.  It's perfect for a romantic date night or even a girl's night out with your best friend.  The outdoor patio is lovely in the summer time, and the indoor seating area is quite cozy.  It makes me want to take a trip to Paris.. . Anyway, on to the food.... The Soup a l'Oignon Gratinee (french onion soup) is fabulous...some of the best I've had.  And the crepes?  They are to die for.  Repeat: to die for.  My favorite savory/entree crepe is the Poulet &amp; Fromage de Chevre (chicken w/ tomatoes &amp; goat cheese).  However, the Poulet au Champignons (chicken &amp; mushrooms) and the Fruits de Mer (shrimp &amp; scallops) crepes are also quite tasty.  And, you certainly can't NOT get dessert.  My favorite of the sweet crepes is with chocolate &amp; strawberries...&amp; they are definitely large enough for 2 to share.
