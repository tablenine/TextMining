it's been a long time comin for this review of the kogi truck. at first, i was very excited about following them. when i first discovered kogi back in february this year, they only had 1 truck. so it was indeed more elusive. i liked that fact though. the whole process of following them on twitter to see if they're anywhere near you. and back then, there was nothing like them on the streets. now, the novelty is kind of wearing off. i don't know if it's because of the food (which is tasty imo), or maybe because there aren't as many new specials being introduced (when i first heard of kogi i was interested at the different daily specials that chef roy was making) or if it's just because they're so popular now that maybe the thrill of finding something that not too many people know about is slowly fading for me. . . anyways, enough drama. on to the food! the short rib tacos are my favorite. just like a regular taco, but with short ribs = yummy! their black jack quesadilla is also very good. always look for their daily specials which sometimes can be pricey but will be worth it. . . i still go to kogi every now and then. if there's a short line i would order something. but if the line is comprised of more than 10 people, i'll probably just head on somewhere else. . . i think that everybody has to experience it at least once in their lives if not for the food, just for the fact of being in that redunkulous line waiting for tacos. :)
