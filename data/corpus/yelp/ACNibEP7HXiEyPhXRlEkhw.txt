Restaurant: Tokyo Delve&#39;s Sushi Bar
Category: Sushi Bars
i went for the first time ever today.... . got there early...we were the first customers...and were greeted by absolute craziness! . . i friggin loved it.. . i had no idea what Tokyo Delve was...in fact i was only there to get my sushi fix and a little buzz from sake bombs. Who knew that sushi could be this fun?!? Waiters being obnoxiously (but not annoyingly) loud...singing...dancing...my friend got a birthday cake and a birthday massage from Alex our fabulous waiter. Very attentive (everyone was attentive actually). We definitely got some prime sushi...and the best seats in the house (which were right in front of the sushi bar!). . plus the sake bomb show was pretty damn fun. (note to self: ORDER SAKE BOMBS!!!) . . you can argue that it's janky...but since i love janky and loud bars, this totally suited me just fine. . . there were games, and there were singing, clapping, there pom poms and standing on chairs...like really, it's a circus. . . and i love the circus.
