Restaurant: Silver Cloud Bar &amp; Grill
Category: American (Traditional)
I ate here on a Monday night, which is a $5 martini special. Needless to say, we ordered drinks...I had the Flirtini (highly recommended), my friend had the Tini Bikini (she said it was too sweet), and another had the Rain Cloud (big thumbs up).. . They had sloppy joes and tater tots, which they devoured happily. I had a bleu cheese burger, which I also devoured happily, and the tots. I think Silver Cloud could give more tots for sure (as other reviewers have mentioned).. . Our server was a fun dude. He bordered on flirtation, which, with our martinis, made the meal that much better. We sat outside on the sidewalk rather than in the gloomy interior of the restaurant (although it's very cheery in the winter in there!). . I recommend this place if you want a big meal at a decent price and VERY good martinis.
