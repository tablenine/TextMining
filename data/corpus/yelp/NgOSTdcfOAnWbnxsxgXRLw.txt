My wife said it all, "These are the best wings ever.". . I concur.  I like "hot."  . . My daughter and I tried the DEATH wings -- she likes spicy food, but I had to try one, too to get her to eat them.  After the one, she tore through the rest of them.  They were very flavorful, but I was kind of hoping to put my daughter in her place.  Needless to say, I did not get to see a crying, screaming kid, blubbering for milk.  Not really "death," but at least they tasted great.. . We have nothing this good in the DC metro area.  I have to travel to Atlanta to get my wing on.
