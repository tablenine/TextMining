Lalalala Lala's I LOVE you!. . First and foremost they have the Best chimichurri sauce!  I didn't even consider that it could be bought in a jar until a friend starts raving about some place on Melrose he went to and had fantastic green stuff with bread...which of course was Lala's...he ended up going home with a large jar of the chimichurri and now I'm slightly green with envy.. . Their Arroz del Campo is fantastic!  I also enjoy the plato mixto although my date and I always argue about what 'sweetbreads' really are which results in both of us being too repulsed to try it...Their beer selection is small, but I prefer the Sangria when I'm there anyways.. . In addition to the delectable food the prices are very affordable and the service couldn't be better.  I'm pretty picky about where I sit...no high barstools when I'm in a short dress, I don't like to sit in the middle of the room...I prefer to be outside, etc.  The staff at Lala's always accommodates us with a smile, unlike the Bossa Nova seat dictators...
