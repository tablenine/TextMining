Where else can you shepherd 12 girls out on a bachelorette party into a tiny space, BYOB, order a bunch of sushi and Thai food, and have it all be at a pretty reasonable price? I think the sushi is some of the freshest I have ever had, the service really sweet, and the prices are pretty cheap. . . Best yet, they do carryout.
