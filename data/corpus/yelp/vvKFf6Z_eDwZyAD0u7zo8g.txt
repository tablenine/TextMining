You'll swear you're at a stylish bistro on the East Coast because of the classic decor, impeccable service and bustling atmosphere, but the laid-back vibe, airy spaciousness and fresh-off-the-farm ingredients are distinctly Californian.. . My faves were the Modena salad with a perfect balsamic vinaigrette and impossibly fresh butter lettuce leaves; an impeccable Margherita pizza with the thin, crisp and flavorful crust you only get with a clay oven; and the eggplant parmagiana, classic, restrained and bursting with flavor.. . We also sampled the calamari, Caesar salad and lasagna...all fantastic! Â . . Its echoing, high ceilings are pretty loud, so it's probably not the best place for intimate conversation -- but a great spot for a power lunch, after-work drinks, or a casual but elegant dinner with colleagues or a date. The dishes are served family-style so that everyone can taste. . . Finish off the meal with a made-for-you chocolate souffle...velvety, rich and luscious, with just the right hint of sweetness and a decadent vanilla cream sauce to gild this perfect dining experience!
