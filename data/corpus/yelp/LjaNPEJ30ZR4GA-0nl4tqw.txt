Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Many have cried, protested and fought that there is no damn way that chicken and WAFFLES? can go together....then the plate arrives....the first bites are taken..the eyes become glazed-over...more butter and syrup is piled on as caloric and fat intake is no longer a worry and the food is scarfed down and conversation drops to ZERO...I have seen grown men smile at a Roscoe's chicken leg after all the meat on it was gone!!.....the menu isn't large however the prices aren't bad at all...as long as you have a piece of chicken and a waffle or two on your plate you'll be A-OK....a number 13 gets me through break-ups, lay offs and bad times and if you'd like to venture out the mac and cheese is pretty damn good and will clog you for about a week!...the staff is neighborhood and attentive...I love it... if you're an out-of-towner or want to be LA-certified get yourself a shirt and grab a few of the red sour balls, if there are any left, as you leave...and consider Â hooked!. . O YEA!!!! if the chicken doesn't have a ton of flavor...here's a little hood secret...add more hot sauce...good luck and enjoy
