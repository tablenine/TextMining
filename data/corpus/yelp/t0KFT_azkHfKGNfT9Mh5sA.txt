This place gets 5 stars for decor alone.. . The food has just been okay.  Honestly, I didn't even LIKE the veggie panini, but the I Am The Cheese Sandwich was good, and the coffee's delicious.  Do I care about the food here, though?  No.  I come here for the environment; an old house converted into a delightful, two-story coffee shop.  I especially love the living-roomish area on the second floor.  Red walls, bookshelves lining the walls, a fireplace, a chandelier -- this is the vision that I've always had for my dream living room.. . Come to study; come to chat with a friend.  It gets a little crowded at times; evenings are generally better.  Despite my complaints about the food, it really isn't any better or worse than the food at any other cafe.  But because of the ambiance, this is the best coffeehouse that I have ever been to.
