Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Either you love it or hate it. In my case I love Tito's. Been a fan for over 25 years. One of the best Crunchy tacos on the westside. Â Though I'm no longer a meat eater this I'll still vouch for Tito's. Plus their chips and salsa is banging.. . Tito's por vida!
