Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
My personal phylosophy in giving great reviews on restaurants is to consider the nature of the establishment (meaning what purpose it serves), the service, decor, how it compares with other business alike, and obviously the food. . . Daikokuya is the epitome of the L.A. Asian role in the wall concept. Within such small confinements I had the priviledge to experience the most friendly waitress (with the best smile... you know... those that make the eyes turn rainbow shapes), the BEST ra-men in L.A. (some say it's even better than in most places in Japan), and the best price for what you get. In truth, I don't know why I have not heard about this place before, but I will be sure to come back again and again and again. . . Though Daikokuya may not be categorized as a Fine Dining restaurant, its hype and ethnic flavors exceed expectations and manage to outclass plenty of fine dining business in L.A. Why, you ask?. . Quality Service: Check. Chill after work factor: Check. Amazing pork ramen: Check. Clean: Check. Long line at 3:30PM: Check. Hole in the Wall factor: Check. . PS: make sure you ask for the PORK RAMEN... it's orgasmic
