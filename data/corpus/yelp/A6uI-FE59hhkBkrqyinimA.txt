Hmmm... Â so much to say. Let's make a simple list.. . The Good:. 1) The interior decor.. 2) The complimentary valet. 3) Nice attentive bar staff. 4) The food, I think (more on that below). . The Bad: . 1) The cost of the food, the cost of the drinks. The food is not that great, so it really shouldn't cost $15 above. I actually think Spice Market tastes a lot better. . 2) The same goes for the drinks. I was suckered into a glass of buttery Chardonnay that I mean I've had better, smoother wine at The Grape and it didn't cost $11.50. . . The Ugly:. 1) There was just a dash of chocolate in the milk, if you know what I mean. . 2) The bald headed manager who I was trying to get his attention in my quest for some silverware. Our eyes met but he did not react with a "Can I help you?" or "Is everything okay?" Maybe it has to do with No. 1 above.
