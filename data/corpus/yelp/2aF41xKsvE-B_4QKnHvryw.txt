I've always loved garlic. And well, this must be the restaurant for me right?? I Â mean it was cool that everything had garlic in it. Including the ice cream! (Which didn't taste very good...) But it just felt like the garlic was too much..... . Wait times have always been good for me...maybe because we go before the dinner rush?
