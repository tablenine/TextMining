Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Oh how I love it!  It's my most favorite hangover food.. The chicken breasts are gi-normous.  I've never seen breasts that big (haha)!!  And there are so many great sides, I don't even bother with the waffles anymore.  Mac n cheese!!!  Red beans  n rice!!  Corn bread (don't forget to slather with real butter and honey!)  Collard Greens!!  Smothered potatoes!!!  I wish someone would smother me with this food.. I have been to all of the Roscoe's locations, and find this one (Pasadena) to be the fastest to get into (you hardly ever have to wait long to get seated here).  . This is food worth getting a big butt over.  Believe me, i speak from experience.
