Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
He looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.  Raymond Chandler. . I grew for a time in my childhood in East Los Angeles, in Boyle Heights, next to the Aliso Projects near the LA River, across which you could reach Little Tokyo in a 30-minute walk.  I played baseball for the Union Church Saints in the Evergreen League where our games were played at Evergreen Park, not far from the legendary El Tepeyec. . For a period in my life, El Tepeyec was the greatest restaurant in the universe.  In reality, it was a modest, small restaurant that did most of its business through a take-out window. It was established in the early 1950's, but serves up some of the best burritos of all time.   . . The burritos here are huge, packed with quality ingredients, and are smothered in a wet sauce.  I like the Hollenbeck Burrito, which is packed with rice, beans, guacamole, and pork.  The Manuel Burrito is another signature item.  . . The menu has been expanded and includes additional items such as enchiladas, chorizo and eggs, tacos, and menudo.  Their taquitos with guacamole are among the best taquitos I've ever eaten.. . I consider El Tepeyec a landmark restaurant.  It's great to eat here even if some of the legendary qualities of its past have fallen by the wayside.. . Don't be squeamish about eating in a restaurant in a tough, East LA neighborhood.  Don't go to the El Tepeyec in Monterey Park - go to the original El Tepeyec in East LA: burritos always taste better in the barrio...
