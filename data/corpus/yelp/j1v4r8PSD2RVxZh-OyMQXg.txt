Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
You might almost walk by it on the street, but if you look closely, you'll see a vintage-looking wooden door. Beyond the door, is a magical new world. Glittery trees out of a fairytale, an open patio, cushioned seats, alluring music. . . It is indeed pricey, but it is worth at least going to once if you live in Los Angeles. The menu changes according to seasons, as is the French way. There is always at least one vegetarian option on the menu, however. . . Go here on a romantic date or sit at the bar with a group of friends and enjoy the Mediterranean world you have slipped into.
