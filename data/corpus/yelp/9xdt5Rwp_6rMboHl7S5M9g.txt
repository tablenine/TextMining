Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
I need a T-shirt that says "I paid $14 for a no. 19 at Langers and all I got was a regular ol' pastrami sandwich."  . . My galpal and I were starving so we decided to do a quick drive-by.  We tried to do curbside pick-up but were unsuccessful.  I guess I must be blind b/c I couldn't find where exactly you were supposed to pull up.  . . Anyway, I was skeptical from the beginning b/c I saw the prices on the online menu.  My galpal swore the sandwich was big and that Langers was famous for their no. 19 pastrami sandwich.  In fact, prior to phoning in our order, we confirmed what Yelpers had to say about the no. 19.. . My heart sank when I saw the sandwich b/c it was about the size of a restaurant burger- like the kind you'd get at Chili's or Ruby Tuesdays.  But those burgers are way cheaper (like $6) AND they come with fries.  The Langers sandwich came with a pickle sliced in half that was in a vacuum-sealed bag.. . I know pastrami sandwiches are supposed to be salty, but I thought that maybe the sweetness of the cole slaw and the slice of Swiss cheese would tame the saltiness of the pastrami. It's a good thing it came with a pickle!. . While I have to admit that the quality of the meat was better than your average deli-meat and the rye bread was perfectly toasted, it totally wasn't worth $14.  So if you're a dude reading this, I think you'd have to order a side dish plus a drink or else you'd still be hungry.  But then your tab will probably cost you $20, and for that amount of dough you could get a complete meal for two at Chili's (can you tell I'm a fan of theirs?)!. . My parents insist that Canters has an awesome pastrami sandwich.  I guess I'll have to eat there and do a comparison.
