Restaurant: Wishbone
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I like Wishbone, but if I had a choice of any breakfast place in Chicago (and you magically didn't have to wait in line), I would not choose Wishbone however, . . It's southern creole breakfast, which makes it different. Like shrimp and cheese grits, which I know gave two of my friends horrible stomach aches, but it tasted really good. The crab cake egg benedicts are really good (hollandaise on the side of course). They did mess up my eggs though one time ... they completely overcooked them. . . Their pancakes here are awesome, pay the extra 2 bucks for the syrup, you won't be disappointed. . . I ordered the Red Eggs, which tasted okay, needed a little more seasoning, it was kind of bland. . . Service was great though when my party of 10 was finally able to sit down considering how packed it was. . . I feel like it's a hit or miss with this restaurant. I can have incredible food one day, but then sub par the next time I visit.
