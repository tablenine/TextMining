Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
3.5 Stars.. . If memory serves me right, I went on a Friday.  I hear that there are 2 locations and that the Culver City location is the roomier.  . . First things first, if you're looking for a waitress or waiter, you're going to have to go to another restaurant because apparently, Father don't play that.. . You have to use a bit of strategery to find seating but once (IF) you do, make sure someone's ass is planted there AT ALL TIMES.  Lest you get jacked by an overzealous patron, at which point, things may have to end in bloodshed.. . The food:. . Had the 'Office Burger' which I believe is the most famous and I might say, lip smacking good.  It was prepared medium rare, and had a side of the fries which was gobbled up by a person who shall remain nameless.. . The burger is pretty damn good, the sweet potato fries are sick (in a good way) and the meal itself really deserves 4 stars.  I just couldn't get over the seating and ordering part of the dinner experience.  Had the food not been so expensive, I wouldn't mind so much.  But when you're looking at a good $50 bucks for a couple burgers, fries and drinks, I think a seating host is not too much to ask for.  . . I will go back and I will bring friends, big one's just in case I have to fight for seating.
