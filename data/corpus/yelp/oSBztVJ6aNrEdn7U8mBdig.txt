If you're bored of margarita's (though I will never be), or just want to impress a friend with a good drink, go here and order their Mexican Long Island Tea.  This 32 ounce drink comes in a big clay bowl with a straw.    Great way to start the night--though you may not remember much of it later.  . . Oh yeah, they have food too.
