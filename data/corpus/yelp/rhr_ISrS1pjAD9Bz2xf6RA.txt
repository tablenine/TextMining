Iceboxx Watermelon Wheat Beer--WHAT?  How about, the best beer I've ever had in my life!  Yeah, I like fruity beers (Sweetwater Blue, Sam Adams cherry Wheat, etc).  Really didn't think I would dig the watermelon beer here at 5Seasons, though, but holy cow, it went down like Kool-aid.  It comes with a little watermelon slice on the rim.  The watermelons came from local Moore Farms.. . Go try this seasonal beer while they're still pouring it!. . And the upper level patio is as good as it gets for me.
