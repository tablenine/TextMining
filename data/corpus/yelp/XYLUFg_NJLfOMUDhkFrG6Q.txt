Restaurant: Urban Belly
Category: Asian Fusion
I went on a sponsored trip (thanks to a gracious vendor) to Urban Belly with a group of coworkers last week, and was a little surprised at how unspectacular the food was.  I had heard nothing but rave reviews about this place so I was excited to go there.  Immediately upon arrival, I noticed that there were only four tables- yes, four tables.  Four tables, each seating about eight, tops.  The restaurant was empty, and we were seated at one of the big tables.  The menu is tiny, and a little confusing.  I ended up ordering a bowl of soup with egg noodles, tofu, and I think Chinese zucchini.  It was OK.  It tasted like spicy prepackaged Ramen noodle soup.  Funny, but everyone except for the one Asian member of the party (and myself) LOVED the food.  . . I did try a few of the pot stickers and they were very good.  However, they aren't enough to warrant a return trip any time soon.. . I think this is the kind of place a lot of young people go to because it's really trendy, and rave about it because it's been on TV and it's just the "place to be".  I don't really think it matters what they serve here, it's "Urban Belly", a too-cool-for decor, highly minimalistic destination for yuppies and business people that plays techno music through its speakers.  I didn't dislike it, it's just not my thing.
