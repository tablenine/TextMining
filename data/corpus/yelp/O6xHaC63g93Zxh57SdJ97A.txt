Restaurant: Katsu-Ya
Category: Sushi Bars
I am always game to try a new sushi restaurant and I have tried MANY. Â In fact, I cannot tell you how many times I heard someone say, "I went to the best sushi restaurant!" Let me cut to the chase. Katsu-Ya is the best sushi restaurant in Los Angeles. The dishes are consistently fresh and delicious. The staff is good. Your green iced tea will never reach the bottom without being refilled.Try the yellow tail with jalapenos sashimi, albacore with crispy onions, and baked crab hand roll. Best of all, Katsu-ya is somewhat affordable (by sushi standards). Quality is similar in Studio City and Encino, although I prefer Studio City. Brentwood location is NOT as good.
