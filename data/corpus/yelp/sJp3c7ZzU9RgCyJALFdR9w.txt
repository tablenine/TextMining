Driving up to a nondescript section of venice blvd., you come upon the weathered sign for this charming mexican/Salvadoran place. I came on the advice of fellow Yelpers and was not disappointed. . . The food: The pupusas were hot and tasty. The tortilla soup is swimming with cheese and avocado; different than i have ever had before but excellent nonetheless.. . The crowd: young, westside folk mixed with spanish speaking families. This really speaks to their authenticity, as opposed to Lares.. . The service: friendly, very attentive. Clearly a family run situation. Also clearly superior to Lares.. . Leaving with full stomachs; M. and I had clearly found a new westside gem.
