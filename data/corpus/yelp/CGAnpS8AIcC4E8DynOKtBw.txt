Restaurant: Cafe 28

Cafe 28 is wonderful!  My party had two appetizers: the Taste of Cuba appetizer plate that had the Empanadas, which were delicious.  We also tried their special ceviche appetizer, which was also delicious.  For dinner my party had the Honey Jalapeño Pork Chops, Cuban Style Chicken, Cuban Roast Pork, Almond Crusted Halibut, Blackened Duck,  and a special lamb dish. All were wonderful, though I would not order the Halibut again.  The other dishes were too special to compare to the halibut.  For dessert we had lemon sorbet, tres leches, and hazelnut and chocolate profiteroles.  It was a great ending to a magnificent dinner!  Attire is between casual and dressy (jeans, nice shoes, nice shirt is ok).
