If I was Degrassi actor-turned-rapper Drake and my record contract demanded a song about hot dog pub, it'd be called "Wurstkurche I Ever Had.". . You da-you da-you-da-you da wurst,. Wurst I ever had,. Wurst I ever had.. Baby, you da-you da-you-da-you da wurst (3x). . Before you base my inability to spell the word 'worst' on the fact that I penned the lyrics to a rap song about a pub specializing in gourmet hot dogs and imported beer on tap, make no mistake in judgment. I'm not knocking this place because I dig it.  (Wurst in German means something along the lines of 'sausage'. Don't ask me what 'kuche' with two dots above the 'u' means.) . .  I dig that it's casual, low-key, stylish-in-an-ironic way and prices are reasonable. You order at a counter, then take your gourmet hot dog and glass of imported beer to a dimly lit cozy general lounge area filled with highly simplistic/minimalistic seats and tables probably from Ikea. Most of their beer is imported from Germany or Belgium and will run the standard $6-7 unless it's their cider-type beer -- that's $8 or $9. Can't say anything about the hot dogs, I just had beer that night -- do you think the record company would mind?
