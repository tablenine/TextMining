A really unassuming building houses one great martini bar.  We didn't order dinner, but we did have 4 martini's between the two of us.  Can't remember what i had, but I distinctly remember one of them having real muddled raspberries in the bottom-always a good sign.. . It was a weekday night, so it wasn't packed, just enough seats for everyone who wanted a table.  I liked the vibe, the music was ok, and I love any martini bar with make out couches.  . Will be going back to try more flavors!
