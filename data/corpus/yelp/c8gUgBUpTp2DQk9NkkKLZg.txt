Restaurant: Stella&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
I love this place, if not for anything else, for the strange sign on top of the entrance, being a huge hand with a pinkie ring, inviting you in... I guess.  But having this diner in the neighborhood gives a great option for any meal of the day.  And if you're like me, that meal is breakfast.  The food isn't phenomenal, but it's good homemade food, or pretty darn close to homemade.  The prices are great.  The service is fantastic.  In fact, the owner or someone from her family is almost always there.. . I've had the lunch or dinner food on occasion, and it's very good as well.  But really, we all know the best meal of the day is breakfast.  Except for dessert.  The individual apple pies are really good and usually fresh out of the oven.  If you don't eat a big meal, get the pie ala mode.  Speaking of ice cream, the shakes are great.  And while we're on the subject of drinks, the freshly-squeeze orange juice will go great with your eggs and potatoes.
