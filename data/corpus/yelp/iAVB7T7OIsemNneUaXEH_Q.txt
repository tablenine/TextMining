Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Ok. Titos lemme tell you about Titos some of my earliest memory's ever really ever were at titos tacos I can remeber when they had two salsas yeah crazy and they were free ! Titos lets go!!. 1 the staff may not be to pally with you in fact they may not like you or the five million jerks they slave for each day. but this place is busy and they wont spit in ur food. so thats nice enuff for me.. 2 the tacos are ok the burrito are ok !! but  its about the salsa get the big one  yeah the big one you will take it home and make love to it . you will eat your eggs with it. you will put it in your coffee.. 3 not so clean toilet but its a fast food place at least its got tp
