Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Thai Elvis drives a white Cadillac with the license plate "T ELVIS".  These people are serious about what they do.  For a big place, the service is very efficient.  You won't find a funnier free show in town, the food is very good (try the coconut milk + lemon grass soup), and the prices are extremely low, even compared to Thai restaurants without entertainment.
