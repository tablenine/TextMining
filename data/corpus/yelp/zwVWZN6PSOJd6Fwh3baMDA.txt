I'm not too big of a fan of the crab dumplings actually. I know this place gets great reviews but it's only so-so considering I've eaten an alarming amount of dumplings in SF.. . I like the red bean dumplings for a sweet way to end off my meal though! This place is pretty crowded. But it's still worth coming here..
