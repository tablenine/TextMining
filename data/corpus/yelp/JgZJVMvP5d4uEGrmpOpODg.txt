1review, woot! and of course its about mex food. the ppl that rated it a 1 star are rating it based on wut it is not, and wut it is NOT is a place where u take a date or a nice restaurant. its simple food that u crave. and if ur looking for the scenery or atmosphere, then 1 star will do, but if ur looking for some homecooking tacos and burritos.... Tito's is your place!
