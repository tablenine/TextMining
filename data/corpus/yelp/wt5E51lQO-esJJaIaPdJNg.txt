This is obviously a great place to be! Every time I set foot inside it is usually crowded and hard as hell to find a place to sit or even a bar spot..  This past Fiday night was different as we found a spot in front of the bar. We were joined later by some friends and enjoyed ourselves drinking and conversing. Pretty cool menu as they had a great beer selection, but some of their specialty drinks no longer existed. I ordered a Captain &amp; diet coke, but they do not have Captain Morgan Spiced Rum so I had to substitute it with some other brand that I cannot remember the name of. Whatever it was, it did the trick as I left pretty hammered. As I left I had a Delirium Tremons to cap my evening. I would like to come back at some point and try the food.. . In case you don't know, this is the place with the cool, lit up sign a few doors down from the classic Green Mill. Great place to hang and drink with friends!!!!
