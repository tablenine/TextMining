ok ok fuck the pizza isn't as great here anymore.  makes me kinda sad.  Antico is a better pizza at this point in time.  flavors were just kind of muted last night, and that's not the cold talking, I could still tell.  . . 3.5+. . I still want my grimaldi's though. now that shit was pretty good.  I suppose Antico's pizza nazi regime will have to hold me over until I get back to NY...  I mean was the stank eye really necessary when someone asked for extra peppers?  damn.  I know this ain't burger king. but damn.
