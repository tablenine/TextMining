Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
On my most recent tour of L.A. eateries I stopped at Osteria Mozza.  Early on a Monday night we made stops at A.O.C., Bazaar, here, and ended the night at providence.  It seemed like the only place really busy was Mozza.  I mean really busy.  Their pizza place next door was like a bustling shoe box, and even though mozza was considerably larger it had the same fun energy.  . We decided to go with the not so ordinary offerings.  We started with the calf's brain ravioli, the pigs feet terrine, and the sweetbreads piccata.  Each was simple and perfectly prepared. I wish I could find stuff like this in San Diego.  We also had some burrata, and a couple of other small plates, all were exceptional.  If you go you need to sit at the mozzarella bar.  It just feels better and you can see the cooks make everything.  Our server was great.  Her knowledge of the menu was better than most, which aided in our good time.  Thanks mozza for an inspiring experience and to the cooks behind the bar answering all our questions about everthing...
