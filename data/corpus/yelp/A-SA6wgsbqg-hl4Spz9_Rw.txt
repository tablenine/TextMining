Not the best, but also not the worst. Went here a couple weeks ago after going house hunting with hubby and realtor. DH and I were STARVING, so the food could have been crap and I probably still would have eaten it. I appreciated the place mostly because they were not a pain about making my vegetarian stuff without cheese or sour cream. But .... it was pretty bland. My husband said his food was okay but nothing special. Their chips are great, and the waiter was very attentive with our drinks. Overall, this is not a place I would go out of my way for, but I wouldn't run away screaming if someone suggested we eat here.
