You have to be ready for a scene..... . Cocktails, Loud Music, HoHum Appetizers/Dishes, and looping short films on a white wall... it's sleek, but you really have to be in the mood for gaggles of super trendy folks.  . . The food is okay.  Cocktails creative. But again, I think the draw to this place is the atmosphere.. . I did like the touch of the chocolate drizzled fortune cookie served on a pingpong though.
