I brought in a groupon for Coobah earlier this morning for brunch.  I had previously dined at Coobah for dinner without a groupon, and hadn't been too impressed with the food.  But this was the first time I was coming for brunch.  I was sooooo impressed with the brunch.  And the waiting staff was great.  It was a fantastic meal!  I will definitely be coming here for brunch again in the future.
