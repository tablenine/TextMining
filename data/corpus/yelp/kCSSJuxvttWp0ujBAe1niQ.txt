Where else in Los Angeles can you get a HUUUUUGE pastrami sandwich with a side of Â Fake IDs. . . I mean.. wait, what? Why no. I never partook in getting novelty ID's from the many different Passport places near here. And while never getting any of those toy IDs did I wait for the printing process while sitting in this great establishment enjoying the massive amounts of portions on the Pastrami sandwiches. . . I frankly never had anything else here. I dunno. It would seem like I missed out if I came here and didn't have the Pastrami sandwich, you know. . . I have to warn you. The area is pretty bad. Drugs, fake ids and other such illegal activities flow through the nearby streets. So if you're a single female looking for good meat sandwiches, don't come alone, I suppose. . . But this is one of those establishments that is iconic for the city. You have to come here once and when you do, your view on a piled high sandwich will be forever changed. . . You'll be wanting seconds or my name isn't Bruce Wayne. I even got ID to prove it.
