Totally worth the wait. We got there around 7:30, got our food like 45 minutes later, which is supposedly in good time. There was a shave ice truck right next to it, which is something you can enjoy while you wait. But anyway.. . Ordered the Chicken Taco, Tofu Taco, Short rib burrito, kimchi quesadilla..it was all absolutely amazing. The flavors were very asian, but also with some mexican spices. The short rib burrito is mostly meat, not that much rice, is so worth the 5 dollars!! I don't normally like lots and lots of cheese in my food, but the quesdillas were awesome. The kimchi balances out the cheese, and the sauce on top makes it a complete package. It's this red spicy sauce, some form of salsa i think. garlicy, spicy and heavenly. The tofu taco was great..something you should try even if you love your meat. . . LOVED it. would go again but the wait i heard, can be quite outrageous.
