I've been to this place several times now, and each time I've dined  the chef has come by our table at some point to see how our meal was. Honestly, that fact alone makes me want to continue offering my patronage to a chef who seems to care about his diners.  Kudos.. . Last night was BYOB (score!), and we opted for the $25 prix fixe menu, which is a hell of a deal for food this good. . . The pork belly appetizer served over corn polenta with caramel popcorn and a cherry-cola reduction was fricking insane delicious.  Perhaps one of the best dishes I've had here (although I vaguely remember an heirloom tomato salad from awhile back that was equally amazing). My gal pal's ravioli app also looked delish (and can I mention how big these portions are for a prix fixe menu!?).  . . The main course, on this occasion at least, kind of let me down.  The cod wrapped in a zucchini jacket was wonderful all on its own.  Perfectly cooked fish.  However, everything else seemed to overwhelm the dish, too many components competing for my attention but not working well together for me, and I didn't even end up finishing.  Total bummer.  I was truly hoping that dessert would come along and redeem my entree.. . The pineapple upside down cake fritter thing was a winner.  We loved it!  But I was a little bummed that the other two desserts were a Smore's dish and a flight of cupcakes, both staple menu items that have been there quite a while - and exactly the same cupcake flavors that have been on the menu for over a year at least.  Hmmm, maybe its time to switch it up a little bit for us regulars?  They were good, but I just felt a little bored.  . . I'll come back.  Hopefully the dessert menu will be ready for me.
