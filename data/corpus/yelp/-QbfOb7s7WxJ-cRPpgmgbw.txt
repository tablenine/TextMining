I'm surprised Resto only has 3.5 stars. I thought it was fantastic. It is one of those places I had wanted to visit for awhile, so my expectations were pretty high. . . I've been for brunch a couple of times. The service is always friendly and the food is very good. I especially love the Bloody Marys - spicy! I've also had the hangover pasta and the grilled cheese. Both very good. On my last visit we got the dutch baby to start. Really nice sweet treat to have after a night of drinking.. . I look forward to going again soon.
