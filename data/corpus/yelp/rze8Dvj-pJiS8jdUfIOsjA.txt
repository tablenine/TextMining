I love this place. So why the three stars??. .  1. There is never any seating inside -- not everyone smokes, you know! The only time we have been able to find decent seats are at 12 midnight...outside...in the cold! And don't get me started on how crowded it is on a summer day/eve... . . 2. The Hipsters/Too Cool For You people. Seriously, not everyone in this world is obsessed with you. I can't stand the whole "Yes, I am an (actor, screen writer, artist, photographer, musician) during the day, but what I really want to do is direct." type of people. And I'm an actress! How high is your 'tude when your fellow peers snicker at your ass?. . 3. Parking is a bitch. Even at night. Be prepared to walk or pay at a lot.. . But I do love the food, the proximity and the fact that it's open 24/7 without it being a Denny's. . . I'm so conflicted with this place...
