Unique, vegetarian-friendly menu, reasonable prices, cute, comfy atmosphere, and delicious salad (the Bite Salad) and desert (peach cheese cake). The only reason this isn't getting five stars is because I wasn't crazy about my wrap, it was a little bland. The Thai green curry was delicious and was a nice twist on your average Thai curry. It could have been a little less salty though. Will definitely be coming back.
