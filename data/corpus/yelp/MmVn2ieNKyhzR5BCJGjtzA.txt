I've always had great Â experiences at feast - the menu holds a lot of variety, their wine selection is solid, and the option to BYOB is greatly appreciated anywhere I go. Definitely check your mailbox inserts for coupons to Feast - they have been sending them out for months, and they will usually get you 1/2 off an entree or buy one get one free. A steal. I am a big fan of their chicken and steak dishes. I have never had to wait to get a table here and the atmosphere is cozy and welcoming.
