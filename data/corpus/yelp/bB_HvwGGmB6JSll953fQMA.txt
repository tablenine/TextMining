First off, I just want to ask Andy S. if he understands that the "Jesus is our dishwasher" shirts jokingly refer to Jesus as the popular Hispanic name (hay-ZOOS), not Jesus Christ (GEE-zus).  It's um, what do you call it.... humor.. . As someone who used to work in restaurants, I think it's hilarious, not derogatory.  But to each his own.. . As for the food, it gets a big, gigantic MEH from me.  But that's what most greasy diners are.  If you find yourself drunk, high or hungry in Los Feliz in the wee hours of the morning, this is the place to be.
