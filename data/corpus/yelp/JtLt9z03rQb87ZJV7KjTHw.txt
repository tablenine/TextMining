Okay getting into this place is a bit tough. There's no parking and the wait is on average about an hour, unless you beat the crowd and get there around 6 pm. This restaurant has been around since God created the earth, so they have a huge following. The winners for the night was the start and the end. The bruschetta is so garlicy crispy with divine fresh tomatoes. I can't get enough. And that perfect tiramisu. Nice.
