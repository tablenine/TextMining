This place has really good food and I totally understand why people wait.  I am only giving it 3 stars because we waited for a LONG time and we were starving.  Not to mention that when I went to check on our name, after 45 minutes, somebody crossed off my name.  We were right in front of the restaurant so we couldn't have missed our name.. . Anyways, the food is delicioso.  The broth is indeed the bomb because it was creamy and so juicy.  I think I would like to just buy a gallon of broth :)  Sitting at the counter made me feel like I was in a ramen place in Japan.  Awesome!!!
