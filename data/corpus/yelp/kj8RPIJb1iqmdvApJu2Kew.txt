EVERY single time I go here I absolutely love it!  HUGE portions.  Great food and celebrity sightings.. The staff is awesome too!  Sometimes on the weekends it can get really crowded.. Great location, parking in the back or on the street but never had a problem finding parking.. It's a great place to share and taste different dishes too!!!. Dishes that we had.... "Good Ol' Fashioned" ~ Our original buttermilk recipe griddle cooked to perfection!. Egg dishes are served with our Griddle Potatoes, sliced tomatoes, cottage cheese or fresh fruit and choice of bread. Egg whites. Two eggs: Any style. With our extra thick cut bacon. "Peanut Bubba" Crunchy French Toast ~ Our Mom's French Toast dipped in a peanut butter crunch and grilled to perfection...Topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream (this IS as good as it gets!)
