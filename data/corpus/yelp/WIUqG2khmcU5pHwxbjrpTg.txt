I finally returned to try their sausages. It was a Friday evening and as soon as we drove by, I was instantly made aware that I had chosen a terrible night to do so. The line to order was crazy long.. . It took us about roughly 15-20 mins to get to the front of the line. Finding a seat to sit in would have been even more ugly if we didn't already have people there saving us seats. It was packed to the brim with people. . . I ordered the Mango Jalapeno Sausage, which I thought was amazing. It was sweet with a spicy kick to it. That added with Caramelized Onions and Sweet Peppers just gave it the perfect taste. The Belgian fries weren't anything special. The sauce you order is what makes or breaks it. We had a few different sauces, but the two that stood out for me was the Thai Peanut sauce and the Chipotle Ketchup.. . Aside from the extremely busy night and long wait, I was happy I revisited to finally shove a sausage down my throat. Next time I come, it'll be on a weekday.
