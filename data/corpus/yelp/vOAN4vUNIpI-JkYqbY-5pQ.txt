I play this fun little game whenever I go to Letizia's, it's called "Stuff as Many Huge, Delicious Cookies into Your Face as You Can Before it Explodes with Joy." The split pea soup is also good.*. . *Note: I did find a piece of a steel wool pad in my split pea soup last time. Have you noticed a pattern in my reviews? I find a lot of non-food things in my food. Stick with me, if you have a preference for unidentified plastics or a certain color hair in your foods, I can tell you where to go.
