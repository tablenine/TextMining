Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
I found this place because my boss had reservations for lunch and the lunch canceled so we took it.  I had seen it on food network cause the owner is has a show on there.  Mario Batali.. . So we headed in and sat with the "LA People" eating gourmet pizza.  LA trips me out.  I worked out there for many years and I never got sick of the fake people.  They crack me up.. . Okay back to Mozza.  We would go and get a couple differant things and share witch is best.  Bizza Blanco and Meat lovers is pretty much my favorite. The meatballs are a great side order.  The place is pretty close quarters.  A older lady sitting next to us once gave me a meatball and said try this,  its to die for.  So I did and she is right.  If you go and you wait, its because its popular and the food is good.  If you dont want to wait, then leave but dont bitch about it.  Their are probably 10,000 other places to eat but just dont whine please.  . . Again, Meat lovers and pizza blanco, and meatballs.  . . Parking blows, its LA.  Remember, don't whine.
