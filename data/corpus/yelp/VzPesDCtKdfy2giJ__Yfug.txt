Yezzir!!! I tend to come here a lot on my Sunday's.  It's usally with my friends from out of town to have brunch before we drop them off at the airport.  I really don't know many other sports in ATL that compete with this place.  I mean, Waffle House and Steak &amp; Shake don't really count to me.  The biscuits are ridiculous.  Most of the menu is pretty much on point.  Grits, chicken sausage, omlets, eggs, etc., its all good.  Only problem is that you have to wait an hour sometimes to get a seat.  Deal with it.
