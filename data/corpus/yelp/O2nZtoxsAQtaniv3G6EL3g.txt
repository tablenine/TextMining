Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Alcove is my comfortable little paradise in Los Feliz. Located on Hillhurst just down the street from the very neighborhood I grew up in, Alcove is a wonderful one-stop shop for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, coffee, and dessert. They offer fresh, delicious fare and friendly efficient service. Alcove is a cute house with an enormous front patio and little nooks inside with couches and tables so you can hang out and enjoy your meal in a more comfortable home-like setting. It's bustling in the mornings, especially on weekends, but I have never had to wait. . . I am mostly a fan of their breakfast and their lunch. You can't go wrong with any of their omelets and french toast. Their sandwiches have my heart over their wraps, but they're all pretty good. Even the vegan one! Their burger is my standard when I don't know what else to get, but they also offer dinner entrees like steak, fish and chips, and pasta. Go for their cakes for dessert. Hearty portions, a little pricier than most in that neighborhood, but you won't be breaking the bank, either. . . My only gripe is that beer is expensive. About 9 bucks for a small bottle of Chimay. Eat a great meal, then walk on over to the Drawing Room for your night cap.
