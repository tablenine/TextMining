WTF, where did my review of this place go? I am 100% confident I wrote one before, since I talked about the chocolate bento box! GRRR... . . I really like Steel, it has a great feel to it on the inside, with the water falls, and the rooms broken up so it does not feel like a camp mess hall. The staff is very friendly (especially Sean Patrick, he rocks!). . . The food is served fresh and the perfect size portion for my likings. The orange chicken is very flavorful and hit the spot. The Chocolate Bento Box is perfect dessert for 2 people to serve, which includes a Chocolate Lava Cake, Chocolate Ice Cream, Banana Limpia (w/caramel/choco dipping sauce). . . For all of you looking for a great happy hour, Wed, $5 Martinis from 5-7pm WITH free sushi, why would you NOT go??? . . They have outdoor seating when it warms up, and this place is on my list!
