I stopped in the other day when I went to the Dekalb Farmer's market for the first time... . It's a cute little bakery, although I went around 4:30 and a lot of the items were gone. I took that as a good sign and since i love anything with mint chocolate, I opted for the last slice of mint chocolate cake. . . Since there is only one of me and I plan on visiting many bakeries around Atlanta in the coming weeks (not to mention that the slice of cake was bigger than my head), that ended up being the only food I tried from there.. . The cake was pretty good.. The icing was a bit overly sweet but there was enough cake to eat with it. I didn't like the overly bright shade of green for the cake, and maybe that made me biased, but I stuck to eating the chocolate layer in the middle. . . Overall, not my favorite mint chocolate dessert, but quite enjoyable. I wouldn't mind coming and trying a different slice of cake if I maybe had someone to share it with, but unfortunately my boyfriend is out of town, my friends don't eat very sweet things, and my family is perpetually on a diet. SIGH!. . I definitely wouldn't make a trip here unless I'm in the area for another reason though. (like the farmer's market!) . I still like Highland bakery cupcakes the best!
