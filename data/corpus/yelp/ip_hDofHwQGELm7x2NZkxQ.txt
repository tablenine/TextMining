Had dinner here last night with my husband and another couple. The service was great and the food outstanding. I couldn't believe they had both of my favorite kinds of oysters - kumamoto and beau soleil - both were to die for. The four of us were almost fighting over the dozen we ordered. Should have got two dozen! Plus their horseradish is so perfectly spicy and fresh. Amazing. The beet salad was good, monkfish quite nice, and the tagliarini with clams was delish. Very good cocktails, champagne and a bottle of pinot noir (yes, we indulged!). Can't wait to go back.
