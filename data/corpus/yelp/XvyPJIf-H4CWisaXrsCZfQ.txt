Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
I've been here 5 or 6 times in the past few years and while I usually enjoyed eating there I always leave vowing to try a different Korean BBQ next time. Perhaps it the fact that I smell like smoke and charred meat when I leave and need to shampoo my hair twice to get the aroma out. Or it could be the reliably slow service, long lines (getting in, and paying the bill), crappy valet parking, or low quality meats. When I've been here with a group of 6 or more (up to 16!) things just go much better as it seems the concept works better for large groups than small.
