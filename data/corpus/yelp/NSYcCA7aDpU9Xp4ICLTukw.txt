Restaurant: The Wiener&#39;s Circle
Category: American (Traditional)
Food: 3 stars. Hot dogs are darn good, but not the best I've had. But don't let that discourage you, I still recommend it. Where people go wrong is the fries. There is always a big temptation to get cheese on the fries when you're drunk. Do not do this, the plasticy cheese taints an otherwise great heap of fries.. . Atmosphere: 48 billion stars. Yeah, I said it. I like to swear, so when people swear at me, I feel right at home. As such, I feel like I could live in this place. I have brought friends from out of town here and some of them love it and others just don't get it. Those who don't get it? We're no longer friends.
