Restaurant: Tank Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Overall, I like Tank. I think it's a fun upscale sushi place and I think they actually do a pretty good job with the space that they have (I've been there when it's been busy and have never felt completely crowded or anything). Â I'm normally not too big into girly martini and hard alcohol drink concoctions, but the ones they have are actually pretty good (I'm especially a fan of the red octopus, which is basically a pomogranate cosmo...except better!) They get pretty creative with some of their makis, but I think for the most part they're tasty, even if its not traditional sushi (I'm thinking the Lava and Empire Makis in particular). But on some dishes, I think they take too many liberties (I'm thinking the Goat Cheese Tempura in particular). But again, I like Tank overall and I think it's a fun place, especially for a girls night!
