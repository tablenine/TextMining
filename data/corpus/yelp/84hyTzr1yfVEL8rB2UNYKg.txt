I went here last night, and was seriously disapointed.. Just because food is served on scorching hot plates does not make it good.. My bone in filet was overdone and bland as were the sides: mashed potatos, satueed spinach, shoestring fries.. . So overhyped and overpriced. Â Also, I fel like we were in a car dealership the way the server was trying to add on sides and apps.. . I will definitly not be back.
