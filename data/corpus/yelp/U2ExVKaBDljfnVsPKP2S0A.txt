I just got back from having lunch there.  Like nearly everyone else has mentioned, if you go at lunchtime, there will be (and WAS) a long line out of the door.. . To start, let me say that I love noodles... all noodles.... Chinese... Japanese... Thai... Vietnamese.  They are (and always will be) my comfort food... however, I'm not a big noodles snob.  That being said, I wasn't too overly impressed with the Daikokuya.. . First, was the wait... but I guess that's pretty standard with some places Downtown.  . . Second, was the service... I asked the waitress to bring me a water... and she didn't return with it until nearly the end of my meal.  My noodles did come quickly, though. . Third, was the selection.  Call me a picky girl, but I love options with my noodles.  At Daikokuya, there is one bowl of ramen (at least that I saw in the menu).  At Kouraku, there are pages of noodle choices.. . However, ignoring all of these, the bowl of noodles themselves were ok... better than many places, nice... chewy... with a flavorful broth and a yummy egg.  However, it didn't make me want to close my eyes and silently savor each bite.. . I don't regret going to Daikokuya... it was good... but I'll probably go to Kouraku next time I start craving noodles.
