best hainan chicken. ive had others but this is the best. Â  . . the chicken is always fresh, cooked perfectly, and never dry. the rice is fluffy. the portions is just enough. and the price cant be beat. and you can have all the ginger sauce as you please. . . its always packed everytime i go. but its worth the wait. usually 10-20 minutes. you can also order to go. . . they have a decent menu. the spring rolls are good. some pastas. but i only go here for the hainan chicken. and so should you. . . CASH ONLY! dont forget, otherwise you will be washing dishes.
