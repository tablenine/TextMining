Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
I use to think that eating fried chicken with something sweet such as breakfast waffles and syrup was the oddest thing. Was I in for a surprise, I loved it! Their fried chicken is so tender and crispy it just melts in your mouth. Don't forget to get the gravy on the side so you can dip your chicken in it. So mouth watering! I've only tried the waffle and chicken there and I can never finish the quarter chicken. Keep in mind I do eat A LOT, the portions were just too big. Every time I'm in the area, I look forward to stopping by Roscoe's for a bite to eat. The staff is also very friendly.
