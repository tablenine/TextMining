Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
The decor of Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ is a bit cheesy.  But secretly I kind of like that and the food is extremely yummy.  It's not quite as good as Trader Vic's.  But it gets the job done when you're craving some sweet meats and you don't want to pay the $30/meal price tag at Trader Vic's.  . . I highly suggest the Waikikie Combo.  The beef is sweet but a bit greasy and the chicken is delectable.  The Spam Musubi is definitely worth a try as well.  I've never had Spam before and the musubi left me pleasantly surprised.  I can't wait to come back to try more of the items on the rathe extensive menu.. . However, I swear they put roofies in the food or something.  The husband and I have eaten here twice for lunch.  And immediately after we're done eating we have to take a nap.
