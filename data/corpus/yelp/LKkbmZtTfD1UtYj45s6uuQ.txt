EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! can i say a big fat "wt HECK is THATTTTTTTTTTT?" i love trying different places all throughout town, and this place has gots to be worse than wiping your own butt with those baby wipes! . . o lord, please have mercy! i went with 5 people, we ALL ordered something diff, so we could try a leetle sumtin off each other's plates.. were we EVER WRONG. clam chowder tastes like crap! who makes clam chowder like THAT? better to buy it from the grocery and make it yourself. their meals, oh HELLZ no.. YUKO! the best was prolly their onion soup... their garlic soup was gross, super garlicy, list goes on.. . i'm not talkin shmack of my own race, it's nice to see asians here and there, but it's like another version of koreatown because the asians seem to pollute this place... . . i'd rather walk few blocks west and make me a happy camper and go to TOAST(another brunch place few streets down)... . . this is DEF a big fat no no... come ON yelp, change your rating to a 0 star. i'm really not in the mood to be rating half of my places a 1 star.... . one piece of GENUINE advice: don't waste your time in figuring out why the line looks long from the outside. i truly think that this place is "known" because it's another hip place to be, but it's DEFINITELY not worth it AT ALL!. . i repeat: don't let the LONG line fool you. i know our brain plays tricks on us, wondering, "hmm. i wonder if that place is any good because of all those ppl waiting in line..." ull thank me NOW and when you leave this world, IF and ONLY you try it AFTER THE FACT I SAID NOT TO.. . service, ok, i give it a 3/5.. food: -100! serious! it's THAT bad!
