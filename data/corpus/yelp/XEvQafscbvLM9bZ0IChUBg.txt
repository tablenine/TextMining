Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Update: Seat yourself on weekdays, look for a waitress to come up to you out of the blue and she'll "eventually" haphazardly pick out a seat on weekends. This whole system put me off. Seriously, it's kind of dumb. I can find an empty table myself thank you. If someone isn't clever enough to figure out how to do that, then they don't deserve a seat now do they?. . Everything I've had at Alcove is yummy. They have a great selection of food and drink choices - they'd be perfect if this place wasn't ridden with aspiring actors that hog the table all day (hey go over to the Coffee Bean down the street &amp; start a support group). Other than that, I love Alcove. Only, I'd prefer to sit on the side gardens instead of the see-and-be-seen front patio, and take the valet option behind the restaurant.
