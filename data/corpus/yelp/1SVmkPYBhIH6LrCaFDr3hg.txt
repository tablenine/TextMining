I was extremely underwhelmed by the food here.  Perhaps New York has ruined me, but for $350 for 2 people, I expected better quality and flavor.  The wines were good, but in terms of food, here is the beakdown: Seared Foie Gras - very standard; Scallops - Cooked well, seasoning was just ok; mussels - size/quality sucked, as did the sauce (how can u screw up white wine sauce?!); rack of lamb - quality fine, flavor just ok.  The only good thing was the ambiance which is what I feel like I paid for.  Service was fine, but save your money for a better place.
