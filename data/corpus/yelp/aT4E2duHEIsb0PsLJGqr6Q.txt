I finally made it over here for lunch the other day.  What more can I say that 500+ others haven't?  It was by far the best sushi I've had in L.A. and since I refuse to spend $300-500 per person at other highly regarded places , this will probably remain the best I ever have in L.A.  The sushi is done perfectly.  Not too much rice, served at the proper temperature a little cooler then body temp as opposed to some other places where it feels like it just came off ice.  For $15 I got the combo with two makis and and I think 8 pieces of sushi.  They don't give you two of anything so you get more variety in the combo and I even got a piece of toro.  Where are you going to get that kind of variety and quality for $15?. My father asked if they had a Dragon roll or something and the waitress was almost offended saying they don't serve any of "that stuff".  No dragons, no rainbows, no crunchy anything just great raw fish.  . For the sushi phobes, my wife had chicken teryaki which was also done great with a cripsy fried skin on the chicken. The Salmon collar the people next to me had looked great too.  Maybe next time.
