Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Good hotdogs, but a bit overrated.  The lines tend to be long here, as it's a trendy lunch and late night choice for food.  Also, the business owners surrounding Pinks tend to be unfriendly, probably due to vandelism, but they don't have to ruin the wait for us law-abiders!  . . The hotdogs taste pretty good, and the service is friendly.
