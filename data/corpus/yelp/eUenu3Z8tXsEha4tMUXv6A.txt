Food: 3. Service: 2. Value: 1. Ambiance: 1-. . While I rarely comment on the ambiance, this place was probably one of the worst places I've ever eaten at.. . We arrive at the restaurant on a Thursday evening (~7:30pm).  The place is packed.  The restaurant is bench seating, which works, if the restaurant is sizable enough.  This tiny warehouse... isn't.  There are people literally piled on people, trying to eat their food.  People are being inconsiderate, sitting at individual tables (with no food, just "hanging out") while 8 people are trying to cram into a space made for 2.. . We walk through the seating area and go order our food.  Could the people there be more pretentious?  The line is about... 15 people long, and full of preppies and arrogant people, commenting about how "Oh you should try the alligator" or "The *insert rare sounding meat here* is divine."  . . Seriously, you're paying $6-7 bucks for a sausage.  That's it.  Did you really have to stick your pinky out when you told me how "divine" this sausage was?  Really?  You're not sipping a fine wine, keep your pinky to yourself thanks.  Unfortunately, this conversation happened all around us while we waited in line.. . We got our food eventually, after escaping that line after 15 minutes, somehow nudging 2 more people into that crowded table, and ate our food.  Food was decent, but it's sausage... how hard is it to mess up sausage?. . Another friend came and joined us about 30 minutes later.  He saw the crowd, went back to where the line was (it was outside of the building, about 30 people deep OUTSIDE), said @#$%^ this, and we all left to go somewhere else a little less crowded, much less noisy, and a whole lot less obnoxious.. . We were looking forward to this place, and were hugely disappointed with our experience here.
