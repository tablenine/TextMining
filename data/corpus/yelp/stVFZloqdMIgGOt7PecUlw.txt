Great "fusion" sushi. If you're expecting the classic sushi bar, this is definitely not the place for you. I've honestly never seen so many female "sushi chefs," working behind the counter than I did here, the last time I was there. I've always heard that women have a higher body temperature than men, and their body temp somewhat "cooks" the fish. I suppose since this is less traditional, more fusion, it really doesn't matter.. . Their crispy rice is divine, as is their rock shrimp. Try their crispy sesame tuna for a slightly varied menu. Most of the dishes here are pretty good. However, I was there a few days ago, and tried their lobster dynamite roll for the first time. Nasty! It was the mayo part of the dynamite, and it was definitely over-salted. This was the first dish that ever had leftovers.. . Always a long line, and long wait so go with good company and conversations.. . BTW, parking is valet only, for $3.50 service charge. If you're gonna try, just know it's really hard to street park.
