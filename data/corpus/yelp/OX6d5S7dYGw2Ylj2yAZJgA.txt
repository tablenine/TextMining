This is my first try of Cuban food and I was pleasantly surprised by what this little place had to offer. I give it 3.5 stars!. . I went on wednesday for dinner and although it was a small place, they cleared the tables really fast and we did not have to wait to get a table. I ordered the coconut milkshake and was disappointed. It was too much coconut and not really a lot of milkshake, I felt like I was just drinking coconut pulp for most of it. Then I ordered the lamb for dinner, it came with fried plantains, black beans and rice and it was absolutely delicious. The lamb was fully cooked but still very tender and it retained the sauce very well. The sauce was a little bit spicy, a little sour but very powerful. I could taste the sauce with every bite of lamb and I felt that the two went perfectly together. The rice was good, it was lightly seasoned with salt and lime which I appreciated very much. I like a place that pays attention to small detail, a lot of places neglect the rice so it was nice that this place took the time to lightly season the rice to give it a little extra. The black beans were excellent as well. They were cooked but not all all mushy and they too were lightly seasoned. I think the black beans were actually me favorite part of the dish, along with the rice it was perfection. The plantains were good, what I expected and nothing special or out of the ordinary.. . Overall it was good food for fast and good service but not very expensive, I highly recommend this place!
