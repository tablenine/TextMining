Everyone has said everything there is to say about the food. It is great. How many ways can that be said. I do, however, want to take a moment to roll over a soap box and preach:. The thing I DONT like about this place is the super LA hipster too cool for school vibe it gives off. The vibe place embodies everything that I hate about Los Angeles. I walk in and instantly, it feels like I need to have an iphone, a 5 oclock shadow, a tattoo and yelp account in order for them to serve me. I dont really know where I am going with this. I guess it may be an aesthetic disagreement with whatever designer carved this mold. I just wish it was more genuine. It feels forced. It feels like a place that was custom built to please foodies. I will be back, just not to the la brea one. It is off to silverlake for me.. . Oh yeah, and the valet parking here is so irritating.
