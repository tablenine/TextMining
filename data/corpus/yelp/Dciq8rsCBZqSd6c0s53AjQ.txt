This used to be one of my favorite places to eat after class. They have a huge menu and the food, for the most part, is good. I always enjoyed fruit&amp;cream, breakfest panini, cinnamon toast, or their granola with milk. Sometimes it gets very very crowded.. . The atmosphere is nice, especially when it's nearly empty. The service is what kills this place. They are super slow, and a very "whatever" attitude with customers. With the exception of one or two, most of them seem miserable. Â . . I would recommend to check out, but the vibe fades quickly.
