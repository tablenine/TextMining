Came here for the $5 40-day aged Burker burger lunch special and reaffirmed why this is my favorite restaurant for all things beef.  . . Got the Burker medium, with fried egg on top. The yolk spilling over the burger was delicious. Also got the topping plate, which had homemade ketchup; delicious spicy mustard; red onion, jumbo dill, garlic &amp; chili pickles; caramelized onions &amp; mushrooms; and smoked bacon.  All of this resulted in one of the best burgers I've ever had and also the sloppiest.  I could have bathed in the spicy mustard, it was that good.. . Got the truffle fries, which were crispy and presented in a cute mini metal fryer, but didn't have much flavor.  Better ones at Rockit.  We also got the Tempura beans, which are huge green beans with a crispy tempura batter, with curry powder and sweet soy sauce.  I preferred dipping everything into the spicy mustard.. . Our server (Vito F) was funny, friendly, and attentive.. . What a delicious lunch!  Can't wait to come back for my next meal!
