Comme Ca...I'm giving this place 4 stars.  Took my mother in law here for an early Mother's Day dinner.  Very French...aka...lots of BUTTER.. . Had the Beef Bourguignon...and can I say...OMG.  The meat was cooked to perfection, carrots nicely caramelized and the pureed potatoes...oh so rich.  Had their Ginger Beer...a MUST try if you like ginger.. . Staff was great and accommodating...especially when they brought out a brand new high chair for my three year old.  A bit fancy for him...but, boy did he like the Mac and Cheese..... . Oh..the mac and cheese...so good...came out in a really cute cast iron dish.  Think it was made with Vermont White Cheddar and Creme Fraiche...not sure though.. . I only wish I wasn't feeling sick to begin with...I'm sure I would have enjoyed my meal a whole lot more...
