LOVE this place. What better way to start your day off with the "Black Magic" pancakes. O-R-E-O's and cool whip, how much better can it get?! I asked for  some fresh strawberries on the side and it was great. We were lucky b/c we managed to get a seat rather quickly (table for 2) When we left the lines were out the door. . Just remember to come really hungry because these pancakes are huge! However, they're so fluffy it's hard to stop =). If I lived here I'd go hear at least once a week (or more!) This was the best breakfast I've ever had. Our waitress was really nice too and took some pictures for us and let us take her picture as well. Oh, and if you look around, you might notice that pretty much all the wait staff and most of the people are very good looking .
