the octopus is basically a haiku of the sea. simple, beautiful and over quickly. . . everything measures up, including wine list, ambience, food. . . one star knocked off for the heffer waitress that didn't apologize for the fly in my bottle of wine, replaced it with an opened bottle with a mere glass left in it and said, "it's the same, it was in our fridge." You know who you are you animal.. . I would take off another star for the manager I reported this incident to who told me he had to hear her side of the story, but that's not fair to the food there. Â Been numerous times and bad service was a one time occurrence but the heffer is definitely still on Mozza's payroll. And let me tell you, SHE SCARY.
