I'd never been to this place but I was craving something light and healthy and my boyfriend suggested it.  It didn't look like much; there was a line out the door but the place looked pretty bare and the ambience was practically non-existent. . . My plan to eat light was derailed by the night's special: Braised Lamb Cheeks with grilled artichokes and parmesan cream pollenta for $10. TEN dollars and ZERO cents. I couldn't resist it and thank jeebus I didn't.  This might be one of my top ten meals ever. Part of what made it so good was how unexpected it was. . . This was a 5 star meal. The lamb cheeks were in a light sauce/gravy that was perfectly flavored, nothing fancy just impeccably prepared meat. It was literally fork-cutting tender and VERY juicy and rich.  The artichokes were a treat: unseasoned FRESH grilled hearts. A little too much stem for my taste but fresh artichoke hearts are one of my all time faves.  The pollenta was smooth yet toothsome and had  perfect balance of cheese, just enough to give it flavor without over salting it. I discovered that by including a piece of each on the fork I got a mind blowing mouthful of food.. . I also had the daily white wine special which turned out to be at least a 2 glass pull in a lovely stemless glass for $6.  It was crisp and fruity, acidic and not too sweet. I could not have asked for more.. . I can't stress this enough, if they offer the lamb cheek special, do yourself a favor and order it. You will be so glad you did.
