Restaurant: Joy Yee&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Vietnamese
I used to love Joy Yee's in Chinatown for the mango lychee freeze (which I think has become increasingly watered down with ice over the years).. . Then I realized that though they have an extensive menu, there really isn't anything that is done particularly well. The menu is super appealing with color photos and you feel like you want to try it all. Options range from Korean to Cantonese. But I can't think of one dish I have had that I would order again after going countless times in the spirit of open-mindedness.. . The service is generally poor in Chinatown, slightly better in Evanston. And they don't serve tea! What self respecting Chinese/Asian restaurant doesn't even serve hot tea even for a small fee?. . I can understand why people find Joy Yee's appealing...bright colors, fresh fruit, extensive/attractive menu. What I don't understand is why people go back and wait in line for mediocre "Asian" food, when you can just walk across the square to so many more authentic options.
