It doesn't matter if you are a disbarred lawyer serving probation or just a crooked politician with a wire tap, Gibsons has still got it. . . Who cares if it is crowded, the hostess has an attitude, you are so stupid that you come to this palace without a reservation, it is still great. . . Personally I'm a vegetarian, not. Some damn good meat and I don't mean the trophy wives and girlfriends. Cougar watch, stay away from the high maintenance Dennis R. Surf and Turf, baby! . . Shiat, a tad better than that Angus at Mickey D's with theirs aged over a month. Hell, concrete cures faster. Peppercorn, did you say peppercorn?
