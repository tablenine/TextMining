Restaurant: f2o Fresh To Order
Category: Sandwiches
The freshest salads Atlanta has to offer. The prices are great and the food is excellent. They have the very best caesar salads, in my opinion. The sandwiches and soups are good too! Portions are great size. I love the honey croissants. F2O is never really packed so you can order pretty quickly. The employees are super friendly. If its your first time here, do the half soup half salad deal, you can't go wrong.
