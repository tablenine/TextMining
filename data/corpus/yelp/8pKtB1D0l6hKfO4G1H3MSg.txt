I've eaten here twice and both times it's been top notch service and mmmmmmm food. Flaming cheese - the best I've had. Gyros are NOT over the top greasy but not dry - as goldilocks would say: they're juuuuust right. I asked for pinot grigio when I sat at the bar and he offered me greek white wine instead. I was a little disappointed at first. I thought, "Why wouldn't he just give me what I asked for? Why's he pushing the greek wine?" but I realized he knew what he was talking about. It was similar to pino, but sweeter at first, ended dry. Great suggestion. . . Also, if you're looking Â to stare at hot tall dark haired greek women, this is your place. How do they find these women?
