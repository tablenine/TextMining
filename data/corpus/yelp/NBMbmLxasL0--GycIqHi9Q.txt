Restaurant: Apres Diem
Category: French
Right next to the movie theatre is this restaurant/bar with a large patio, youthful crowd, and mediocre meditterano-American bistro food.   It has a more intimate lounge area in addition to the regular dining hall and its large bar area.  The entire interior is tasteful and gets very, very dim after the sunset, usually saturated with the combined volume of conversations.  It reminds me of those club-like food places around buckhead, except Apres Diem is more subdued and the crowd artsier.   Patio is huge but austere and the view can boast of not much other than movie goers--you also can't really see the pretty wait staffs (apparently a big draw) sitting on the patio. . . Menu is unexciting to the point of suspicious laziness, as other than the entrees most items are simple variations of plain old bar food.  The sandwiches are especially uninspiring, featuring perhaps too simply prepared meat and fish adorned with little else (lettuce and tomatoes on ALL sandwiches).  Entree selection is small, even with specials added to considerations, but at least are well made.  These do not stray very far from straightforward preparations of free range chicken, bass, rock shrimp (if that), pork loins and filet.   They often have a special mussels appetizer that is a great deal.  Not only is the portion massive but the mussels are plump and juicy.  The broth used is one of the spiciest for a dish of its kind, and is worth a try.  . . Drink list is satisfactory.  More than 10 beers are on tap that even includes a hefe weizen.  Food here is usually served until past midnight, making it a decent choice for that hour, but not so much so otherwise.
