I've never had Northern-style Thai before.  I've had Issanese, but this was more Chiang Mai regionish.  I liked it.  They did pile on the heat though.  It was almost over my limit.. . I had the mock duck with mushroom sauce, which was umami and picante and good,  I loved the fried banana appetizer.  I think it was a red banana or apple banana or some other kind of banana.  The eponymous dessert was phenomenal.  I had it with taro.  It wasn't the soupy stuff you get elsewhere, it was like a twinkie almost.  I'd go back just for that.  I'm tempted to do so now, and I just had a big lunch.
