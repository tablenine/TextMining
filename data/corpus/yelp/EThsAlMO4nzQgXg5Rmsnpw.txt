I've eaten here six times and each time I had the crab and the garlic noodles and each time it was amazingly amazing.  There is no way around this.  It IS expensive - too expensive.  I took someone there for their birthday and it was something like $190 with tip and no alcohol.  But those noodles - that crab.  Want some NOW.
