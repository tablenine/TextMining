Category: Southern
Roscoes does rock. To a virgin, waffles and chicken don't quite sound right....but if you think about it, a waffle is just a modified (and slightly lighter) buscuit. And when you try it....oh yeah. Also try their collard greens and cold water buscuits. Delish. . . For another decent fried chicken experience, check out Dinahs in Glendale on San Fernando Blvd.
