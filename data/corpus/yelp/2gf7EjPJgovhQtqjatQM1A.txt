Wow. the Hainan chicken is so good here!!! Â i love the sauces also, it goes so well with the chicken. I will definitely come back here next time i am in town. . . I enjoy the whole concept of sitting outside, and luckily the seats are on the side street, so less cars driving by. The restaurant itself is a bit small, so sitting outside is way more comfortable.
