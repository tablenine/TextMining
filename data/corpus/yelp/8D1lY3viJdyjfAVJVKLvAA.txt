HELLA hungry after a long day at Six Flag's Magic Mountain.. . I ordered the Scoe's #1(2 chix with gravy and 2 waffles).... HELLLLLAAAA GOOOD. . Best damn mother effin fried finger lickin chicken ever had in my effin life!!! Dizzaaamn! This is real talk foo!. . Oh How tasty the chicken was under that homemade gravy of theirs... And the waffles... THE BEST ever too. This place made me say "EF DENNY'S!!!"(which was actually across the street, haha!). . Our waitress was cute and was very kind too. I guess you can call her service as that southern comfort type of service. =D. . Can't wait to come back to this place again. Only if they had one in norcal. =(. . 5 stars! =D
