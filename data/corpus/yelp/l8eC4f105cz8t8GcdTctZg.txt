One extra star because you're better than Calbi :x. . I've been meaning to review this, but when I went here late night on Wednesday I remembered. My friend has been wanting a taste of the infamous most raved about truck so we decided to hit it up. The smell of food always gets my mouth watering and this was no different. I've only tried the short rib tacos and kimchi quesadilla before and haven't been back since -- until a few days ago. I'll probably be ordering the sliders next time.. . Is it just me or do all these food trucks seem way too overpriced for what they're giving? I guess they need gas money too -___-
