Restaurant: Café Santorini

Delicious food!  I had a pesto pasta dish which was AMAZING!  It was also gigantic, and I ended up leaving it at the restaurant on accident, which led to me crying myself to sleep when I realized I had no leftovers (it was that good!).  My 2 friends also liked it.  The little outdoor seating they have is super cute and I just really liked this place.. . Great atmosphere, great food, good stuff!
