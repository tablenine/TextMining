this place used to be great.  went there last night, really bad.  ton's of msg (i was yawning like crazy after)in everything.  i ordered a thai beef salad and they had actually BOILED whatever cheap, chewy cut of meat they tossed over a few pieces of cucumber and a lettuce leaf.  everything else was perfectly awful!
