Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
The lines are long, the place is packed, and no one knows which line to stand in (hint: just pick the shortest one--I ordered sandwiches from the "coffee" line, no problem).  Nevertheless, Porto's is one of those places that I dream about during the work week and can't wait to make the 30 minute drive on the weekend just to eat there.  I came here twice on Saturday, ordered a bunch of food, and paid less than $20. This is a great place for take out, since the atmosphere is hectic.  It's also a great place for potlucks/catering.  Food quality to price ratio is the best I've seen!. . I've had:. . Meat Pie (5 stars): Like the perfect pot pie in your hand.  This was great heated the day after too.. Guava cheese strudel (5 stars): *salivating*. Cheese rolls (5 stars): sweeter than the guava cheese strudel and equally addictive. Chocolate croissant (5 stars): Dipped on both ends in chocolate, with chocolate on the inside as well. Mmmmm.... Potato balls (4 stars): Not oily AT ALL, perfect crispness on the outside.  People were ordering these by the dozen.. Cuban sandwich (3 stars): This was ok, the plantain chips are a little bland. . Service here is great--extra kudos for dealing with the crowds in a pleasant, efficient manner.. *See pics*
