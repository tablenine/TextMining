This 2-star applies solely to their potato balls.  . . They just dont do anything for me anymore~  I read on a separate thread somewhere that they had possibly changed the recipe up (its been quite some time since i've had a potato ball) and all i can say to them is fail.   Fail on the meat goo they put in the balls.. . Perhaps I ought to just stick to their sweets because this was a complete disappointment.
