Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So who eats lunch/dinner on a Thursday afternoon at 345pm?? well, apparently besides me, about 50 others. :). Came here with my friends after taking my friend Lynn for a plastic surgery consultation. Anyways, the line was looongg!! . . TIP: Please don't park on the street meter between 4pm-7pm, your car WILL be towed right on the dot at 401pm. Park behind Pink's in their free parking lot with a security guard on duty.. . After waiting for about 45 mins. we got to order. The service was quick and friendly. We tried out each others' items. The hot dogs are not anything special, but the toppings are very fresh, not to mention creative. Now that's what make them special. Here's what we had:. . Today Show Dog: guacamole and onion and chili and cheese, awesome guacamole!. . Mullholland Drive Dog:mushroom, cheese, onion, bacon. Yum!. . Lord of the Rings Dog: topped with bbq sauce and onion rings. The sauce is really good and they sell it in a bottle.. . Walk of Fame Dog: topped with delicious coleslaw and chopped tomatoes. surprised that their coleslaw is really good!. . The hot dogs are about $5 - $6. They were a lot better than I expected, they are overpriced, but it is the whole experience and a hot dog w/o the usual ketchup and mustard that makes them unique. . . TIP #2: cash only, no ATM on premises.
