Category: Italian
If only the food matched the great decor/atmosphere.  I had the highest of hopes coming here the first time since it's within walking distance of our home and came highly recommended.  The wait wasn't bad (we got lucky), the service was very good, the restaurant is beautiful and warm, but the food....how can I put it?  Fairly forgettable.  I think that the problem may be my perspective -- Italian food (I believe) should be fairly simple and so I agree with one of the previous reviewers that it seems that the kitchen just tries too hard. . . I have since given Rose Angelis 3 other tries with 3 other couples since it's so convenient, but have never been impressed with the food.  I stopped ordering the chicken marsala (fairly tasteless) and while the pastas are usually solid, hardly worth a long (or short) wait.  Overall, the atmosphere is wonderful and the service hasn't disappointed (thus the 3 stars), but since the food (while presented beautifully and usually good) doesn't make me say "wow, can't wait to come back," I'll sadly walk/drive by this beautiful spot next time instead of going in.
