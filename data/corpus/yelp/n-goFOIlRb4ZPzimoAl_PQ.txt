The sushi is fantastic - especially everything under "Mitch's Special Rolls" - that one that mitch is blowtorching in the pictures is the "Awesome" roll. Two of us split the veggie tempura appetizer, the "Awesome," and the "Stars in the sky." We sat at the bar, so Mitch's direct over the counter delivery lapped the waitresses by a longshot. Everything was delicious, so we didn't really notice or care that no one picked up our dishes as we finished. . . Mitch is a super guy, he remembers his regulars, and is extremely friendly, even for a sushi chef.
