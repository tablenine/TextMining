Restaurant: Pozole
Category: Latin American
Pros: Good salsa, waitress was friendly, nice atmosphere. Cons: Bland food, kind of pricey for mexican food that's not that great. . This is like a more expensive Taqueria del sol. If you like ground beef tacos I suggest you avoid both of these restaurants.
