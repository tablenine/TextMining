Ok you definitely have to be a baller, shot-caller to hang out at this place. You have to like dropping over $100 for four glasses of champagne. You also kinda have to be a tool, a cougar or a sugar daddy. You also have to like pretending you're at the club hearing loud beats that prevent conversation unless you're as loud as I am. You have to like feeling like you're on the blue line at rush hour because it's so crowded you have no personal space. You have to like being the only person on a wait list for a table, waiting an hour at the bar for said table, then finally leaving only to be told when walking out the door that the table was ready (that wasn't really their fault though - they can't just kick people out you know?). You have to like standing next to a guy who was so ripped he knocked over his glass of vodka tonic, letting it shatter all over the bar and drenching the guy I was with...then saying something to him like "you owe us a drink for that" and having the guy give you $20 (not even enough for one glass of champagne...but i guess it's better than nothing). You have to like waiting forever with empty glasses because they are severely understaffed. You have to like the same Dom Perignon ad play over and over and over on the screens in front of you face. If this is your idea of a good time then hit it. We left and went to Webster's.
