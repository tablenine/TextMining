The reviews are true. This is the greatest steak joint ever. The Environment is airy and light with a casual vibe. The staff seems to actually be happy to be there. Everyone was smiling and attentive. The Bone Marrow Souffle seems to go straight to the pleasure of your brain. Then there is the steak. $160 for a hunk of dead cow may seem like a lot, but that's what real Kobe costs in Japan. Other places say they have Kobe, but this is the real beer fed, hand massaged, had a better life than you, melt in your mouth deal. Save up and go just once. Thats all you need. I would tell you about the dessert, but I was so busy giggling from the steak, all I remember was that it was sweet.
