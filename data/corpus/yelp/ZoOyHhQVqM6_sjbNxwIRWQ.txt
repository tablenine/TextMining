This place has the fastest delivery I've ever seen.  They're always at our place in less than 20 minutes  I sometimes think they're watching us, but that's another story.. . Onto the Q.  It's good.  Not nearly as good as Honey 1, but nothing is.  The meat is always tender, if not a bit bland.  But I dig their sauce, so it's cool.  And the sides!  Delectable.  One of my favorite mac and cheese spots in town.  And the green beans!  Greasy and buttery with bacon bits.  Mmmmm.  . . They have jazz at night, which always creates a cool, southern feeling.  I dig it.
