I found this place shortly after they open and it was undiscovered.  Lines were short even on the weekends.  I was looking for Belgium fries like I had at Benito's (long gone!) and Fritzj in San Francisco.  This place definitely fit the bill.  Great Belgium fries and an array of tasty dipping sauces.  Wurstkuche also has an interesting variety of sausages including some unusual game species.  Plenty of Belgium beers on tap.  Located in the Arts District.
