Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
A perfectly cooked burger is one of the most pleasurable foods and Umami delivers!  You only have 2 options when it comes to doneness here, well or medium-rare and being the bloody carnivore I am I could only go with medium-rare.  The location is very small and the parking situation looked like a nightmare so I opted to pay for the valet (not too bad at $2.50).  M and I managed to get there about five minutes before the big rush and were seated in the front area, the table were a little cramped together but the music did a good job of droning out other conversations.. . Lets dish on the dishes:. Sides:  M &amp; I both started with the house salad ($4) and it was nice to have a simple mixed green salad not slathered in extra ingredients.  The dressing had a salty undertone which complimented the natural bitterness of the spring greens and the cooks dressed the salad perfectly as well.  I would definitely order it again.  Next, we split an order of the malt tempura onion rings ($2.5).  These were good as well but a little pricey for just 6 rings.  The batter was very light and the rings were only slightly greasy but still tasted very fresh.  No comment on the side ketchup, very unmemorable.. . Burgers:  I ordered the Hatch Burger, medium-rare.  The burger was cooked perfectly and came out very hot (+++ in my book).  The peppers complimented the cheese and spread giving a very umami-ish taste.  I loved the bun and wish I could buy them for my own burgers!  M ordered the So-Cal Burger, medium-rare with the garlic spread on the side.  This burger was good too, but I preferred mine more.  . . In summary, I would definitely come to Umami again but would be more willing to try FO or Golden State first.  And I want to get my hands on that scallop burger in the future!
