Went here with the boyfriend's parents and I was very impressed.  I never saw the bill but I'm assuming this place was expensive out the roof.  The restaurant itself is hidden behind a store in the most surprising location.  Being only 5 minutes off-campus, I've driven by this place a million times and never knew it was inside.  The hostess was very polite and her demeanor was my first indication that this place was pure classy.  I actually went here almost a year ago but I'm writing a review now because it stands out to me as one of the best places to take a date in Atlanta.  The chef sent out complimentary pea something or another... can't recall the exact name of it but it was delicious nonetheless.  The flavors were exquisite and I was blown away by the quality and presentation of the food.  As always, dessert was my favorite part and Bacchanalia definitely didn't disappoint me on this one.  After this four-course meal, my tummy was happy and I was loving the ambiance of this place.  For such a classy restaurant, the interior was not over done and I'd say it was the opposite of pretentious.  I really loved the food and I'd love to go back someday!
