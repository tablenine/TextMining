Restaurant: Feast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
awesome awesome awesome. Feast is so on point. Albeit the service is definitely not the best, that's not why I go out to eat. The kitchen is super consistent, and the food is simple brunch food perfectly prepared every time. I even took my super picky parents here when they were in town and they loved it.
