I wanted to like square one more than I did, but I think it will live up to its potential on the next visit.. . Coffee and fresh OJ are great.  The fresh muffins are amazing too.. . It was a cold rainy day so we sat inside.  I think I would enjoy the patio much more when it heats up.  Just a little to quiet inside.. . I got the baked eggs gruyere and was disappointed.  Just not what I was expecting.  The hubby got the chorizo eggs and loved it.. . I think I'm going to try the eggs benedict next time.. . We experienced no wait, but the line started to form shortly thereafter.. . Lots of street parking around, its right next to the scientology center.
