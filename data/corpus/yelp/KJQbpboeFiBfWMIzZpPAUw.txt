Restaurant: Spago
Category: American (New)
Food: 3.75 stars. Ambience: 4 stars. Service: 5 stars. . My husband and I celebrated our 5 year anniversary at Spago's last Friday.  We have already tried most of the neighboring restaurants on Canon and La Cienega, and so we knew we could not live in LA without visiting Spago's at least once.. . And I am glad we did.  We sat outside on the beautiful June evening surrounded by strings of white lights (where a romantic proposal took place at the next table).  The food wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was definitely good.  We chose the 5 course tasting menu, and when I asked the waiter if there was an actual menu, he replied that it is pretty much up to the chef (which is totally fine by me). . . The highlight of the meal was probably the 3 amuse-bouches, particularly the tuna tartar hand roll. Delicious, I could have eaten 5 of those and called it a day!!  The main entrees were good, but none of them truly stood out.  Dessert was delicious and upon hearing that it was our anniversary, they spelled out "Happy 5th Anniversary" in chocolate on the dessert plate, which was a nice touch. . . I wish I was a wine drinker because the wine list aka encyclopedia was quite extensive.  . . Wolfgang wasn't in the kitchen that night, but as always, there was a star sighting: Celtic's Ray Allen and Ahmad Rashad.  And in typical Beverly Hills fashion, the other restaurant patrons didn't notice.  As Laker fans, my husband and I (and the wait staff)-  definitely noticed.  The "bread guy", upon noticing we were Laker fans too, stopped by our table with a funny anti-Celtic or pro-Laker comment EVERY time he walked by.
