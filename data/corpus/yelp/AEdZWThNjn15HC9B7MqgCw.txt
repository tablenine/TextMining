many of my friends are scattered around fourth ward, grant park, and cabbage town, and johnny's has become our meet up place of choice. it's close to everything (bikeable, even!) and always has something fun going on.  it can be a little loud at times, but if that's an issue for you, just head out to the back for comfy couches, or walk a little further to the lovely outdoor patio section.  . . the menu and decor are far superior to any other johnny's in or around atlanta. the pizza's great and my friends all swear by the subs, but i must admit the main attraction is the ridiculously cheap drinks.  if you're strapped for cash and not too snooty about what to drink, a pitcher of PBR is only $5 any night, mickey's (the malt liquor with the anagrams on the inside of the caps) run at about $1.50, and well mixed drinks go for $3. and if you're in for a night of heavy drinking, try their signature shot, the eye of the tiger.  . . definitely not for someone seeking a classy, upscale joint (try p'cheens across the street, maybe?) but if you're up for a low-key night out with friends, good pizza, and cheap drinks, johnny's is for you.. . if you need something a little more entertaining, they often have shows, there's trivia weekly and adult trivia (which is really fun with friends with whom you're comfortable discussing the nasty) on thursday nights and kareoke on wednesdays--a hint for that one: if you want to get in the queue early and often, tip the dj or buy him a bunch of eye of the tigers. ;). . [EDIT may 2009: since moving to the UK several months ago, i have been informed that johnny's has changed to jack's and is (possibly?) under new management. since i'm out of the country, i'm not sure how much of this review is the same, and how much has changed, so check the other reviews--but my guess is it's still worth a visit. :)]
