Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's? Why is it called Pink's It should be called Brown's for the excrement it serves. We had a burrito, and a hot dog. They were both so bad. The hot dog has a slathering of feces-colored chili on the bun, a pile of wilted lettuce, tasteless onion, and a hot dog that I wouldn't feed to my dog. The burrito was so salty, I needed to gag afterwards to get the taste out.. . I ordered a diet coke, they gave me a regular coke. I also asked them to cut the hot dog in half, and they forgot. When I trudged back to ask them to do it, they said they were too busy.. . What a nasty little dump. Avoid at all costs. I feel like standing there with a sandwich board telling everyone how nasty it is.
