Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
if you are lucky enough to live in friendship's delivery area, you must try this place.  i've never had better chinese in chicago (via delivery).  just do it...you'll be happy.. . eating in the dining room is another story.  i've eaten in the dining rooom on several occasions and have never, ever had attentive service.  i think that they are simply understaffed in the dining room.  it's a shame too because the food is sooo great.  also - i was informed last time that they are no longer byob.  boo.
