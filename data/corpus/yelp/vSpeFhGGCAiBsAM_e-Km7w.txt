Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
If you don't have Cable or watch Food network shows, i.e. Guy Fieri, maybe you didn't see the special he did on this restaurant.  Cemitas are a Mexican sandwich and street food which originated from a city called Puebla.  Their name says it all, really.  Check out the photos here or go to Google photos to see more.  I had an Atomica, it cost $9.  (The other meat options are all $7.)  The meat on this bad boy included carne asada(steak), milanesa (breaded butterfly porkchop) and jamon (ham).  The sandwich had a spicy taste to it and with the addition of this BBQ like sauce with a slow heat or pepper in it, it only made its taste spicier and that much more yummy in my tummy.  The bread was fresh and crispy, toppings tasty and bite after bite the meat still piped out smoke signals.  After I completed my sandwich I was ready to be rocked to sleep, quite a filling meal and I think I felt my heart palpitate.  For sipping I ordered a nice cool "Jamaica" which is a hibiscus juice (tea) with sweetener, which pacified the heat of the sauce, between bites.  Total around $10 dollars and some change.  I got another sandwich to go, I plan on having that one with spicy Maggi sauce, that would make it even more bangin'.. Small restaurant seen easily on North Ave, it's a fast food joint, so seating is as it comes.  Probably about seven or eight tables with seating for around thirty or less.  Parking is on the street and there aren't many places to get quarters so bring'em from home, if you drive here.  Another place to bookmark and stop by when nearby.
