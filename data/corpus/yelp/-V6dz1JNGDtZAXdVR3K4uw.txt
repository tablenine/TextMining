Ok it's gotten to that point with all this freakin' snow that I've surrounded myself with blankets and 30Rock and my poor refrigerator is freezing expired eggs and condiments. Grubhub can be addicting, let me tell ya. And usually a gamble, hard to trust the reviews on grubhub which usually consist of "the food is excellent" or "great food" - otherwise completely vague descriptions of food that is either excellent or horrid. So i often compare the rating on grubhub with yelp- . . Well i took the gamble and tried Feast and what originally grabbed me was there Lemon and Rosemary Chicken skewers over a mixed greens greek salad and pita and hummus. Sold. Add a fruit salad with lime honey yogurt and... . WOW. "Great food" ha! No, each dish is well prepared and thought out and i was amazed with the extensive breakfast menu that continues till 2pm, nice. I will have to make a trip to wicker town and dine here- Ordering food is usually not of quality and for delivery all i can really sell you on is . . scrumptious, i'm full and i have left overs and that matters most.
