Read about this here on my most recent trip to LA, and being the breakfast fan I am, decided I needed to go. . . First thing you should know is there will be a line, from opening on til past noon. 20 minute wait almost, but it's worth it. Big portions, nice friendly staff, a crowd you feel comfortable with in close quarters (because the inside of the diner is pretty small, and there is little outside seating).. . My only dislike is that a lot of the pancakes are jam-packed with sugar. My apple fench toast was coated with cinnamon toast crunch cereal. Add a bit of syrup, the sweet bread itself, and the gooey baked apples and you're about to fall into a sugar coma. Wish there were more fruity, light pancake offerings. Aside from that though, plain old good food at reasonable prices. Check it out.
