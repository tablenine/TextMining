I could eat here twice a day. The Kukicha tea is always perfect.   The T.V. Dinner is flawless.  The farmchop is the best salad I've ever had.  My friend Karen loves the Tacos!  Nicole loves the BLT with avocado.  The chocolate pudding is divine!  I just had the carrot cupcake and it was amazing!!! Eat this!!
