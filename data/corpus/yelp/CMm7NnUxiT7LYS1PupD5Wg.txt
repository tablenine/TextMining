Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Simple fresh sashimi. My friends and I were amused by the diverse crowd this authentic and casual little Japanese restaurant attracts- on this particular Sunday lunchtime there were customers of different ethnic groups and ages ranging from a elementary school-aged little girl to an elderly couple probably in their 70s. Apparently for many people this is also their Sunday sushi lunch stop. Â . . I love their Nigiri and Chirashi, though the portion size is not always completely filling. The scallop roll is creamy and delicious and the cuts of sashimi are generous. Their lunch combinations though, are unspectacular and pretty ordinary. For a light Japanese meal that will leave me satisfied Hide is one of my favorites!
