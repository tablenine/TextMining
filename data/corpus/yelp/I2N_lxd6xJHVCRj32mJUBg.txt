NOT worth it.  $90 for OKAY to tasteless sushi, beef, oyster shooters, cocktails.  The cocktails were the best part.  Oyster shooters pretty good, beef okay, sushi meh.  WAY overpriced.. . Very unimpressive service.. . Reiterating what everyone else has said, the view is A-MAZE-ING.  GORGEOUS and SOOO romantic.  The koi pond area is nice, very beautiful, can't really see koi in there though.. . We tried to cut costs by ordering just one entree and one sushi, but we were both so hungry we hit up some good ole Chano's for the ever trustworthy carne asada burrito + tacos.. . .....come here for drinks and appetizers perhaps, but don't expect a great meal here.  And maybe come if someone else is paying.. . Valet parking = $8.
