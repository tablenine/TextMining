Look, I'm getting married in less than a month and I gotta look good in that wedding dress. I'm also needing to save every penny so I can afford said wedding. But there I was, savoring my #19 with both hands, washing it down with their cream soda, not even talking because I just want to be alone with my sandwich. Even though after I finished the first half I was feeling kinda full, I knew that there was no such thing as taking home the second half. That second half of goodness must be enjoyed now while it's at its perfection. Every scrap of pastrami that falls onto the plate and even on the table surface must be consumed. This is not the time or place to fear the establishment's sanitary habits. Even though my gut is busting, I enjoy my very last bite of the best sandwich I have ever had. I don't even mind that both hands are so greasy it feels like I've just put on some body oil. I think nothing about paying almost $20 for my lunch that consisted of a sandwich, a pickle, and a drink. It was totally worth it.
