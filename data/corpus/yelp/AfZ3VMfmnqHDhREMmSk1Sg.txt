I like this place. The food is decent and the atmosphere is really nice, especially during the summer. It's not expensive and the food is good. The waitresses tend to be nice on the eyes. The food is prepared Distrito Federal (Mexico City) style. I like the carne asada and the huachinango. The place is not fancy and seems somewhat tacky. But if you go in with friends, I'm sure you will have a great time. Definitely recommend it.
