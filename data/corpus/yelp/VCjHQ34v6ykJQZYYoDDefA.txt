I personally do not like this place. I came there with my family and it took nearly 2 hours to get our food. I ordered Â "thunder chicken nuggets and fries" for my 2 year old thinking that was safe, however, it turned out to be chicken breast sliced in little strips and roasted potatoes. My daughter was not happy at all with that, and I ended up making her dinner when we got home. I ordered the crab cakes which were just ok. They were too soggy in my opinion. We had to go to the bar to get our own silverware and even ask for refills on water. They put 8 people at a table setting for 6. We were very cramped! I won't be back.
