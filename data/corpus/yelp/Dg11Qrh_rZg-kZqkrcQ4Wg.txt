Restaurant: Mediterranean Grill
Category: Greek
Heading home to New Jersey only showed me how good us students here at Emory and Georgia Tech (and State) have it. I live next to Rutgers University, and like any other college campus, it is surrounded by a bunch of Mediterranean  restaurants too. The difference between those and Med grill is that Med Grill is cheaper, comes with a lot more food, and it has significantly better food. . . The only thing that Med grill could have done better was to give more food and to make it better. So, after 2 months away from it, I went again. And Lo and Behold, the food was literally spilling off of my plate. OMG there was so much good. And the quality is just as good if not better. The lamb was flavorful and juicy,and ohhh mannn, the kufta kabob, I thought it was perfect when I first had it. Somehow, it is even better now. the combination plate at 9 dollars is a great deal. This is probably one of the few non buffets that I can get reasonably full at below 10 dollars. . . And the pita was so nice and soft too. Not hard and dense like the pita bread from other "fast food" Mediterranean places.  . . The increase in quality and quantity give it that hard earned 5 star rating. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta. Oh, and they have delivery now. = win
