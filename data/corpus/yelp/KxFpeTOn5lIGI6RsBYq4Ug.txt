The best french dip sandwiches I've ever had since I was a kid! I've grown to love their lamb dip more than their beef. Both are so juicy, on fresh bread and a choice of cheese. Gotta also get the custard cup!. . If you don't mind sawdust, picnic table style seating, 10 long lines (and each person ordering about 5 sandwiches and 5 drinks with a small dessert on the side) AND don't mind sharing the same deli mustard container with the rest of downtown then this is the place for ya!
