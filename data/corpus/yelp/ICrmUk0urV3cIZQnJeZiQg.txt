Definitely one of the best Ramen sit-downs I've been to.  Ordered a Miso-style broth with Eggs and Corn.  IMPACT Level (forget which #) but it's one notch above the normal, average spicy.  Bowls were huge.  Flavors were done right.  Enough toppings to fill you up.. . I did watch my friend do and finish their Special #2 Challenge. Crazy! Ghost chili and jalapeños galore! . . The inside is kind of small but they have a lot of outside seatings.  I would definitely recommend this place for spicy lovers.
