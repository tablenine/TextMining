I dream about the day I will return to LA and eat at Shabu Shabu once more.  I was dragged here kicking and screaming by my best friend.  I'd had Shabu Shabu in New York and was seriously less than impressed.  Why did I ever doubt "The Cruz"?  Has she ever guided me astray? (Let's not talk about her insistance that I see "How to Get Ahead in Business"... that was a fluke.)  Think soup dumplings at Joe Shanghai's.  This is one of those special eating experiences that you must have again and again.
