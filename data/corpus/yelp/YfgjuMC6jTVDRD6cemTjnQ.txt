Wow- i was taking a stoll with one of my friends around my neighborhood and stumbled along Gloria's 'hole in the wall' restaurant. Immediately, the dim setting, nice mixture of decorative pastel on the walls, and candle lit tables caught my attention and made me feel as if i was in El salavador!. Not bad at all! Shortly after receiving our menu's, Gloria came over to our table and introduced herself and took our order! She is definitely the sweetest ol' lady around and she reminds of  my grandma with her nice personality and superb hospitality. 15 minutes later the food arrived...OMG, i finally found out what i have been missing all this time! My entree was delicious, fresh, (steak marinated overnight), and tasted really home cooked!  We also ordered a few side dishes and appetizers as well-everything on the menu is worth trying. Kudos for small businesses that genuiely look after their customers needs/wants. Gloria definitely made a repeat customer out of me!
