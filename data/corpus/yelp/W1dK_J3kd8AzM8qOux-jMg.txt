I ate here once last year and had a fantastically delicious experience.  Hoping for the same I came here again for dinner and got a surprising same day reservation.  . The sardines and octopus appetizers were lovely-- flavorful yet light, a perfect beginning to our meal.  The burricotti with radicchio, walnuts, and honey was delightful although better when separated from the bread.  . . Unfortunately the pastas were so salty they were inedible.  The orecchiette with swiss chard and sausage had such wonderful elements that were absolutely ruined by such heavy salting.  I never send a dish back to the kitchen unless I'm absolutely unable to eat it and I could not put back more than 2 bites of this incredibly salty dish.  Our waiter kindly and promptly took the dish back but returned saying that it was not possible to be prepared this evening with less salt.  So he brought me the taglietelle with oxtail ragu which was just as salty. I was ready to resign myself to just keeping it uneaten at the table but our waiter offered to take this back as well.  . My friend's maltagliati with wild boar ragu was also heavily salted but she was willing to scrape off the sauce and eat it.  . . The wine was wonderful and bombolini for dessert was delicious.. Unfortunately, the pastas were a huge miss.  Someone in the kitchen ruined them with excessive salt.  I notice a few other reviews mentioning the horribly salty pasta.  I hope the chef takes note because this is certainly not how it used to be and such a simple thing to correct.. . Our server was very apologetic and happy to change my order however gave a long very passive-aggressive speech about people not being used to restaurant "seasoning" if they don't eat out much, NOT that he's referring to us.  He should have just stopped talking.
