Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Yummy ramen. Medium noodles, medium base, heavy oil. I take some of that red seasoning they have on the table side and toss a bunch in. That's delicious! You can also get extra noodle for like a buck. That's awesome.. . I've had the ramen, the takana fried rice, and chicken onigiri. All were very delicious and yummy. Definitely one of my favorite places to go for ramen and onigiri.. . The only negative about this place is how PACKED it is all the time. Better get in early or during off-hours if you don't wanna wait!
