Was here on Monday for the monthly wine tasting, which was very enjoyable.  The atmosphere is nice - open, yet warm, with a very cozy lounge area in the front.  The service was excellent, as was the food.  My only regret was that we didn't get more of it, but paired bites literally means that.  I look forward to coming back for dinner sometime, but I certainly plan to be at the next wine tasting.  Three stars is not meant to reflect negatively on this location - I'll re-rate it when I've actually dined here.
