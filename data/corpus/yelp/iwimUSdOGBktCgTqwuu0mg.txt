I've eaten here twice and for the money and the quality of food this is clearly a 5 star joint. The service is on point and friendly despite the long waits. Definitely make a reservation, if possible. The wine bar is great and you can usually get a table there with a far less wait.. . The first time I came here I ordered the wild boar ravioli which was. tender and delicious and the sauce was superb. I've also ordered. the braised rabbit on the follow-up visit which is not exactly common at. your usual restaurant in the neighborhood. The wine selection is vast. and well selected. Bring a date. Bring your mom. This place is great (except for the waiting).
