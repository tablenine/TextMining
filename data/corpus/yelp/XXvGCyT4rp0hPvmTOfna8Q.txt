Restaurant: Greek Islands Restaurant
Category: Greek
My husband recommended we go to Greek Islands last time we hankered after some Mediterranean good eats (he'd been before, but I hadn't) and I wasn't disappointed.. . I forgot how dense Greek food is and thusly I over-ordered, but I went away stuffed and very VERY happy.. . We ordered the saganaki and dolmades to split for appetizers. WOW. Despite my husband raving over the saganaki before we even left for our reservation I was still amazed at how good that slab of flaming cheesy, brandied deliciousness was! I almost wanted to order a few more for my main course, but there were so many other things on the menu my taste-buds were salivating over that I knew I had to restrain myself from the temptation.. . I couldn't decide between the mousaka and the spanakotyropita so I ordered a combo plate. Both were delicious and the portions were HUGE!. My husband's whitefish was delightful also.. . The wine and dessert selections were rather good too, and the service was fabulous but our table placement was not- we were near a kitchen door and were brushed past a few times. A minor inconvenience though. Charming decor.
