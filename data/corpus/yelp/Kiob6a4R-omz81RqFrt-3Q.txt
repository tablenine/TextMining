Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
This place started in Cuba, with a woman selling cakes to her neighbors...when she and her husband moved to the US, they bought a little place in Glendale. It immediately started getting awards &amp; recognition. The Glendale location keeps buying its neighbors &amp; expanding. They just opened this one in Burbank and it's just as good as the Glendale (and, I imagine), the Cuban locations.. . A "Cuban" bakery with pastries, breads, sandwiches, deserts, soups, and drinks. I don't know what makes a bakery Cuban (there's another one in Burbank called Martinello's) except the owners, it's just a bakery in my book. But the very best bakery on the planet.. . Porto's takes making pastries to a new heights. I've not yet tasted something that I don't like there. My favorite is the mango mousse cakes (hint, hint, my birthday is in February!), with a second being the potato balls. Also must-tries: meat pies, turnovers, cookies, mango slush drinks, feta sandwich, and raspberry mousse (in no particular order). My favorite place for loaves of bread is Panera. But my favorite bakery for anything and everything else is Porto's. Get some potato balls for your next party and watch your friends love you even more.. . ***Caution: do not go in the morning, the evening, for lunch, or on weekends. Despite its size, it is super packed at these times and it will take you at least a half-hour to even get to the counter.
