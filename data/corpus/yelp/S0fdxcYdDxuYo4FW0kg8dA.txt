Restaurant: 90 Miles Cuban Caf√©
Category: Cuban
In one word: Guajirito (green plaintain, steak, grilled onions). Wow! I love this awesome, laid back, cozy place. The people here are so cool. You don't have to wait long for your food, yet It is not fast food. The food is unpretentious and always delicious. My boyfriend and I will probably try a new sandwich each time we come. I ordered what I thought would be a small dessert and was surprised by the size of their bread pudding-a hefty portion to share and the taste was out of this world. Their cortadito coffee gives Starbuck's a run for their money. Sorry, Starbuck's. Outstanding. If you're up for a good authentic Cuban meal, you won't be dissapointed.
