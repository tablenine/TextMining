Damn good meats and impressive salad bar.  This place is money.  They serve these delicious cheese bread and the salad bar spread keeps you coming back for more.      . . What not to miss (by order of preference): filet, top sirloin-house steak, bottom sirloin, rib eye, and lamb chops. What to skip: sausages and anything chicken. . . I wish they served up some traditional chicken hearts though.   . . Food: 5 stars!! If you love your meats and love all you can eat...this place is the shizzle, For a fee of ~$65 (dinner) Saint Fogo will let into the pearly white gates of meat heaven!! . Service: 5 stars!! Only complaint is that the server didn't ask me if I wanted more wine but instead polished the bottle off giving it to me.  My pet peeve is when you don't have courtesy to ask if your guest wanted more.  Yes I am talking to you Asian server at Fogo!! Ask for permission before you act.  . Ambiance: 5 stars. Good crowd and very nice restaurant.  Setup is clean and efficient.
