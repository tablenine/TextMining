Restaurant: Alcove Café &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
yet another reason i wished i lived in LA and not nyc... i mean, seriously, we have nothing that comes close to places like this in ny, it really sucks.. . had an amazing lunch, and good latte.  service was super friendly (girl from new zealand) and we bought an unreal apple pie for xmas dinner... best apple pie ive ever had BY FAR. . note: do these LA restaurants realize that a place like this would seriously kick butt in ny, you cant get cheap fresh food like this, with a simple tasty menu.  here its all over rated waiter service places etc.  i mean, can someone name me one place that is even a pale version of the Alcove..?!?!
