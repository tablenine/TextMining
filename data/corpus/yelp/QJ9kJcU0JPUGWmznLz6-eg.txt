Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
The amount of people walking out in droves with Porto's bags in hand just kinda puzzled me. But it wasn't until my second visit that I finally understood the hype about Porto's.  Massive selection on Cuban dishes, pastries, cakes, snacks, and bakery items.  I had the Ropa Vieja dinner with rice, beans, and plantains. It was not as tasty as I had hoped but was satisfying. The Roasted Pork sandwich was better though simple and understated.  . . Upon walking in you will be served plenty of eye candy and your head will spin with the number of choices you will have to make.  It's a good lunch (or quick, casual dinner) spot and one-stop shop for a good meal plus dessert.
