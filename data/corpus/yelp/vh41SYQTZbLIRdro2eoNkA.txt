I loved this restaurant because of how much I loved our waiter.  He had formerly worked in the kitchen here, and he knew every ingredient of every dish. For those with allergies - this guy made our evening. I recommend this restaurant, and if I can get his name I will add it later.. . I only give the restaurant four stars because I thought the menu was just a little bit small.  I ordered the steak frites because I really could not find anything else I wanted that I could order.  Yummy steak, but the fries were nothing special.  Possibly frozen in a former life, even.  . . Grade: A-
