Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
I was going to say great breakfast place, but Grey Dog's is actually good for breakfast, lunch or dinner! During my most recent visit, I got the breakfast quesadilla. I liked that it was made with a whole wheat tortilla and wasn't too greasy. Although I canceled out the healthiness by ordering a side of home fries! Their menu pretty much covers everything: eggs, crepes, wraps, salads, sandwiches, etc. Their raspberry iced tea is amazing and my own personal hangover cure. They have cookies with a circumference of about a foot that I would love to try one day! On a weekend day, expect to wait in line for at least twenty minutes to order.
