Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I lived like 15 seconds (with in-rush j-waking) from this place for 3 years, but I went there my last day of living in Pas, because KFC next to it wasn't open that day. It looked like a homeless people lined up for their welfare checks every weekend morning in front of this place. That's probably I hesitated to go in and check out. Oh, and you expect to sit next to a group of loud annoying punks. . I did finally. They have Fried Chicken and Waffles. Oh, they got Eggs too. I can't judge or describe the taste of the food. It didn't seem it had. Syrup on chicken and waffles. Just imagine. $20.
