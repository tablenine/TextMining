Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I have absolutely no complaints. We were promptly seated and served, the chef seated us and the two other wait staff were very nice and polite. . . I ordered the Port and Stilton burger, which had carmelized onions and bleu cheese crumbles. It was a bit rare, but absolutely delicious.  Perfectly portioned, I actually finished the whole thing and was comfortably full afterwards.. . This place is small, and maybe seats about 20-25 including outside.  So if you're here on a busy day, be prepared to wait for your food.
