This restaurant is probably one of the best Chinese restaurants in Atlanta.  The food is excellent the prices are on par with similar restaurants and the staff is extraordinarily friendly.  They have come to recognize us when we come in and even those that don't serve us come over to say hello.  . . Excellent food and excellent customer service.  What else could you want?
