Restaurant: Luckie Food Lounge
Category: Lounges
"Is it a restaurant?" Yes.. "Is it a club?" Yes. "But how could it be both?". . I just didn't get the concept. But it's a typical Atlanta setup--the same thing you'll find at Strip or Dolce on a Friday night. People go early, grab a table, dinner and drinks and then stick around as the tables get removed from the center of the restaurant and convert to a dance floor. Another DJ upstairs and a patio roundout the restaurant/club transformation. . . Unfortunately, Luckie is the typical Atlanta club, which I don't like. Covers at ridiculously early times ($20 after 9:15), overpriced drinks ($10 for a well Lemon Drop, $15 for Ciroc &amp; cran), chicks who think they are models (justifiably, from the 5 different club website photographers there) and guys who stand around ogling the multitude of women gettin' down but never joining in the fun. . . This is a great place to take out of towners who want to go "out" if they're not quirky enough to appreciate MJQ or Apache. . . Oh well, I went, I had fun and you can find me on one of those websites if you look hard enough!
