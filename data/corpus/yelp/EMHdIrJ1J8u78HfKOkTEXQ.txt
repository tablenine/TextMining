What can i say that hasn't already been said... My favorite spot without a doubt. Beer is great, food is great, people are great. This is the place that every out-of-town visitor always wants to go first when they come into town. Beloved by 80 year old grandfathers to college kids to lesbian couples. Highly recommend warm pretzels, spinach salad, arugula salad, fish and chips, veggie burger with bleu cheese, malt vinegar on the chips!, and the volcano and brat, even though I'm now a vegetarian. . . Only drawback is some of the OTP and Buckhead customers who have discovered our local gem and started to ruin the atmosphere... . . Final note: If the only beer you drink is Budweiser, you need to go somewhere else.
