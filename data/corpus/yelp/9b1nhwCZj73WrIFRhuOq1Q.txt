Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
Square One has delicious food and celebrity sightings.  Something that's fun for me because I live in San Diego and we don't see too many celebrities down here, but we do have some good places to eat.. . The last time I went to LA I was at a restaurant and Ron Livingston was there, and today he was at Square One.. . Aside from that this place has great service and the portions aren't out of control.  I had the club sandwich and it was delicious.  Thick slices of smoked bacon, avocado and turkey.  The french toast looked really good, but I wasn't in the mood for something sweet.
