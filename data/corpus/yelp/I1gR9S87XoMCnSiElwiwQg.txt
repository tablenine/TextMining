I went here with my vegetarian coworker on a business trip and he was REALLY happy.  The poor guy is often stuck to bread and salad since rest of our coworkers usually prefer steakhouses when we travel.  While the restaurant is on the pricey side, everything was really good.  Definitely a good place to take your vegetarian friend and not have too bad of a meal yourself.
