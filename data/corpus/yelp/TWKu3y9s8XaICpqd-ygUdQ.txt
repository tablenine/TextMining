Some of the freshest and most delicious sushi in Los Angeles. I'm NOT kidding! I try and make it here at least twice a month. The wait can be a little troublesome at times so try and go either earlier or later than noon. Also FYI, the lunch special is only available at the tables. NOT the bar! But if you can get in and get a seat the dining experience you'll have is hard to beat.
