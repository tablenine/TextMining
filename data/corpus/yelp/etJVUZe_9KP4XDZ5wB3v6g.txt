Restaurant: Pho #1
Category: Vietnamese
The spicy beef stew w/ the side French baguette is awesome!. Although it is not as spicy as I would like..... and there was a lot of beef cubes w/ a lot of fat..... I still prefer this dish among the pho choices.. Also, if it's during the day, you can ask if they have any bahn mi thit nuong in the back....if you are lucky they do (because it's not on the menu....you have to ask for it! Â And it's so yummy here).. My boyfriend loves this spot....and it is appropriately named Pho #1!!!
