mmmmmmmmmm........ . I went with my cousins, we ordered: the potato salad, corn chowder, 2 lamb french dip sandwiches, 1 beef french dip sandwiches, and cheesecake. . . The lamb sandwiches were SO TENDER, but it actually just sort of tasted like beef to me, but like melt-in-your mouth beef. I didn't try the beef sandwich, but my cousin liked hers. The corn chowder was also excellent, the potato salad, was good but not great. The cheesecake also so, so. But wow, you've got to go for the sandwiches! (And go easy on the hot mustard, it may give you a lot of grief in the nose department)
