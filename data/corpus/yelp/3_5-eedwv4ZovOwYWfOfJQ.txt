This place is a lot better than just OK. Waaaay back in the late 90's when I was a college student (Yes, dear children. I am *that* old. Someone pass me an Ensure, please!), this place was actually open 24-7. It was an awesome place to pull an all-nighter with a gigantic glass of milkshake (one of the best in town, and enough for 2), alone or with your buddies.. . You walk in, write down your name &amp; the # of people in your party on their notepad, and wait for them to call your name. If you have a sense of humor, you can do what my friend did when we walked in here for the first time: sign in as "communist" as your name and indicated how many of you there are. Then they'll yell, "Communist, party of 4!" Since I have a very juvenile sense of humor, I still find that hi to the larious. . . Anyway, besides awesome milkshakes, OK Cafe has great chicken fried steak, vegetable plate (collard greens, mac n cheese, loaded baked sweet potato, oh, my!!), and.... FANTASTIC chicken nuggets, which come with equally fantastic french fries. I'm also a huge fan of their sweet tea, which comes with my favorite kind of ice - restaurant owners, please take note.... It's nugget ice, or bust!! Read the sales figures from said ice machine owners, and you'll see that I speak the truth here. . . Oh, yeah... Some people get kind of freaked out by the gigantic confederate flag on their wall... While I'm not a huge fan, I have yet to receive ill-treatment or get dirty looks from any of their patrons or staff, so I'm willing to overlook it because of the food. This is kind of a touchy subject for some, so I'll just leave it at that. . . Bottom line, if you're into southern comfort food, skip Mary Mac and give this place a whirl.. . p.s. Their coconut cake is also awesome. My favorite thus far in Atlanta.
