I was a bit hesitant to dine at Sepia given the mix of reviews I've received from friends and colleagues.  Given this, I was very impressed by my experience this afternoon and instantly fell in love with the warm and subdued decor, and not to mention very attentive service.. . I opted for the skate wing with cauliflower, almond and brown butter which far exceeded my expectations.  It' s always a gamble when ordering skate wing, as it can turn out very dry and chewy if not cooked correctly.  The dish was perfectly seared on all sides and flakily moist inside.  The potato emulsion with almond slivers, cauliflower, and some type of aged berry was a perfect blend of umami flavors.  Each bite evoked a cry of happiness and sadness for I was one bite closer to the end of the meal.  . . We came with a regular who typically orders the Bison burgers for lunch, but was sadly informed that with the introduction of a new chef, this was no longer offered on the regular lunch menu.  He opted for the farms burger with duck fat potatoes and seemed to enjoy his meal, but eyed my fish with roving eye.. . Irrevocably, I'm coming back for dinner.
