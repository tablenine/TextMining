Delicious! I was trying to be good so I ordered the turkey burger with the caesar salad and I was not disappointed at all, it was DELICIOUS! Fortunately my husband was not behaving himself so I got the chance to taste the UNBELIEVABLE YUMMY Nutella and Burned marshmallow shake... OMG! Everyone that goes there should taste this... it is SOOOOO GOOD! Everything there is amazing!
