I love seafood, so I was chomping at the bit to try Goldfish.  I loved the aquarium and "fishy" decor, but I thought the food was a little lackluster and the service somewhat neglectful.  Still, I might give it another chance the next time I'm in the area.  Such is seafood's allure for a pisce-tarian like me.
