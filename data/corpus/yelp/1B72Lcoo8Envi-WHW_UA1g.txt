Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
Literally, a square box built for ONE! This place is super small. You can't sit indoors without someone's behind brushing against you. If you're outdoors, the tables are round and not really made to be joined together for larger parties (we had 4 adults and 3 kids). The food was nothing groundbreaking. I've had better of everything we tried from the omelet to the brioche French toast (at the Alcove in Los Feliz!!). The wait was an eternity to get a table. If you plan on going, two is much easier to seat!
