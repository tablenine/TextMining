Okay, so maybe five stars is a bit too much for this place, but, really, it's not. . The biggest plus about this place is the fact that they have almost everything you want, their menu is huge! If you want chicken parmesan, they got it, corn beef and hash? you bet, motza-ball soup, why not? And their bakery pastries and yums are heart stopping amazing. . If you are looking for a place with the greatest food ever, don't expect this place to be it. BUT, they have some pretty decent stuff, their french dip is the best that I've ever had, and I like to rate places upon their french dips.. So trust me, if you go there a few times and pick out your favorite plates, you will find something that you can't go anywhere else to get, because Canter's will do it best.. Plus, this place has been in LA for a very long time, when you step in you feel like you are stepping into the past, you can just feel the memories of stars who have been there and events that have happened, if you live around LA, you HAVE to go just to experience that feeling.
