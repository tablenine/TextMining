Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I'm sort of a cheapskate when it comes to eating out, but Lawry's is so worth it for the price!  I love every aspect: the delicious food, the silly fancy-retro atmosphere, the beef carved at your tableside---everything!. . Here are my Lawry's tips, since there are a ton of detailed reviews already:. . -The (free!) meatballs and chips are good, but only have a few--you don't want to fill yourself up before dinner!. -Even if you're a light eater, get a bigger cut of meat and take home leftovers.  You'll thank yourself the next day when you can have a cold prime rib sandwich for lunch.. -If you have leftovers, you can ask for the meat juice to go, and they'll pack it up in a plastic container for you.. -The creamed corn is heaven.. -Dessert is so not worth it.  Just eat more beef!. . Enjoy!
