It wasn't that this place was terrible, just nothing to write home about. Yawn .... . Went here for dinner one night when walking around and just trying a new place randomly. The service was "eh" and the atmosphere was alright. It's a big place, so I suggest trying to sit near the windows. The food was just okay. Not bad, but not too exciting. Definitely a place for drinks with friends though, if that's what you're looking for.
