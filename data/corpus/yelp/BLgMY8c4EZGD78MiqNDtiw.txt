5 stars for their flawless Xiao Long Baos!. The other menu items I suggest are the Chicken Soup, brewed to perfection. And the "nian gao."  Many people order the string beans.  Their baby bak chow is not bad too.  . . For desert, they have the steamed red bean bun.  Other than that, DTF really doesn't have anything good to order.  But their XLBs are unbeatable.  That's why we always order 3-4 sets.  Enjoy!  =]
