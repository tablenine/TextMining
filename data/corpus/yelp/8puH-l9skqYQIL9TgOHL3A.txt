Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
All I wanted for my birthday was one of these pies (fried eggplant, mushroom, and homemade sausage). I didn't want to share, either. MINE. Was kind of hoping the eggplant would be fried into crispy little balls, but was pleased with the breaded strips.. . I agree that eating it take-out loses something of the experience, but I took some to work the next day and my boss liked it too (and he's a big ole' food snob).. . Still, I prefer to sit at a table with greasy checkered tablecloth, order a grandma salad (1/4 iceberg lettuce with plenty of ranch) and drink the house red after slinging Manhattans at The Chalet, one of my favorite bars. It has a nice, easygoing ambiance. Good people. Screw La Buca.
