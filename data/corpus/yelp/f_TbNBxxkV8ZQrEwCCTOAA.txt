"I'll take you out to eat pho tomorrow morning". . was what I heard the night before. . . "Steak and Eggs". . at Fraiche was what I ended up having.. . What the...? . . So the boy tricked me somehow while I wasn't fully awake yet on Saturday morning. I guess it's fine. The steak there was very nicely seasoned and the eggs were perfectly over-easy, so I was generally happy. Well, except that they made my steak medium instead of medium rare as I asked, and they also put insane amount of tea leaves in the pot so that by the time I got to the second cup, it was unbearably bitter.. . Over all, ok brunch place. Nothing too special. I wish we stuck with our original plan and had pho instead.
