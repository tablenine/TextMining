Had no idea about this place.  Just came here to meet with my friends.  The place looked great.  Nicely lit and very clean.  The place (or at least the downstairs part) is small, so tables were a little crammed together.. . We got edamame as starters -- as expected.  The restaurant definitely sells when it comes to their sushi bar.  We got the special Zuke maki rolls with breaded shrimp and salmon.  That was deliciously fresh and tasty to eat!  I got a miso soup, which as much as it was good, it was too expensive!  $4 for a small cup of soup?!?  Slightly annoyed by that.  But then I got octopus and otoro (fatty tuna) sashimi, and I was pleased with both seafood.  Octopus was meaty, and fatty tuna simply melted in my mouth as it should!  All my friends who dined there (seafood noodle soup, sauteed shrimp, seaweed salad) said they liked their food as well.. . The price is a bit hefty for the portion, but the food quality is quite good.
