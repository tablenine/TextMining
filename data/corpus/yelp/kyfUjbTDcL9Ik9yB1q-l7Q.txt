Hm... not sure what to rate it.. . It wasnt the best hollywood club i've been to, but it certainly wasn't the worst. Therefore.. a 3 should suffice. . . kind of weird. We go in around 11 and there weren't many people around the bar which was surprising but in a good way. No pushing and shoving to order a drink. Girls got in for free. There were a bunch of people dancing around the fountain. Took a while to realize thats where they were flicking their cigarettes. . . Tried to dance in the patio but the whole open exterior of the dance floor.... felt a bit odd. Couldn't feel the music pulsating off the walls and ceiling. Plus too many drunk girls slipping and sliding.. getting my feet stepped on, bumped. What did I expect right? Decided to head inside.. hiphop room? Much too crowded. I think there was a fight, smell of pepperspray still lingered in the air. Made me cough. . If fumes can hurt.. what would direct contact feel like?. . Bathroom lines are ridiculous, wished I could just duck into the boys room but possibly the bodyguard stationed for just that reason?. . Left around 1:20 to avoid fighting to get out of the parking lot. . . Overall it was whatever.. maybe it was me?
