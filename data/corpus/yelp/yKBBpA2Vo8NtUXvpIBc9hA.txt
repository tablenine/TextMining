Restaurant: Parker&#39;s on Ponce
Category: Steakhouses
Great meal, great atmosphere, great service!. . We did a late afternoon booking on Saturday using open table for a 7:30 dinner last night. and made a note that we'd like outside or front room.  They saved us a table outside but when we got there we decided front room and they took it in stride with a smile.  We ordered a cocktail at the bar and when we were just about done our table was ready.  . . We were surprised at all the other non-steak options on the menu as we had read the reviews and thought it mostly a steak house.  . . The fried green tomato appetizer was awesome!. . My husband had the new york strip and I ordered the bibb salad topped with steak.  Both of our steaks were cooked to our request, amazingly flavorful and very tender!. . The bibb salad comes with blue cheese which I think pairs well with steak.  It was tiny bit dry so I ordered a bit more dressing on the side.  The blue cheese dressing Courtney brought  was absolutely the freshest and best tasting blue cheese dressing ever!. . The restaurant ambiance has a mid-up-scale feel and seems to appeal to a variety of ages.  It was pretty busy the night we went but not too bad of a wait.   . . We really hope this place will be staying around for a long while!   It  fills a void that isn't filled by Ted's and much tastier than Sage ever was.
