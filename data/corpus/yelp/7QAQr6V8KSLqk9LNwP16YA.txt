what i love abut this restaurant is that they open til very very late, beyond the times the clubs close. the restaurant is dark and they have cinematic black lacquer furniture and everything.. which is a big contrast to the tables on the patio outside.. but the effect is quite dreamlike. . furthermore they have a very extensive menu! you have choices such as beef, chicken, pork, seafood, and get this: faux beef, faux chicken, faux pork, faux seafood. and theres great malaysian dishes like satay and roti canai as well.. . i havent tried the malaysian dishes but im always fascinated and adore the faux vegetarian dishes. amazingly tasty and might be even better than the real stuff!! the dishes is okay but im satisfied. They seemed to have limpy ugly lettuce as a garnish for every dish.. which is quite a chinese thing to do as well.. and my tip is dont ever eat the lettuce coz it a garnish and u dont know where it came from/been!
