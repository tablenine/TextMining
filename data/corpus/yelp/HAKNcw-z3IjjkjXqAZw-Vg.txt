Mmmm Ramen! I love this place! I will wait for hours in the freezing cold just so I can have a bowl of their delicious ramen! Luckily I'm never the only one waiting for my name to be called. I have lots of company outside lol.. . Their broth is so savory and full of flavor, the pieces of pork just seems to melt in your mouth and their portions are huge!! Very reasonably priced. Probably one of the best ramen places in CA. . I've also tried their pork belly bowl which was good, but let's not kid ourselves, the ramen really is the star of the show here.
