I went there for Brunch and it's was just OK. I gave it a 3 because I couldn't give a 2.5.. . The food wasn't really memorable, except for the sweet potato cake thing that was delicious. If you're picky, you might want to stay away because they don't allow substitutions.. . The service is rather... blah. Our server was a really friendly girl, but after she took our orders we pretty much didn't see her for the rest of our meal unless she was passing to go out onto the patio and we could never seem to make eye contact with her. . . The cashier guy was extra rude to me for no reason but not the guy I was with. After our waitress abandoned us, he came over and removed some things from the table and asked the guy I was with if we needed anything. When I asked him for a refill, he paused and gave me a blank stare like he really didn't want to do it. (But he just asked if we needed anything else?) Then when he brought it he placed it in front of the guy instead of me and was ignoring me for some reason. Whatever, it was odd and we just laughed about it afterwards.. . It's also tiny and if they develop a wait, they will try to speed you along.
