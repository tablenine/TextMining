Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I've been to Pink's twice now, and it really only gets better for me. I stick to the spicy polish sausages, and they usually come out really well. The first time I went with the Chili Spicy Polish Dog, which caused a little uspet stomach. The chili really overpowers the dog, and all you can taste is chili. I recommend getting something without chili, unless you really, really like chili. It gets a bit messy as well. The second time around, I got a pastrami polish dog which was a much smarter choice. Pastrami on a spicy polish dog, I would get it again if me and my friends had agreed never to order the same thing twice. Also the second time we went around 12:30 AM, didn't wait more than 15 minutes to eat.
