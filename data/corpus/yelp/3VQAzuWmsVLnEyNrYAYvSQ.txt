While visiting a friend in LA she took me hear boasting amazing banana pancakes. Well, after waiting for about 45 minutes to get seated, I was pleasantly surprised with the selection of pancakes, as well as the fast service (and the cute servers helped a bit too). The food was delicious and it was a fun experience!
