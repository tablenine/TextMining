Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I was excited when i went for the first time. After reading so much reviews about it and even seeing it on TV, i know i had to give it a try. First of all parking was ridiculous. but that was okay, i dont mind walking to get good food. when i got there, it was early so i didnt have to experience the long lines. which was always nice.. . On to the food~. First the menu was all over the place. for someone who's going there for the first time, everytime i found something i wanted to try, i always saw something else better. i ended up just buying 3 different hot dogs. =.=. . The Hot dogs were not what the reviews or TV said. the dog was plain and the toppings were so much and so gross i think my shirt ended up eating more of the topping then i did. . . If you want a great hot dog experience. id recommend driving around downtown and looking for those hot dog vendors on the corners. they are still by far my favorite hot dogs of all time.
