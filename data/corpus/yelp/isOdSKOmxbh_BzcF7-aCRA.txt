I LOVE this restaurant.. . Plus' - small, smart, pure food, great service, casual enough to make your comfortable, good enough to make you feel lucky to be there.. . He's the chef and she is the pastry chef... they are married and working hard - I'm concerned about there future.. . Minus - I can't get the Himache C.M - out of my mind!!!!  LA's best Appetizer (Meal in itself)!!!!   Love the wine list - service and style of this place... HOME RUN for me.
