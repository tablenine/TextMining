Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
There's a reason 152 people have uploaded photos of their food, it's really good. I don't know how to explain the reviews that say otherwise. The selection is unique, the portions are big and there are large and small breakfast, lunch and dinner type items. I like everything I've had here, especially the big salads!. . When I first moved to Los Feliz, this building was a lawyer's office. I used to walk by and think what a cool spot for a restaurant it would be and then voila! It was Alcove. The outdoor seating is lovely. There is very little like this in Los Angeles, let alone in this neighborhood. I've always liked the metropolitan vibe here, great people watching! Over the years, I've brought visitors from out of town, friends, and even my mom. They all loved it. (My mom still talks about it years later.). . This place is perfect for a casual business meeting that takes place during the week or for bringing people from out of town who want to see what Hollywood is all about -- especially after a trip to Griffith Observatory. I'm not giving it five stars because a) it is very popular and on the weekends you have to wait a long time in line b) parking is a bitch and c) it's a tad expensive for counter service.
