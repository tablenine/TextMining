I know that this place is THE birthday dinner destination of LA, but I went ahead anyway and made a Saturday reservation to celebrate the anniversary of my girlfriend exiting her mom's uterus. . . By the time the helicopter airlifted my Jabba-like body out of Mastro's, I was half-scotch/half-cow. Small chunks of Alaskan king crab were stuck to my chin as I bellowed to the heavens. Mothers hid their terrified children's eyes as my pants exploded into nothingness .... . Anyway.. . If it didn't shorten my lifespan by a decade, I'd eat here every week.
