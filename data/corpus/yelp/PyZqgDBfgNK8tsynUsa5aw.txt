I've visited Los Angeles many time before and have wanted to dine at Toast every time. However each attempt was thwarted by a long wait list. Finally I decided to just suck it up and wait. It was well worth it. The weather that day was clear and sunny, which made sitting outside the perfect experience.. . Since I was there during breakfast time, I had the baked granola with vanilla yogurt. Talk about a perfect breakfast. The granola had a mixture of other nuts, seeds, and what appeared to be small dried berries. I could eat like that for breakfast every day of the week. The serving portion was actually a little on the large size, which lead to me to over eat. I'd heard about their famous cupcakes and wanted to try one, but I was too full once I finished eating that I decided to pass.. . The wait staff was pleasant, but not overly friendly. I'll chock that up to the fact they were so busy dealing with as many customers as they were. I enjoyed the vibrant atmosphere and hope to dine here again next time I'm in town.
