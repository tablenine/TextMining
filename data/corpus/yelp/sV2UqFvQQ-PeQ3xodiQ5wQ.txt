I went here with a couple of girlfriends and liked it. Â The wait was about twenty minutes on a Saturday evening, even though the restaurant was a full house.I had the piscorita, which is central american margarita, pisco, and fresh lime. Then I had the Brazilian Margarita...For dinner, I had the pollo ciudad, which is grilled chicken with cilantro sauce, tomatoes, and rice. yummy in my tummy!!!. . The food was great!! But I've had real Peruvian food before and this restaurant serves nothing like it...eh but the food was good...
