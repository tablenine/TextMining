I have heard so much about this place and have always wanted to go! Tried it last night with a group of people and can't wait to go back! The food is amazing and its "small plates" tapas style so you get to pretty much taste everything! There were a few vegans in our group and there were plenty of dishes to keep them satisfied as well. . . The quality was great and everything tasted fresh! Highly recommend the fried chicken, the crunchy lentils and the bacon wrapped dates! The tables are kinda close together but the atmosphere is really comfy and cozy! Prices were amazing! Great date spot! Can't wait to go back!
