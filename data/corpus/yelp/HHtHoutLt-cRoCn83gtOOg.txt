Food is prety good - not great.. . We sat outside - I didn't like the layout of the outside seating.. It made you forget that you were eating at a nice establishment.. . The service was mediocre too.. . We had the Kobe Beef and Polenta Dish. Both were pretty good but then again, I was tipsy from the wine so it's hard to really say. Plus, I'm writing this review 1/2 a year after the fact.
