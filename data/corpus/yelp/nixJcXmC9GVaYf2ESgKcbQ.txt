Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
DTF is my favorite restaurant in the world.  . . Why do I like it so much? Because the owner/proprietor's devotion to quality makes even simple things like stir fry vegetable and fried rice taste like nothing you've ever had.. . Dining at DTF is a life experience not to be missed.   Its soul food that goes beyond satisfying your taste buds and/or filling up your stomach.  A bite of their juicy dumplings brings me to tears every time.. . But I can also understand why alot of people don't "get it".  After all, people have certain expectations based on their own life experience as to what Chinese food is supposed to be, such as Egg Fu Young, Chop Sui, etc.  I guess that also why PF Chang, Mr. Chau, and Panda Express are enjoying brisk business
