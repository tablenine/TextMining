The ambiance at this place is great. I felt like I was at jazz cafe. I ordered the Florentine Benedict, which was okay. My friend and I both loved the Kamil's breakfast special which was mac and cheese scrambled with eggs and bacon. I wish I would have ordered something more adventurous. I was in one of those situations where the person I was eating with had way better food! I had food envy from across the table. My friend ordered the plum Olong tea that was delicious, whereas I had a vanilla latte that was just too sweet. So it's really the luck of the draw if you are coming here for the first time. I found this place on the yelp application on an Iphone, so definitely take the time to look at the pictures of the dishes before you come here for the first time. It was a satisfactory breakfast, but I'm probably not gonna rush to eat here again next time I come back to LA
