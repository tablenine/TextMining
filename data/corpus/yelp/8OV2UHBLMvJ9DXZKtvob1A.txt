yum yum yum.. . so i came here to celebrate my day and another friend's day.  we came on a friday night and it was quite packed.  i hear it's hit or miss on how long the line is....so just take a gander and try it out.. . so my friends are totally great and they got me a nice yummy belgian chimay reserve to start out the night.  being the big foodie i am...i had two sausages and fries.  yes...i know, who really orders two sausages, but i just had to.  i got the santa fe jack cheese &amp; jalapeno peppers (smoked turkey) w/ additional spicy peppers and i believe the hot italian.  got the fries with bleu cheese walnut and bacon dipping sauce.. . the beer selection here is also pretty darn good.  had the la chouffe, chimay and a taste of the cider.  not bad at all.  really good belgian beers on tap that's for sure.. . i didn't feel like the wait here was super long to get my food.  but then again i was w/ friends...and time flies when you're having fun.  oh and not too bad w/ parking on the streets.  didn't take long to find a parking at all and it was a friday night.  so yeah...all in all, i think it's definitely worth a taste.
