This place is fine. It's not for the atmosphere certainly its more of a take out or quick lunch kid of place. The food is decent not amazing. The felafel's leaves a lot to be desired. The tzaziki sauce is good and the hummus is the best thing on the menu by far and away. It just seems to lack unique flavors which is what I love about middleastern food in general. Maybe I was spoiled in Boston. It is not bad, worth checking out for a lunch or quick bite but I think its a little over hyped on here if you have had this food in new york etc.
