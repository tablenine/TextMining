Overpriced burger that is not worth the price and not worth the drive coming all the way out here.  I fail to see what all the hype is about the burgers at this place.  Yes, the meat is nice and soft and yes so is the bun...but 6oz for $10+ and its not even a Kobe or Toro patty.  Sure it may be worth trying out once, but this is not someplace I would visit frequently even if I lived nearby.
