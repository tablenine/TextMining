Living a stone's throw from here for two years, I only ate here twice...which is sad because I wanted to love it.  When I moved up to the square, I had just learned to like sushi, and was excited to try a place that seemed to have such a great selection of maki and even have some half-off on the weekends.  . . Unfortunately, both visits just didn't compel me to return.. . The decor is lovely.  It's very clean-looking and modern, and the restroom is particularly cool.  But that's not enough to get me to spend my hard-earned dollars.  No sir.. . The sushi is fresh and inventive (hello, Latin Heat and Orange Crush) and presented beautifully.  I had the opportunity to sit at the bar and watch them make all the rolls and see how they put them all together.  For how lovely they look, it was really fun to watch them put it all together.. . The major downfalls?  Price and service.  The service always seemed to be lackluster, which really takes away from the delightful food.  Slow service, unfriendly host stand, not particularly attentive with the refills.  Not good enough.. . Furthermore, it is pricey.  Drinks particularly...an iced tea for nearly $5?  That's just insane.  I don't need it fancy, brew it cheap, give me lots of lemon and that does it.  Bleh.  . . For the prices and the crappy service, I will seek my fish needs elsewhere.  And guess what?  Since I don't live near here anymore, I don't have to worry about wanting to like a not-so-great place.  . . Onward march toward a better served and better priced sushi...
