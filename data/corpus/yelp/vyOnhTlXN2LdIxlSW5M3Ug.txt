I am a fan of the Randolph restaurant scene and I love Red Light.  You have to get the Hong Kong Jerry Beef entree - don't fret if you do not see it on the menu since it is a special item.  A bit pricey perhaps, but where else can you pay $35 for a great entree and have enough leftovers for 1-2 more meals?   I have gone to many places where the portions aren't enough to get me full and it costs the same.  Go to Red Light and you will return again and again!
