I've been to H&amp;F several times before, but only recently got to try the elusive 10pm cheeseburger. Damn. That was delicious. . . Went with a group of friends and hunkered down for a couple of hours with a revolving door of small plates and drinks until 10pm came around. Since the place is small, we were lucky to get a table as soon as we did (arrived at 8 on a Friday and were seated at a table by 8:30). . . Stuffed as I was by 10pm, I couldn't NOT eat the cheeseburger...and wow, H&amp;F gives Flip a run for its money. Also, I have to give kudos to the servers and bar staff - they're so knowledgeable about the food and its preparation/origin. They're also uber laid back, despite the restaurant being a mad house...they could easily be pretentious foodie snobs if they wanted to be (some of the patrons have these tendencies...you can't help but overhear ridic comments at the communal table from people who have watched one too many episodes of Top Chef and proclaim themselves foodies), but it's apparent that the staff just loves sharing good food with their customers.. . I can't help but love the Crunchy Gentleman, even though I could make it at home. Something about their homemade mustard makes me drool...
