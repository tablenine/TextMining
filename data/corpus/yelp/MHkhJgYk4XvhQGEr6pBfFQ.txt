I have been here a handful of times, and every time I swear I'm not going back. Friday night was no different.. . Between the lack of service, mediocre food, and crappy ambiance, I am gonna make my promise of not ever going back stick.. . The shumai we had were luke warm and seemed pre-made. When we asked for mustard, that in any other restaurant would come with it, we were handed a tube that was covered with junk. Like they couldn't of given a dab of it on a plate? C'mon!!!. . The sushi and sashimi we ordered came out way too quickly, crowding our little space on the counter. Anyone hear of timing out food??? The taste of the rolls was okay... Nothing special by any means. The sashimi was the same, though the hamachi I ordered was not as well cut as I prefer. . . On the tv was the same movie I had seen every single time I went before, Spirited Away. Get a new DVD people!!! I can't for the life of me understand why people like this place... Silly gaijin!
