I'll be completely honest when saying this. I was expecting Vietnamese food. Most of what I saw on the menu, was stuff that I've seen at a Thai restaurant. If only the entire menu was filled with unpronouncable food names. The service sucked also. The waiter was this really disgruntled asian guy who threw things. Yeah.... Not a fan. Sorry. Food was so/so. I've had better at a Thai restaurant, and an actual Vietnamese restaurant. Where? In Astoria. Go to Astoria.
