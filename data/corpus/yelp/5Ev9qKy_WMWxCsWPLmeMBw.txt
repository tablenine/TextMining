Restaurant: Mexicali Cocina Cantina
Category: Mexican
You have to try the shrimp quesadilla, yummy.  This place offers lots of different options.  The only way I can describe Mexicali food is that it's not your regular concoction of Mexican food.  The flavor is different but you may like it.  I think I taste garlic in most of their dishes.  . . The drinks are good and this place stays open till 2am.  They give a last call at 1:50am.  They also serve full menu food till 1am I believe.  It's certainly worth a shot and listen, I love Mexican food and it's not as bad as some of the reviewers say.  You'll just have to try for yourself.. . This place also gets so loud with music and people talking, you can't have a conversation without speaking up.  It's a good people watching bar for you to see all the "out of work" so called actors, wannabe's and porn stars.....
