Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Porto's is incredible. I'm lucky enough to live up the street and walk up there and get coffee and breakfast if i'm up before eleven. Their pastries are really delicious and cheap. I recommend the cheese rolls.  For lunch, you could just fill up on the appetizers alone: fried potato balls, ham croquettes,  pork tamales, meat pies, etc.  All cheap as well.  If you want a sandwich, try the cuban midnight sandwich, roasted pork with ham croquettes.. . I've been frequenting for awhile and I must say the quality has fallen off a little so thats why I deduct one star, but otherwise go go go. And get in the line on the right hand side, it always goes faster than the "express" line.
