Just went to Verde for a late lunch, and it's still really good.  I think of all the taquerias out there Verde has the freshest and best quality ingredients.  It's a little more pricey, but it's worth it because they haven't sacrificed quality for a cheaper price.  But, we're talking 4 tacos, chips and salsa, and 2 drinks was $20 for 2 people is still pretty affordable.  . . They've tweaked the menu since I was there last added more options, streamlined a few things, and cut down the number of quesadillas.  Plus for the people who are anti-gluten they're menu has loads of options which is rare.. . The patio and outside space is great with both in the front and back porch so it's great when the weather gets nice.
