I visited MILK after hearing family talk on and on about their home made ice cream.  Between the hubs and I, we ordered a cookies n cream bar, red velvet popper, banana and cookies n cream ice cream, and mint milkies all for $10.  The cookies n cream was okay, I've had better.  On the other hand the banana ice cream was THE BEST I've ever had, I'm always on a quest to find the great banana ice cream.  I don't even like mint ice cream but bon-bonesque mint milkies were yummy.  The red velvet popper was delicious, soooo much better than the boxed stuff the cousins keep feeding us.  Next time I'm here, I'll try the blue velvet cake which I'm totally curious about.
