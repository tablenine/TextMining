Stopped into HM's the other night after my brother mentioned how good the burgers were... I thought that it was ok, but not the best burger ever.  The brother must have just been really hungry.  The servings were pretty huge and they had a ton of fries on the side - but I didn't like them much because I didn't like the seasoning - ya, I'm hard to please.  Anyway, I guess it's worth a stop in if you're craving a hamburger and you're in Andersonville.  Otherwise, go someplace else.. . ...I did like that my bill came in a high-heeled shoe though.
