I gave UGO another shot today since it was a nice day out and we felt like having some pasta while enjoying a little sunshine. The service is still really awful and it wasn't even crowded. I just don't get it. Good bread though and the pizza is tasty. Pasta was overcooked and pasta sauces are not authentic. Still a pass.
