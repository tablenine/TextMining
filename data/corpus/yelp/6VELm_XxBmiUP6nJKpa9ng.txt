Chopped full of gays &amp; grays, The Colonnade has GOT to be fabulous, right?! Heck yeah it is! It's the best bang for your buck when it comes to southern food! Both the fried chicken &amp; fried shrimp are slap yo mama good, but all of their veggie side dishes often deter me from even venturing into the meat sector of the menu. I adore their collards, pole beans, tomato aspic, black eyed peas, sweet potato fries, etc etc etc. When you go, you MUST ask for the waiter Eric. He is phenomenal &amp; will make your experience. I have had the luxury of trying their Kangaroo appetizer special (which should be noted that it was featured on the food network), &amp; I must admit, it was delicious! Very much like beef, if you're a red meat eater. For those in the know, ask for the "marion salad," which is a great treat &amp; not featured on the menu. You can't beat the value of The Colonnade... it's an Atlanta institution that you must experience at least once!
