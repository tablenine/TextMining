If this is what healthy food tastes like, I'm about to have a Biggest Loser-esque transformation. Cause, wow. . . I mean, it's just fruit. In a cup. Maybe with some sort of juice or cream or spice on top. But that's it. You'd think you could make it at home. But trust me, no matter how hard you try, you can't. If you were to try, it'd involve at least 5 fruit trees/bushes in your backyard, managing to coincide their fruiting cycles so each one has fresh produce on a given day, and then you'd have cut, juice, and season them up. Trust me, you're a lot better off trekking down Auburn Avenue to LottaFrutta. It's a scenic drive past MLK's birthplace, anyhow. . . So yes, the fruit is delicious. Beyond delicious. And served up in so many different ways, I look forward to trying more. I also had a veggie sandwich and despite me not being a huge cucumber fan I seriously hearted it. Big chunks of avocado and lots of sprouts on some of the most delicious bread I've ever experienced. . . The owner is as charming as her shop and I just felt lighter and happier here. Maybe it was the lack of grease and fattiness in my lunch, maybe it was my gorgeous dining companions; either way I can't wait to experience it all again. Soon.
