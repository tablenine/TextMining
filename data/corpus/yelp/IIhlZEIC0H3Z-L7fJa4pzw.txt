Restaurant: Five Guys Famous Burgers and Fries
Category: Burgers
You can't compare Five Guys to In N' Out.  They're just totally different. But Five Guys is a Really great place to get a burger in a Atlanta. They have a great number of toppings, lots of veggies, like bell peppers, and mushrooms.  If you dine there you can eat peanuts(if you don't have an allergy). Our family likes the Cajun Fries. They give plenty of them too. I find that a Little Cheese Burger is enough for me. They are way better than going to other fast food places but not quite as good as some of the bar fair around town,
