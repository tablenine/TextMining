Dear friends, I was in Roma and Firenze in Feb this year and I can honestly say, the pizza here is pretty comparable, I don't care about authentic, I don't think going somewhere for a week for vacation will give me the right to say "authentic", let me just say this again, Antico's pizza is AWESOME!!!!  I am lactose intolerant, yes, that means eating pizza hut pizza, pappa johns pizza makes my stomach go crazy.  but whatever the heck they put in this pizza warms my stomach.  Dang, I love the fresh ingredients here and whatever oven they bake the pizza in is fantastic, can I get one up in my crib?!?!?! . . I donno why every pizza joint doesn't serve pizza with fresh chopped garlic and pickled peppers. BAM! 5 stars, yes ANTICO, you get ALL 5 freaking stars from Miss Mei, see you this friday Antico!
