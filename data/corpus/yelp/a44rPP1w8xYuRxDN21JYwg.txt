Restaurant: Eclipse Di Luna - Park Place
Category: Tapas Bars
Went here on a Thursday night.  Parking was a pain.  I, along with many others, ended up having to park along a residential side street at the back of Park Place.  Inside the restaurant, we had reservations so we were seated immediately.  Place was absolutely packed, especially the bar area.  Lots of people standing around due to lack of seating at the bar.  Big yuppy crowd and lots of attractive people.  We sat next to the stage and dance floor, so it was very loud, but I didn't mind too much.  Towards the end of the night, lots of people started getting on the dance floor to dance.  Our table ordered the Hummus, Peixinhos da Horta (fried green beans), Calamares Fritos (fried calamari), and Hamburguesa (mini Buffalo burgers).  Both the food and service were pretty good, especially the fried green beans.  Lively and fun atmosphere.
