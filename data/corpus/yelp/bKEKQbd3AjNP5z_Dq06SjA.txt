Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
ok yah, this place is cheap but i'm so not a fan of tito's tacos. i always feel like i just ate 5 pounds of grease. there is always a line but it goes quick. but i guess if you are looking for cheap eats while drunk, this would be a place to go. but you will pay for it when you sober up.
