Restaurant: Porto's Party Store &amp; Cake Gallery
Category: Bakeries
My husband and I have been going to Porto's since the early 90's.  We were invited to a Cuban friend's party, and they served it as appetizers--potato balls, meat pies and the guava &amp; cheese pastries.  All three are still our top favorites to this day.  The cakes are good, but not amazing.  I've had much better.  They are beautiful and good, but not why we go there.  . Since they opened a Burbank location last year, we have been going there instead, since it's a little closer.  We love dropping by on Saturday or Sunday mornings to have some cappuccino with a breakfast sandwich.  My favorite is the egg and avocado croissant.  But most of them are just as delicious.  They serve it with some plantain banana chips...perfect!  . And we cannot leave there without picking up a box of our top three fave pastries I mentioned above, and occasionally we throw in some of the cheese rolls, or cheese logs, whatever they call it.  They are totally worth the calories!
