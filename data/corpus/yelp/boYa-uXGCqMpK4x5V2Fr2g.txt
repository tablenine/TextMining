The feta sandwich never disappoints however, nothing does... the food is always great and I've had a lot of different items on the menu. Everything ranging from the steak salad w/avocado to the veggie sandwiches.. Soo good!! Their drink selections are great too, all the coffees (chai latte) and smoothies (try the mango) are all wonderful not to mention the pastries!! There is something sure to please everyone.
