Restaurant: Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse
Category: Latin American
In general side by side with any average restaurant this is probably 4 stars, but side by side South American restaurants that I have been to it is more like 2 stars.  Food was good as was service.  The atmosphere was pretty cool and unique.  But I'd rather go to Tango Sur or Carnivale.  For that reason I won't be back unless a group of my friends are already going.  Good food but nothing special.
