They claim they have the best sausage in LA... and yet the name sounds like they're saying "worst cooch". I have to admit, as a gay man, I was conflicted. Could have gone either way on this one.. . I liked the vibe right away. It actually did remind me of my time in Germany, the gastropubs in Berlin and Hamburg. Same type of energy, same type of vibe. Kudos, Wurstküche... you're off to a good start.. . LOTS of choices, I didn't realize that sausages could be that versatile. (Pause for laughter that never comes): Bratwurst, Bockwurst, Hot Italian, Vegetarian Italian, Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage, Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle,Mango Jalapeño, Chicken Apple &amp; Spices, Austin Blues, Sun Dried Tomato &amp; Mozzarella, Green Chillies &amp; Cilantro,. Filipino Marharlika, Kielbasa, Louisiana Hot Link.... . Then there's the exotics selection. I didn't have the nerve tonight, but sometime... Buffalo, Beef &amp; Pork with Chipotle Peppers, Duck &amp; Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers, Rabbit, Veal &amp; Pork Seasoned with White Wine, Alligator &amp; Pork (you heard me), Smoked Andouille Sausage, and Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers (yikes).. . The place is a TOTAL sausagefest, and this is from someone who goes out in West Hollywood every weekend. Lots of beers too, all very Germanic. And great fries with many dipping sauces.. . Das ist der gutte scheisse!. . I can already tell this place will make me fat.
