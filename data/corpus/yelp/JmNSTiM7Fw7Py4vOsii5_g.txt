Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
4 1/2 stars!. . My boyfriend and i took me here on our first date to the most romantic restaurant ever! First thought stopping in front of the entrance was basically.. "wheres the restaurant??" the door of this place is so hidden (well im assuming thats why its called the little door) but still! at least have some more noticeable signs.... . anyways, both service and food were great and all the dishes were magnificent. i ordered Duck confit for the main course while my bf ordered lamb. Both were super yummy and we cleaned our plates of course. Â Dessert we just got the ice cream and when they brought their big chalk board of dessert menu i thought that was so cool. . . loved this place. i'd go back in a heartbeat.. if i saved up enough haha :)
