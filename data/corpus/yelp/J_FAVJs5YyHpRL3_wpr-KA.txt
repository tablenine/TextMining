Frisbees, berets, fake plastic vomit, LPs, tortillas &amp; large hubcaps are all SMALLER than the pancakes they serve  here.  Seriously phat griddle cakes, man.  No room for silver dollars here.. . Sure.  All the flavors and toppings sound delicious.. Yes, the descriptions on the menu read well.. But you start to feel ill after only the third sickeningly sweet bite.. . I say stick to the Chili (it's from chili, my soul!!), or eggs, or whatever.... Just order some pancakes for the whole table and enjoy your meal while you take delicate nibbles of the flapjacks.  . That way you can get your taste of sugary sweetness without the bloat and Rolaids chaser.. If you must order something sweet for breakfast, pass on the pancakes and go for the french toast.  They are super slobbery drool worthy!. . Plus any leftovers you have you can just throw on the floor and I will be there to slurp those puppies up right off the ground.  (smallish) Dogs allowed &amp; hollywood A$$holes are welcomed at the outdoor tables.
