Restaurant: Eleven City Diner
Category: Diners
Well, we all know I am partial to diner food...hence the generous helping of stars, with a side of sausage, eggs and diner-style charm. . . My bit of advice for ECD: Whenever there is a large event (ie; Komen Walk, AIDS Walk, any type of walk), be prepared for LARGE groups, masses even, of people. There are very few brunch places in the South Loop. You and Yolk gots the market cornered, PLAN ACCORDINGLY!. . So, can you tell I waited a LONG time to eat at Eleven City Diner? I did. And I could be a bit more sympathetic had the place been jammed, but the reality is...they were just understaffed. I'd have been happy to have been seated with my party (Yelp Komen Cure Team, you guys rule!), drinking coffee and waiting...as opposed to sitting on concrete. We walked in after 1 hour (quoted 20 minutes) to a bevy of empty tables. My blood pressure spiked, just a bit.... . However, our server (and the food) saved the day. Ellen M commented that our server had "good mojo" and I'd be inclined to agree. Quick with the coffee (THANK GOD), water, Diet Pepsi, food, ordering, etc. Everything was prompt, and the ladies were all happy, myself included. . . I had the tofu scramble with a side of sausage. Just because I order tofu doesn't make me a vegetarian! ;) It was pretty good, but the "spicy tomato dipping sauce" was basically cold marinara. No spice. Not very good, I'd have rather slathered ketchup on it, honestly. That's what I usually do anyway. . . Love the decor, love the idea, love the diner. With a few tweaks to the wait situation for better flow and happier customers, this place gets 5-stars in my book. . . Now, will the South Loop PLEASE get some more brunch places!? GEEZ, jump on the bandwagon already, people want it!
