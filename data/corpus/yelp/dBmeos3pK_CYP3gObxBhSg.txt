Oh man, everyone love Griddle Cafe. The pancakes are great, the eggs benedict on potato skins are AWESOME (and huge!), and the mimosas have just enough orange juice to provide color. ;). . Yes it's got a long wait, but if it's just two people I've found the wait is substantially less (like, only 15mins... if that).  If you take a group of more then 4, be prepared to wait at least an hour.
