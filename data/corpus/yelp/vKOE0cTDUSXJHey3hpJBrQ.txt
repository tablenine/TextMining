Restaurant: Mary Mac&#39;s Tea Room
Category: Southern
A must visit when in Atlanta. Mary Mac is the place to go if you want some good ole' home cooking. The restaurant itself is huge with several rooms winding here and there it's easy to get lost, or at least not be able to find the bathroom. What is interesting about this place is that you need to write down what you would like to eat and all the sides, desserts, special wants that you need (although this would have been fine if the waitress would have taken the time to explain this to us). . . Their cinnamon rolls are phenomenal. Just take a bite and you really can't stop. The country fried steak cooked to perfection as well as the mashed potatoes and collard greens. My bread pudding was eaten in two seconds. BUT there are things that you should avoid when coming to Mary Mac's...the cornbread and biscuits - two thumbs down. Both were flavorless and tasted like they were days old. The peach cobbler was so bad that after taking a bite we pushed it as far as it would go. Isn't Georgia suppose to be famous for peaches?. . Our waitress...well, what waitress I say? She was never around so we pretty much had to fend for ourselves. . . All things aside though if I am ever back in Atlanta again this would certainly be one of the places I'd like to revisit.
