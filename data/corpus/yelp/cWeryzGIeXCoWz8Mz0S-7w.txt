We went here on a whim.  There were no tables available and ended up on a waiting list for the bar (about 20mins).  The service was great and the food really lived up to my expectations.   If you sit at the bar, trust your bartender for recommending everything.  :D. . My only regret is that there is not one in Orange County.
