today after school...me and girlfriend went.... the place is unique...we didn't expect LA to have such a Asian place . like this one.........it made us feel like we are home....^^(we are from Asia).......... VIEW-****. We were sitting at the smoking area, which was beside the garden. . FOOD-*. . http://1.it.  really wasn't that great.i guess i could buy better sushi/sashimi at other smaller restaurant. I wish the sashimi had been a little bit colder..... 2.the after dinner coffee wasn't too sweet...which is good. . *they DIDN'T check my ID when i ordered the plum wine.. . i guess its ok to try it once.....but i really wouldn't go back for the food tho.....
