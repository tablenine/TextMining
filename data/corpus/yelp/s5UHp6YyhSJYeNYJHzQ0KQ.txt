If you know me, I love Korean BBQ and I'm always down to check out a new korean restaurant! but like clock work, the beautful bbq smell over powers my overcoat and hair... and i always find myself going out to a club afterwards, i wonder why do all the big girl always hollar at me... ^_^ j/k..... Back to my review... Â I had to check out this spot a few times before i posted a review... So.......... this is why I provided this joint with only three stars:. . Here is the run down.... . -=Service=-. My complaint is more with the service. Their servers were rude every time and rushed even for Korean standards. I notice that the Korean customers where receiving better service, am I being singled out cause I'm not Korean? I recommend San Soo Gap San over this spot as they are more personable.. . -=Food=-. I can deal with the bad service just as long as the food was awesome... but in their case, their food was simply alright. don't get me wrong or anything, it food wasn't bad, simply nothing amazing.. . For Korean food, I recommend San Soo Gap San.
