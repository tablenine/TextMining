Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
At this location if you are not 20 something or Chinese or Filipino go ahead and get an order to go which takes about 30 minutes or less compared to the 1-2 hour wait on the weekends. My mom was begging to just eat at home rather than eat there and glad we did. Not the kind of crowd you want to socialize with like the Asian buffet lines in Vegas.  Probably a very unpleasant experience for anyone older than 30 here. Bathroom is backed up with people and service is very disorganized here. Try the crab cooker in long beach or crab pot in Newport for a pleasant experince with the same or better seafood. Not worth the 2 hour wait for a dinky table for sure.  Take a look at the pictures on this page. If this is your type of crowd then count on 100 more people plus waiting out in the parking lot to get in for 2 hours on a Sat.
