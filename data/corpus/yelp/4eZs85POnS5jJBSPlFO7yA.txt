I spent the summer in LA with my brother and sister in law and this was my absolute favorite place to eat. . . The breakfast is amazing.  I didn't have anything I didn't like.  Their ice blended chai was perfect and I crave for it nightly.  We don't have such great restaurants with such awesome menu options in the Detroit area.  . . We ate inside and it was comfortable.  We also ate outside once with my 1 and a half year old son and it was pleasant.  It seemed a little crowded inside on a weekend morning so I don't know that my son would have done well inside.  . . I'd go to this place everyday if I could.
