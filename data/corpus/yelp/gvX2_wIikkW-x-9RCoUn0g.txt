Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Went to the one on Pico a long time ago. First time at this one - been wanting to try it for a while. Ordered the thigh, waffle, cornbread and mac&amp;cheese. The chicken was good - not great. I really like fried chicken - it is better than most you will have at other restaurants. I don't remember the cinnamon batter in the waffle - but it was good. Only thing I did not like was that it was soggy - I like crispy waffles. The piece of cornbread was huge - but it was just ok. I like warm, moist cornbread - this was a little dry. The mac&amp;cheese was very southern - had shredded cheese and pepper in it - I like creamy mac&amp;cheese.. . Overall was ok. Place was really clean and parking was good. Service was good too. The meal stayed with me for the rest of the day - like a bomb in my stomach.. . Prices seemed a little high to me - you do get a lot of food.
