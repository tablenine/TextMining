Came here for v-day. great prefixed menu, for what it was and a decent bargain at about 70/pp for a 3 course meal. food underwhelmed a bit but the drinks made up for it! had the mango mojito and i've never had better. the dance floor is sooo small though! i'm a very animated salsa dancer. i twist and spin and twirl (it's the latin girl in me i can't help it). i need a lot of room. coming down from a one legged spin i impaled a girl with my stiletto and i'm sure it was painful. the salsa selection was very good though but i still prefer my music live and for that i'll go to rumba.
