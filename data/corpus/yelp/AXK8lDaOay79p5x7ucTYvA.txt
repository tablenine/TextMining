I've been wanting to go to this place for awhile. I've heard about their garlic themed dishes for a long time being from the Bay Area ( there's one in San Francisco too).  I was pretty excited when coming here because I LOVE garlic!!!  You have the option of ordering this sauteed garlic sauce with your bread, I'd recommend getting it...muhuhAHHAHAHA!!  Decor was nice, very different from the San Francisco one which looked a lot more homey. This one definitely looked like a restaurant located in Beverly Hills.   . Anyways, I ended up ordering the prime rib which of course had some sort of garlic sauce on top of it, and it turned out very tender and delicious.  The portions are decently big so I had no room for dessert unfortunately.  I'd definitely recommend this place if you like garlic, and I'll be coming back to try this place again for sure.  Just make sure you're not plannin on any first kisses on this night haha.
