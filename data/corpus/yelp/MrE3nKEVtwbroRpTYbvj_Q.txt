Restaurant: Friendship Chinese Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Friendship proves that casual Chinese food doesn't have to be greasy, heavy, and bland.  Their food is a few dollars more per dish than your average take out, but the flavors are always light, flavorful, and fresh.  Their dining room also proves that "cheap" dining doesn't have to mean crappy ambiance-- they have a downright good-looking dining room that shows a real attention to detail-- a rariety for most establishments of this type.  I fully and totally recommend!. . By the way, I'd still consider this to be a part of Logan Square... but if Avondale wants to share the credit, they can feel free.
