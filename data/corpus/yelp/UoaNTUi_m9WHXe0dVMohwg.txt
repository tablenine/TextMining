First I have to say the food was good, in fact the taste and quality was probably about a 4.  The problem I had with the place was the value.  I had the skillet fried chicken (or something like that) and it was good but the portions were small for the price (around $13).  Usually I would not be picky about price but considering the economic times I would say it may have been worth around $8.50 since I have had similar dishes for around $8.  The sides were good and a little unique, risotto withe ham and greens salad with a vinegary lite dressing that combined well with the risotto.  I saw some other dishes that looked and smelled good but didn't get a chance to try them.  The service was good but slow, especially considering it was a weekday lunch with only 2 other tables and 3 servers.  At least they were really nice and I do have to admit I didn't try to get them to go any faster so maybe the service could have been faster.  SO would I go back?  if I didn't mind spending a few extra bucks and wasn't too hungry I might but right now I need to save some cash for some other good places to eat.
