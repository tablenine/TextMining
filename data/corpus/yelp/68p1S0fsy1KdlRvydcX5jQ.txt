Best two words on the menu: chicken wings. :). . The best part of the chicken wings is that you can pick your poison - mild, spicy, extra spicy! We got one order of mild and two extra spicy - both were really good! We also got a variety of other dishes, including (but not limited to) the shishito peppers, miso cod, agedashi tofu and rice balls! . . I am just glad I don't live within walking distance of the restaurants on Sawtelle, because I'd end up being 4 kajillion pounds. Street parking kind of stinks, but that's pretyt much everyplace on Sawtelle....puh-leeze.. . GOCHISOSAMA DESHITA!! :)
