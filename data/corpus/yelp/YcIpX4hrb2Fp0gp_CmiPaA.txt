This is by far the best sushi I have found in ATL. After being appalled by Ru San's and uninspired by the trendy, "mayonnaise roll" places that can be found around town, I was ecstatic to find this place tucked into a strip mall across from Lenox Square. It reminds me of the holy grail of sushi restaurants in the US - Tomoe in NYC. Really. If what you want from your sushi dinner is delicious fresh fish, authentic Japanese specials like yummy baby octopus and a thoughtful chef who will recommend great items, then check this place out.
