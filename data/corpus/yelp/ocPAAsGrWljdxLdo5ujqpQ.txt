Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
There is nothing you can complain about Shin Sen Gumi: taste, service, variety, and price. I like its Hakata ramen which you can add extra noodle for a buck or two. Its business hour is good enough to fulfill your late night craving for a hot bowl of ramen. The area is very lame and boring but SSG Ramen is a very vibrant and lively business that makes you realize that there is actually young and lively population resides in the area.
