Category: Japanese
HAKATA RAMEN HAVEN.... One of the places I end up at whether I mean to or not.. The energy of the workers is great, they are super...These kid's will be "Johny on the spot" with real good service too. The ramen is very consistent and always good to the last drop. Although when it comes to the pork, it's a wee bit on the dry and thin side for me.. I am a fan for sure...
