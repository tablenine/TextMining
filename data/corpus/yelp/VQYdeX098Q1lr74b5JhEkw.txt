Restaurant: Abattoir
Category: American (New)
I was excited to dine at Abattoir. Bacchanalia won me over and I was hoping Abattoir would do the same. Shall we begin? . . The atmosphere... amazing! It was pure, crisp and the noise level was perfect. Our server, Darnell was awesome! He may have been the highlight of my night. . . Now, it's food time! Here was my dinner: . . 1) Complimentary baguette with butter- YUM! I ate so much bread. . . 2) Rabbit rillettes- Really good! Not salty, not bland. My second favorite of the night. . . 3) Chilled local cucumber gazpacho- Tasty, but I wish it weren't served in a mini mason jar. . . 4) Sliced local hot house tomato- The tomato was okay, but it's definitely not in full season. . . 5) Confit of mushrooms- My favorite of the night! Seriously! A vegetarian item was my favorite of the night. (sad face) . . 6) Wild arugula, beets, house made ricotta- This was pretty good, but either less beets or more arugula next time. . . 7) Soft pretzel with grain mustard- Crunchy and somewhat soft inside... I can't wait for the next carnival. . . 8) Kumamoto oysters- small and forgettable. . . 9) Pommes frites- Soggy, but not in a good way. Is it that hard? I could have screwed this one up myself. . . 10) House prepared selection charcuterie- Fantastic meat selection! Mmm... salami! The pork rillettes sucked compared to the rabbit. . . 11) Potted chicken liver &amp; foie gras with armagnac- Most horrible item of the night! It left a weird tingle on my tongue. . . 12) Grayson cheese- Hahaha! Two out of three girl friends hated it. I thought it was okay. But I wouldn't order it again. . . 13) Rogue river blue cheese- It was okay. I really didn't touch it again after the first taste. . . I had another type off cheese, but I can't remember which one. (It was that memorable). . . 14) Ricotta cheese tart with bing cherries- Sara Lee does it better.. . Overall experience... fun! Sharing food with friends, good service and decent food. Would I initiate a dinner meeting here? Probably not. But I wouldn't refuse an invitation.
