Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
My best friend's boyfriend was in town for the week, so we all decided to splurge and treat ourselves to a nice dinner - needless to say, Mozza was the place to do it. We'd originally planned on going to Pizzeria Mozza but there was a mix-up with the reservation, so we got "stuck" with the osteria instead. Ohnoz right? Anyway, gorgeous interior. Very loud and noisy, even at 10:00pm (the only time they were able to get us in, on a WEDNESDAY night. Huh). We decided to pass on the wine and each ordered two courses. I had the grilled octopus at the recommendation of the very solicitious waitress, as well as a leek/mozzarella/bacon concoction from the cheese bar. Both delicious. Both waaaaay overpriced - but worth it. Dessert was also wonderful but totally unnecessary at that point, as we were all pretty full. I had the chocolate truffle torte, which was so dense and rich that it felt like I was eating a chocolate BAR. My friend had the miniature doughnuts with sorbet, and her boyfriend had the gelato. . . Amazing dining experience, although the prices were about $10-$15 higher than desired for every dish. And although the service was impeccable, the waiting time between each dish was excruciatingly long. It took them about 15 minutes to take our order, and then about 20-25 min in between each course to serve the food. Also, bread was proffered but without any of the perfunctory condiments. No butter, EVOO? Strange. . . Overall, it was a great meal and definitely worth a trip, just for the experience. Good place to rub plebian elbows with some celebrities as well. We saw Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Kimmel making out by the valet - that was definitely a highlight of the evening.
