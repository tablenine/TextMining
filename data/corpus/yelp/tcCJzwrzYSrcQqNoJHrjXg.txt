It took me two years to finally eat here.  The strange hours and the drive from Westwood have kept me away until last week.  It seems like I'd only think of going here on Saturday night.  They are closed on Sunday, so I would think, "next week".  But then I wouldn't think about it until the next Saturday night again.  . . Finally we got here.  There's a parking lot, which is nice.  We were seated right away at 2pm on a Saturday.  . . For some reason, I was under the impression that these are HUGE sandwiches.  So my bf and I decided to split one sandwich, since we are trying to eat healthier (ahem).  He wanted to get straight up pastrami, nothing else.  I convinced him to get the #19 with the coleslaw and the Russian dressing.. The sandwich was NOT huge.  It was normal sandwich size.  Half a sandwich is enough for me, but my boyfriend is 100 lbs heavier than me and a foot taller.  We went back and forth on whether he should order another sandwich in addition to his existing half sandwich.  I advised him that just because he ordered a whole other sandwich, he did not have to eat the whole thing.  With that, he decided to get it.  A sandwich and a half later, my bf was not feeling so well.  Too much nitrates/nitrites, I guess.. My advice....get your own sandwich.. . How was the pastrami, you ask?  Frickin' delicious.  Thick slices that are not chewy they way I've always had pastrami.  I never knew pastrami could be like this.  I've heard the corned beef sandwich is also good, we'll have to try it next time!. . I'm docking Langers one star because their hours are so crappy.  But everything else was great.
