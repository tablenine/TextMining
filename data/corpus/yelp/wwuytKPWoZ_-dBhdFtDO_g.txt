I'd give this place 5 stars for their beer selection alone.. . Then i tried the sausages. Excellent.. . Then there were the fries drizzled with truffle oil.... OMG. The truffle oil is an extra $1.50, but do get it, you will not be disappointed.. . And it's vegetarian friendly.. My girlfriend is vegetarian and she loves this place. . The vegetarian sausages do taste pretty scrumptious even for a hardcore carnivore.
