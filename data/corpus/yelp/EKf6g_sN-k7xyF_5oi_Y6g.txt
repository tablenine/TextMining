Went to see my buddies the Kingfish play acoustically....very casual, very friendly helpful staff. My buddy Steve swears by the fried egg sandwiches,while Crusher loves the bloody mary's. My crew had a skillet cookie and bbq chicken pizza,which onlymade me crave bbq chicken pizza for days after....still a great spot!
