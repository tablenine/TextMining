Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
what?! westlake?...this is echo parque! what! what!. . ...anyways, even though langer's deli is not in the best area of los angeles, i still frequent this eatery. it's much closer and MUCH better than canter's.. . im not much of a meat eater. in fact, im more of a salad girl, but when it comes to langer's deli, vegetables and fruits take a back seat to a hot pastrami sandwich. the place is always packed when i stop by and it's nice to see familiar faces each time. the butchers are quick with the orders and boy are they generous. like half of the population of los angeles, i ordered the famous #19. that sandwich was so thick it lasted me for 2 days! whether its served hot or cold, it was just as good. my mouth just salivates with each bite and just even thinking about eating it. HUGE, Delicious, kosher pickles for $1 or $1.25. order it...it makes your meal complete!. . parking is difficult, especially during the early afternoons. the streets are busy and the cat hollering is plenty. just walk fast, keep your head down, and think about that #19 waiting for you!. . it's a good thing i dont live in l.a. anymore and i dont visit l.a. as much. this is only true because by now, i'd have 5 chins and 2 heart surgeries.
