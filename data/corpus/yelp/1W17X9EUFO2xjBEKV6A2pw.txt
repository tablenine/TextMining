Restaurant: Taka Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
This was some of the best sushi I have ever had!! I had yelped in search of a sushi restaurant in the buckhead area of Atlanta prior to my trip, this place was very well reviewed. Taka definitely exceeded my expectations!! Everything was so light and fresh.... Melt in your mouth sushi! I the atmosphere was cozy and intimate. I can't remember what we ordered. It's been a couple of months since I was there. We just picked random items off the menu, but everything was amazing!!!! Taka rocks :o)
