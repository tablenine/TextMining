LA Mill.... yes, YES it is indeed one of the best coffee in LA. . . We were driving on our way to another spot but spotted this and decided to give it a try. ZOMG!. . After finally sitting in the snake skin chair after an ungawdly wait of 2 minutes I finally had the chance to take it all in. The simple red, black, and blue color scheme along with the faux tree mural on the wall all behind the glass wall giving the illusion that the place is much bigger than it is. Throw in the decor one would expect of a color coordinated coffee appliances and LA chic clientelle and staff and you got a winner. I want to live here forever.... FOR-EVER!!!. . Get this.. they serve coffee here. Really good coffee. So good that they give you choices as to how to prepare them... several forms of drip, the 'moonshine' kit, the 'purist' kit, and then some. I dont remember the real names of the techniques but trust me, if you wanted to check it out before purchasing the art deco coffee pieces.. here's your chance. What goes well with coffee you wonder? Well, breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert! They serve these killer donut hole things! *drool* I can testify that it is only great when served with the exotic sounding vanilla accented whipped cream concoction. You think that's it? Guess again.. one last piece to round out the offerings here... . .. .. .. .. Not to be outdone by the coffee selection.... THEY SERVE ALCOHOL!!! A limited yet fine selection in itself at that. . ;D
