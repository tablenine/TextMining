One of my favorite SGV place to eat!! This place is always pack!! Okay, maybe they are tiny in terms of store front but there's always an option for take-out!! It taste just as good as dining there!!!. . I'd like many other reviews on here love this place too!! There hanian chicken is delicious!! You can ask for all white meat or half &amp; half. I like the half &amp; half and my friends like it all chicken breast! Chicken is soft and sauce is tasty!! The rice could use more chicken broth to cook, but I'm alright with either. I guess the hainan chicken flavor makes up the blend taste on the rice.. . Oh, did I mention they got real good curry chicken too?!! It's the Singaporean style curry chicken!! Ah.. just thinking about it makes my mouth watering. . . I think I need to grab some soon to calm my craving. Totally recommended take-out or dine-in!!
