Being on Melrose, I thought it was going to be a little scene-ee but once ur in, totally welcoming and warm. Fa reals.....this place was hella good. From the short wait time(even though it was crowded), to the owner, the staff, the customers... the ice blended coffee (bomb!)right down to the food...hella good. Our waitress, probably one of the best I've ever had, she was on top of everything! Kamil, --if you're lucky enuff to meet.....so cool &amp; humble.  Definitely will tell all the fam and the homies about this find.  And whoever's reading this, go yo! BLU JAM, ur the best!
