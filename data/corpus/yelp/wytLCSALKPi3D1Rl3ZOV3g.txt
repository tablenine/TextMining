Restaurant: Nan Thai Fine Dining
Category: Thai
My overall impression of Nan was that it was a bit trendy, a bit expensive and the Thai food was a bit above mediocre. . . I'll say that the presentation of the dishes was like going to the art museum. I almost felt bad eating some of the dishes. The waitstaff was VERY attentive. I think I took a sip of my water, turned around, and my glass was full.. . The bathrooms were very zen-like and probably one of the cleanest I've had the honors of doing business with. . . Taking into consideration the prices and the quality of food, I'd definitely have to say that there are BETTER and CHEAPER Thai restaurants out there.
