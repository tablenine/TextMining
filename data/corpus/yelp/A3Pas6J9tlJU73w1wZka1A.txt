Went here the other night with a bunch of my friends and it was pretty damn good.  Maybe it was because I hadn't eaten all day.  Anyway, I had The Manhandler (the classic sloppy joe) while my girlfriend had the Breakfast Burrito.  While the sizes were reasonable, both tasted great.  One of my friends ordered a chocolate and banana milkshake and that was REALLY good.  I guess the milkshakes are bomb here.  I would definitely come back, plus it's open 24/7/365 to crave any post-party drunkenness.
