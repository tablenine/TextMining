Restaurant: Perennial
Category: American (New)
If based only on the cuisine, Perennial deserves 4 stars.  If based soley on service, more like 2 stars.  After dining here about 3 times, the food continually gets better and better.  Last time I dined here, the gazpacho soup was simply lovely, the pekeytoe crab salad I can't get out of my dreams (umami is the only way I can describe this), and the grilled pork belly with the roasted corn spoon bread?  Let's just say I'm a sucker for pork belly and corn, so this dish was a massive party in my mouth and perfectly executed.  My only complaint is the dry, UNEASY dining room service staff: "I would like to offer you water" ... Are you for real?!  It's almost like they're trying TOO hard and nothing seems to come 'natural'.  Also in one of my dining experiences here, my server could not stop dripping wine on the table, menus, my clothes when pouring.  In a restaurant who is owned by the same owners of Boka and Landmark, both of which provide great service, I expected much more.  My suggestion is to find a seat at the bar and dine there.  The bartenders are far less fake and plastic, more personable, and give stellar service (not to mention they have a fantastic and creative cocktail list, so suggestions are spot on).
