Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
The food is good. I always been a fan of the Hakata in Gardena and Rosemead but it's now only Gardena. I have been waiting outside in the cold with my girlfriend and another friend. A lot of the tables were empty when we arrived, yet a crowd waited for a while to be seated. Whether it was the huge party in front of us or not, the excuse the waiter told us is that they ran out of menus. Is this a club or a ramen joint?! If there is a waiting crowd outside it would be because the place was packed, which it wasn't tonight. Anyways, I'm catching a cold in Rosemead still waiting to be seated and torturing myself watch the TV monitor displaying a Hakata commercial. Punks.
