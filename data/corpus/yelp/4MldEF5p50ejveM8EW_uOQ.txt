First and foremost, I feel like i should note that I have never been here 100% sober, but its fantastic location within walking distance of most of my favorite bars in Buckhead make it a real late night treat. I've never ordered anything but a gyro but Al has always been fastastic and brings me out samples of many other items. . . I think their gyros are some of the best in Atlanta (trust me, i've eaten a lot of gyros after a late night drinking session - i'd like to consider myself somewhat of an expert) and their baklava is also quite delicious.
