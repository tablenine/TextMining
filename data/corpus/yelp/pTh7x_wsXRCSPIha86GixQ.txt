Restaurant: Kyma
Category: Greek
I wasn't sure how I'd feel about Greek food, but having tried just about all of the Buckhead Life restaurants I couldn't leave this one out of the loop. I actually convinced my parents to go and when it comes to trying new types of cuisine outside of seafood, salad, American and steak, they aren't usually gung ho. Â The saving grace was the fact that Kyma has quite a number of seafood options. We were all very pleased with what we ordered and happy to clean our plates. I'd like to check this place out for one of its cooking event or wine tastings in the future.
