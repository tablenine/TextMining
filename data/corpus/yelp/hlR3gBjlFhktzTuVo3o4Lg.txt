Beautiful place, huge, sparkling, clean and white. ahhhhhh. We went on Sat afternoon while they were serving brunch.  I would have prefered to be able to order anything off the menu by we were restricted to breakfast and pizzas and salads.  So we had Eggs Benedict, Potato Pancakes and a Bianco pizza.. Potato Pancakes were the best, I could eat a couple orders of those, but the Benedict and the Bianco were very good too. . One little annoyance is the Bianco pizza has lots of yummy cheeses and arugula but no prosciutto so we asked if we could add it and they said no problem.  We joked around that it would be like a $8 surcharge (granted we should have asked) and when the bill came it was a $5 surcharge.  Really? wow, my pretty expensive pizza became a super expensive pizza.  Oh well.. it was good, (they just might want to offer one with proscuitto, hint hint...). Just the ambiance of the place makes you happy, food . everywhere you look, waiters everywhere you look, open kitchen, open pizza kitchen.  . Im looking forward to going back and Im super jealous its not in my neighborhood so I can just stop there everyday to stare at all the great stuff in the take out section!
