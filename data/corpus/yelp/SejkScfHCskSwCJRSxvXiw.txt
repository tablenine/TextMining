Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
TITO FOR PRESIDENT!! I swear if everyone had a Tito's Taco...this world would be a better place!! It was one of my meals every week when I lived in Westwood!! (Warning....there is a line a block long even if there is a flash flood warning!!) Tacos are amazing!! I will crave these tacos til the day I die!! Â My recommendation is to have a side of guacamole and beans and cheese to dip your yummy tacos in!!
