Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
The skinny.... . If you're in the mood for a great pastrami sandwich, go to Johnnie's.. . On the pricey side, cash only (they have an ATM on premise), but so very much worth it!. . Be sure to ask for some au jus on the side! Â That stuff is like nectar of the Gods.
