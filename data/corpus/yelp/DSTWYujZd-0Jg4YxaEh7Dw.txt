Went here on a random recommendation a few months ago and I've been back several times since.  . . It's super busy all the time, but they validate the parking garage that is SW of the store, so that helps.  But if you don't like crowds, don't go - it's really really busy.. . I get the potato ball sandwich every time.  Also have tried the pulled pork sandwhich with the mojo sauce.  Both. Are. Awesome.  Whoever thought of putting fried mashed potatos on the best cuban bread every is a genius.  It's fried carbs on carbs!  And the bread really is great.  A little crunch on the outside, super soft and really fresh.  The plaintain chips are also a treat.  Ask for extra mojo sauce, because for a garlic lover, there just isn't enough to get through those chips.  . . The desserts are good too.  Some of the best tres leches I've ever had.  For a small treat, try the dulce de leche kiss.  A shortbread cookie filled with caramel - yummy!
