The food was satisfactory. The environment was nice and quirky, albeit a bit too crowded with a crowd I don't feel comfortable in. Our waitress seemed nice enough even though her actual service towards us was minimal at best. We left a minimal tip.. . Our waitress comes chasing after us (my 3 friends and I) down the block to inform us that we didn't tip her enough. No asking why we gave her the tip that we did, she just goes into a a fairly long explanation that presented her as thinking she absolutely was entitled to as good a tip as possible.. . It's a terrible shame she exhibited such appalling behavior because I was sincerely planning on telling my husband and visiting again, but that is no longer going to happen.
