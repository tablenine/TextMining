What's the fuss???  it's OK, not great, but OK.  I like Puck's soup better in the can from the market, personally.  Desserts are exceptional but everything else was simply OK.  He did come out and shake our hand...I guess that was intended to dazzle, but it didn't.  This is the place people "think" they "should" like.  Big yawn. Next.
