Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
We also saw this place on Man vs. Food. I love LA's hole in the wall places, like El Matador, Chano's, and the taco trucks in Eagle Rock, so we decided to check out the 'Yac. . . First, Many, the owner, meets you at the door. The staff is friendly. The place is small, so the long lines outside are misleading--there is seating for only about 35 people. There was plenty of seating at the counter, but it stinks because you watch the staff washing cups. It is loud inside. The restaurant has a "B" rating, which can be a deal breaker for some. . . The portions are huge and the food is priced accordingly, around $8.50 per burrito. I had a Hollenbeck burrito (chile verde [in RED sauce, mind you], rice, beans, guacamole, and more chile verde on top) and my brother had the Okie machaca (shredded beef) burrito. I ate the whole burrito for lunch and have not been hungry for 10 hours.. . The food was just ok, nothing special. The pork chunks in my burrito were inconsistent--some were succulent, others were tough &amp; dry, as if they had been sitting around. The taste was normal, just like any other burrito. Remember, you pay for the big portions--other places have smaller portions but you pay $2-$3 less.. . I would probably not come back. It's one of those restaurants where you go back just because you forgot the food is nothing special. Give it a try, but don't expect a life-altering experience.
