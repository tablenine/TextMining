Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
Sorry Stinking Rose but I may have set my expectations a little to high with you. My girlfriend raved about your food and ambiance but alas.... I am sad to say, food wise, I was not to impressed. Here is my rundown of all things Stinking:. . Pros: . -Service is on par for the type of restaurant. -Price is reflective of food and service. -Ambiance is pretty cool with all the different themed rooms. . Cons:. -Maybe I set my standards to high but my dish seemed bland and uneventful . -Being Valentine's Day 2009, the dining room was so tightly packed, I am very surprised how any of the wait staff was able to squeeze between the tables to properly take orders (it was 930PM at night to!). -Girlfriend said the last few times were better in terms of food. . . Maybe next time Stinking Rose we can meet up again and you can turn my frown upside down. :)
