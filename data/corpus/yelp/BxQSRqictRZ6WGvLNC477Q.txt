so happy i called two weeks in advance for a lunch reservation (seems excessive, but was sooo worth it).. . we had the prosciutto and mozzarella to start and finished it in about 2 minutes.  we had the white pizza and finnochiona pizzas which were both great (though i was having food envy when the table next to us got the squash blossom pizza).  that was prob the best white pizza i have ever had.  . . what was really suprising was how nice and attentive the wait staff was.  i generally don't associate pizza places(even high end ones) with great service, but our waiter was fantastic.
