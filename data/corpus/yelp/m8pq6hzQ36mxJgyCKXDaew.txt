Some of he best Italian food that I've had in Atlanta.  And coming from New York, where the Italian food is perfect, that is saying something.  I've beem here with the family a couple of times and each time was very good.  The portions aren't too big and packed with flavor.  They had a special menu when we were there but it's a seasonal thing.  This is a classic Italian meal with four courses--an appetizer, a pasta dish, a main and a dessert.  Sadly, the dessert was never had but everything else was great.  A mussels pasta was really good while my mom had the spaghettini for a main, but if you want something really spicy, you should tell them to spice it up or else it may be kinda bland.  The chicken that my dad had was great while the mozzarella and tomato salad was a unique spin on an old favorite as it was mozzarella cooked in butter and you have a tomato paste to combine it with on italian bread.  Sooooo good.  However, the scallops and spaghettini pomodoro were both great regular dishes to order.  The fish is also great, no matter what you order.  The squash and grilled swordfish is a really good option.  If you want desssert, the gelato is always a good option.  If they're out, then just head over to he gelato shop across the street.  The decor is really nice, but there is an outside in the back that can be really loud.  It;s also facing a parking lot, but the inside is really romantic.  The sourdough rolls are really good as well.  Only drawback was that the spinach and ricotta ravioli wasn't that great.  The sauce just didn't do it for me.  However, great little Italian place with a new-age menu.  Enjoy.
