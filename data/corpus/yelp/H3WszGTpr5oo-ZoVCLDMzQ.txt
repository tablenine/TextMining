The milkshake was very good--a vanilla malted.  But the food was a miss.  The Cobb salad had way too much dressing.  The bacon was crispy and fresh, but the chicken, cheese (cheddar, not blue) and avocado were in equal portions to the romaine.  A bit too hearty for something called a salad.  The pressed panini with prosciutto and provolone had a measly single piece of prosciutto and a mix of grilled and marinated vegetables that were too sweet.  . . The service is good and fast, which matches nicely with the casual atmosphere.  But bad food served with a smile is still bad food.
