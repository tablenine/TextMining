I gotta thank the Hollywood Christmas Parade for closing down the streets, rerouting all the buses and making us (literally) walk from Hollywood&amp;Highland to Sunset&amp;Fairfax.. . We were on a mission to visit another restaurant when we hopped on to our Yelp App and found that this place was closer - 'I'm starving, sounds good to me!'. . I ordered the Chicago Charlie's Scramble - 1) it was HUGE, 2) it was fresh, and 3) it was fantastic!. . As Deana I. mentioned: we became INSTANT fans!
