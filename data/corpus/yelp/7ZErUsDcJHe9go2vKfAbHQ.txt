Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Been wanting to come here for the longest and I finally did when I was in Hollywood. It started off pretty bad when looking for parking was an issue. I assume that the restaurant has been there for a while because they do not have their own parking lot. Having bad experiences with parking meters, I looked for the closest parking lot to the area which was still maybe about two blocks away and it also cost $10. However once I stepped inside the restaurant the mood changed right away. The atmosphere seem just right with the kind of environment that has the comfortable feeling to it. Everything on the menu sounded like good southern comfort food, but of course I had the go with what the place is known for, no other than the famous chicken and waffles. I didn't think that I was going to get full, but boy I was wrong! I had to waffles with two pieces of chicken. Not being a big fan of fried chicken, it was actually pretty good especially with syrup; yeah I know that it doesn't sound right, but it's actually good this way. Other than the parking, I was satisfied with everything. I probably won't go back to this location, but I will definitely stop at the one in Pasadena since it's the one closest to home.
