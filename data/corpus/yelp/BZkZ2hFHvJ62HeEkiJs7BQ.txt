My husband took me here for my birthday. Since he knows I love intimate/romantic spots, he thought this place would do the trick. I walked in and was in love. This place is super romantic and definitly makes you feel like you are in a different place (other than the cold Chitown). I thought it would only get better, but I was WRONG. The waitor took our order. The appetizer came out before the wine?! Our waitor finally came back with the wine which was a freezing cold bottle of wine, and totally mismarked from what the menu said it was. All he could do is say, "Sorry we havent updated our menu?!?" Then the food.... so the grilled calamari was absolutely disgusting. I had a cold, so I thought maybe I cant taste anything because of the cold. When I saw my husband salting the food I knew that it was flavorless. He hates salt and never salts anything. Lets just say that then brought us the wrong entree dish, and then what they did bring us, was again lacking in flavor! I was so dissapointed as I really want to like this little gem spot. The only reason I gave it 1 star, is that I want to go back to try it again to see if it was a really off night and its so romantic. Arg! Soooooo dissapointed.
