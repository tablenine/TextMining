I haven't been here in a while because it is quite the drive for me, but I still think about their beet salad all the time.  The burger is good and all, but I'm a lover of beets and this place hits the spot with their salad.  If you like red beets, you will probably love the FO beet salad as much as I do.  Plus it is a good large size, so perfect for picking at over drinks.
