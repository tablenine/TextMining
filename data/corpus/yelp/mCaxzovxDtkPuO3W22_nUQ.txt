Have heard of Kamehachi and saw a groupon for it so had to try this place out.. . Service was good and the decor was decent. I guess there is an upstairs section, but didn't get to see it. The food itself was okay. The specials weren't really creative and the quality seemed just okay.. . Overall, not a bad place at all. Would definitely be open to trying again with hopes of being more impressed.
