five stars for the atmosphere. i love the white walls and the decor with the pastry display cases. it almost reminds me of dean and deluca in new york if dean and deluca was a restaurant and not a market. very classy. and again five stars for the service. our waiter was lovely and helped a group of talkative girls out and was patient with us when we were too busy talking and not looking at the menu. and the manager (he was a really good looking, tall gentleman) was very charming and polite. . . now for the food. i dont know how i felt about it...none of us weren't really hungry so we shared two salads and a few of the small plates. everything was just okay.... the two salads we got were the mache (chicken, avocado, celery, balsamic vinegrette dressing) and the modena (candied walnuts, butter lettuce, crumbled goat cheese). the mache was a little too salty for a salad. the modena was really good with it's candied walnuts and dressing.. then for the small plates we got burrata with grape tomatoes, the portobello fries, and the calamari. my favorite was the burrata! the bread was cooked and toasted to a perfect texture and the prosciutto was the perfect touch. the calamar was just okay (like any other calamari) and the portobello fries were not really what i expected. i liked the texture of the crispy outer shell, but i didnt really like the mushroom inside. i did like the dip that they serve it in.. . we also got a few desserts, but i was a bad yelper and can't remember what they were.... . so i'm a little conflicted because the service was so good, but the food was just mediocre (maybe i had high expectations, or maybe i ordered the wrong things?)
