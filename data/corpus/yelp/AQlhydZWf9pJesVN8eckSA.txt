I have waited many years to eat here, and when I finally tried it I was a little disappointed. It has a quaint, European feel, but I didn't fall in love with the crepes like I thought I would. I found the savory crepe a little bland and too saucy. I found the flan on the creme caramel sweet crepe to be less than stellar. Maybe I need to go back to France and re-experience an authentic crepe, but I get the feeling these are anything but. The pluses-they take reservations. Also, when you go to a place like this, you almost have to order dessert!
