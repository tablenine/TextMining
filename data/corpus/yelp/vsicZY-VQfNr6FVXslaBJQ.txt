I went on Oct 6,2009 for DineLA and to celebrate my 3 year anniversary. . . One word: Perfection :) . . The food was delightfully simple and Delicious. I'm so over the tiny froufrou plates with 4 different kinds of sauces on funky shaped plates. . . Our server(mid 30s, spiky light brown hair, glasses) was kind, patient, and attentive. He even brought our dessert with a candle in it. . . The hostess was very professional and happy/smiley. She also held the door open for us when we were leaving. Most hostesses would just stand behind their podium and yell "good bye". . . Gez, even our busser was smiling. . . They must feed these people happy pills because you definitely feel the love not only in the amazing food, but from the staff as well.
