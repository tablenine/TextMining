I love the food here. You have to try to Veggie Burger! Also, I love how they alter their menu all the time, so you get a nice change of pace if you are a regular. Their beer prices are little off the charts. The Late Night menu here is the best in the city. Great place, but they should change their beer prices as they are getting a bit out of control.
