You know a place is gonna be good if there is a line each time you go! I love the ramen here and wish it were closer to my house so that I could go more often...I love to add the minced garlic and that pickled pink vegetable thing they have too...mmm, my stomach is so growling at me right now, protesting the powerful memories of my last visit to Daikokuya (which was too long ago!!) I so so so soooo wish it was closer to me...well I guess it's okay that it's all the way downtown or I would always be puffy and bloated from the massive intake of delicious pork noodles.
