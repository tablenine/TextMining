you know that place in little tokyo with that long ass line? not that place, the other place!. . there are two ramen places right next to each other, and i never know which one is the one everyone raves about. i went to this one because it looked busier/popular and i had some time to kill. . i'd suggest you sign up and walk over to fugetsu (sp?) it's a japanese sweet shop a couple of doors down. they have some delicious treats you can pick up and kill some time looking around. be prepared to wait, especially if you have a party of more than 2. (i did only wait 20 mintues when i went, which i was surprised about) if fact, if you have more than 4 people, you are not going to be sitting at the same table. this place is teeny tiny.. for being a "ramen place", they don't have many options. actually, just one, but it was soo yummy. the noodles were perfect and soup was silky and flavorful. most ramen places i've been to only give you half of an egg, but they give you the whole thing and it's cooked just right. also good amount of veggies and meat. we also got the gyoza. it was delcious too. nice and crispy, none of that soggy stuff. i think next time i come back, i'll try the other food.
