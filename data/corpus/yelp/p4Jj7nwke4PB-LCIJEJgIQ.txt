This is the best Chinese place ever.  Okay, it's my wife and I's favorite.  We both suffer from really bad cravings for this place and it doesn't take too much to convince us to go.  We get the same thing everytime for the most part because what we get is just too good to branch out.. . Dinner for 2.  The sizzling rice soup is my absolute favorite part of the meal.  We both just can't get over how good it is.  Then you get spring rolls and a piece of nicely marinated meat (not sure what it's called) and those set you up perfectly for you meal.  My wife always gets the Mongolian Beef and I get the Sesame Chicken usually.  There is a huge portion that makes for a great lunch the next day too.  . . We both like most Chinese places and have tried a good bit of them, but we'd go here over any of them.
