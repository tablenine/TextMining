Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
I really wanted to like this place.  It has been a starlette since it arrived on the scene with so many local foodies wanting a piece of her.  . . However, I found Hungry Cat to be overpriced and underwhelming.  Everything from the seating, to the our waitress to our food - nothing made an impression.  I take that back, their cucumber martini and luke's lemonade were quite good.  The waitress kept emphasizing how everything in both drinks was made fresh that day.  Is that the best line she could come up with?. . Speaking of our waitress, she was a bumbling idiot.. . On to the food.... . Our peel 'n eat shrimp appetizer was the best part of the meal.  Juicy big shrimp with a tangy cocktail sauce.  My Alabama gulf shrimp in a Singapore "chili" style was good, but again I was expecting to have a orgasm upon first bite from all the reviews I had read.  The flavor was there, but the dish itself had a mushy texture...and I'm not talking about a good mushy-chili texture.  I can't remember what my husband had, but I do recall the look of "that's it?" halfway through the meal.. . I could have gone without experimenting at the Hungry Cat.
