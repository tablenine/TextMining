I frequent taco trucks and taco stands in Lincoln Heights at least two times a week, so I had high expectations.  If half stars were available, Kogi would have gotten 2.5, but the couple bites of the burrito made me decide this place was worth 3 stars.. . I ordered one pork and one short rib taco.  On my first bite, I couldn't taste anything but sesame and tortilla, with crunch from the lettuce.  The lettuce concoction didn't even taste like a kim chee remix.  So I subtract one tortilla from each taco and I'm still only tasting sesame lettuce and down four bucks.. . Disappointed that each flavor component didn't separately pop in my mouth, I tried the short rib burrito.  This generated a mild party for my tastebuds, mostly because I love cheese (real Mexicans don't put cheese in their burritos so I never order them).  And three hours later, I can't remember anything else about this meal.. . I am not yet understanding the hype of this place, and would rather have carne asada or al pastor tacos with cilantro, onions, chile, lime, and guacamole in Lincoln....
