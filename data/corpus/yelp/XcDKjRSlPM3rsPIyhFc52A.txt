Restaurant: No Mas Cantina

Good: Great location and the restaurant is a visually cool and appealing, but that is were the good ends. . . Now for the bad.  The food was ok at best, but the service was awful and very slow.  It took longer to get the bill and pay then it did to get the food.  And the food took forever to show up.  I have eaten there a few times, and each time I am no more impressed.
