Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I was not in love with my sandwich. Part of it is my fault because I didn't want to order something I typically would. The pretzel roll was nice and my sides (baked beans and mashed) were different that what would normally come with a sandwich. We also got the pretzels, which were tasty, but nothing out of this world.. . Our server was attentive when we were ordering, but left us alone for so long that she asked us if we had gotten our food AFTER two of us had already finished and our plates were cleared.... . I'm interested in going back to Jerry's to try out different sandwiches, as I am sure there is one I will love.
