Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
I heard about the famous Father's Office burgers pre-21 years of age. Thus, after turning 21, I had to go and try it.. . I tried their Father Office burgers. They were really good. In a way, I think it's nice they try to preserve their burgers by not allowing substitutions or removing any ingredients. But I do believe that it makes it hard for people who absolutely and cannot have cheese or don't like arugula. I thought it was good though.. . My favorite thing is their sweet potato fries. I'm a major fan of sweet potato fries and they add a bit of garlic to theirs, cook it amazingly... so crispy but the inside is not and it's warm, soft and delicious. Their garlic aioli sauce is also, quite delicious.. . The beer selection is good. They have a kind of everyone for whatever your taste buds prefer. If you're not sure what to get, just ask the bartenders for recommendations and they'll give you a good selection.. . Many nights it's gets pretty crowded an hour or two after typical after work hours, probably around 6 or 7. You will be lucky to get a table, but I suppose you can if you're lucky or you just decide to stalk a table and wait for the people to leave.
