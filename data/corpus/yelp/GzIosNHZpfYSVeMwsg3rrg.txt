Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I'm a meat and potatoes kind of gal and Lawry's always satisfies my craving! My boyfriend and I have been coming here for years to celebrate special occasions - birthdays, anniversaries, and we also leave stuffed, happy, and with doggie bags. . . Their special spinning salad is delicious and their dressing is also available for sale by bottle (just ask your waitress). The prime rib comes by each table on a carving cart and you can decide on the cut and how well you want your meat cooked. I usually order the "California Cut" which is their smallest cut but still very generous in portion. My boyfriend gets the "Diamond Jim Brady" which is huge and comes with a bone - perfect for gnoshing on the next day :). The meat is nice and tender and served with the au jus. Â We typically go with medium rare which is perfectly pink in the center and not too rare. For sides we get the standard mashed potatoes and their creamed spinach which is excellent. Every once in awhile we will splurge and get the lobster tail combo. Each meal comes with their Yorkshire Pudding which goes nicely with the prime rib and au jus. They have a great wine selection and the waitresses are always very helpful with suggestions for food pairing. . . Overall, Lawry's is one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles. Service is excellent, quality of the food is great, and pricing is very reasonable for what you get. Make sure to make reservations ahead of time. You can also walk in and wait, but it may be awhile until you get a table. Though if you have to wait, they do have a bar and in the waiting room - savory meatballs and potato chips.
