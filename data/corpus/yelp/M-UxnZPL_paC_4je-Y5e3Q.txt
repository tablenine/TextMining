I have been going to Canoe for years, always for special occasions, ranging from my junior prom to my last bday (24). Needless to say, I'm a fan. . . I love the impeccable, 5-Star service and food without the pretentious atmosphere that you get at a lot of other spots. Canoe is warm and inviting, like it's lodge-y decor. . . The food is amazing - I'm a big fan of game meats and there's not a whole lot of places where I can choose from ostrich, venison, duck and rabbit on the menu (all of which are good, by the way). Â . . Desserts are delicious as well, so save room.. . Go when the weather is nice and ask to be seated in the lower dining area overlooking the river. So pretty.
