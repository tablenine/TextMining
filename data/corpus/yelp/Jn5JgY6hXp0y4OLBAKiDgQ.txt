Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
So I finally made it to this place. Woo! Pizzeria Mozza is the type of place that is on many a yelper's hit list.. . I took my sister here for her birthday and I had the squash blossom pizza, she had the stracchino, and our friend had the Funghi misti. Mine was actually the most traditional-tasting. It had a glob of burrata, a very creamy cheese that almost tasted like ricotta. My friend's mushroom pizza was very rich-tasting. IT tasted as though the mushrooms were marinated, yet the mushrooms were very firm and tender. My sister's Stracchino pizza was sour from the lemon and the artichokes. It was very refreshing and all 3 were incredibly tasty. The crust was just rightly crispy. I wish I could have one every day.. . They have a great wine list. We ordered a bottle of the Notari; a delicious red wine from Montepulciano. . . I made my reservations for 5:00pm on a Friday and there was no wait. The valet is a rip, but it goes along with the experience.
