This was the best steak I'd ever had.  Amazing.  Other good things:  the popovers brought in lieu of bread (in their own little pans); the caesar salad which is prepared table-side is suprisingly good; the service is perfect.  Also, my boyfriend is a huge steak fiend, so he requested a tour of the salt tiled cellar -- which we received!  Very cool.  Yes -- it is very very pricey (a full dinner with wine was bout $200 for two people) -- but I think it was actually worth it.
