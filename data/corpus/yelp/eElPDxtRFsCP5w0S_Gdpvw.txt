Went on the first warm night of the season and the place was packed. It took 80 minutes for us to receive two orders of onion rings. Took 70 minutes to get a pitcher of beer. Took 2 hours for our food to come. When I complained to the owner, she was neither surprised nor apologetic. She blamed me for ordering onion rings because "those take a long time" and then yelled at our poor waitress, who had been an angel and was running all night long. She didn't comp anything, which at that point was the least she could have done. I will never go back.
