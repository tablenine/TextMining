3.5 stars, to be exact.. . Our fault for not making reservations. Wait on a Saturday night was quoted at 2 hours. Had a few glasses of wine at the bar while we waited. Their CHEESY BREAD PUFFS are the best free bread I've ever had. Come to think of it, it's the best bread that I've ever had, period. I had to make my boyfriend keep them from me. But then that didn't work cuz I would say, "LOOK OVER THERE!" He'd look and I'd snag some more puffs.... . Finally we checked with the hostess and she said our table was ready. We were starving! Service was quick. Nonstop meat servers came. They have a cute system: a placard on the table, one side green, one side red. Turn green on top to indicate you want to be served, and the meat men will keep on coming. Turn red if you're a pansy and need to slow down on the food pile-up.. . Most of the meat had great flavor, others were overcooked or dry. But the servers were very attentive and would send on over medium rare if you ask.. . We ordered another round of drinks, of which my bf was convinced they gave us the wrong wine (cabernet instead of the shiraz) so their customer service specialist (they really have one!) came and apologized and comped it off our bill.. . Speaking of the bill, we were in for a big surprise. Had no idea it was that expensive!. . I've been to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before, and the meat there was better. But I guess you can't compare to the original stuff.
