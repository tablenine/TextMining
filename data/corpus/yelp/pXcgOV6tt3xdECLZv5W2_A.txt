Been here twice and have had a great time, both times.  The first time I went, we all just went for drinks and people watching.  Pricey, but of excellent quality. They certainly do not stiff you on the actual liquor portion of it.  Our waitress was very attentive and was happy to suggest her favorites off the drink menu.  The lounge/drinking area is toward the front, away from the dance floor, which is nice - you can still hear the music, but don't have to shout when talking to the people you're with.. The second time, I actually went to dance with some friends.  Huge (but crowded) dance floor with great salsa music.  The diversity of the crowd was astounding - old, young, and of all different races. You could tell everyone was having a great time and really enjoying themselves.  All in all, a great place for a weekend night - it has something for everyone.
