Restaurant: Santullo&#39;s Eatery
Category: Pizza
All you people who like Piece better...GO!  I love Santullo's.  And I am glad you all hate it.  Go some place else!  The pizza is way better than any other crappy standard Chicago-pizza joint.  . . Yeah, the waitstaff isn't that friendly...well, maybe you are just expecting too much from someone handing you already prepared, heated up pizza.  . . And yes, the place is a tad dirty.  That is part of the charm.  Go, and take your smelly children/pets with you.... . Best NY-style pizza in Chi-town...if that is what you are looking for.
