Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
The only Brazilian restaurant I've eaten in before was one of those meat-a-rama places where they bring out as much meat as you can eat without dying. But I was curious about this place after seeing the menu online, and I'm so glad I tried it! . . The menu really is extensive -- I didn't even get all the way through it before deciding on steamed veggies and rice and beans. I know, it sounds boring, but the vegetables were AMAZing! They serve the good kinds of veggies -- red peppers, tender spinach steamed just enough, corn, zucchini, broccoli -- and so much wonderful flavor! The plate came with plantains, which were tasty as well. . . I love the feel of this place too. Airy and sunny. . . The best part was that our waiter really knew what was on the menu and was very helpful and patient. Not being familiar with yucca flour, which came in a spoonful on my plate, I asked him how to eat it. He didn't make me feel like a dumbass, which I really appreciated! . (Btw, stir it in to the beans! It's good stuff!)
