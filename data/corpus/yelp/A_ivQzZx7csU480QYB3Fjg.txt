The food is good.  If you beat the 9 am crowd, you usually don't have to wait.  . . It is KIDS galore, so if you are looking forward to a quiet, calm relaxing breakfast, you may want to think elsewhere.  I do always feel surrounded by babies but sometimes they're cute and well behaved so I don't mind.  On the other hand, the last time I went the manager was playing with some customers baby (I mean literally for 15-20 minutes) so it was really distracting to be honest with you.) I mean she was walking with him, swinging him around, handing him to other waitstaff (which they are probably thinking "why the f-k would I want to babysit this child while working?" But one of those situations they kind of had to act interested.)  .         And I am not the greatest morning person so it was kind of annoying for me. But with that said, could you imagine going here and the manager is taking care of your child to keep you as a customer? She's smart, really.  So those parents will probably have the greatest review in the world. And good for them being able to enjoy their food out for once. .    .       I usually get the goat cheese omelette but I finally tried the breakfast burritto I always wanted to- I think it would be excellent if you like breakfast burrittos, a little heavy for me. But the huevos rancheros is awesome. And I love their rye toast and they have great coffee.  . . If you can make it before 845-9 I think it's pretty groovy because I keep going back.
