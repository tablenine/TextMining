Restaurant: Dunlays On The Square
Category: Nightlife
It had been a while since I was at Dunlay's on the Square, but it was a beautiful day and I wanted to sit outside for brunch. I walked past Lula, because as usual the lines were too long. I noticed that the patio for Dunlay's was a little packed (hrm...so I'm not the only person in Chicago with this idea?!?!?) so I went inside and sat at the bar. . . I got the Big Mike's Irish Breakfast, which is two eggs, two sausage, two bacon, cheesy baked potatoes, a broiled tomato, and a pint of Guinness. Mmmm-mmm, just what the hangover doctor ordered! . . The bartender and someone who I think was the owner were so incredibly nice and attentive. Oh Dunlay's, why did I ever quit you??
