All I can say is OMG for Sassy Eggs!!!!  The food and service is amazing!! I went here on a Sunday morning with my Boyfriend and I fell in love. What we liked the most was that there was a wait to be seated (arrive early cause it gets really packed) but due to that they brought out some delicious Julius Meinl coffee while we waited. It was so worth it!!!
