There were ten of us; seven of us were duck-eaters (ok, no... we're just not opposed to eating duck). We ordered two duck specials (2 ducks, one HUGE bowl of duck soup, two plates of duck fried rice), a plate of fried noodles and bean sprouts, a plate of fried wontons, beef and broccoli, a tofu vegetable dish, and shrimp in lobster sauce. . . The plate of fried noodles and bean sprouts was supposed to hold us over while we wait for our ducks. Between ten people, it didn't hold very well. Our three non-duck-eaters got their beef and brocoli, tofu veggies, and shrimp in lobster sauce with rice. It was a little painful to watch them eat their food while we wait with bottles of Tsingtaos, hot tea and ice water on almost-empty stomachs. We ordered the fried wontons and still we had approximately 20 more minutes to wait. . . The duck meals were worth the wait though. Everything was delicious. Some people didn't really like the soup. Here's a suggestion: pour a small amount of the red vinegar into your bowl of soup and add some of the white pepper available at your table. It might taste better. That's what I do. . . The share that I paid included:. - 1 bottle of Tsingtao. - the two duck meals (split between 7). - the fried noodles with bean sprouts (split between 10). - the fried wontons (split between 10). . All for $16! Add in $3 for tip (approximately 20%) and I only spent $19 that night all the while going home on a very full and satisfied stomach. Yum!
