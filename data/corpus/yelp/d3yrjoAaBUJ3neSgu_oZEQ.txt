When I was a carefree college student, we used to regularly make the 45 minute drive from Westwood to Arcadia to hit up DTF and Phoenix for a good meal.  Yes, the wait is brutal especially if you're hungry.  Yes, it's a little expensive for a Chinese meal.  But yes, is it good.  Not as good as it's original location in Taiwan but as good as it gets in the US.
