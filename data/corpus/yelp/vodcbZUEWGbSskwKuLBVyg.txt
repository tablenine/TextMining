Restaurant: Sushi X
Category: Sushi Bars
I pass the black box of Sushi X every day so I finally decided to go in for lunch.. . $50 for two rolls and an Ahi tuna appetizer is a bit steep for lunch, but still...Sushi X is pretty fantastic.  The maki are superior to many places in the city, although I did frown on the lack of Sashimi..so I was forced to eat rice.. . Michael, our server/the manager?, was extremely pleasant.  Although we were the only table in the place on a Wednesday around lunch time, they were doing a great carry out/delivery business as someone was always in and out with orders.. . They are opening another place by Clark and Diversey this week and I am sure it will do well.  The maki were creative and extremely tasty, even if they were pricey.. . But who complains about overpriced food when the service is spot on?. . I shall return.... . ...and, oh, the Speed Racer t-shirts?  Hellz yes.
