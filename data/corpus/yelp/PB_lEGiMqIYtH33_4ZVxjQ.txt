Extensive beer menu, delicious affordable eats and it's my neighborhood spot! What could be better? I had the veggie burger and it was fresh, crispy and came with smooth red pepper hummus/mayo for $7.50. The potato wedges were filling and everything is locally sourced. Great spot to check out. Voted one of the best beer bars in the country!
