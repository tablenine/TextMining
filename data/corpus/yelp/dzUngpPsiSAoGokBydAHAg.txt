So I tried the LA famous Porto's pastry at a birthday party.  My friends kept telling me to try the cheese rolls.  I'm, for sure, not a huge cheese fan.  In fact, I won't consider cheese on my dessert list.  Really, I dont even enjoy dessert as much as salty foods.  . . I took my first bite out of the cheese roll and I felt like I was in heaven.  I never fell in love with any dessert before.  . . Yes, I heard the lines can get long but I'm prepared for some more yummy cheese rolls.
