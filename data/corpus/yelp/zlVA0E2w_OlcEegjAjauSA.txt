Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
We love Shin Sen Gumi...if only they take reservations and there wasn't such a long wait.  Start with Agedashi Tofu served with scallions, daikon, shaved bonito flakes in a soy/sake sauce - slightly crispy outside with a hot center.  For our ramen we usually add corn for  $0.50 and spinach for $1.00.  We can share the spicy miso for $1.25.  Refills on noodles are only $0.99 so my husband usually gets his money's worth!
