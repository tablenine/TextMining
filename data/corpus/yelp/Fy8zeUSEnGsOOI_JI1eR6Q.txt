I love this place.. . Their hot sipping chocolate is to die for, though their coffee isn't the greatest I've ever had. Their tea selection is almost overwhelming, but I can usually make a decision pretty easily because the tea menu tells you what tea is good for what, which is nice when you're concerned about your health and all that. Their sandwiches are good, too. I love the tempeh burger and the vegetarian turkey sandwich. As for the breakfast menu, I recommend the meggsicano. Who can turn down a mexican egg dish complete with olives, tomatoes, refried beans, a blast of tabasco sauce, and tortillas? It's awesome. And make sure to try their vegetarian miso soup (with the seven grain bread, of course) and to give their corn chowder a go (when they have it). . . And make sure to check out the little boutique. There are a lot of interesting items to be found.. . Go there at night, though, when the crowd is more adult. Kids screaming always ruins the ambience. This morning's breakfast was shattered by a howling kid, which I have no patience for, especially when I'm trying to read.
