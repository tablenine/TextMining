it was a long journey from westwood to eagle rock but i'm pretty happy i did it. I'm moving from LA back to the Bay in a week so i have a to try list and this is one of the i can't leave LA till i have it things. It didn't dissapoint and i'll tell you up front if it costed 10 instead of 15 there would be another star up there. . I got the oinkster pastrami with fries and a dad's root beer. (not my actual dad) and it was pretty legitttt. . so this isn't your normal pastrami sandwich, instead of pickles and mustard it had gruyere, caramelized onions, and red cabbage so instead of being sort of spicy and peppery like most pastrami sandwiches (like johnny pastrami or the hat) it was actually sweet. But like in a really good way. The pastrami itself isn't very peppery which is good because it probably wouldn't jive with the onions but overall is very moist and makes for a tasty morsel for your tummy. . The fries are "belgian" which according to the guy working there mean they've been fried twice and i've belive it, the texture is pretty differnet that regular fries with a crunchier something or other added to it. . they have a pretty decent selection of sauces including their house ketchup and and house chipotle ketchup as well as some sort of southwestern grilling sauce, a house mustard and regular mustard. the ketchups are pretty good as is the house mustard. your fries also come with their garlic aoili which unlike the other sauces you can't have as much as you want of it but a cup really is enough. The garlic is ok, but not life changing. . like i said, cut 5 bucks off that price and oinkster would be legendary... er more than it already is
