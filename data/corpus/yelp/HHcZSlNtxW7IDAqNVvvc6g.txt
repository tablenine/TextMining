We tried two entrees.  The pad see ew was...eh.  a bit too sweet.  Fresh ingredients though.  Otherwise, good solid thai noodle dish...not that creative.  The jumbo prawn curry at first glance was ordinary.  But man...it was pretty spicy.  Usually at these faux-Asian places (you know the places...too much red color, lots of silk/fabric drapery...Buddha heads everywhere you look...places for those who think they are adventurous enough to try "pan-asian" food, but too intimidated to actually go to a hole in the wall in Chinatown or on Argyle) those chili-pepper symbols next to the items on menus mean nothing.  At this place, they mean it.  The curry was rich, prawns were cooked just right.  the frew strands of veggies turned out to be vinegar pickled radish--very unique blend when combined with the curry.  Then the surprise--a hidden square of sticky rice at the bottom of the dish, permeated with the curry sauce.  it was a very nice touch.. . If the prices were reasonable, i would go to this place more often.  but $17 for a noodle dish and $27 for a curry?  come on, folks.  I can get thai food just as good at half the price.  I'll save the money to buy my own buddha head.
