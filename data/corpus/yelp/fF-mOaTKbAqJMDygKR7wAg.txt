When I was in Japan in early 2006 a friend of mine took me to a great ramen place.  While prices tend to be exorbitant in Japan, I had a bowl of some amazing ramen with marinated pork for about $8.  Needless to say, I began to immediately wonder if there was a place in LA that could compare.. . When I returned, a friend who was also in Japan at the same time told me about a place downtown.  This is that place.  While its not quite the same as sitting in a hole in the wall in, surrounded by authentic slurpers, its definitely worth a visit.. . Since I am a fan of spicy food, I tend to prefer sucking down noodles here as opposed to other places I have been.  Their three soup base choices allow some variety as does their choices regarding optional ingredients.. . The ramen here is actually more expensive than what I paid in Tokyo, rest assured you will have a good meal and be more than full due to their extra large Americanized portions.  Although I tend to drink much more flavorful beers, they do have Kirin (I am 98% sure this was the brand) on tap.  Just a nice little bonus.. . Please feel free to share any other ramen houses you know of that I should check out.  I'm still on my search to find that perfect bowl here in LA.  Until I have a few more places under my kimono I am going to have to stay conservative and give Orochon a 3 rating...
