Finally, Mexican food I was able to eat when I wasn't wasted. This was my weekly go to spot for margaritas, yummy chips and salsa and my favorite, carnitas tacos.  The back patio is wonderful in the summer. However, I always seemed to go when it was raining so I'd end up sitting in the small dining all cramped.  . Service was always very good here and I came here enough so the waitresses all knew me. Definitely one of my favorites in the hood, which is saying a lot because there is a lot of fine Mexican food in Logan Square.
