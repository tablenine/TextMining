might be the best brunch (or weekday breakfast or lunch) place in this part of town  (that's right Fred 62, Square One Dining and Home...).  the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that it is so popular that it can sometimes be hard to get a place to sit when you get there, so plan accordingly (come early or prepare for a wait).  food is consistently good.  great for a quick bite or a family gathering.  also, the pastries they offer are awesome (and this is coming from someone that doesn't have a sweet tooth).  i don't think they make them here, but wherever they get them from is the bomb because i've never been disappointed.. . there is also a retail specialty food shop housed here that is a good place to get nosh to go or some good cheeses.. . definitely worth a visit.
