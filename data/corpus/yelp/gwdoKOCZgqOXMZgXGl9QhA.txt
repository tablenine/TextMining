Restaurant: Gingergrass
Category: Vietnamese
2.5 stars.. . Gingergrass is for the Silverlake hipsters who have never had real Vietnamese food. Don't get me wrong, the food is not terrible. It's OK. Â And it's hella cheap (as it should be). However, it's just not the real deal. . . You may "feel" kinda hip eating here, because the hipster concentration here is pretty high. It's cleaner than most cheap Vietnamese restaurants, and I do appreciate that, though not the real deal, Silverlake has a Vietnamese restaurant.. . They don't take credit card.
