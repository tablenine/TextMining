DELICIOUS!. . Huge fan of the pizza pot pie.  The homemade salad dressing is quite possibly the best I've ever had.  You can buy bottles of it to take home....you have to buy a bottle for home.  The flatbread is also amazing.  All in all you can not go wrong with the food.  . . When I lived in Chicago I took many out of town guests.  . . Caveat: This place can get pretty packed and it is a bit small.  You can expect a wait.  I've heard that many people drive in from the 'burbs specifically to go here.
