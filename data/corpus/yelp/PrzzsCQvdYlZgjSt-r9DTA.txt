Friend: "have you been to that sausage place? (giggling)". Me: "the one in downtown?". Friend: "yea, yea! its called like... worst... coochie? (more stiffled giggling)". Me: *sigh* . i dont know how its pronounced but i think its like 'worst-kutch' (like aston kutcher), but im not here to grade the pronunciation. . . "Come for the sausages! BUT stay for the beer" . As a fan of german and belgium beers, i think the selection can appease any palate. From the girl who says "i dont drink beer, i think its disgusting"  (PS.. you can shut her up by ordering her 'the floris apple ale', its like an unfiltered pear cider from yardhouse, but waaay better) . or to the man who likes his beer dark and full bodied ( Erdinger Dunkelwiezen)  I have yet to try them all.  . BTW, i recomend the La Chouffe.  Golden Ale 8%... it has a nice finish to it. . . As for me, i tried Rabbit, Veal &amp; Pork Seasoned with White Wine and Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers, i was expecting a more gamey taste, but it tasted like what i expected.. like a salty and meaty sausage. . My friend had the SantaFe Jack Cheese &amp; Jalapeño Peppers,  which was not as spicy as i thought it would be, but def had a nice kick to it. . . Tip: ask for the toppings on the side, so you can actually taste the sausage. . Sauces: Chipotle Ketchup &amp; Pesto Mayo
