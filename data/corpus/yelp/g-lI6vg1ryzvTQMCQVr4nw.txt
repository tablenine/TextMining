Sweet Butter of Mary, this place rocks.  Throw a stick up in the air and it will land on a new martini.  I prefer the classics, myself, but any girl that's ever come with us has dabbled in the fruit concoctions and has always left giddy.  The food is amazing, too...best steak I've ever had on a bender.. . In fact, I've never had a bad experience here...the staff is sexy, the crowd is sexy, hell...the freaking valet is sexy by the time you leave.  So, when you're done wading through the corporate facades of The Grove.... . ...GO.  Reclaim your taste at Lola's and then lose it again the right way.  End of review.
