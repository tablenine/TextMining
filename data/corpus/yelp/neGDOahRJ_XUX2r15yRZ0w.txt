Recently I went back for a follow up visit for my birthday and to get that delicious chicken sandwich I had a few weeks prior.. this time around was not so great. I ordered the chicken sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes. The chicken was very dry this time around and not nearly as flavorful. The mashed potatoes lacked flavor and were also a bit dry. I should note the first time I visited was on a Friday, this visit was on a Wends. Not sure if they stepped up their food on Friday or what, but it was very inconsistant.
