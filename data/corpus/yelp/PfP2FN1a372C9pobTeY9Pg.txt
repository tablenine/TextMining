Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I've wanted to go to this place for a long time and finally found a reason to go. Actually from some things I've heard the ramen was better than I expected. I got the 6th spiciness level (osae-osae)out of 7 so I didn't go near their top but the base did have a nice flavor,I think it came from the pork which seemed pretty sweet. . I tried a base I haven't ever tried before here,Salt so I can't compare it to any previous experiences. The Salt was actually pretty good and not too salty until the end. I tried one of their side dishes,chicken teriyaki which was good but not the best I've had. A pretty good place all in all, the only complaint I would have would be their Chicken teriyaki for not have much of a flavor or nice grilled taste.
