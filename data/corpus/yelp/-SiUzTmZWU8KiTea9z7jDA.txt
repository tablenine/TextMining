Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
My wife and I lived in a microscopic apartment two blocks south of the Helms Bakery for six years. We were part of the new gentrification of Culver City which now includes "restaurant row" along Washington Boulevard, home to a dozen places of varying price and style. Ford's Filling Station is the highest end of the bunch and its packed bar and full RSVP book attest to its popularity. The food is overall outstanding with only a few exceptions. Their heirloom tomatoes were served too early in the season so the insides were still slightly white, and their cheese plate was served too cold (that didn't stop us from going berserk on it). After that erratic start my stepmother and I shared a whole fish topped with aromatics and clams. Mr. Ford came out both to say hello in a busy restaurant and pointed out that the best part of the fish were its wee cheeks, which we asked him to scoop out for us (while thinking of all the old ladies who would grab my face and mutter "shayna punim" when I was a boy in synagogue). My wife thoroughly enjoyed the trout and my dad had a salami meat plate. He would do this again at another restaurant (A.O.C.), and though I found it strange to serve what was essentially a late-night snack as a very expensive plate of food, I can't talk because I ate over twenty dollars of cheese that you couldn't make into a sandwich. A group of four will cost anywhere from $30 to $70 per person depending on alcohol and appetizers. (Reviewed May 2006)
