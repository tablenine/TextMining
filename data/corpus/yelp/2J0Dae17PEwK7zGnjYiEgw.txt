This restaurant is the business.  The food is amazing.  I always get a bowl of ramen and compliment it with one of their small rice bowls.  I have never tried anything that I didn't like right away.  The ramen has so much flavor and they serve it piping hot which is especially great on a cold day.  They have a bar where you can watch the cooks make the dishes, it's fun if you see them making something you don't recognize.. . The service at this place is excellent, all of the waitresses are polite and they don't ever rest.  I've never seen anyone slacking off during business hours in the 20 or so times I've eaten here.. . The only downside to this restaurant is the wait.  I've been a regular customer for the past 5 years or so and the wait times have gradually increased every year.  Plan on waiting at the very least 20 minutes if you're alone, longer if you have a group.  The restaurant is pretty small and their booths don't fit any party larger than 4 comfortably, you might be able to get 6 small people in a booth but that is going to be super crowded.. . Despite the wait time and the considerable drive it is for me, about 30 minutes one way, this is one of my favorite restaurants and it's the only place I eat ramen.
