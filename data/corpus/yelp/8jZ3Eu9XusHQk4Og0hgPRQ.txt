Don't let the craziness of the exterior fool you: this restaurant is awesome! Â There are cages along the outside of the restaurant containing tropical birds and loads of beautiful bright flowers. This is another one of those places that makes you feel like you've momentarily left Georgia. Once you pass through the tropics, have a seat on the patio or the lovely interior. The service is quick and friendly. I enjoy the Magic Quesadillas (cheese and veggies, and some tasty mystical element I can't quite discern) and Dr. Joe's Mango salad. The menu has tons of options and would please the pickiest eaters - plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and carnivorous options. Most of the food is organic, and R Thomas is great at making healthy dishes taste as wonderful as they are for you!
