Restaurant: Market
Category: American (New)
Stopped by after a Bulls game on a Thursday night. Got a table along the windows and after a bit of a wait, our server stopped by. We ordered the nachos and our waiter mistakenly heard tuna. He was kind enough to bring us both with no charge for the tuna which, incidentially, was far better than the nachos which tasted "funny." My date did not like Market, but could not be more specific. The main bar area is a little tight, but its comfortable with attractive clientele. Not quite as sporty and spacious as West End, but I would not rule out coming here again, particularly in the summer when the rooftop opens.
