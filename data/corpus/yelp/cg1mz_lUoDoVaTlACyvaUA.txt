I have been here for dinner and brunch, and both were amazing.  For dinner I have had the grains and greens with tofu, and had the best, most perfect silken tofu I have ever had- it was indescribably delicious and this is tofu.  The mac and cheese is also knee weakening. Before I was vegan for lunch I had the wild mushroom omelette, and the eggs benedict.  Both fantastic.  This is what quality food made with pride tastes like.
