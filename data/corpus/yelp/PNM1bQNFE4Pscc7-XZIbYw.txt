I've eaten here twice and frequent the area since my bf lives in bowmanville. . . Nothing memorable at all.  I would rather go to a small fast food place for real burgers.  It's pricey for the so-so quality.. . I never crave or suggest going here when we're looking for a spot to eat.  Probably won't set foot in here again considering the neighborhood has better places to eat (Huey's is across the street - yum!)
