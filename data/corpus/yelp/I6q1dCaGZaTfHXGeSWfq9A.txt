I hate the parking here. The parking lot is so small.. unless you're super lucky. otherwise, don't even bother going in. Try to look on the streets, but residents are so smart that you often see their cars parked RIGHT in the middle. URG. The place is also small and CROWDED.. but,. . If you wanna avoid the wait (and the trouble of fighting for a parking spot) , try coming here for lunch.. or dunch. I've always come here around 3-5 ish, there usually isn't a line or if there is one, the wait is probably just 10-15 minutes.. nothing ridiculous like 2 hours. . . I did come here twice around 9:40pm (forgetful me, they close at 10!!) , and they refused to let us dine in.. even though both times, we would see a big group leaving. Nope, no luck. It's weird (to me at least) how early this place closes.. considering this restaurant is in Alhambra and is right next to noodle world which doesn't close til 1 or so.. . The food is GREAT! I usually get either cajun crawfish or shrimps! BUT shrimps are definitely more filling because the biggest part of a crawfish is its head.. which is not particularly meaty. . . OH GEEs, but I dread to eat here because of the AFTER taste it leaves you with. I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT. It's been a whole day since I dined in here and I can still taste it.. GROSS. I've brushed my teeth 4 times, rinsed twice, chewed a whole pack of gum and it's STILL HERE. . . Price is alright, I think they have a either 15 or 20 dollar minimum for credit cards.. . Service is attentive. . . ALL IN ALL, try it if you haven't. I like this place but it's not somewhere I go often because of that forever lasting after taste. Puke.
