You go to a restaurant, let's call it Crapplebee's.  You sit down, enjoying the smiles and good vibes from the waitress.  You peruse the menu, considering your options...and decide on a nice grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad.  The waitress comes and asks for the scoop; you deliver the goods.  "What kind of dressing for the salad, sugar plum?", says she.  "Honey mustard", says you, because you can't imagine a salad without the sweet tanginess of honey mustard.  "Oh, we don't have honey mustard", she says.. . What the hell did you just say to me? . . You don't have honey mustard?  But I love honey mustard!  No salad is complete without it.  It's stupid, downright unethical, for a salad to be served without honey mustard in the vicinity.  A restaurant has a responsibility to offer things exactly the way you want them, to offer every possible ingredient you may want included.  If you want a sprig of cilantro as a garnish, that should be available and delivered with a smile.. . Excuse me, waitress?  I'd like for you to cut my burger into the shape of a Malaysian yak.  "Sorry honey, we don't have yak-shaped cutters here".. . What the hell did you just say to me?
