Category: Burgers
A 4 star experience and 2 star food.  Hmmm.  I waited 4.5 hours for my food, during which time Ann served exactly 27 people, in 3 groups.  I'm not sure what the business model here is, but  I guess it works for her, so who am I to complain?  . . After that lengthy wait, I think just about anything would taste good.  I devoured the clearly frozen crinkle-cut french fries as my burger was being prepared.  I watched as Ann opened a prepackaged tube-o-beef, and took a fistful for each of the 2 patties that form the ghetto burger.  I winced each time Ann flattened the burger with the back of her spatula, and I gaped in amazement at the sheer size of the ghetto burger when it ended up on my plate.. . In the end, I could only finish half the burger, and was happy to mortify my wife with the size of the other half.  I wasn't necessarily impressed with the taste of the burger, but the experience was fairly fun.
