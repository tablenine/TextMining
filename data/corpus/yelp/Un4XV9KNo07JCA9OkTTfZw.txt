Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Canters is opened 24 hours and has an enormous selection of breakfast items, sandwiches, burgers and more. The corned beef hash and eggs are as good as it gets. For breakfast, Canters beats Denny's, Norm's and IHOP. Service was also excellent.. . You can also top off your meal with a dessert from their huge bakery up front. The chocolate scone and peanut butter cookie was yummy.
