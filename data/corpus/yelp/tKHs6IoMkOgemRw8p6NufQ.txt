Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
Came here again and strayed away from my usual beef green curry to try beef red curry and it was delicious....just as good as the green curry.  Also had the shrimp in blankets....not authentically Thai, but it was cute, and pretty good.  They're basically shrimp wrapped in egg roll wrapper. . . To end the meal, we ordered sticky rice with mango slices....just like they do in Thailand.  I missed out on this during my visit to Thailand, but I'm glad that I got to experience it here in my hometown.  It consisted of sweet and warm sticky rice with coconut milk poured over it, accompanied by fresh, sweet mango slices....heaven.. . Sticky Rice is officially my favorite Thai restaurant.  I think they're always consistent and always good.
