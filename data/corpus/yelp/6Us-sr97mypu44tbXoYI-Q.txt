I really, really wanted to like this place. . . ************************************************** . SERVICE / PARKING / DECOR . The service was as bland as the food (uh-oh, I'm giving you an indication of how my review is going to go.) No mention of the specials, recommendations or how's it going or ever been here before - just a basic, are you ready to order. The parking lot is as small as our appetizers. As we sat in the car (10 minutes before 5pm, when they open), we spotted a little mouse scamper across the parking lot. Did you know they can run/jump super fast?? The decor of the restaurant itself is chic and absolutely right up my alley. Sophisticated, minimalistic, and clean. . . ************************************************** . . I ordered the VEGETARIAN BROTH and the LYCHEE MIMOSA. My boyfriend and I shared the SEASONAL GRILLED VEGETABLE ROLLS. My boyfriend ordered the BEEF PHO which I'll let him fill you in on (be on the lookout for Ken's review.) . . ************************************************** . EMPTY CALORIC APPETIZER TO START: CRISPY CHIP THING-IES . These looked interesting and I did want to try them. However, I had strong suspicions that it was a combination of rice and shrimp as they looked like the colored chips typically served with Peking duck in Chinese restaurants. The waiter confirmed that it did have shrimp so I didn't get to try them out. My boyfriend however, commented that it was low on the shrimp flavor. . . ************************************************** . APPETIZER: SEASONAL GRILLED VEGETABLE ROLLS . Excellent plating but teeny tiny portions. It came down to essentially two thin spring rolls (smaller than "normal spring rolls") and then cut in half so that you have four teeny tiny pieces. It's "rice paper rolls filled with fresh vegetables, lettuce, rice stick noodles and fresh herbs." It came with a dipping sauce which made them super yummy. I ate my designated two pieces and snagged the piece that my unimpressed boyfriend had decided not to eat. $5.95 for this tiny appetizer. - boo! . . ************************************************** . DRINKS: WATER AND A LYCHEE MIMOSA . The chilled water was served in clear glass bottle topped off with a cork and came with small water glasses. LOVE IT! It's cute, chic and actually quite smart (server does not need to refill water glasses as often as you drink as much / little as you want.). Would be nice however if the server actually poured us some of the water. . . I decided to try out the LYCHEE MIMOSA just because I LOVE lychees. :) In fact . . . I'm planning to make lychee cupcakes later . . . The drink was OK, nothing really to write home about. For $8, it was kind of a drag. If it was made into a lychee martini that had a lychee skewer with it, then it would be more impressive. . . ************************************************** . MAIN ENTREE: VEGETARIAN PHO . I picked this because I happen to love pho but haven't had it since I became a vegan as the broth is typically animal-based. It's described as having "mushrooms, bok choy, carrots, ginger and baked tofu in a vegan broth infused with traditional ph√≥ spices over rice noodles." Beautiful plating but not practical as the bowl doesn't quite sit well in the rectangular plate. I do however, like how the beansprouts and basil and limes were plated alongside with the soup. The basil was limp and the lime wedges lacked juice. So I wouldn't say those were very fresh. . . The pho was beautiful and I wish I took a picture. However, that was pretty much it. The broth was bland. What it lacked in flavor, it made up in appearance. Excellent pieces of vegetables and tofu but OH - no flavor! Very much a let down for $8.25 and left a majority of it uneaten. . . ************************************************** . That sums it up for me. Really wanted to like this place but unfortunately, this was quite a miss for me. The best part was the decor but that can only get you so far.
