The food here is extremely fresh and tasty. I definitely recommend the interesting cocktails and the phatty cakes for dessert. Service only ok (they forgot about our reservation and left us hanging out at the bar) but they made up for the mistake by comping our dessert and coffee. I'll definitely be going back to this small place with a caring, helpful staff.
