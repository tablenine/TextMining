Restaurant: Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant
Category: Chinese
It was my mom's birthday and we wanted to try something new.  Chinese seafood isn't at all a departure from our usual, but all of these glowing reviews plus a recommendation from a co-worker had me convinced that this restaurant would be worth trying out.  Plus, unlike the standard hole-in-the-wall Chinese family restaurant, this one always looked so shiny and appealing from the outside.. . Well, the interior design is certainly prettier than expected and the food is of undeniably good quality, but unfortunately it's also nothing special.. . Granted, we didn't order what everyone here recommends.  My mom refused to break the bank for the lobster, so our main seafood dish was the classic Shrimp with Walnuts.  You can never really go wrong with this dish, and it was tasty but overly fried (and quite disturbing to see as the shrimp looked like it had some pimply disease under the mayo sauce).. . Beef with pea sprouts was good, the braised tofu pieces were a little small, the spicy minced chicken with lettuce was ho-hum, and oysters with leeks were tasty but sparse and a bit salty.. . The food was solid, but I could have gotten the same thing elsewhere for a fraction of the price.. . Add to that the fact that the servers were practically hovering over us, which is completely unexpected for a Chinese restaurant but also quite annoying as it felt like they were pressuring us to order, pay, and leave.. . Overall, the experience was underwhelming.  Perhaps it was our fault for being so unadventurous with our ordering.  Make sure to get the lobster.  We won't...because we probably won't be coming back.
