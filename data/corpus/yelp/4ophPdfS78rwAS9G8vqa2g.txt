This place has its ups and downs, I'd say.  I really liked the wine list.  I was impressed with the selection of ports after dinner.  I thought the waiter was very patient with us as as we went over the wines, and let us try whatever we wanted before we decided on it.  I'd say the salad and the entree were both above average.  The food part, which the waiter didn't have control over, took a bit too long to get to the table.  Luckily we weren't pressed for time.  The dessert was decent, not omg wow.  The waiter was kind enough to throw in the glass of port for the price of half a pour, and it was a very good glass of port.  But damn, did that meal really cost what it did?  Something is missing at this place.  It could be a solid four star restaurant.  But I tell you what, I imagine this is a good place to just do wine and cheese, though I haven't tried that out.  And I imagine I'll drop in on occasion for a glass of tawny port.  The 1986 Delaforce colheita was pretty damn nice, and that's not one I would expect to see on a dessert wine menu.  For dinner, something is missing, though.  I can't say my experience was as bad as those of the one and two star raters, but I can't say it was on a par with my four star dining experiences, either.
