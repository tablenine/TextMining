Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
Super cool place with great food! Everyhting at Joan's is fresh and tempting...from the great little side dishes to the desserts.. Joan's is a total neighborhood spot but you never know who you'll see there...fun sitting at the big table inside or sitting curbside.. Enjoy!
