Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Four girls.. 3 pounds of shrimp.. 1 cajun fries.. 1 cajun fries + 6 pieces of catfish.. =Happiness. . Okay, so that may not seem like a lot of food, but trust me, it was most certainly enough. I totally recommend all of the food I just listed above, especially the catfish. Normally I'm not a big fan, but the way that Boiling Crab makes it, is AMAZING. The outside is nice and crunchy, while the meat on the inside is moist, tender, and succulent. Try to come before 5:30 on weekends and 6:15 on weekdays, cause it just gets too crowded. Oh, and park on the streets, cause the parking lot is too small.
