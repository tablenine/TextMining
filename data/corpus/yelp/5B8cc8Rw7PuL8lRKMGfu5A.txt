This is the best chicken I have ever had. I should have eaten an entire one, it was so good. I could have, but my friend and I had other things to eat as well - all equally worth trying. But, it was May of 2006 and all I can remember is the chicken... My mouth is watering now just thinking about it. I wish there was a place where I live (Phoenix) that was comparable to Pio Pio. . . If you haven't gone yet, go. And when you do, make damn sure you order the chicken!
