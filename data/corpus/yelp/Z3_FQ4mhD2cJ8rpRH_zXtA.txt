Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
Pretty good burgers, good fries, good pie, but pretty expensive for what it is. I ordered an Orange Crush, and he brought me a Sunkist; I figure if you're gonna put Orange Crush on the menu, it should be Orange Crush. Anyway, I got the Â Steakburger, but it was nothing special in my opinion; the meat wasn't very flavorful, they put way too much lettuce, and the sweet relish was a little strange. I finished with a slice of apple pie ala mode, which ran me a whopping $7.50, but it was good; very warm and gooey pie, very cold (but not hard) ice cream.
