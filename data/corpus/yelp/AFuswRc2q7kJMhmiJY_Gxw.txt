Round 1- Honestly, even though it tasted great and was cooked medium rare to perfection, I expected a little more from the original Umami Burger. I also love washing down a good burger n fries with a icy cold beer but they don't serve alcoholic beverages. Definitely will come back tho to try the other burgers on the menu. . . . http://www.avocadoLA.com.
