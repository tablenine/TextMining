Aaaaaaahhhhh!!! Meat!!!! Tons of meat!!! This is a treat for me because it reminds me of home. Great meat, salad bar, cheese bread (pao de queijo) and looking at the waiters walking around dressed in gaucho costumes holding chunks of meat on big skewers, just makes my mouth water. lol. The secret is to pace yourself and not attack the delicious side dishes. Order a caipirinha, or even a pineapple juice with mint (it helps to brake the meat for better digestion so you can eat more ;^) and eat with your best salad, and let the food come to you! It's a great experience! Go hungry! It's all you can eat!!!! Bom apetite!!!
