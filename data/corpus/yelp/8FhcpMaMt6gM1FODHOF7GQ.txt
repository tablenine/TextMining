Every time my father-in-law was in the area he would bring back Canter's corned beef and pastrami sandwiches.  This went on for years and was a nice perk in the beginning, but I have to say I grew tired of their sandwiches.  You can tell the quality is very high, nice rye bread, lots of lean meat, and I had to think about why it just wasn't doing it for me.  After all, I do love pastrami with corned beef being a close second.  Plus I was getting these great sandwiches from the famous Canter's for free!  . . So, I came to the conclusion that there are so many choices for restaurants that serve pastrami and corned beef that I became more spoiled and picky over time.  Canter's probably has a better sandwich when eaten at the restaurant (based on ther reviews).   Maybe it's the overall experience thing I'm missing out on.  However, from a pure sandwich viewpoint, I prefer the stronger pickling spice flavors of Johnnies or the Hat.  So, I would have to say the pastrami lacked the gusto of flavor, had a tendency to be a little dry (remember it's really lean), and didn't quite satisfy my craving for a high caloric meaty pastrami sandwich.
