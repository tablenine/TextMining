With "every man for himself" seating, a meat-a-tarian menu, and an overrated beer menu (not as much variety as hyped up to be), I was really disappointed.  We fought for seating for almost an hour on a Saturday evening, and all I could eat were fries, a salad (which didn't sound appetizing) and some olives.  Big whoop.  I know that the thing to get here is the burger, but not all of us drinkers partake in the consumption of meat.  They should take a tip from the York here, and have at least one entree option other than a salad for vegetarians.
