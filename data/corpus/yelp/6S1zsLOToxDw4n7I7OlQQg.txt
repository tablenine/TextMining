Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
It was a friday night and this place is alwayssssssss packed... soo first we had to park the car across the street in the banks parking lot... after we parked the car we put our name on the list... WE WAITED FOR 2 HOURS seroiusly!!!!!! 2 hours but it was definitely worth it!!!!. The place looked like a typical american style seafood place... except that all the waiters are asian...^_^. We ordered 1 dozen oysters, 3 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, 2 lbs of Â king crab legs, cajun fries, hot wings.... lots of food!!! we ordered them in extra hot...^_^ except for the king crab legs... it was extremely spicy... I am still feeling the pain of eating food sooo spicy..... Everything tasted super good except that it was a bit too hot for me... my favorite was the king crab legs for sure!!! . My best friend told me that they are going to open one in San Jose... I hope it is soon... this is going to be one of my favorite restaurants for sure!!!
