Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Should be called "Johnnie's Hot Dog Restaurant." This place really doesn't deserve more than 2.5 stars, but once again, I'm at the mercy of the full-star policy... Round up, right?. . The pastrami here... I don't know WHY so many folks think this place is so good, but they obviously have never had a lean and mean pastrami. Don't get me wrong--for those to whom size matters, yeah, they have an argument, but as for quality of pastrami, I just can't acquiesce to this place.   . . Now the hot dogs are a whole different matter. Fire-grilled, good snap factor, and a full-bodied taste. The chili dogs here are nothing less than epic. Following that epic status are the chili cheese fries. Man, I LOVE the chili cheese fries; unfortunately, I'm not filthy rich and can only rationalize shelling out that kinda cash on rare occasion.. . What irks me is the fact that they charge the kind of money they do--and cash only, at that--for what's basically backyard barbecue fare. Yeah, the sandwiches are large, but I'd rather have a smaller, higher quality pastrami sandwich than a huge sandwich that sucks. My friends insist that I either don't know good pastrami or that I'm constantly getting the shitty part of the batch, and to them I can only say: they shouldn't be serving the shitty part of ANYTHING. Furthermore, I may not know good pastrami, but I know that I've certainly had better (and LEANER) experiences elsewhere.  . . You want a dog and fries? Sure, try Johnnies. You want good pastrami? Go elsewhere.
