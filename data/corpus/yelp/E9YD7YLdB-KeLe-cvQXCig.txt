Seriously, seriously, seriously disappointing.  My expectations must have been too high.. . I simply hate the decor. I felt like I was eating in hospital O.R themed restaurant scene in a bad Wall Street plot 80's movie.  Was Michael Douglas hiding in the kitchen?  So for the all around experience this didn't help.  So cold and unwelcoming.. . The flavors were all ok, but the food temps seemed off.  Too cold, or one ingredient was hot while another in the same dish was icy.  I got that sensation that one gets when biting into a half defrosted frozen dinner.. . Perfect service.
