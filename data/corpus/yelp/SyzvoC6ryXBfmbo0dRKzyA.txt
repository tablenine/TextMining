Hello Kobe beef cheeks!  After splitting this with my sister, her and I proceeded to hallucinate in the streets, due to overwelming richness and taste. Good grief!. . We had the rabbit special, which was okay.  The clams were not worth a damn. So don't get them.  But then again, this is coming from two palates, a foodie and a chef, that cannot deal with such things.  Our server recommended it so we went for it. Bleh.  You can tell they were of great quality and taste, but deep fried and battered with aioli that was lookin' a little worse for wear!  We had the curried lentil salad, it was spectacular. It's a must if you value simple flavors and freshness.  All of it paired with an amazing server and a fine bottle of white wine, made our afternoon blissful.. . **With one weeks in advance notice you may have your own suckling pig served to 4-6 of your friends with all the fixin's.  My sister saw it on tv somewhere, we shall be returning for that gem. Bet your balls!
