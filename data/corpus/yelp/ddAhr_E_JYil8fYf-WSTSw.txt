Thank you, Silver Cloud, for accommodating a very hungry party of 6 within 10 minutes of arrival. Thank you for providing us with a menu full of comfort foods during a very stressful holiday season. Thank you for being cheap (Total bill: $66 for food and booze for 6 people!). Thank you for offering s'mores for dessert. Thank you for not being yet another posh designer restaurant, which seem to be taking over Damen Ave. You were clean, quick, friendly, and best of all, yummy. Thank you, Silver Cloud, for all that you are.
