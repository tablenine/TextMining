my first time eating ethiopian food and it was good...different from what i'm used to...but good nonetheless.. . got a meat lovers &amp; veggie platter &amp; shared with a few friends.  it was really good...the presentation, portion size, atmosphere, price, and service was great.  . . they deliver, have an outdoor patio/seating area, and it's close to my apartment.
