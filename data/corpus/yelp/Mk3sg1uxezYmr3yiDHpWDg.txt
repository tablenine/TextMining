Unimpressed and uninspired. The doner classic and the doner chicken wraps both were able to pass my esophagus without any type of gag reflex and the pita chips and sweet potato fries were also consumable. . . So why the 3 stars? Mainly it has to do with their ridiculous prices. Almost $10 for a wrap the size of a hot pocket, a side, and a drink that they force you to buy. Another thing I found irritating was that they ran out of french fries but told us we could get sweet potato fries. Well they charged us 75 cents for the sweet potato fries when they should've just waived it for not having french fries. Management needs a strong reality check and the service was sub-par with no smiles or any type of welcoming vibe. I can't say I'm looking forward to coming back here again.
