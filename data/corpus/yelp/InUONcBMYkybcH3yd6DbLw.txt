Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
Yes it's true, Penny's Noodles is not really Thai food.  It's American Pan-Asian cuisine.  But even after accepting that, it's still not that great.  The dishes are kind of boring and they're not big on spice.  Also, I found egg shells in my drunken noodle last time I was there.
