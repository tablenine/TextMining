Restaurant: Furaibo Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Furaibo is my favorite restaurant. Period. The restaurant runs in Izakaya fashion.  There are more than enough teppa styled dishes to try out.  In fact, you can order all night long eating a few dishes at a time with your cold pitcher of Soporro.... or..... you can do what I do.  Get the best 2 items they serve.   12 orders of Tebasaki Chicken wings and 2 orders of Agadashi tofu. (serves 4 hungry people plentifully).  . . Tebasaki:  Tebasaki means chicken wings in Japanese.  These are almost bite sized chicken wings that have been marinated in (I suspect) fine chili pepper, soy sauce, mirin, ginger, sugar, garic and a mystery ingredient in which to cause you to be addicted to these wings for life.  I swear you can't find such lean chicken wings anywhere else unless they starve the chicken and then make them do yoga all day long.  The meat is lean, tender, richly flavored and pretty much intoxicating.  The preparation method is deep fry.  HOWEVER, by the time it comes to you, there's not 1 oz of extra grease.  Excess oil is "dry" up and I swear I've eaten a whole dozen of them w/o having to use napkins.  It will change everything you ever knew about a chicken wing.   . . Agadashi Tofu:  Tofu lovers will not be able to stop eating it.  Tofu haters will convert to lovers.  TRY IT!  Simply divine!
