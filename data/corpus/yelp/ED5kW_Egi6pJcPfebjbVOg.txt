Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
"So, you've ordered a lot of cheese," said our server.  . . I think we gave her a strange look when she said this because she proceeded to apologize for her weird statement.. . "Yesterday, a customer complained to me because I didn't warn him ahead of time that he ordered too much cheese," she explained.. . That poor server. What kind of an idiot would go to an ITALIAN place called Pizzeria MOZZA and then complain about too much cheese?!!. . Besides, the cheese there was delicious!  We had their fresh buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto (so creamy), goat cheese with lentils (who can say no to deep fried cheese), and ricotta stuffed squash blossoms (more deep fried goodness).   The pizza was also really good; the fennel sausage and onion pizza had the right balance of salt and sweet.  And then dessert: the butterscotch budino was really good... the butterscotch is extremely sweet, but they sprinkle some sea salt on the top that cuts through the sweet and also accentuates the flavor.  YUM!. . Our server was funny and nice.  She also recommended a good bottle of wine that was reasonably priced and matched the food and our preferences very well.  It's a casual and fun atmosphere.  Reservations are recommended; my sister made a reservation a month in advance and her only choices for time slots was either 6pm or 11:00pm! :P. . The only thing I had a problem with was the noise level.  The place is small with lots of people and they had the music volume pretty high so it made it hard to talk over the other diners AND music.  But I would still go back! :)
