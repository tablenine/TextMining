Restaurant: Twist A Tapas Cafe
Category: Tapas Bars
I visited Twist recently for brunch.  I was pleasantly surprised at the service, menu selection and food quality.  Our server was on top of things (unlike many brunch servers in chicago who are too hungover from saturday night to serve you properly), we were offered a brunch menu, AND their traditional tapas menu, and everyone in our group seemed very happy with the quality and taste of their food.   I'd definitely go back for brunch and would be interested in trying dinner sometime.
