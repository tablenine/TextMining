Go on Tuesdays for the 8.95 entrees... yes that's right, 8.95 for ANY entree, served with short-grain white rice steamed to perfection, a hot pot of jasmine-oolong tea, and a chocolate fortune cookie.  . . From the outside, this place reminds me of a miniaturized P.F. Chang's, with a modern, clean atmosphere and cohesive decor.  The food was out in literally five minutes after we ordered, and I wondered with skepticism if the food would have a serious pre-made vibe to it.  It was, however, very fresh and tasty.  I had the Buddha's feast, basically a melange of Asian mushrooms with fried tofu and other veggies in a garlicky brown sauce.  The tofu smelled lightly reminiscent of Taiwanese "stinky" tofu - if you know what I speak of and you happen to like that stuff, then this is probably about as close as you will get to it around here.  It was subtle, though, so the aroma wasn't overpowering.  The natural buttery-ness of the tofu skin was extremely impressive.  My boyfriend had the General Tao Shrimp and was equally pleased with his order...and we will probably be back next Tuesday.
