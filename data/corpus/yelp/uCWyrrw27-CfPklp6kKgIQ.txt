Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
Anybody who disses Philippe's might need to be taken out back. Seriously. What the hell is wrong with you??. . Philippe's is an oasis of old Los Angeles. Saw dust on the floor. 10 cent coffee (sure there are no refills, but you'll have to drink 15 cups before you Â are paying anywhere close to what other restaurants charge). Purple pickled eggs. French dipped deliciousness. Pies in all varieties. A candy counter with more names than the super market. Giant pickles. The most delicious of all mustards. All of this plus free parking and at a low low price of less than $10 per person. Where else in LA can you buy lunch for 6 for $53 including drinks, sides, and dessert?. . My favorite thing to do is order a french dipped turkey on swiss and a side of coleslaw. Then at my table I throw a bunch of coleslaw in the sandwich with a generous layer of Philippe's famous mustard. Tastes divine and clears your sinuses too! . . It's Monday night and I'm STILL dreaming of lunch on Saturday...
