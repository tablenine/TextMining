Pros:. . -the food is GREAT -- i always order the porkchops ($7.95 - lunch) or the coconut curry cod. the pho is near perfect. Â for dinner, they give you shrimp chips with some hoison sauce, which is a great alternative to bread and butter. also, the desserts (expresso brownie and lychee panna cotta) and the coffee drinks are delicious. . -inexpensive -- for the quality of food, i think it's really inexpensive ($7-10 for a lunch entree, $10-15 for a dinner entree). . -location -- thank goodness this place isn't in the heart of hollywood. the silverlake location is PERFECT, especially if you live 2.5 seconds away.. . -parking -- gingergrass has a pretty big parking lot so it's not that difficult to find a place to park. . Cons:. . -can't really think of anything.. . - - - - - - - - - . . Out of Wallet Costs -- $40 for two entrees, dessert, drinks and tip. . Chance I Would Go Again -- Yes. . Would I Recommend This Place -- Yes
