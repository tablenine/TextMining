I have yet to find a better Chicago establishment than Rose Angelis. I've dined here numerous times and have always had above average food and service. All of their pasta dishes are amazing. My all-time favorite dish is the "mezzalune al burro," which consists of spinach ravioli pasta with sun dried tomatoes and pine nuts in a light butter sauce. Their marinara sauce is excellent. They also have unique specials every night. Unfortunately, I can't comment on the desserts because I'm always too full to try them. Perhaps one of these days I'll save room. The atmosphere is cozy; perfect for a date or a group. I've brought many people to this restaurant and no one has ever said anything but good things. Five stars!
