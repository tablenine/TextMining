After a girl from work brought the office delicious treats from MILK:  blue velvet cake, powdery cookies, chocolaty cookies, and banana dulce de leche ice cream, all equally fit for the gods of scrumptiousness; a personal visit was in order.. . 3 days later - head there for a lunch date.  First time in I got a salad (forget the name) that had mixed greens, cranberries, candied walnuts, tomatoes, goat cheese and wild rice.  I was a little put off by the idea of rice in a salad, but I decided to trust the combination and was pleasantly surprised...tasty!  Ty got the veggie sandwich which contained squash, zucchini, goat cheese, onions and red peppers, served on the perfect crispy, yet squishy, bread.  I've gotten that sandwich on both return visits...soooo good.  The roasted chicken sandwich is also very good-melted mozzarella, roasted chicken, tomatoes, onions and again with the BREAD.. . Usually we are so full from the sammies that we don't have room for dessert, but last time we shared a toffee milk shake...Tyler said it was the best milk shake he ever had!  . . The staff is kind and accommodating and I absolutely love the space.  Ample street parking.
