Short: Veggie options available!! Fries are made in veg oil. Perhaps I chose poorly but I felt you could do better with a pack of tofurkey sausages at home. . . Expanded: So, so excited to see several options for veggie. Not so excited to see them displayed right next to meatier options. A useless counter-girl volleyed every query I threw at her to the busy cook behind her manning the grill. Are the veggie sausages cooked on the same surface as the meaty ones? No. What are the fries cooked in? Veg oil. . . I went with the veggie smoked apple sage with caramelized cebolla and spicy peppers. Perhaps I chose overbearing toppings but I didn't notice a bit of the yukon potatoes, sage, or apple that was supposed to be in my 'sage pick. The "freshly baked roll" was a teensy bit stale on the ends. . . The fries were saving this meal. Warm and crisp, even without dipping sauce these babies were yum. Order the white truffle oil glaze and be the envy of all those around you. . . Out of curiosity we tacked on a small bottle of Underberg (found by the register). 44% alcohol content and a purported aid for digestion- healthy AND buzz-inducing! If you can get past the strong bitters taste that is. Think jager to the twentieth power (I coughed taking a sip). . . Don't expect to zip in/out of here, if there's a line you're gonna have some wait time on your hands. Use this to pick out your mustard and peruse the beer menu. KCRW card holders: discount, whoot!! Parking: street. I may not be doing backflips over their veg 'sages but I do dig their use of an unusual building space.
