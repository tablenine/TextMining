Restaurant: The Marlay House
Category: Pubs
The food was good, the ambiance, and seat yourself is fine. What was really annoying was that they were not prepared in the front and back of the house for a holiday weekend. It took 45 mins for the food to come, the server was very slow and wasted many steps (given that I use to be a server), and the manager was no where in sight. This place could be a 5 star, but clearly needs new management.
