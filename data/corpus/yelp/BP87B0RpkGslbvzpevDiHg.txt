Restaurant: The Counter
Category: Burgers
I already thought The Counter was pretty good, maybe because of the novelty of building my own burger, checking off my choices on a clipboard with a golf pencil and awaiting my own masterpiece, but NOW I love it because I discovered their veggie burger. And let me tell you, it is m i g h t y Â f i n e. . . Not the best/quickest service in the world but I will be returning at least twice in the next 10 days to take advantage of their buy-one-get-one coupons from the Pride Parade!
