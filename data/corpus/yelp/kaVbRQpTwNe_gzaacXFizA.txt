I don't get why everybody is so excited about this place.. . Yes, the food is good.  Not spectacular, but good- I'd have it again, and I have no general complaints about it.. . The beer is good too- but geez, they sure are proud of it!  During one visit, I tried several of their in-house brews and while they were all tasty, there were all also overpriced, either way too much for a pint or charging a pint's worth of price for a smaller glass.  In my general experience, brewpubs usually charge LESS for their own creations for reasons ranging from not having established brand-caché to not having been through any distributors or middlemen.  $5 for a pint of in-house-brew is ridiculous, period.. . The atmosphere is nice but it can be noisy.  The staff often seem a bit surly, especially the spiky-haired dyke working the bar the last time I was there.  The first time I visited I was with a group of about 10 people, and the service was not only surly but was also uneven from one end of the table to the other.. . Despite the attempted 'niceness' of the interiour, there is a sort of lingering aura or run-down-ness that seems to permeate the place, and the amateurish art on some of the walls doesn't help that much.  Such a shame, because I like the architecture and the lodge-theme is an old favourite of mine for some reason that defies logic.. . I'll visit again if somebody invites me, but I don't have much desire to return of my own volition.
