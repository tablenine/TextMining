the number 19 was good.. but not GREAT.. . i was expecting GREAT from all the reviews.. i guess i'm more of a fan of the greasy oily pastrami. . aka the HAT.. . but it's like eating a piece of history since this is a . landmark restaurant so i guess i'll give it a 4.. i love all things landmark. :)
