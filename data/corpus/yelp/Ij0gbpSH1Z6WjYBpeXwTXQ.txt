Restaurant: Loteria Grill
Category: Mexican
Loteria Grill is one of my fave Mexican joints! Probably one of the best 2 or 3 places in the Farmer's Market too...everyone I've taken here has been impressed by this humble stall, including my Latino friends.. . Far from the ubiquitous gloppy combo plate so prevalent everywhere, even here in North Mexico, Loteria serves up smarter, fresher fare with superior flavor. Part of its uniqueness is perhaps due to the Mexico City influence, rather than, say, Baja or Tex-Mex.. . Chilaquiles (I'm a sucker for 'em) come three different ways. And not many places I know have cactus salad or chicken in pumpkin seed/peanut sauce. Did I mention pork rinds in tomatillo sauce? Pork roasted in a banana leaf? Oh--try the chile relleno special if available.. . Wash it all down with an horchata and then waddle down the main street to laugh at people amazed by the dancing waters.
