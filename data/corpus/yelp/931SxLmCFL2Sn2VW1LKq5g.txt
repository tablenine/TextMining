Restaurant: f2o Fresh To Order
Category: Sandwiches
I have been a fan of Fresh2Order since its' early days!  It's really just the best!  The Wild Mushroom soup has got to be the yummiest thing on the planet - so rich and creamy!  The vegetable panini is amazing!  The Roasted Corn and Peanut Salad (a side dish) is unbelieveable!  There is nothing I've ordered that hasn't been wonderful!  This is always my go-to spot when I'm having a crummy day!  I'm glad I work within walking distance!
