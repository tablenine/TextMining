Category: Lounges
N9NE was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  It is trying too hard to be trendy and is unbearably noisy.  Impossible to converse with our friends.  Impossible to hear our wait person.. We'll never be back due to the noise problem.. The food was interesting, the decor was delightful, the service was good.. The noise UNDID all positive impressions.. Never again.. I could have enjoyed everything so much more if I'd been able to hear myself think.
