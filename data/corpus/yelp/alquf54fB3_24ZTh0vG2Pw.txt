This place is an Atlanta institution. I've gone there forever and just have great memories of going Â with my mom after a day at the High or meeting my dad there after work.. . Yes, it's greasy. But if you don't know that going in, you're already headed for trouble. Lighten up a bit and just have fun! (And have a Frosted Orange while you're doing it!)
