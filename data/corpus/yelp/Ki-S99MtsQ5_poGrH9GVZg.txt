Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Not sure what's up with ALL the RAVE Reviews for a place like this..  Very small dining area inside, so I had to sit outside with ALL sorts of insects crawling &amp; flying around..  Had a huge Roach Fell OFF the ceiling and into my Manuel Special and I was ONLY 1/2 way done..  Spoke to the owner bout that and he kindly told me I didn't have to pay for mine..  Out of his Generosity, I rated this place a 1 Star..  Otherwise, it'll be ZERO..  Sorry, need to clean up the Patio area a little bit here..  Sure their Burritos are huge but it also comes with a HEFTY Price Tag..  Imagine paying $15-$23 for a Burrito..  :D
