Vegan and organic seems to be all the rage down south these days, though those LA people don't seem to have heard of recycling, or the downsides of styrofoam.  . . Anyway, this is a hella great place to have a relaxing and healthy brunch, with good prospects for celebrity sightings.  We spotted THE HOFF.. . The nachos were incredible.  I couldn't believe they were vegan.  I could probably be vegan if I had food like that every day.. . I wasn't as crazy about my entree, an artichoke ravioli.  It was unexpectedly bitter from an excess of kale, and didn't have the right herbs or whatnot to offset it.  Others didn't seem as floored by their entrees as by the nachos either.. . I drank kombucha with my meal to romanticize the experience.  I must confess I hadn't heard of kombucha before.
