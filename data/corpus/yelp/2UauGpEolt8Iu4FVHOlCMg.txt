I was really looking forward to this place because it really has that french Bon Marche' vibe that i like so much when i visit Paris.. But as they say "good from far, far from good". The place just opened and there are about a million people working there. Half of those people don't have a clue.. The coffee is good, the chocolate croissants and butter croissants are pretty good (i would say comparable to real french-made ones). The chocolate eclairs were ok...nothing special. However, the chocolate macaroons were kind of gross, and very hard. They're supposed to be chewy inside. And, my biggest disappointment of all was the apricot tart. First of all STOP PUTTING CINNAMON EVERYWHERE! Just stop! Cinnamon destroys the taste of yummy pastries. It is often used to hide bland tastes! I love apricot tarts...i especially love the light almond taste, which was covered by the cinnamon. Yuck! Secondly, please pick ripe apricots. The ones on the tart were tasteless and practically white.. . All in all, this place isn't bad. They just need to get their stuff together a little bit. I'm sure a few months from now they'll be more up to par.. . One good thing is that it's not too pricey. Thank god, because for a few bucks more i would definitely prefer eating at Le Pain Quotidien, where the apricot tarts are delicious.
