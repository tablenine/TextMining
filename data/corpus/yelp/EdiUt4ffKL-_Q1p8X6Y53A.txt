This place is so good, it's almost sinful that it's not that best kept secret only you and your friends know about. The thing is everybody and their mother knows about Porto's. There's a reason why the line is always long at Porto's, and I don't stress that to discourage any impatient people. The product is superb, the service is prompt, and the customers (refer to long-ass lines, all day everyday) are almost always satisfied. . . My favorite has to be the meat pie. At under a buck for each, I just can't help but go home with a dozen. The outer crust is flaky and buttery, and stuffed inside like a magical fairy tale ending is some beautifully marinated meat. Aside from savory snacks, some favorite sweets are the fruit tarts, mango mousse, and guava cheese strudels. Â Flourless chocolate cake deserves an honorable mention as well. Just let spontaneity take over because I'm sure whatever you choose will be a winner.
