So I was invited to attend a swanky little shindig at the Geisha House last week....which is surprising considering my usual aversion to all things sushi. It is located in a fairly nondescript building on a busy corner in Hollywood, but the interior is fantastic! Ambient lighting, an eclectic soundtrack (old school Cure, NIN, Postal Service, etc.), and creative lighting and decor made for a great first impression. The upstairs bar, patio and intimate seating made a perfect setting for our pre-dinner cocktail party. . . When we were finally ready to eat, we all headed downstairs (fairly steep so watch your step if you are feeling tipsy) and were seated around 3 large circular tables. Given the 3 martinis I had earlier, I decided to give the sushi another try and was pleasantly surprised. For starters we had the Edamame and several rounds of sake. I ordered the Chicken Robata-Yaki (chicken on skewers with three different dipping sauces) and we had family style orders of Oceans 3 (a variety of hand rolls), Agemono shrimp (tempura) and I have no idea how many different types of sushi and sashimi (I was drinking sake, remember??).. . I was pleasantly surprised by the rolls and actually lost count of the number of shrimp and crab that I ate. Suffice it to say it was enough that someone finally intervened and moved the plate away from me so others could enjoy some as well. . . Overall the food was delish, but the crowd was rather loud and rowdy. I had to shout at the person sitting next to me to be heard and we finally resorted to hand signals in order to communicate. Add a drunk jackass bopping around (no, it was not me) from the table next to us, and I was ready to exit stage left, but Geisha House has inspired me to bring back some sushi into my life.
