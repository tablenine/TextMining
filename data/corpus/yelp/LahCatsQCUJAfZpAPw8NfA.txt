3 for the food, and 4.5 for the ambiance and drinks (it's beautiful but it does get quite crowded and noisy some nights). I always end up here for birthdays and group events, but wouldn't go here on my own accord. . . There are definitely some good things on the hot menu. The miso marinated black cod, rib eye, and sauteed calamari are all very yummy dishes. The crab miso soup is served with a generous piece of king crab leg, and has an impressive presentation. But the sushi ranges from bad to good (never great), depending on the night. I've the tuna here on some nights where it tasted like water with sushi texture. And I've come on other nights where my "Frightened Geisha Roll", Baby Bay Scallop roll were surprisingly good (although hot sauce and mayo helps everything taste good). The sushi quality doesn't meet the price, but in Hollywood you're mostly paying for ambiance and eye candy anyway. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing on a Friday night. . . One thing that's superb about this place is the lychee martini and the extensive sake menu. The sake sommalier here is a very sweet guy, easy to talk to, and can make great recommendations. If you can spare the bucks, the Jozen is a light, floral, delicious sake that is a TREAT. I love the private room upstairs and the nice upstairs smoking patio, and the round table seating areas downstairs.
