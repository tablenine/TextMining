Restaurant: Wurstküche
Category: Hot Dogs
As seems recommended to most Wurstkuche virgins, I had the Rattlesnake &amp; Rabbit bratwurst with Jalapeño Peppers. I also got their fries with a couple of dipping sauces. Very, very good food. . . I also liked the clean atmosphere and feel lucky that I found parking right away and didn't even have to wait in a line... I arrived at 12:15pm on today's Saturday and there was a large group who made it in just after I walked in... my timing was perfect! . . I have to admit, I think Downtown LA, (like the area near Wurstkuche), is the nastiest and most disorganized city center on planet earth, therefore I try to avoid it. If there were a Wurstkuche in West LA, I would likely go much more often and jump this to a FIVE! . . Final note... this is not really a "German" restaurant, as I had initially expected. But... for America, they do a good job, have good service, keep it very clean and have wonderful food and beer!
