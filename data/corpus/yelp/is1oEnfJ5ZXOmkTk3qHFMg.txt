I was all excited about tricking my aunt into eating vegetarian food and not letting her know it.  Could she tell it wasn't real chicken?  NO!!  Success!. . Seriously though... amazing!  Love the kale, the chili, the sweet potato fries!. . Only thing that'd make this place better is a gluten free option.  Right now you have to stick to the salads (minues faux meat), chili, and kale.
