Look no further than the carnitas.  It took me by surprise and I've not had carnitas as good since then.  I'm a fan of Susan Feniger's food and Ciudad does not disappoint.  The patio seating is perfect at night, towered by skyscrapers from all sides.  Not since the now-defunct Windows has a downtown restaurant impressed with its spectacular view.  Ciudad also gets cool-kid-points for authentic mojitos.
