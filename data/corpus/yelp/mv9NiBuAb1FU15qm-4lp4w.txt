After the second try.... 1 star for not having to pay.. 1/2 star for the great time I had.. 1/2 star for the bartender (great drinks + free drink). 1-1/2 stars for the food. (Too bad they lose out of the 1/2 star). The meats were so salty and I kept getting overcooked cuts even though I asked for med. rare everytime.. They need to turn more meat around ...faster.
