Decent Indian food. Great flavor but SOOO oily that it's amost unbearable. They will make it as spicy as you want it and if you ask for very very spicy, look out! The kulfi ice cream is wonderful. I always get the kadai chicken and it's delicious but so greasy. . The naan is always covered in butter, which isn't my favorite. . The health rating posted on the wall for years was only an 81, but within the past few months it's gone up. Still, this worries me. . It's always very quick service. . Ample parking in the back. . Very very affordable ($5-6/ dish not including naan). . The atmosphere leaves something to be desired. It's basically a huge room with lots of little tables. . They serve all of their food in styrofoam plates/bowls and on plastic trays, so it's not the classiest of joints.
