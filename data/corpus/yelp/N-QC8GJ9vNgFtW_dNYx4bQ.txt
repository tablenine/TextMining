Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I finally made it to Lawry's after hearing about it for years.  It was good, but not as amazing as everyone says it is.  The prime rib was very good (juicy and flavorful) as were the sides.  Usually sides really make a steakhouse but unfortunately, I was not blown away.  The lobster tails were also dry (very disappointing).  The spinning salad was just so-so, but it was fun to watch the process.. . They had a good selection of wines (very reasonable too) and the desserts were great, as was the service (although it made us feel very uncomfortable being served by people dressed like maids).
