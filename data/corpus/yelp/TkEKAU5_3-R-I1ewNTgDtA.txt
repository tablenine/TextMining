Restaurant: Sushi-Gen
Category: Sushi Bars
*Highlight: lunch special sashimi plate!!. . Their lunch special is ridiculous-- you can get a HUGE plate of assorted sashimi plus soup, rice, and tofu for $15. The sashimi is so fresh and amazing. It's gotten to the point that whenever I go to other Japanese restaurants, I sit there missing Sushi-Gen. ;). . It's not so horribly crowded at 11-11:30ish on weekdays.
