I like this place. Tons of options, burger was delivered to order, decent beer list.  However, it's a bit pricey for what it is.  I had the 2/3 lb with Horseradish cheddar and bacon.  It was too big for me, and that's saying something.  You won't leave hungry, but at what they charge, you shouldn't.  The fries were great, as were the onion straws.  Beers came cold, though I did have to summon the waiter for a refill.  This is a place like DMK for me.  I'll go back, but probably only if someone I'm with wants to go.  Nothing's really drawing me back there.  It would be a good people watching place when the weather gets nice.
