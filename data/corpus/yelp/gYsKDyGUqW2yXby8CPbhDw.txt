Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Right next to my summer workplace, this place was a delicious component of my lunchtime explorations.. . Okay, the Best Fish Taco might be a little superlative and hyperbolic (I'd argue that the El Siete Mares (3131 W Sunset Blvd) gives it a good run for its money, but Best Fish is still pretty amazing. They don't fry your fish/shrimp until you order (you get to watch the whole process, huge vats of oil and everything).. . Clean, huge variety of salsas, friendly owner, I loved coming to Best Fish Taco. I'd recommend the shrimp over the fish, but of course, try both. Also, their horchata has a unique taste (I think it's homemade), so give it a sip. Parking is no issue, easy to find street parking in the neighborhood if need be.
