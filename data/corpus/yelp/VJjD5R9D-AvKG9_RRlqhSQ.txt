A solid dining experience. The staff is super friendly and the BYOB idea is genious. Portions are on the smaller side which is a good thing. I had the salmon and my mom had the chicken. Both were delish. The almond stuffed dates are a must try. I'm looking forward to going back and trying their lamb burger with truffle fries.
