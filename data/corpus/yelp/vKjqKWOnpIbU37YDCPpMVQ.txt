The Ropa Vieja sandwich was delicious today as always.  The pulled beef, swiss cheese, and garlic infused mayo on their perfectly baked bread hit the hunger spot perfectly.  The service was friendly and fast as well.  They actually have menus and take your order at the table now.  No more ordering at the counter unless it's carryout.  . . My mistake today was disregarding the size of the sandwich and eating the second half of it.  Oh my goodness!  It's been 2-3 hours since I've eaten my sandwich and I am still suffering from ODAS (over distended abdomen syndrome).  Mental note:  always save the second half for later.
