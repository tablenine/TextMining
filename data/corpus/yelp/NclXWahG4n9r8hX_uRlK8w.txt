I'm going to ATTEMPT to keep this brief because as we all know, service is slow (food is made to order -- what can you do?), waits can be unbearably long (unless you go for dinner which is when I normally go), portions are ginormous, it isn't the cleaniest joint in the world, and yes, Oprah loves their red velvet cake.. . This is a destination spot for me.  When I'm tired, cranky, sick, or suffering from bad-day syndrome, I crave their soup au pistou (without the pesto) with their ridiculously good bread, and the 1/2 portion of the chicken basil salad.  I can't vouch for anything else (aside from the blueberry flaxseed pancakes -- divine), because I can never get myself to order anything else.  I go there because I want the soup.  It is good.  It makes me happy.  And I have leftovers for the next day.
