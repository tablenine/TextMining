The bf and I finally used our groupon on a Friday night. Overall, we weren't impressed. We are huge fans of Coast &amp; Butterfly, whose sushi is amazing and is BYOB. Kamehachi was much more expensive and there was not one roll that had that "wow" factor. The best part of the meal was the steamed dumplings. While it wasn't a horrible experience, my love for cheaper &amp; better sushi places in the city will most likely keep me from returning.
