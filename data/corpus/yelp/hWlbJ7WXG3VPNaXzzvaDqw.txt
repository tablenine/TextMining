Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
So, it's like 2:15 am on Saturday night. I was lame and hadn't left the apt all night.  Problem is I'm wide awake (Vegas has put me on a weird like 6 AM - Noon Sleep Schedule -- Damn you again Vegas).  I get a craving for something, but what's open this late?  What you got for me Yelp! --  Johnnie's Pastrami, all right, that is close.. . I drive thru the ghost town of Culver City, to the place on Sepulveda.  The place is alot nicer than I expected (I was thinking whole in the wall, but nah, it actually has outside patio seating and fire pits, pretty cool).  So, I get a pastrami sandwich (it's in the title, I have to try it, right?), cheese fries, and a coke.  The sweet lady says $19.94.  I was like whaaaaat?  Damn pricey, I think I got robbed a few bucks because they gave me chili cheese fries for like $6.75, but what you going to do?. . The fries, I couldn't really find the cheese buried under mounds of chili, we're ok.  The fries themselves look good, just not drenched like they were.  Rookie mistake, next time I'll know better.  Pastrami is good, better than most places.  4 Stars on the food and being open til 3 AM, minus 1 on the price.
