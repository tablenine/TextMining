I agree with Paul's assessment.  The atmosphere of this place is very cool.  I loved the chalkboard menus, and I like that there are only a handful of dishes to choose from.  There is nothing wrong with a kitchen concentrating on a small selection of good items.  . . However, I felt like the food was very overpriced.  I was not wowed by my entree, the gnocchi, and I definitely did not feel like it was worth $18.  My boyfriend ordered the trout, and his was far and away better than mine.  The chicken looked delicious, but $24??? Come on, chicken is one of the least expensive things a restaurant can get, even if it is local and organic.  The wine selection was good, again overpriced but what wine in a restaurant isn't?  . . Our server was very nice, but a little over-eager to please and a tad bit awkward.  She was knowledgeable about the menu, but her recommendations were not a hit with our table.  Overall, the food was good, but not good enough for what they charge.  My impression of this place is that they don't quite know what kind of restaurant they want to be.  It is designed to be trendy with the yuppie crowd, the people who don't quite know what good food is but are lured in by atmosphere and fancy menu-speak.  I have to admit though, that the phatty cakes were excellent.
