Restaurant: Little Five Corner Tavern
Category: Bars
I pass the Corner Tav frequently and I finally made it a point to stop in with my family, and I was pleasantly surprised.  . . The atmosphere was very comfortable and the beer selections were abundant...anytime there is franziskaner on draft I nearly wet myself!. . It is seat yourself and once we did so, our server was there almost immediately, which is a nice change of pace.. . The food was good, but not great.  With that being said, I would eat it anytime without hesitation...Also, my pops is a vegetarian and he was overwelmed with the amount of vegetarian selections. (He decided on the shrimp po-boy and he thoroughly enjoyed it). . I would definitely recommend Corner Tavern.  Full bar, pool tables, accomodating to families or groups, and a nice change from the normal hustle and bustle of L5P.
