Such a great dining experience! Â Not only is the food amazing, but the wait staff is efficient and informative (not to mention- beautiful!) Be sure to check out the crab, tiger prawns, and garlic noodles. Our server suggested those, and she was right on. When you walk into Crustacean, you immediately feel the vibe- elegant, exotic, and cool. I highly recommend it.
