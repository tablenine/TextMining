I remember the G.o.D. (good ole days) when I didn't have to wait freakin' 2 hours for a table. Use to be, everything on the menu rocked. Now it's too crowded and too 'touristy' (is that possible??) so the food can be inconsistent. But the lobster still rules. And don't forget the clams with basil (instead of black bean sauce). BTW, the place is not chinese nor vietnamese, but a cross between the two. That's why the food/spices/herbs have that unique blending. Enjoy hangin' out in front of the 7-eleven.
