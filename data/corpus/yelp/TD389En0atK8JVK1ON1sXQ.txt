Restaurant: The Hungry Cat
Category: Seafood
My girlfriend and I met here for the very first time over a year ago and loved it. In fact, we still go back. Everything about Hungry Cat reeks of quality, from their peel-and-eat shrimp with olive oil &amp; sea salt, to their original hand-crafted cocktails. The portion sizes can be a bit dainty for the money, but you'll leave feeling satisfied. They used to serve a 40 oz can of Pabst in a brown bag, but not sure if they do that anymore.
