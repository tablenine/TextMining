We stopped by last night for the first time.  I was in the mood for a burger which is a very rare occurrence and this is one of the only places I know of in town where I can get a "happy meat" burger.. . It was around 8pm, but the parking lot was still quite crowded and I got nervous when I saw the line and the crowded dining room, but it went really quickly.  . . It took me a minute to figure out how to order - the options were simply overwhelming.  I'm definitely going to have to make a return trip to try more.  You can either choose some of the "pre-defined" burgers or build your own adding various toppings at $1 and $2 price points.. . We were easily able to find a table when the time came.  There were several picnic-style communal tables, but also plenty of two-tops and a couple tables outside if you don't like to share your space.. . Everything was delivered to our table quickly - my fresh salad with blueberries and mustard vinagrette was heavenly, as was the carmelized onion dip &amp; chips appetizer.  Burgers were very satisfying, and my root beer float the perfect ending to the meal.  . . It's not really a place I can see lingering over the meal for hours as the atmosphere isn't too conducive to that (we were in and out in around 30 minutes), but I really enjoyed the experience and plan to return.
