I always wanted to try this place because I pass by and see all the people out on the patio and I always thought it would be a cool place to try.  I'm glad I did.  I enjoyed my meal at Cafe di Sol.  I was torn between the salmon and crab cakes and went with the Oven Baked Crab cakes that came with Fresh Organic Angel Hair pasta, Grilled Asparagus and Slow Roasted Tomatoes.  It was really good.  The crab meat was tasty and sweet!  My boyfriend had the Andy's Burger and he really enjoyed it.  The mojito was strong and not too minty (which is good).  For dessert we had the hot fudge brownie sundae and it was huge and hit the spot.  The service was good also.  I will definitely return even if it is just to sit out on the patio.
