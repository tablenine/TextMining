Do yourself a favor and order the Hot Chocolate Cake  - NO matter what time it is.  It's a chocolate flourless cake served on a bed of fudge and a side of mousse.  I was so excited for CFC that I ordered it for breakfast this morning.. . The food is generally "ok" and overpriced, and expect slow service, but it has a country charm which sets it apart from other places in the city.  They have an extensive cupcake/bread/bakery item list, and I'm sure it's all tasty - yet overpriced at the same time.. . I've found myself coming here because of happenstance because it's really the only breafast joint in Andersonville, and I will probably continue to come because of happenstance, but I won't ever go out of my way to come here.  Unless I turn gay, apparently it was voted best gay coffeeshop in the city.  So there.
