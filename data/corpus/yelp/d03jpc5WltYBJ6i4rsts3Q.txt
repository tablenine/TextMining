if i can't fit into my pants for work tmrw i'll know it's because i ate too many cheese rolls from porto's. these bad boys are coated in sugar and filled with cream cheese goodness. . . they were brought up to us so we didn't get to go to the store but i will update once we do.. hmm.... ::plans visit to LA in head::
