They finally replaced those uncomfortable chairs! The old chairs made you feel like you were sitting on an iron bar ... the funny thing is that the same chairs are on display in the modern wing of the Art Institute! . . The food is just OK, but the positive is that the dishes are huge and they have a large variety of Asian cusines for an inexpensive price. The standard customer is the gen-X crowd. . . But they are the standard bearer for the Bubble Tea which has made them famous ... gotta have that after you look at the huge selection!
