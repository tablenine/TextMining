1. This place is really darn close to my apartment.. . 2. There is a beer garden. I don't even mind so much that there are very few selections of beer. They had 321 and that made me happy since I'm not crazy into beer anyhow.. . 3. My friend liked her burger. I didn't get anything to eat and didn't really glance much at the menu. My friend said there weren't many vegetarian options. I didn't mind because I was just there to sit outside and drink beer.. . 4. One of the darkest restaurants I've ever walked into! It scared me, I thought I was going blind! The tables are so tightly packed, I had to move several chairs to get to the back patio. Kind of annoying but I wasn't sitting inside so it didn't bother me much.. . 5. I would go back again if I had a group of people who wanted to get some reasonably priced beer and sit outside. I wouldn't say it's a good representation of Chicago in any way but it is what it is. A beer garden and lovely outdoor seating. Simple as that.
