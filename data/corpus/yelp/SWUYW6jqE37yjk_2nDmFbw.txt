Now let me preface this by saying that I love my husband dearly and would never cheat on him. But... HOT DIGGITY DAMN!!! Every waiter in this place must be an actor/model wannabe.  Good looking people everywhere.. . The decor is very simplistic. White walls. Glass. Marble floors. And that's about it. No paintings on the walls, etc. It had a very clean feel to it. The one thing is: if you don't like noisy places, this is definitely not the place for you. The noise bounces off of everything since there isn't a whole lot for it to be absorbed by.. . The food.  The food was delicious and beautifully presented. There was a miscommunication with someone somewhere and one of the people that I was with did not receive her dessert in a timely manner and they put a rush on it and made sure it was taken off of the bill. . . This place is busy and there is a lot going on, all of the time. If that's not your scene, you probably won't like it. If you want a quiet dinner, not the place. This place is so loud it reminds me of lunchtime in a convention center conference. But if you can hang, definitely a must!
