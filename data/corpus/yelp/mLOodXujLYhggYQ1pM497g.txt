When it's 75 degrees out in sunny socal you can't help but gravitate towards this outdoor patio for brunch.  The outdoor area is quite unique and has it's own flair of personality.  It has a feel of a personal home garden with some random patio seats thrown out there.  Great vibe they accomplished when putting this place together.. . Not only am I digging the outdoor seating area but I love the self serve concept.  You order inside, grab a number and get your own drinks.  No need to deal with a waitress or deal with gratuity fees.  Something I greatly appreciated living in San Francisco when they hit you with a 18% gratuity charge along with a healthcare tax.  . . Food here wasn't half bad either.  I opted to make my own omelet here and it was pretty good.  Portions were fairly large and they served it with a huge side of potatoes.  The potatoes were just okay, I would have opted for some fresh fruit next time.  Brunch wasn't the best I've had but you can't really complain when dining in such great weather with the company of great friends.  If I'm ever in the area again, I'll make a special request to come back here so I can check out their pastry selection.
