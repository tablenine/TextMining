Previous visits to Opera included only drinks and apps at the bar so I was excited to finally sit down and have a meal here.  (Although Jimmy is a very good bartender and if you like eating at the bar, this is your place!). . Had a late night reservation and was treated very well from the moment we walked in the door.  You could tell they had a busy night and were winding down but they were still very attentive and respectful.  Have had many instances eating out late where you can tell the servers just want to get the hell out of there.  . . Started with the Lobster Spring Roll and it was very good.  Believe it or not I'm not a huge fan of lobster and this was tasty.  The spicy sauce that it was in totally made the dish.  . . We weren't that hungry so we asked JL how the duck was.  It comes in 3 seperate presentations and every one of them was delicious.  After we mentioned that we wanted it, JL informed us that if we took one bite and didn't care for it that he would bring us something else.  There is something about a food guarantee that I enjoy and he certainly was right.. . The decor alone in this place warrants 4 stars.  It is the IDEAL place for a romantic dinner as they have the little side rooms you can reserve.  MAYBE NEXT TIME!. . Prices make this place perfect for any type of dining.  . . The kitchen is also in view and the staff was VERY appreciative of our positive comments about the food.  GREAT PLACE!
