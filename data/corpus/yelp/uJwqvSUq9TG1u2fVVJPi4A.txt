Like many who saw this place featured on Check Please, we went to try it out. Mostly OK but not worth a return visit. Cocktails are fun if a bit on the sweet side. Our server was the main drawback. She was speedy racer and bit curt/brusque in bringing out our food as fast as humanly possible. At one point we asked for some more rice and my wife and I looked at each other knowing that it would be on the table in about 30 seconds and sure enough it was. The food was pretty tasty except for the tamarind-date-glazed chicken skewers. These had a scorched flavor probably from the glaze burning in the super-hot tandoori oven. Very off-putting. Other dishes were better including the scallop app and the mutter paneer. A bit pricey for a weeknight - $150 for drinks and dinner. Server didn't understand how to apply our coupon and deducted the amount from the previously calculated food/drink/tax amount which was incorrect but not a huge delta.
