Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
there was a lot of hype about this place, but i'm giving it only 3 stars because neither the pizza, pot pies, or the grinders were all that great.. . what i can say is that i brought my SoCal friends here for a bit of history and chicago pizza.  it was drizzling outside and the manager let us in 45 minutes before they opened, which was quite cool.  we were already inside as the cooks and wait staff were arriving.  he got behind the bar &amp; served us up some pints &amp; drinks (one of which he had to look up the ingredients to, so A for effort).  we had a mini photo session with the deep, dark wooden furniture and giant menus as a backdrop.. . it took FOREVER to get our food, i mean i was practically gnawing on my arm by the time it came out.  our waitress was...okay.  not good, not bad, but nothing i'd overtip for.. . guess if i wasn't here with my friends, i would have been more disappointed.  we did have a lot of laughs.  i took them out for real deep dish the next day.
