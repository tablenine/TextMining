We had a free night and thought that we have a chance to wait and try the tacos.  After we arrived, we read the Tweet that they're going to be an hour later than scheduled.  OK, no problem we weren't in a hurry.  There were about 200 people a head of us and a few people left before the truck arrived.  By the time we ordered, it had been a couple of hours waiting.  We had the short rib tacos and burrito.  The tacos were OK, nice vinagrette dressing, didn't think that the meat had that Korean marinade flavor.  The burrito was worth the trip, love the hash brown in it and was my favorite.  I give it 3 Stars, would have been higher if the meat had more of a Kalbi flavor, not sure if it was an off night.  Don't think that I'll wait 2 hours again, but not bad either...
