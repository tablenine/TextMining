Phoenix is a good place to go to if you want to splurge in Chinatown, or have that special celebration meal.  You'll pay maybe 50% more for the portions here, but food quality and service is also usually very good.  If you can manage to secure a table by the wall-to-wall windows, you will also enjoy, as we did, a magnificent second story view of the downtown Chicago skyline that you can't get anywhere else in Chinatown.  You will also get nearby parking, spaciousness, and cleanliness, not found in many Chinatown restaurants.. . Tonight, the featured dish for us was taro duck.  This was accompanied by various other dishes to compete a family meal - seafood soup, sauteed lobster, beef tenderloin, steamed pike,  mushrooms with peapod leaves, and Chinese fried chicken.  It was all very good - only little complaint might be that they were a little heavy (than what I'm used to) on use of gravy or sauces for the applicable dishes.
