I have just finished a wonderful week in Atlanta where my wife was attending a banking conference.  I went along for the ride to spend  week in the city.  . . One evening we were out looking for a restaurant to dine at and we stumbled upon this place.  After a quick search of the . http://yelp.com.  mobile site and a read of the reviews we decided to give it a try.  . . We couldn't have done better.  My wife dined on the incredibly tender pork loin on the new menu (it was 4 days old when we went) and I tried the shrimp and grits.  Both were spectacular dishes.  In addition to dinner we both ordered a drink and desert and our bill was still under $75.00. . . The decor was urban, classic and modern with exposed beam ceilings, visible ducting and a wonderful copper paneling over the bar.  The lighting was very muted, as was the music, so it was very conducive to a peaceful meal. . . Located in a quiet neighborhood close to midtown Atlanta and the Virginia Highlands area.  It is a little tight for parking, but they do offer free valet parking as an alternative to parking on the street.  . . I would recommend this place to anyone traveling through Atlanta on business or for pleasure.  You will not be disappointed.
