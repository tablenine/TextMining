Hands down, this remains one of my favorite watering holes in town.. . I'm a tequila drinker and this is one of my favorite places to enjoy it. The lucha libre theme, the Mezcal Margaritas, the Dune-esque paper lanterns, the velvet wall paintings, the jukebox, the Mezcal Margaritas, the weeknight dj's, the red leather bar chairs, the Mezcal Margaritas, the fact that it's dark enough for me not to care how nasty the little girl's room is and close enough for me stumble home. . . Did I mention the Mezcal Margaritas?. . All that AND I can get a fish taco?. . Love it!
