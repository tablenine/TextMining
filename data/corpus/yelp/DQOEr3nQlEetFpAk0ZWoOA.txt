I don't really have anything much different to say than the others on here that generally like this place. Food is good, some nights seem better than others. It is cheap and has a good vibe. It is a very good neighborhood staple for us and one that we will frequent. The heads on the wall are a little weird and probably why they did it. (taxidermy no longer there)
