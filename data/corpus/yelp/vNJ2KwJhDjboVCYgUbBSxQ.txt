Ok so folow me and u might have a 4 star experiance too.... . first ....have someone else drop you off or park for something else...I didn't park but I hear its a nightmare..... . Second...come in like I did I was waisting time I whanted to just sit down read a book. text on the cell phone and then order...so I can't really review the service as it was zombie slow but that was what I wanted.... . Food: had a really good Tuscun salad? good greens and chicken tasted good too. I got the Half portion for 8.50 it was a little small for that price it felt..... . and I had a Vanilla Blended drink...unfoutuatly they ran out of the sugar free syrups (yes please message to me how im killing myself with diet stuff) . . oh yeah best bussers that i think ive seen this side of the hill.. . So I recommend this place if you don't have a car and have lots of time...
