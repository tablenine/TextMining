My girlfriend and I went for happy hour. I was a first timer, but she wasn't. Ambiance is good for relaxed conversation, and comfy seats at the bar. I ordered a beer and she had the house red served for happy hour. Good so far. We ordered the jamon serrano flatbread with mozzarella and peppers and onions. Wow! I'm a fan. Even though I was drinking beer, when I tried the grenache with the flatbread, I took her glass! We had peel and eat shrimp as well. Nice, understated house prepared sauce for the shrimp. Just right. Big, perfectly cooked shrimp. Service was spot on, even though the bar filled up in about 2 minutes towards the end of happy hour. I've not had dinner, so I'll review it after I've been. Happy hour was a hit though. Just FYI, the food is full price, the drinks are "happy". Still very reasonable for two people. Give it a try. You'll be glad.
