One of the best meals i have ever eaten, hands down.. Fried ricotta squash blossoms. Bottle of wine. Two pies. and the BEST desert ever, some creme butterscotch custard with rosemary cookies. The salty sweetness of the butterscotch and the uncommon pairing of rosemary/cookies was INCREDIBLE. Everything was top notch, i would eat hear once a week if budget allowed. Â . . I almost took a star away for being so cramped and kind of snobby LAish service but the food is worth it!
