Just to add to the abundance of reviews here... Yes a place open late, I'm not sure when they actually close but we were all there around 12 that night!! ( I miss the late night coney island type places), they were able to take care of our large group of Â hungry yelpers, and the food was good, and the interior is a chic combo of black and reds. I loved the Mongolian chicken ( chicken tossed with green onions etc.. and lots of garlic over rice noodles) This will now be my late night place to go!
