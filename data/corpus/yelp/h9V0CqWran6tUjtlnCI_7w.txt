Restaurant: The Izaka-ya by Katsu-ya
Category: Sushi Bars
This is one of my favorite restaurants in LA. Great food, fast service, fun atmosphere, and cozier than the SBE-owned Katsuya restaurants. It's always busy during dinner so make reservations or go early. . . Try these:. Yellowtail Jalapeno. Albacore w/ Crispy Onion. Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice. Red Snapper w/ Shiso Leaf Sushi. Seared Salmon Sushi. Baked Crab Hand Roll. Rock Shrimp Tempura. . Their lunch specials are also pretty good.
