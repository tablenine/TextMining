To quote the Mayor of Little 5 Points,  "I love this place!". Strong drinks, yummy food, colorful people, and great music!  Almost everyone is a regular and if you're not, chances are you will be after a few minutes.  You'll be treated like family.  Sometimes the red headed step-child, but mostly the favored child!. Monday night is Trivia with Robert Holland.  He will keep you scratching your head as you down your favorite tasty beverage.
