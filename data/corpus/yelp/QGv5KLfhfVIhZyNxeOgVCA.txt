Restaurant: Pizzeria Uno
Category: Pizza
The heavy weight champion of pizzas! Authentic deep dish pizza with the super buttery crust that I long for when a new and disappointing pizzeria opens in SF.. . The wait is ridiculously long but they take your order as you give them your name for the list. Luckily there are shops within walking distance to kill time.. . I always get the Numero Uno with extra cheese, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers all piled to the top. The tomato sauce is tangy and thick. They pile on the sausage and pepperoni but I saw a few chunks of the mushroom and peppers (funny since it's usually the other way around). With one bite all the flavors star bursting and there's a party in your mouth. Other options include bbq chicken and broccoli and spinach. Wash all down with a nice cold beer and move that belt buckle another notch.. . The seating is a little crammed (they have a 4 person table right by the bar). Wooden booths line the wall and tables are scattered throughout.
