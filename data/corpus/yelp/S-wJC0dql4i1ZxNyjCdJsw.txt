The veggie burger was delicious. Was it worth $10? Probably not; but I would still come back for another one.. . Umm... the hand cut fries. I don't know why that is the name for these. They should be called "potato bricks." They are like huge chunks of potatoes. Not my thing; I will try the skinny fries next time.. . The cakester dessert thing... I don't know how much it was I didn't look at the receipt but those things were pretty good.
