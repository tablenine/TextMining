The food was good, but the service was ok. Â I say this because my friend and I came here on a weekday for breakfast and it was only 5 tables filled. There were 2 servers working the tables, yet the service was super slow...Don't get it!!. . I can't imagine how it would be on a weekend when they are packed with a wait of 45-1hour.. . I'm going to try it again, hopefully I'll change my thoughts.
