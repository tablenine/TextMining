Hidden in Downtown LA, there isn't much around this spot. The outside doesn't look like what it would be on the inside. It's actually pretty big back there. . . They do have a lot of choices of what types of sausages to get. I ordered the Austin Blues, made of spicy pork. It was alright, honestly nothing special. What really caught my attention was the beer selection and ambience, oh and the sauces. Pesto mayo? Hello.
