I have had a change of heart- partially.  I was initially really angry when they switched from BYOB.  I went there quite often and the non-byob kinda ruined the experience for me.  To be fair I love the pizza, I just hate when something that I love changes.  I would also love if they had a better beer selection, just 5 well chosen micros would make it a lot better, and somewhat restore the heyday of Three Floyd's 6 packs.
