Half of on Bottle Monday!  (decent selection of wine) . . The ambiance was nice.  The service was good.  But the FOOD is excellent!  The Mac &amp; Cheese everybody raved, the seared pork tenderloin was amazing, and the braised short rib was good portion.  . . And the dessert was... see the picture.
