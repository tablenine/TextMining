What a fun place. I was driving around looking for a place to eat and came across The Vortex. I had The Great Big Jerk Burger with a side of fries; it really was great and big. Our waitress was friendly and kept checking on us to make sure we were happy. I could only finish half my burger and even less of the fries but I do plan to go back and try a hot sandwich.
