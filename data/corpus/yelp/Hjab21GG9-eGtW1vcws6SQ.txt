Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Part of the appeal to Griddle Cafe is it's location and the fact that celebrity sightings are likely (we've seen Adam Brody and Eve from America's Next Top Model).  The first time we went, Casey got blueberry pancakes and I got banana.  The pancakes come in HUGE portions - about 3 pancakes that are almost a food wide.  I ate like 1/10th of the pancakes.  The second time we tried the egg entries, which were good as well.  If you want pancakes, I'd recommend sharing, no matter how big your appetite is.. . The service isn't that great, since this place is SO busy.  The wait is usually at least 30 minutes on a weekend morning.  But I'd recommend it for the experience!
