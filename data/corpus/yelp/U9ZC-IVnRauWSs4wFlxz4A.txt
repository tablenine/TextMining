This place is out of the way (being knee deep in Little Tokyo). There's never any parking around. There's always a long wait for a spot - even at the counter. It's not very pretty inside. But I love this place! The ramen is so oh-ish-shi ("delicious" to you gai-jin)! The soup is the perfect combination of tang and saltiness. The noodles are firm, but are soft enough to melt once in your mouth. And the pork cutlets. Oh how sublime are these pork cutlets.... . Okay. I'm getting a little creepy here. But this place is good. Like, TAMPOPO good. Check it out if after a show at the Ahmanson or the Dorothy Chandler.. . Arigato, Mr. Po-tah-toh.
