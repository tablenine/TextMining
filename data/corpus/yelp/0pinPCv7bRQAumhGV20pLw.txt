Be prepared to starve yourself for a day before going to Fogo de Chao because you will want to have enough room in your stomach to try everything.  One mistake I made was accepted everything that came by.  By the time I got to some of the meat, they were already cold.  I recommend getting a piece from the server, and turn the green/red coaster to red until you finish the meat in front of you so that you will always get hot meat.  . . My personal favorite meat is the Picanha.  It has a little fatty meat on it and it is always served with a burnt layer on top.  Once a slice has been made all around, the server will go back and get the outsider heated again so the fatty area gets a little burnt.  . . There are tons of small dishes placed all over the table.  Once you finish a dish, the server will bring out another dish.  I feel that it is a waste when they take away a dish with some food still on it.  The service is excellent.  My drink was always full and the servers are quick to bring you more meat.  The service is so good it sometimes feel overwhelming.  They will serve your table until your entire table has their coaster turned to red.  The atmosphere is great and I love the private room with all the wine bottles on the wall.  I rate it 4 stars because of the expensive price.
