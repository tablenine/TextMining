Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I don't eat hot dogs--I love meat, just not in dog form.  I've taken one for the team &amp; stood in line @ Pink's many a night--once even dozing off in line.  They get only 2 stars because the non-dog items are horrid--the burgers are soggy and small and the fries make McDonald's taste like a 5-star meal.  No hate meant to the dog lovers, just a friendly warning not to get fancy; don't order anything else but a frank.
