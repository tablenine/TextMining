Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Dear Pinks,. . You are an LA Establishment I recommend every Angelino and tourist to visit at least once. There is a charm, an allure about waiting in Hollywood to get a hot dog. But not just any regular hot dog, Pinks Hot Dig's have a little more spunk as they are named after famous celebrities and made in unique ways like in a burrito or covered in salami.. . They also carry bubble up! No one carries bubble up, you know the good sodas. I can say Pinks is one magical... Hell I can't go on with this, YOUR LINE IS TOO DAMN LONG. Seriously people, its a hot dog, I know its good, but I'm not going to wait 1+ hour in line for a friggen hot dog.. . I know Pinks is making money hand over fist, is there any way you can make your lines move faster? Lets also talk about parking, wait, there isn't any, good luck finding a spot. So you finally endured a long wait or unless you are lucky and hit an off hour, not so long wait, you enter the dining room (if you can call it a dining room) packed with very little room to eat. Forget about bringing a big group.. . Fix the lines, I'll come back with friends and tourists in tow.. . -Ed
