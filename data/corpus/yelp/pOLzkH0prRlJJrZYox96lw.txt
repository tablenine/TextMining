Restaurant: The Grey Dog&#39;s Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
The place is dark, it feels like a bar/pub... that serves coffee? The coffee is decent at best. They do have a really interesting art exhibit on display right now.. Maybe I walked in with expectations too high.... Didn't try the food but I'd go back to try it.
