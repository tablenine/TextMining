Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would give them 10.. I had to wait in line to be seated (they do have take out, though) but it wasn't for long. I had the most delicious plate of enchiladas. . My boyfriend said that you can always judge a Mexican restaurant by its rice and beans (just as you can judge an American or Italian restaurant by its bread). Everything was exceptional. Veeerrrrry filling-- we both had to get "to go" boxes (a first for my boyfriend) and even better the next day.. Some people are uneasy about being in EastLos, but every one is different. Personally, I felt at ease with the area. And the drive is totally worth it!
