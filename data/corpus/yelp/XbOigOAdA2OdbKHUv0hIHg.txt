So I went there for a business lunch. The first impression by the hostess was great. I was about 20 minutes early and she immediately sat me instead of my having to wait on a bench. Asked if I wanted anything to drink, I got it. Everything was great,, for a while.... . ...fast forward 20 minutes. Asking the waitress here opinion was useless. As neither myself of my associate had ever been there, we asked for suggestions for appetizers, etc. She was woefully uneducated. So we just ordered what seemed like a good idea.. . We were NEVER asked if we wanted something to drink aside from when I initially sat down. We had the mozarella and pruscioutto combo as well as the grilled vegetables for appetizers. They were pretty good.. . Then we ordered our pizza. I have no idea how this was managed, but somehow our pizza crust was soggy!  After reading all the accolades and the press releases on the wall, we were really looking forward to a superior pizza and found it to be on par with Domino's.  For $50 for lunch in Ravenswood, this should have been a superior meal. Unfortunately, it was one of the more disappointing ones I have experienced in Chicago..
