Great place. One of my favorite places to go in the area. I always order the salt &amp; pepper shrimp. Interestingly, their black bean sauce is the best I've tasted. The stir-fried pea sprouts are also good, and the house special beef is delicious. The crab and lobster dishes look and taste good too. The best part about this place is that they have a late lunch and Â the lunch specials are excellent - mostly in the $4 range and the portions are big. . . It's a popular place, but small, so go early or late if you don't want to wait in line. Otherwise, you're going to be behind a whole lot of people during the middle of lunch or dinner hours.. . Update 5/28/08: the lunch prices are now $5-6 per dish. The food is still good.
