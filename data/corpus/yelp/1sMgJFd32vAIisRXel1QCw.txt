On the recommendations of everyone, the BF and I came to eat some of Nemo's buddies.  Everything raw on the sashimi plate was some variation of tuna.  They had some good stuff, and the amount of food you get will fill you up.  However, the toro I was given was horrible - didn't-even-finish-it-bad!  BF ordered the sashimi again (he first had a pricey box of rice and fresh eel).  The second time around, the toro was much better - you could see a HUGE color/quality difference, which makes me wonder why his toro was ten times better than mine.. . Lunch special for a full plate of sashimi is $15.  It's an EXCELLENT deal considering the abundance and freshness of the fish.  But then you factor in tax/tip and parking ($1.50 validated), and your LUNCH comes out to much more than what I would consider to be a "value meal."  If it was mind-blowingly good (Toros in Alhambra anyone?), I would be back and maybe splurge for dinner.  But as it was not, I'll stick to Fish-o-Filet Fridays for my Omega-3s.
