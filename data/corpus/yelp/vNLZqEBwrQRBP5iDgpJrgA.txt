I am a nice little Midwestern girl who loves her steak and potatoes, so a colleague of mine to me to Ted's on a recent business trip to Atlanta.  He said that he eats there practically every night he works in Atlanta.  Every night?  How good could it possibly be? . . Outstanding.  Who woulda thunk that a Bison filet could really be that much better than beef?  It is just a bit richer and a little saltier, but there is something about it that made me come back two days later to try a Bison Burger.  The creamed spinach was the best I have ever eaten, and the wine/beer list was decent.  . . The service was actually great.  There must be something to that whole "Southern Hospitality" thing everyone always told me about, because everyone at Ted's was super friendly and accommodating.  . . I guarantee that every time I work in Atlanta, I will eat AT LEAST one meal at Ted's.
