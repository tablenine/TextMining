Restaurant: Moody&#39;s Pub
Category: Pubs
If you find yourself up in this neighborhood check out Moody's.  It had been a long time since my last visit to Moody's, but I recently stopped in to have a beer and burger and it was great.. . When you enter Moody's it's really dark and has that English Pub feel.  During the winter months this is great because they have fireplaces and with the tables being relatively close to each other it makes it a nice venue to get away from the cold.  . . On the other hand, during the warm months they have a large two tier beer garden, which I would say is one of the best in the city.  The beer garden has trees growing it and has plenty of tables to accommodate a fairly large crowd.  When you go at night you get the full affects of the space, they have xmas lights that keeps the lighting dim which is distinctly similar to the ambiance found inside the pub.  It's a nice comfortable spot to go with your friends to chill and drink to another Chicago summer.. . They are known for their burgers and they are very good.  You can tell that they figured something out and are sharing it with their patrons(I appreciate them for doing that).  The service is also very good,  the waitress I had last time was great and kept us well fed and kept full beers on the table.. . I think I will be making a few more visits to Moody's pub this summer and you should as well.
