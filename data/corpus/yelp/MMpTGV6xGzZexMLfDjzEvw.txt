I have to admit, I totally judged this place when I walked in with my group, and saw a sea of your typical Lakeview/Lincoln Park restaurant goer.  I really thought it wasn't going to be good at all, like some Uncle Julio's Hacienda BS (you know what I'm talking about).  I didn't think it would come close to being authentic.  But I was wrong!  And sorry for judging!. . I eat a lot of Mexican food, and from all over this city, and I would say this place is actually quite authentic and quite delicious.  I ordered a combination plate (La Fabulosa... hahaha) as I couldn't decide, and it had a little bit of everything I was craving.  Man, it was good.  I can honestly say it was the first good chile relleno I ever had.  It also came with a flauta, which again was very tasty and not dry like at many places.  The skirt steak was well cooked and had pretty good flavor, and the rice and beans were as good as it gets.. . I did not get a margarita, and was basically the only sober person at my table at the end of the meal, but I hear they are good.. . It maybe is a liiittle pricey, but not totally unreasonable, and what do you expect from the area?  This is no corner taqueria, you aren't going to get taqueria prices.  Anyway, I'm really pleased with this place and am excited to head back...
