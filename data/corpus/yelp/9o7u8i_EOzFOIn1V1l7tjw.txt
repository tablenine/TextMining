Restaurant: MF Sushibar
Category: Sushi Bars
I hate to be a sushi snob, but, I also hate to see nice people getting overchared for mediocrity.  . . And so I'll say it:  . . MF Sushi serves Whole Foods quality sushi at Nobu prices in a setting so blatantly blandly "upscale contemporary" that I actually looked around to see if it was attached to the lobby of a Marriott.  . . I gave them four stars for the breadth of their menu, and took away one star for their prices. A restaurant with decent but uninteresting decor, sufficient but unwowing service, and acceptable but ungreat food really shouldn't be able to get away with charging 1.5 times the bill you'd have at an average respected sushi restaurant in San Francisco, Vancouver or New York.  . . They lost the other star when all of the sushi was decidedly warm. If you're lucky, you've gone through your whole life without eating warm avocado on rice. If you've ever been served warm ikura (gigantic salmon eggs), well, maybe we can join the same support group. And picket along Ponce until MF Sushi buys a fridge.
