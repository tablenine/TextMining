Sweet outdoor seating. I like the small bamboos surrounding the premise. How nice of them to include the veggie burger in their menu. It was okay, but not really surprising since this place evidently appeals more to the meat lover. I wanted to try their ube shake, but there was no ube left! Sadface.
