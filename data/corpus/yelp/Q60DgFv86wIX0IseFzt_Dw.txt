I love this place. It's like our "Cheers"!! The service is awesome because Michael Marco Tommy and the whole freakin staff rock, and the people watching is amazing. Not to mention the kick ass rock shows they have there often. . . It depends on what your cup of tea is. If you're offended easily or by tattoos and midtowns more artistic and dark socialites then don't bother but if you're down for some good strong drinks, tater tots with chilly and cheese, and just a chill dark bar then you're in the right place.
