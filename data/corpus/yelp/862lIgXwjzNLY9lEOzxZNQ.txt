Why are American's not allowed to go to Cuba when their food is so good?  It's a crime against humanity I tell you!  Well do the next best thing to visiting Cuba and visit Porto's.  At first you'll think you're in the customs line in a Cuban airport, because it's basically a giant wall of people and it's loud and you have no idea what's going on.  Pretty soon, you'll discover the cryptic menu which doesn't have all the items on it.  Eventually, you'll get to order, but whatever you order, do not fear.  It will be wonderful.. . I recommend the potato balls and any combination of garlic and pork that you can find on the menu.  The sandwiches are cheap and so good.  They also have some sort of weird chip thing (I think they're fried pantanes) you can order with garlic sauce.  They should win the Nobel peace prize for that one.. . They also happen to have wonderful cakes and pastries which are also amazing - guys, chicks LOVE this stuff.  If you get into a fight with a girl, bring home some Porto's cake / pastry and watch the magic.  It's like a get out of the doghouse free card.  I can't think of something here I don't like.  And ya know what?  They have great coffee too.. . Parking's a nightmare, try on the street or the lot behind.  Good luck.  They close early around 7pm, so if you want to eat dinner, come directly after work and get it to go.
