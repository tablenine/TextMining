Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I had been wanting to go to Umami Burger since I saw it featured on the Food Network.  I went on a Sunday night and the wait was about 30 minutes.  Not too long, but it was chilly and the place is tiny, so there is no room to wait inside. . . I was seated at the counter and ordered an Umami burger and thick-cut fries.  The server seemed like he wanted to be anywhere else, but there and the counter was weird- you faced the wall with wood paneling and nothing else to look at unless you turned around.. .  The food arrived and it was between good and great.  Portion of the burger was on the small side, but very flavorful with a sun-dried tomato and mushroom. The burger was cooked great- on the rare side- and it was very juicy!  I also liked that they toasted the bun. The fries were also really good- they reminded me of fries you get at the fair.  :)  . . When I asked about dessert, the server mentioned two with ice-cream and then said "And, we have a gross cookie".  What? Really? Basically, it was a cookie he thought was dry and so he didn't want to recommend it to anyone.  Good to know! I passed on dessert. . . Overall, a fun experience, but I'm not really in a big hurry to go back anytime soon.  I didn't leave with that "WOW" feeling.
