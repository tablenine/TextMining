Restaurant: El Tesoro
Category: Mexican
The experience my boyfriend and I had at El Tesoro was remarkably underwhelming. I'll get to the food poisoning later, but let's start with the service. What appeared to be a relatively slow night we saw our server maybe once every 20 minutes. Other servers came to our aid and when we wanted to leave we had to finally go track our server down for the check ourselves. We ordered chips and salsa with the two salsas being pretty bland for the price they were charging. We both had pork dishes, my boyfriend getting the pork chimichanga and I went with the torta, both being not any better than the local tex-mex chain... but twice the price. However, about 2 hours after getting home my boyfriend revisited his pork dish for the next 6 or so hours and is still currently suffering from the symptoms of food poisoning as I write this review.
