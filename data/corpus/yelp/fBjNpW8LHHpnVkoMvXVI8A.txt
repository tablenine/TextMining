They got the "worst chooch" but some of the tastiest hotdogs by far in the LA region (ok, that was cheesy). . In a nutshell:. -/+ location is tricky . - the line sucked (i believe it was an 1.5-2 hr wait) but an employee kept coming out to hand out the menu and answer any questions people might have . + THE FOOD:. 1. Gator w/ spicy peppers and onions: wasn't my type of  "dog" since the case was a little too thick for me (we were warned) but it was flavorful. 2. Rabbit with white wine: I was able to get a taste of it from my friend's order, and it was delicious! Juicy, flavorful, tender om nom nom goodness.. 3. Mango Jalapeno: nothing really special. I mean, it was good. But not as good as the exotics. . 4. Duck: MY FAVORITE! Flavorful, tender, yum yum in my tum tum.. 5. Belgian fries... crunchy outside, soft inside. Not sold on the Peanut sauce or the sweet and sassy sauce but the fries with their honey mustard is straight money. 6. HONEY MUSTARD: anything with their honey mustard was straight money. If there weren't any cameras, I probably would of copped a bottle.. 7. Hefenweissen (spellcheck please) beer: YUM YUM YUM. Was a great reward for that long wait. I also recommend the ginger beers. Or if on a budget, the water is ice cold and served free!. . I'm definitely a fan of this place... Pinks is no longer the golden joint for LA hotdogs. sorry.
