as most of my reviews indicate, i am a fancy fancy lady ( yes, 2 fancies) and this place was perfectly fancy for me. I thoroughly enjoyed having my plastic bib tied for me, eating out of huge steaming plastic bags and using no cutlery. the excess garlic and spice was to my liking, the squirting slippery crawfish and shrimp were just dangerous and messy enough to inspire my eating partner to wipe my whole face with the  provided full roll of paper towels. the seating was super cozy. i splashed our neighbors with beer and they fed us their oysters and sweet potato fries.   we obliterated 2 bags of deliciousness, 2 oyster platters, and a few  fistful of beers. a very successful night. parking is a struggle on the streets, waiting for a table can be aggravating if most of your party is fashionably late because they'll only seat when you're 1 under, but won't seat extras. i resolved this situation by punching the late party in the boob.
