Why has this place got a parking lot? Does anyone leave here sober enough to drive? ICH DON'T THINK SO.. . Pardon me then Lola, when I drink too many of your Garlic Mash Potato Martinis and spend the night on your chaise lounge. It's not my fault! Yelpers sent me here! They were right - you do rule.. . Please get better fries and don't charge so much for burgers. And please get me another great martini, and an ambulance home. Thanks!
