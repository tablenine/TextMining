3.5 star is what I would really give this place if I could.. . First of all, the food here looks Taiwanese but the taste does not quite come close.  It is good enough only because Taiwan is thousands of miles away.  Their sausages, however, are pretty descent.  The services here are, how should I say this, "efficient?"  Friendly enough, though.  Somehow I just always feel I need to know what I am ordering before entering the place, or else they'll just move on to the next person....
