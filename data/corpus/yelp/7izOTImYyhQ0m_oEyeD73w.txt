Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
I've only been to Ford's Filling Station twice...once for breakfast and once for dinner. I had their corned beef hash for breakfast and was pretty disappointed. I was expecting a really hearty breakfast but was presented with a mushy sad excuse for one of my all time favorite dishes. my boyfriend had some sort of curried eggs benedict, definitely more delicious than my plate.. . the pros from dinner: lobster chowder. the cons: cream puffs (kind of dry...the toblerone ice cream was good though). . dinner was pretty a little overpriced. the drinks were meh and not strong (booo!!!) this place is probably much better for brunch/lunch than dinner.
