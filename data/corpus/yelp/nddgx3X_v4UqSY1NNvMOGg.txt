Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I think this place is soooo overrated, especially considering how plain the hotdog is and the Lines, ouch.... people do lines up for a plain hot dog that you can make your own... how crazy is that? I guess peeps who went there expect to meet celebrities, but no no, celebrities have their own chef to make their hot dogs... :) I don't know but I think people just went there so that they can tell their friends they've been to Pinks :) the one featured on Food Network or something :) I think this place is totally not worth to eat, you can show your guests the place, but not eating there, even Wienerschnitzel is better :P (wait... do I spell it rite? :) )
