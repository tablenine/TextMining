YES YES YES to "elitist burger joint from hell" comment below. Â They should pay YOU to stand in line, roam around waiting for a table, then rushing to it and hope you beat everyone else in the same situation, have people eyeballing you the whole time you're eating because THEY want your table...are we having fun yet????
