Restaurant: El Barco
Category: Mexican
Very nice find in the city.  Fun, bright atmosphere with seafood served in ways that make it fun to enjoy dinner.  El Barco is casual, very reasonably-priced, yet makes you feel like you're on the Mexican coast eating the catch-of-the-day.  I highly recommend this if you're looking for a very reasonably priced, yet outstanding fun new restaurant.  Go with friends and enjoy a great atmosphere and outstanding food.  Service was not the best, but it didn't matter.  We were in no rush because this place is just fun.
