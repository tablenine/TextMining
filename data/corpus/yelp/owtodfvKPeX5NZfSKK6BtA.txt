Category: Bakeries
My husband has raved about Canter's so we stopped for take out yesterday. I preface this by saying I grew up in NY/NJ so I am a deli snob. . . I ordered 2 corned beef sandwiches and 2 knishes. $40? The knishes were not good. I prefer a different outside dough. . The pickles were interesting, one was really garlicy and awesome, but the other tasted icky.. I also got rugalach and other cookies. They were enjoyable, but again...$40?. . $80 spent, got to hear some of the waitresses bitching about the dining room customers, and ate some average deli. . . I'll be in NY next month...YUMMMM!
