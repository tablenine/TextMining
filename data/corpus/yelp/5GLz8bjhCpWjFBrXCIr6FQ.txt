The best thing about this place is the freshly-made guacamole. It's amazing. That's the only reason I went back a second time. . . The food is overpriced and NOT tasty. I wouldn't recommend going there unless you love guacamole like me. Just be warned, it will run you about $12....but so worth it!!
