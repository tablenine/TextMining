Restaurant: Five Guys Famous Burgers and Fries
Category: Burgers
Not sure what all the hype is about. I like real beef burgers, with some heft, and at least a little pink. Not quite sure how this glorified Burger King became so famous, but it did. I've heard from many people that Five Guys used to be a good place to eat, unfortunately, from a fresh perspective, it is just full of suck now. . . If you want a good burger there are way too many other excellent choices Atlanta. If you are sick of Burger King and need to mix it up, come here.
