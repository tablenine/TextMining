This is over-hyped for sure.  . . Decor - The glass walkway over the fish tank is really cool, but as a girl who wears stilettos, a bit scary.  The restaurant overall is pretty, but its pretty typical of LA restaurants.  In fact, the fans that they have on the ceilings are the same that you find in any Claim Jumper restaurant.. . Food - Ehh.  I admit, the crab was awesome.  A full Dungeness crab is always tasty, and the secret "garlic sauce" really improved the crab.  This is the reason I am giving the restaurant a 3 instead of a 2.  The garlic noodles, however, were not heaven-like, the way everyone described.  It tastes like chow mein with some soy sauce, garlic, sugar, sesame or peanut oil, and maybe some hoisin or oyster sauce.  If you're Asian, this isn't anything new.  In fact it isn't that its not even new, but its that its not even particularly tasty.  Its like chow mein.... . On top of that, if you order the crab, you have to order a side of the garlic noodles, which was an additional $13.  $13 for garlicky chow mein????
