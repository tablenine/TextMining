Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Just tried out this place for the first time a few days ago. I ordered 2 lbs of Crawfish, 2 soft drinks, and an order of Catfish and Cajun fries. Â I paid about $35 for 2 people total. This was my first experience with this type of seafood, and I must say it was an enjoyable one! No utensils, just your hands and some limes! . . Crawfish was tasty (whole shebang sauce), catfish tasted of high quality, and I must say the Cajun fries did not meet my expectations. They were just normal fries topped with some seasoning. I also got the corn and sausages, which turned out to be pretty good.. . Overall, a great experience. Everyone should come here to try it out at least once, even if you don't like seafood! It's a unique experience! Oh, and come early unless you feel like waiting for 1 hour or more.
