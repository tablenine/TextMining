MMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm............tapas!. There wasn't a tapa in the place that I didn't LOVE.  . The Asparagus had the most delicious miso mustard sauce I've ever had.. Loved the pumpkin ravioli in sage sauce (and I don't usually enjoy sage). . We got there half hour before they opened because we didn't know they had 'winter hours' but they welcomed us in and hooked us up with menu's and water and let us chill until they officially opened.  Sweet people, lovely service, they helped us choose the right amount of food and then made it a point to get our names and call us by name when speaking to us.  LOVE that.. . I heart Mana!
