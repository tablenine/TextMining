This is the BEST thing about L.A.!!! Their coffee presses are absurd - I challenge you to caffeine crash after drinking an entire one! You won't. I don't know why - it's just plain ol' magic. All of the pancakes are obscenely delicious but I recommend The Golden Ticket. They'll serve you enough to eat for three days, I shit you not. If you're not in the sweets, get the eggs benedict. They're served on crispy potatoes!!! WHA?! (It's true.) So good. Go before your hunger kicks in full-swing cos it's full everyday of the week.
