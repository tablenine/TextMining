Party of 8. Told us to order way too much food - - one starter, one main course and one side per person is ridiculous! Spilled a tray of drinks on one member of our party. Veal sweetbreads were too large, not crispy, and mediocre. Rabbit tortellini and jelly doughnuts were amazing. It was uncomfortable to have to pass dishes around such a large table.
