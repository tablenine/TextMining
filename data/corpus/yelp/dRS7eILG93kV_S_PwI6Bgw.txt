I wish this place was closer to my house, b/c I would eat here constantly.  I love the food and the atmosphere.... the dolmas are great, I can't think of anything that I don't like on the menu.  I buy tons of stuff to take home and it's always great.  Weekends are a bit crazy, you can barely get a table but it's nice to find a place in LA where families go.  Definitively check it out, you'll be glad you did!  And the staff has been there forever!  Papa Cristo is doing a great job!
