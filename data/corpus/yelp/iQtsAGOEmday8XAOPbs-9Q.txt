First the food - I had chorizo brussel sprouts and tilapia.  The brussel sprouts were delicious; this could be an addicting food if more widely available.  The tilapia was on the salty side, but had a great presentation as a "deconstructed" fish sandwich.  . . This place fails in pricing.  Everything is just $1-2 too much for what you get.  I value high quality ingredients, but I also want to feel I'm getting a good value for the cost.
