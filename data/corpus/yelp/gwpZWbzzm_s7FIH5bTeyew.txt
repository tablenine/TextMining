Restaurant: Versailles Restaurant
Category: Cuban
There's a reason I will never be rail thin and that same reason is why I will never be a vegetarian despite my conscience telling me other wise. That reason, my friends, is a lil' Cuban restaurant chain called "Versailles". I go here often and I remember the first time coming here (and second, third, etc.) that I ordered the pork, took one look at the plate and thought to myself, well that will take about a month to work off, then dove right in and did not regret a thing. If red meat could be a tangible ecstasy, it would be the stuff that they make here. No joke.
