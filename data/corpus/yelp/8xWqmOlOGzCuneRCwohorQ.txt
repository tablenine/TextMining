Restaurant: Mr. Pizza
Category: Pizza
This is my take on this place.... I was first introduced to this place, 1. because i lived close and 2. the somewhat closest thing to pizza in Korea.. I took my husband here for a late dinner. . We arrived there about 30mins before closing. We all know servers become agitated with "late walk-ins." However, we were seated and served with kindness. Needless to say, the service was great!. We got Garlic Potato Skin for an appetizer and Potato Gold for the pizza. (I swear the pizza used to taste better a few years back...hmph..). Any whos, the potato skin was okay...I would have to say, the slices of garlic on the potato completely threw me off (warning for whoever doesn't like eating baked/raw garlic!!) . All I tasted was cheese and garlic slices...not really what I expect from potato skin...Where's the saltiness and the bacon? =/. The pizza...needless to say...LOVE the sweet potato stuffed crust. (I know what you must be thinking..."Gross...sweet potato + pizza?" my husband thought the same thing!) Once you get a taste of that pizza/dessert in one, you may make this place your regular.. Although its a bit pricey than dominos (you def won't be eating this every night), it is quite worth the trip to K-town and $50 for a meal that, for me, is virtually thousands of miles away.
