Restaurant: Griddle Café
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This weekend was my 4th trip from "the OC" up to Hollywood to indulge in the Griddle Cafe.  My first point is that the food here is always excellent, although the supposedly fresh squeezed orange juice tasted a bit unfresh.  The coffee is great.  The pancakes are superb.  But the hour wait to be seated and the hour wait for the food once we were seated was unbearable.  And of course I forgot my leftovers on the table when we left which added insult to injury.  The restaurant is still highly recommended although try not to show up at 11 am like we did because the wait is long.
