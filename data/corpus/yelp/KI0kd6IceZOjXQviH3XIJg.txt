Category: Steakhouses
Came here for a dinner on a saturday night, and it was a busy night. . . I'm not a big steak fan, but when you're at a steakhouse, it's probably best to order what they're known for. Ordered the Bone-In Filet, and what I got was tasty meaty goodness. The steak was juicy and full of flavor. As far as sides go, you should know that you order separately and that theyre for the entire table (so each side is good for about 4-6 people). Everybody raves about the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, and they're right, it's pretty dang good. What they haven't told you is that it costs 3x as much as the other sides! . . All in all it was a great experience, with great food, and great service (our waitress literally waited to make sure we approved of our food). The ambiance is nice, dark and somewhat intimate. . . I will be back again Maestro's!
