Restaurant: May Street Market
Category: American (New)
Such a disappointment!  I had been waiting over a year to try May Street Market.  When dinner with a group of friends presented itself, I immediately suggested May Street Market.  The service was ok - the waiter was a little over attentive though bordering on annoying.  The appetizers/salads were all good but nothing memorable.  The entrees are where May Street lost me.  Everyone ordered favorite dishes ranging from steak, jumbalaya, fish, etc.  No one enjoyed their entree.  Either the meat or fish was overcooked, the food had no flavor, or the sides were larger than the protein.  I had high hopes for this place, but it did not live up to them at all.
