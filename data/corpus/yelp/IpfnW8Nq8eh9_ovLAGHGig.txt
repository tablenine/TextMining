Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Went here for Sunday brunch based on a friend's recommendation. I was surprised that there wasn't a wait especially given that Retro on Roscoe was that weekend, but that's good thing.. . The menu was full of interesting dishes, and I ended up trying the crab benedict while my friend went the LA route and tried the chicken and waffles. Both were really tasty and delicious. Add their amazing coffee and you have an awesome brunch meal.. . Recommended!
