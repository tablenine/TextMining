Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
Talk about a really good French and Italian fusion restaurant. The openness of the restaurant gives it a very Mediterranean feel and the decor is very Frenchy ! The quality of the food is great and the presentation is even better. The only drawback is the slow service and lackadaisical employees!
