I'm a little ambivalent about this place.  Normally I'd be all over a place that combines high-oil golden brown goodness with high-sugar carb goodness into one convenient place setting.  And yet I always leave here feeling a little empty...ironic, given that empty is the last thing my aorta is after eating here.  Don't get me wrong, the food is nice - the chicken is pleasant, and the waffles are fantastico.  I think it's the price that keeps this place out of the 4-star range for me.  10 bucks feels 2-3 dollars too much for fried chicken and waffles.  Would I stop here if I drove by while hungry?  Or even not hungry but was feeling like a pig?  Probably not, simply b/c 10+ bucks for a quick fix of fat seems too rich for my taste...
