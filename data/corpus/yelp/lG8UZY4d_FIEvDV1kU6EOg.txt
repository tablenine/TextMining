We came during dinner time with no reservation. Even though the place was packed, they managed to sit us within 15 minutes near the piano player like we requested. . . Our food was brought to us in a reasonable time and it was delicious. The crab and garlic noodles are some of the best I've had. The ambiance and piano music greatly complimented the experience.. . There were only three minor gripes that I had. First, the noise level was high enough to prevent me from hearing the piano music clearly. Second, the prices seem a bit high. Third, the food is very oily and fattening. Other than that, its a solid 5 stars. . . I highly recommend this great restaurant.
