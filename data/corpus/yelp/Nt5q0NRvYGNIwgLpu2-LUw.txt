Restaurant: Comme Ca
Category: French
The evening was great from beginning to end from my experience at Comme Ca.. . First of all, my bf and I were on the way to Comme Ca and Â my friend called me and asked me what I was doing. I told her I'm on the way to get French food. Then, she asked me "What are you getting?" I said burger and fries. Then , she said "What! How is that French food?" Of course my argument was frites is pretty damn French if you tell me. She said I think you should try escargots. Hmmm, me thinking to myself "SNAILS?!" I get off the phone with her and of course the bf says "Let's try escargots!". . . When we got there, street parking was very easy to find and no coins needed for the meter after 6pm on a Friday night. We were 30 minutes early for our 6:45pm reservation, and the hostess had no problem seating us early. . . We got the escargots appetizer. Those snails were actually pretty tasty. We also both ordered the burger and fries. The burger was perfectly seasoned and cooked at medium rare. The fries were awesome with the mayo sauce that went with them. . . Our waiter was awesome and the decor looked great. I will definitely come back here again.
