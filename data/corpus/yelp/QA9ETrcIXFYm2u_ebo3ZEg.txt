Food makes me happy. If it makes you happy too then this is the place for you.. . I believe in self control but sometimes there are things in this world that make you cut loose and say f*k it. I've had this feeling every time I come here. You want me to tell you why? . . Ube Shake ( don't question it just do it ). . Pulled Pork Sandwich ( go with me on this add a few bites of those hot yellow peppers and you will find foodie bliss ). . Garlic Aioli on their Belgium fries. . Also I just tried their Cheeseburger yesterday with Sharp cheddar and avocado and I have to say it was pretty darn good. My man had a big ol helping of their Royale with Cheese (pastrami, burger, chili and cheese on a bun). Â I subjected us to this yesterday because I wanted to dine outdoors and enjoy the beautiful 80 January weather. Love it.
