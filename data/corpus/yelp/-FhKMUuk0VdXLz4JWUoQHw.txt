So I've never had corned beef before and this was my first.  From a friend's recommendation, I ordered the Reuben.  It was definitely different ... and the portion was HUGE!  I wound up pulling all the excess meat out of my sandwich, I could've made 2 more sandwiches with it!. . The servers were friendly.  The man making the sandwiches asked my bf if we were sharing and when we told him no he exclaimed "I was gonna give you extra meat but forget it now!"  He was quite the joker, flirting with all the ladies in line.. . The potato pancakes were the highlight of my meal.  I enjoyed that way more than my sandwich.. . I guess to really savor the quality of the sandwiches at Manny's, I'd have to try a mediocre corned beef sandwich before heading there.  I'll definitely give it a try again, after I've had a taste of others.. . Also, it's pretty pricey there for a sandwich.  Our bill was almost $40 for 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks!  Ooh, I loved the fact that they have a parking lot in the back and FREE valet.
