You know I understand why some people don't like the garlic chicken. It can be a little dry at times and it can be a little sour. But that's what makes it good!  The very first time I didn't really care for the garlic chicken because of how sour the sauce was. But after trying it a few times, I converted over to the dark side. I actually get extra sauce. I love their garlic chicken, but the garlic pork is even better. Mouthwatering.  That could be because of how sour it is, but it is really good.  The meat is so moist and full of flavor. Plus you have to try the sangria. Delish!. . Several years back, I saw Jim Belushi at the La Cienaga location and I saw Cameron Diaz at the venice location.
