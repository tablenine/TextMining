This is my new favorite place to eat.  We went there for one of my roommate's Birthday Brunch this past weekend.  It's her favorite spot for her favorite meal of the day (brunch) and I can see why!  We all had a hard time deciding on our dish (our server was very nice and patient - he had to deal with 16 of us) and were impressed by the healthy and organic options.  I had the opportunity to eat 3 different brunch items between myself and 2 friends and each was SOOOO delicious and SOOOO unique!   I had the Chipotle Corn Pancakes, which is 2 corn pancakes with eggs, salsa, black beans and sour cream - so yum, and filling!  The bf had the Peanut Butter French Toast - that's peanut butter smothered in between if you look at the pictures, and the French part of the toast is a bran flake coating!!!  My other roommate had the Sweet Potato Pancakes and they are SWEET!!!!!  As we left, we were greeted with gigantic snow flakes falling all around us!!!  It was as magical as what we had found inside!  I can't wait to go back and do it all over again!
