ohai Milk.. . I like your ice creams, especially the watermelon and hazelnut.  I like your blue velvet too, even though it's too sweet to be good for my waistline and left my teeth stained like Violet Beauregarde.  Your marketing ploy to sell those mini red velvet cupcakes for 75 cents each is pretty genius, but I was disappointed by the dryness :(  And for some reason, it was pretty funny seeing you using the same kind of milk that I use... With a place called "Milk," I thought for a couple seconds that you'd have your special cows or something.  Ha, ha.
