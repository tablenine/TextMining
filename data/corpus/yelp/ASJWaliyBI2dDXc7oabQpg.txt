Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
I am predisposed to like 24-hour diners, but this one didn't do it for me. The coffee was cold, the grits were bordering on disgusting, and the toast was somehow too buttery (margarine-y?) even for ME, the queen of dairy product consumption. Â There weren't even any plugs so I could park myself there for awhile with laptop. The service was pretty good, though. I figured out quickly this wasn't a place I could stay, and the check was immediately dropped and I was on my way.
