Restaurant: Rise-N-Dine
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
If there was a room in my brain that housed all of my most sprightly, rainbow-laden, vintage postcard-colored thoughts and served breakfast, rise n dine would be it.  . The whole time i was there I was thinking two things: I wish I could be besties with whoever decorated it, and my favorite color is the green through the light of all the glass bottles.  Oh, and that I want to decoupage eggs and stencil charming birds on paintings I find at the goodwill.. Pangaea- a dish made from the secrets of my culinary heart. Roti-indian flatbread topped with hummus, feta, cucumbers, spicy red pepper sauce thinger, and eggs. Do you ever, when you eat something really amazing, sing the 'delicious' song? It goes like this (opera singer voice): 'Deeeeeeeeeeliiiiiiiiiiciiiiiiiiiiiiiiouuuuuuuuus' . I sang it while I ate my breakfast and sipped my perfect cup of green tea served to me in an adorable tea pot.. The service was full of smiles and promptness, my toast was good, my pint-sized dining companion ate chocolate chip pancakes covered in maple syrup and had hot chocolate.  mmmmmmkay.. The only thing that keeps me from fattening my ass there on the daily is the fact that it's way out of the way.
