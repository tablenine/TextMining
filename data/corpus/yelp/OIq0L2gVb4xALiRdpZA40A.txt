Feeed me!! and they did.. . The staff was extremely friendly, the atmosphere communal and inviting, the food rocked...but their cans of diet coke could have been a little colder (a mild complaint to say the least....I'll probably bring my own beer (bmob?) next time anyways).. . My roommate and I ordered the following (arranged by awesomeness):. -- pork and cilantro dumplings (amazing! I love cilantro and these had a great flavor and they had a delicious crispy crunch fried texture to them..and they were laying on a bed of green beans garnished w/ bacon and some sort of heavenly sweet sauce...as any vegetable should be). --soba - very very generous with the scallops and oyster mushrooms, dark brown noodles that I've never had before and loved and the broth was the perfect amount of salty!. --ramen - beats college style in a heart beat, huge chunks of really savory pork. --lamb and brandy dumplings - really really good, but I wish they had the fried crunch of the pork dumplings, saving grace: on bed of edamame laced w/ bacon and that same sweet sauce...omg. . . Great food. Cool decor (although they could use a little more pieces of wood on the walls but who's to judge?! ...or shall I say 'yelp'?!). The huge heavy communal tables looked really cool and was a great ice breaker to ask your neighbor what they liked best. . . I'm sure we'll be back to try the other half of the menu we missed!
