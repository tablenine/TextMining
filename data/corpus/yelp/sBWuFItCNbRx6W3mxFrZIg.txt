Philippe's is an LA landmark and should be part of any Dodger fan's pre or post game experience.  The reputation is stellar and the name Philippe's has become synonymous with French Dip.  Also, perhaps no other LA eatery exemplifies the city and its diversity like Philippe's. . . Last night Philippe's was the final leg of a 4 part Yelp road trip and it completed the journey magnificently.  I'd like to offer some added appreciation to the staff for allowing the 20-30 of us who remained after closing to stick around until the Dodger game was over.
