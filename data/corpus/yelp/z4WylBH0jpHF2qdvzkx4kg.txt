It's been my experience that there are few *good* brunch spots in Manhattan that (a) take reservations, and (b) accommodate large groups.  My roommate and I were entertaining some out-of-town friends and needed a restaurant that fell under both categories.  After a quick search on . http://OpenTable.com. , I came across this place... and the Resto is history!  (I couldn't resisto.) . . If you're counting calories or watching those carbs to gear up for bikini season, avoid Resto at all costs.  There are some decent salad options, but once you see what the others at your table are eating (and drinking), you'll immediately regret your decision.  . . Take the Hangover Pasta, for example.  It is a perfect sum of what I consider a true brunch: a little bit of breakfast (sunny-side egg) and a little bit of lunch (spaghetti)... and a lot of gruyere-y, cheesy, peppery goodness to cure that foggy, morning-after headache.  (Clearly not the most dietetic option, however.). . Other belt-tightening highlights of the meal were the Frites and the beer.  Resto's beer menu is loooooong and features amazing selections from Belgium and the Netherlands.  The Koningshoevel Tripel and the draft white beer (the name escapes me) were both excellent and paired well with the crispy fries.. . Consistent with the Belgian vibe, Resto had a very European, take-your-time approach to their service, and that was juuuust fine with me.  (I hate when waiters bombard you every five minutes with the question, "How is everything?")  If you're trying to get in and get out in a jiffy, you might be annoyed by the slow service.  But if your objective is to catch up with friends over a leisurely brunch, Resto is perfecto!
