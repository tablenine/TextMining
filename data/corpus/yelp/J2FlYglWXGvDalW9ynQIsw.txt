I loved Uncommon Ground 5 years ago when it was cute and cozy, somewhat of a hidden gem among the obnoxious Wrigleyville bars. I used to go there to get coffee and read, or see random musicians perform. Then I moved away from the neighborhood and found out that they jazzed the place up by opening a big front room that seemed to cater more to the trendy and fabulous. . . That explains why I've stayed away for so long, but now I'm back...big time. . . I went there for brunch on a Monday and was so happy to see that the two back room haven't changed much at all. They were so welcoming that I couldn't wait to sit down and eat up. I ordered the Winter Scramble (sweet potato, shallots, gorgonzola) with house potatoes and wheat toast. It was so scrumptious and I enjoyed every bite. And the potatoes?!? Honestly, they must have given me at least 2 whole potatoes worth and I couldn't get enough...they were incredible. . . The space had all old wood and brick exposed walls with hand painted pictures of birds everywhere by a local artist. All of the staff were joking and having a good time together, which always makes me like any business I'm patronizing a little more. Our waitress was so nice and relaxed, she was attentive but didn't crowd. She even allowed us to move to the two big chairs near the fireplace after our meal to read for awhile. Just lovely. . . The only "meh" point was the coffee sweetener situation. They only had raw sugar or an all-natural substitute that was rank. I am all about loving the earth...but I want my Splenda. I will definitely be back for brunch and giving it a whirl for dinner.
