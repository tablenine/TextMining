Okay, it's been almost a year since I've eaten here and it is still 5 stars.  The service is stellar, the waitress was lovely (and she knew wine).  Great ambiance.  I had steak frites which was superbly prepared.  We started with baby beet salad, which was outstanding, and mushroom salad, which was also outstanding (and clever, try it.  you'll see).  For dessert, beignets with raspberry jam.  Good lord this place is good.. . I had two glasses of wine, an American Cabernet Sauvignon and a Bordeaux, and I sampled a Sangiovese and a Syrah.  Great wine list.... . Give it a go.  You won't be disappointed.
