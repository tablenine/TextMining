delicious!  . i wanted to try everything.  every maki roll was excellent- salmon lovers, crunchy tuna and spicy tuna (spicer than most places which was fine with me), siberian tiger...  . it's small, but worth the wait.  sit at the sushi bar and chat with mitch if you can because he was also wonderful.  . go here
