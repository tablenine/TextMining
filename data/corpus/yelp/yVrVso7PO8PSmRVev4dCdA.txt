Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I don't think I can muster up anything to say that hasn't already been said....so with that I leave you a bit of advice:. . Don't forget to tell your server if you want your sandwich warmed up... because unless specifically addressed, it will be cold!!  I've had many-a-friends get all sassy because they took a big ol' bite of their sandwich and it was cold.  Hey, it's not Jer's fault--just tell them you want it warm!  Everybody wins.. . On that note, I am not a frequent meat eater, but for the Diego R I am a convert.  Steak, cilantro, chipotle chutney,  adobo sauce...Mmmm.  . . ....but ask for it warm.
