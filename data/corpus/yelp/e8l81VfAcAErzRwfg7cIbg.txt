Been here a few times.... . Desserts - AMAZING (and believe you me, I'm well versed in desserts!). . Salads- not so hot, I like familiar looking leafy greens, not a fan of when the try to make salads fancy looking. . Chili - AWEFUL, it was like sloppy joe in a bowl. . Coffee drinks - THE BEST, even my coffee hating sister liked it
