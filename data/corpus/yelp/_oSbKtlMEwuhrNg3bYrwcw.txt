"Good for kids" reads the Yelp rating. Well that's partially true.. Personally I loved my roast beef, coleslaw and lemonade, but the darn 2-year-old is all CHOO CHOO, CHOO CHOO so I had to spend most of my visit in the back room, holding him up against the glass case with the miniature Metrolink and other toy trains. . Did he eat one bite? No!
