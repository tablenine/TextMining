Review is for a 4.5/5 stars. . I started with the asparagus+egg appetizer. As it arrived, they set the dish in front of you then add the sauces in a culinary manner then they puncture the lightly poached egg and let the yolk spill out onto the other sauces. I tried the my friend's Kobe Ribeye and it was so soft and buttery. There was practically no chewing energy needed to eat it. I then proceeded to my American Waygu ribeye. It wasn't as marbleized as the Kobe however, Â it was just so much work involved in chewing it. This made me reflect back on my life on how much time I've wasted my life chewing and wondering why aren't there more foods out there that doesn't require chewing. . . Comparing between the Kobe and the American Waygu, the Kobe is definitely worth it.. . I deducted 0.5 stars because for my personal preference, the steaks were a bit too charred on the outside making it really dry for me and requiring the use of sauces. However once you get to the meat on the inside, you're gold.
