Came here with a friend on a Friday afternoon to catch up on this and that. We both ordered salads-- she ordered the grilled veggie salad, and i ordered the asian scallop salad. I didn't try her salad, but for me, the contrast of the crispy shredded potatoes/battered shrimp with the fresh veggies was delicious! Maybe sitting outside on the patio with the gorgeous weather made the food taste extra yummy ;) . . As for drinks, the arnold palmer was good, as most arnold palmers are..my friend ordered a blended chai..wouldn't recommend it if you like your chai drinks on the stronger side cause hers was more like a milk smoothie with a veryy subtle taste of chai. . Lastly, ordered a slice of the carrot cake...so good. This ain't your average slice of cake..it's big, very dense, nutty and the frosting isn't overly sweet--just right. price ~$7.. . Overall, everything I tried was good but on the pricy end with salads being $10-$15...though I think the decor and vibe of the place makes it worth paying those few extra bucks.. . With the lights and the outside seating, this place looks like it'd be a cute place to chill at night..good luck finding parking though!
