Restaurant: Medici On 57th
Category: Bakeries
note: i have only ever eaten at the Medici Bakery &amp; Cafe, never the sit-down restaurant. i do, however, stop in no less than once a week, so though my review might be somewhat lacking, it is based on consistent patronage. . . that being said, i have some mixed feelings about the med. are their chocolate chip cookies delicious? yes. do they sell ice cream in the dead of winter? yes. are the people behind the counter friendly, attentive, &amp; don't treat you like a total pariah when you ask for something like a refill on your coffee (something other establishments have taken to charging a dollar for, or even outright REFUSING to do, forcing you - the pariah - to shell out ANOTHER $2 for a whole new coffee*)? yes. thank god. . . however. . . the med's coffee, though alright, affordable, &amp; the most immediate thing available to me on my way to my weekend job, is really not that great. their trash is frequently overflowing, &amp; certain types of bread cannot be gotten on certain days of the week. &amp; for a bakery/cafe, there are WOEFULLY few places to sit down &amp; eat your admittedly delicious apple turnover. the med boasts a whopping 4 tables, which are so tightly packed into this tiny bakery front that, should a crowd form, you'll find yourself shoulder to shoulder with the breakfast-pastry loving residents of hp. . . the med's worth it if it's vacant (which, on the weekends, it never is), but if you see a crowd, just grab that turnover &amp; scram. you can get your work done elsewhere. Â . . *yes, i am familiar with establishments offering a 'bottomless cup' [see: star lounge]; no, the med isn't one of them
