This is my favorite soup in all of Los Angeles.. . The broth is wonderful and flavorful - make sure to choose your spice level carefully though. I usually get a #4 - which is just spicy enough for me to call it spicy. I also like the Miso Broth the best, but all three options are great. In addition, I usually add a hard boiled egg and shashu pork slice. The pork slice is sooo good and tender. It is a bit on the fatty side, so if you like really lean meat, I'd stay away from it. . . There is usually a wait, especially on weekends, so just be ready for that.
