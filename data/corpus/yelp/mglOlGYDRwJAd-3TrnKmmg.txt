Ridiccccccccc!  I love every single, itty-bitty thing about this place  and am thinking about moving in and calling it 'home'.  It's very 'Dean &amp; Deluca' but better!  The food, selection, ambience, decor and even their packaging....love it all!  . . Yes, it's slightly overpriced, but when it comes to good food, I don't mind.. . Ok, so, things to try:  Mozzarella/Tomato/Basil sandwich, Chicken Schnitzel, Roasted Chicken, Grilled Cheese w/ Tomato, Chocolate Cloud Cookie, PB &amp; J (they cut the crusts off ;), and their ham and brie long skinny sandwich thing (I don't remember the name but it's usually near the register and they sell out quick - it's my fave).  Ooh, and of course all the amazing salads in the deli case...made with fresh, unique ingredients..mmm~  If I weren't already eating as I type this review (surprise, surprise), my mouth would be watering. haha~~  They also have a little 'market' section where you can buy rare gourmet products and ingredients~  I don't even know what half the stuff is, but I want to eat it all.. . I'm in love, love, loveeeeeeeeeee~~
