First of all, let me start by saying I opened a yelp account for this review specifically. Having said that, it's not going to be a positive one. . . I've been here quite a few times and the food was good. Excellently prepared, fresh buns, delicious toppings. So what if every time I come they give us regular fries instead of the truffle oil ones we order and then must complain to get a new batch? I've let it slide before and I will again. . . However, last night was beyond awful. I would love to chock it up to the idiotic Saturday night clientele, but no, even they deserve good sausages. Me and my two friends each ordered separately and each ordered different sausages. They somehow messed up each of our orders in different ways. Oh and of course we didn't get the correct fries and instead got rude waitstaff who refused to find us some mustard in the packed ass restaurant (we were banished to eat in the front because of the massive crowd in back). Worst of all, all three of us had the same disgusting issue with our food: severe grease. The paper under the hot dog was completely drenched and translucent when it arrived by about two bites in all three of our dogs/buns had completely fallen apart (some resulting in complete loss of toppings!!!) due to soggy/liquified buns. Honestly, it was disgusting. We all felt ill after the meal and for now have no intentions of going back. Really sucks because the first 5 or 6 times I went it was nothing like this.
