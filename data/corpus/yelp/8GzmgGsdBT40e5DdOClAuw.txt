Restaurant: Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse
Category: Latin American
Went here on Saturday night on a date. Ended up going with the BYOB wine option. When I read the menu I was surprised to see that they charged a cork fee of $7 for each bottle of wine. We ended up bringing 2 bottles and didn't care for the first one so we asked if they could open the second bottle. We ordered the Empanada Combination Plate as an appetizer. The Empanada's were all nice sized and stuffed with beef and chicken. The cheese Empanada's were amazing also. For dinner I ordered the Entra√±a. First off let me say for $19 this steak was huge. The flavor was also very good and it came with very generous portions for the sides. Our Waiter was excellent also. He was nice enough to wave the cork fee and gave us free dessert because we let them have our first bottle of wine. He also gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and didn't rush us at all during dinner. Over all Las Tablas is a great deal for the money you will not be let down.
