Zapatorias, pinatas and pastrami sandwiches?  Oh my!!  The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but the food at Langer's is capital D-licious!  I thought Jerry's Mazto ball soup was great, but after tasting the Matzo ball soup at Langer's which is in its purest and tastiest form (matzo ball + broth, can it get any more simple than that??), I realized that Jerry's adds noodles and veggies to distract you from tasting how non-authentic and bland their commercialized recipe really is.  Lame!   . . As for the pastrami sandwich... SO GOOD!  The pastrami wasn't too salty or fatty, the bread was soft, and the crust was crunchy.  Personally, I think the bread is what makes the sandwich amazing.  Simply perfection!
