Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
The best steakhouse ever. The food is wonderful. The steak will melt in your mouth. Order it rare since the plate is about 400F hot. Great warm spinich salad, butter cake.....Bone in filet is my top recommondation. Someone recommanded Cut to me, we tried and cannot wait to go back to Mastro's again.
