This place has been around forever.  There is usually a wait of at least 20 minutes, but it's definitely well worth it.. . I ordered the combination Daikokuya ramen and chicken teri bowl. This is the best ramen you will have ever have.  The broth is delicious! It has a rich meaty taste to it.  I usually order the ramen with extra kotteri flavor (basically it's soup base extracted from pork back fat).  The chicken teriyaki is also an exceptional dish.  The chicken skin is slightly crispy and the chicken is lightly glazed, not too sweet.. . The place looks like a Japanese diner with vintage Japanese posters and decorations.  Very cool.  The food is excellent and the service was good.  Expect to spend about $15 per person.
