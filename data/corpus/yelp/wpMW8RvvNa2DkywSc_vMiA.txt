The two dishes to come here for is the garlic chicken and the garlic pork.  Both come with a side of rice, beans, entree, and fried plantains and a mound of raw onions.  Portions are big enough to share with someone.  Typically I go with atleast 4 people and 2 entrees is more than enough to share. They also serve you warm bread which often times fills me up.. Their mango shakes are also pretty good and can serve as the dessert.
