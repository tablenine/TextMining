I've been a fan of this place since it opened. It's a great spot for lunch, the food always arrives super fast, the servers are nice, and for dinner, it's a great BYOB.. I usually come here with coworkers for lunch and at this point we no longer even need menus. We always get the Pad See Ewe with tofu, Crunchy Spicy Tuna roll, lately the Summer roll have been a must-have and we usually go with either the cashew chicken or crazy noodle. The food is always consistent, inexpensive, delicious and the Thai fortune cookies at the end of the meal are really awesome and it's fun to read off the fortunes with your fellow diners.. I've also been here for several birthday dinners and love the fact that it's BYOB, the servers are great at dealing with large groups and at the end of a big group dinner, the tap never goes over $25. It's a great option for Â groups, as the variety of offerings on the menu can accommodate anyone from a vegetarian, to a fish-lover, to a fish-hater.
