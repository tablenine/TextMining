Nice Verk, Volfgang!. . Took my wife there for lunch on her birthday. The Beverly Hills power crowd was in the house; lots of pinched faces/frowns, noses in the air. We had a great table-- semicircular booth with a view of the patio. Service was prompt. Wine list was interesting, albeit pricey by the glass. We each had salads-- both were excellent. Wolfgang himself came out and visited each of the tables; he was warm and engaging. Definitely a great experience for a special occasion.
