Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Wow...I read some of the reviews. I know I shouldn't before writing one myself, but I would say I am not sure the reviewers were all eating at the same restaurant. . . The bread was inexcusably bad. In an Italian restaurant this is usually my favorite part, and it tasted like bread and butter from a diner that had been set out for a bit. . . We asked our waiter, that btw couldn't have cared less, what would be his best suggestion for dinner. He said, well if you flip to the specials page, they are pretty much our "special items". We proceeded to order the calamari and two of the specials, which sounded delicious. A pesto capellini with mussels and a seared whitefish with asparagus. The mussels were rubbery &amp; gritty all in one and the fish was highly flavorless. The wine was the only good part of the meal, so we had a second glass. . . At that point we weren't willing to give dessert a go, but it, the coffee drinks, and gelato seemed to be the major drawing items that night. So maybe next time I will just peek in for desert and coffee. And give the service another chance (here's hoping he was having a VERY off night). Someone that patronizing should REALLY not be in a service-related field!
