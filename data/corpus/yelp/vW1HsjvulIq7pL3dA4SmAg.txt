Restaurant: Hamburger Mary&#39;s
Category: American (Traditional)
The potato croquettes really needed some kind of extra seasoning or even a sauce to dip in because they were pretty bland.  And the fact that I had to use the most hated condiment in the world, yellow mustard, on them to even TRY and spice them up was a horrific experience in itself. . . But the "Spicy Mary" burger wiped away all that unpleasantness and redeemed Mary's somewhat for me.  Wasnt spicy to me at all (but I am pretty hard core about stuff like that) so if you arent sure about the blackened seasoning, Mojo hot sauce, jalepenos, pepper jack cheese and special sauce combination you might want to take a taste of someone else's first!  The Mary's Punch that was on special that night was pretty good too.. . Decor was cute - very purple and funky.  Service was OK, nothing to brag about.  . . I would go back if someone really wanted to go, but I think I will save my burger cravings in the future for the greatest ones on the planet.  If I am going to spend that kind of money I would rather have a Kuma's burger.  Just sayin is all.
