Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
After 1800 reviews, 3 stars overall sounds about right for the Pinks experience.  There are definitely pros and cons to Pinks but it's baffling to me how they still command such fervent fan loyalty.  As a former restaurant owner, I can only shake my head with equal parts wonderment and jealousy at the throngs of people in line that characterize Pinks Hot Dogs.. . The one item on the menu that I really enjoyed (the unfortunately named "Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Sausage") was snuffed out after management probably realized how homoerotic that particular hot dog sounded.  Now, like those guys that go to Mcdonalds and try to order 'McGangbangs', I'm reduced to trying to order the HPatSS at Pinks merely for a cheap laugh from the peanut gallery.. . Still, you've got to give them a modicum of respect for brand maintenance and longevity, making people wait in line to overpay for glorified street food.  And we wonder when things started to go wrong with this country.. . 1 star for the food and 2 big stars for carrying Bubble Up Soda.  If you've never tried Bubble Up, you're definitely missing out.  If you could bottle the souls of all the dead unbaptized babies in the world, I'm sure it'd still be no match for Bubble Up's distinctive kiss of lemon, kiss of lime.  Tastes like...  sacreligious.
