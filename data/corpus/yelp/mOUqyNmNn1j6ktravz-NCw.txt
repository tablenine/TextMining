I wanted to go somewhere for Easter brunch because that's my tradition I try and keep. But I recently moved (I promise to stop mentioning it soon) to a different neighborhood and thus don't know what's around and want to test out the local fare. So I found Square One, par usual, through Yelp.. . The mixed reviews had me a little wary, but I decided to go with it anyway. I was just going to order the items everyone seemed to like.. . So we arrive and it's not as cramped inside as some have said (in my opinion, of course). Put our name down and thus begins the 10 minute wait. The woman comes &amp; finds us when our table is ready, go sit out in the patio (REQUEST THE PATIO, especially if it's nice out), and we get prompt service.. . The prices are pretty expensive for a breakfast / brunch place in that neighborhood. $13.75 for an egg's benedict and around $10 for anything else. But it's Easter brunch, so why not splurge a little?. . I order the salmon benedict and it was pretty delicious. The skillet was apparently also tasty so --golf claps-- for this place. Wouldn't go there too frequently, but it's a nice option to have.. . 3 stars, not 4 maybe because I like reserving my 4 stars for places that make me warm &amp; fuzzy inside, but definitely this is a 3+ ... "a-ok" with a smile on my face as I say it. Don't be discouraged (as I sometimes am) by the faded golden color of those stars.
