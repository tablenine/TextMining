Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
Milk is official. No strong weaknesses. I used to only get cookies, brownies, cake, ice cream sandwiches, milkshakes. Until one day, I showed up and I thought "Maybe I could use dinner before throwing back 4 pounds of whatever is chocolate." I got one of the specials, a pasta, and it kind of changed my life.
