If you come here strictly for the food, you'll be disappointed in that it's more of a club, cool to be seen type place rather than a serious eatery.  There really isn't any privacy also so if you're expecting to have a normal conversation, good luck....also, the tables were are all packed together like you were in New York or something.  However, if it's light sushi fare and drinking that you're going after (pre-party/club sorta thing) then this is a good call. My date and I shared about 8 orders of just "ok" sushi (no real exotic or specialty sushi is offered here) along with a bottle of sake and some drinks and the bill came out to about a couple hundred.  Looking around, the "rolls" are what you really see ppl ordering but that's really the crowd that Geisha House caters to.  Seeing the fake Geishas walking around the place is kinda cool but visiting this place once is good enough for me.  I probably would hit up Koi again before this place cuz at least there u can have your space and enjoy the vibe at the same time.  All that said, Ashton's joint fits right in there with the Hollywood scene and ppl jam pack the place so I'm sure he's not complaining.
