mother of god!. . i cannot rave enough about this place. (ansley location was strangely inadequate in comparison - what gives?). . everything i've ever had was spectacular. friendly efficient service. prices are reasonable. portions are great.. . my pick is the Pad See-U and the Roti-Canai appetizer AND the Nur Namm Tok salad. . be careful when ordering cocktails. they can be somewhat light on the alcohol
