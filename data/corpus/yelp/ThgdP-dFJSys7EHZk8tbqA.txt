Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's is worth a stop, if you're in Los Angeles if only for the history of the place. The chili-dogs are really yummy and its fun to sit back and eat them in one of the few Los Angeles places with a lot of history and character.. . The line: this seems to be a source of a lot of people disliking Pink's. ("I waited in 95 degree heat for two hours for a hot dog!") This is my take: if you drive by, the line seems long or it quite hot, then don't stop. A good chili-dog in a hip place is not worth getting heatstroke.
