What a cute little bakery! And boy is it little! Or maybe it's just not big enough to fit the large crowd that flocks here on the weekends. The last time I tried dropping in on a Sunday afternoon to grab some grub, I was in for a rude awakening. The wait was a solid hour--and no way was I willing to wait an hour on an empty stomach. Instead, I chose to order food to go. I spent the next 15-20 mins drooling over the baked goods they have out in their display counters. I ended up ordering a few tarts and other goodies--they were all FABULOUS. In fact, lunch was pretty fabulous too. I can't imagine getting something here that isn't 100% fabulous. . . Probably shouldn't try this place on the weekend... but if you're patient enough to wait a while, then go for it! You'll be happy you did.
