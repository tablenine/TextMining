Restaurant: Maggiano&#39;s Little Italy
Category: Italian
Let's see...A three might be a bit harsh given that it is a decent chain restaurant, but that is what I'm going to give it.  This place is a bit harder to review because it really caters to a certain crowd. I don't ever go to Maggiano's unless there is some gathering or team dinner there that someone else has arranged.  Still, the food isn't bad, and the service is generally at least generally average.. . The way I see Maggiano's is that it is fun place for the younger crowd.  (I lump it into that category with Cheesecake Factory)  In fact, I think it is a pretty nice treat for high school students and college students during special celebrations: birthdays or maybe dinner before some school dance.  It is more than what a normal college student spends for dinner yet it isn't overly expensive.  Like I said, the food is decent and the family style setting and portions are great for big groups.  There are even the All-You-Can Eat family style meals for big groups, so Maggiano's gets extra points for being so accommodating for groups.  This makes it fun, hassle free, and people always go home with leftovers.  The tiramisu is pretty good for chain food also.. . I can't consciously give it over a 3 because there are better local Italian joints in town that you can get better food and probably for the same price or less.  (for example, see my review on Dominick's)  I will say, though, that the ambiance is nice and this is in a fun part of town!  It's also not a bad place to try if you've never been because it is pretty consistent.
