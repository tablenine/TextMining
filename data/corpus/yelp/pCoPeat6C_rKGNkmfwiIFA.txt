Restaurant: Tom&#39;s
Category: Diners
My roommate and I have lived down the street from the famous Tom's for eight months, and, feeling obligated to try this notorious brunch spot, finally decided we'd be willing to put up with the wait this morning (they are now open on Sundays and it was beautiful out, after all).  . . We waited in line for about 30 minutes, and were thanked for waiting when we were seated, which was nice.  But this was not a relaxing brunch!  Yes, you feel like you're in someone's living room (actually, it feels more like your grandmother's basement), but that living room is packed with people eager to take the chair you've got.  Our table was adjacent to the queue of brunch goers that streams all the way into the restaurant, which felt very strange.  Our waiter (not necessarily the same one every time) came exactly three times--once to pour our coffee, once to take our order, and once to bring our food--and the owner/manager-seeming guy, while moving people in and out, kept his eye on our plates to put the check down on our table as soon as that last bit of toast had been swallowed.  . . The food was good but not remarkable, in my opinion (I had a veggie omelet and home fries; my roommate had french toast), and it was all just too rushed.  I'd much rather brunch somewhere quieter, with more room, where I can sit and have that second (or third) cup of coffee before I leave.. . Basically, glad to have tried it but won't go back.
