Okay, Just Okay...Nothing special. I tried the Margherita pizza and tried the Wild Herb and Cheese. The wild herb &amp; cheese was tastier, the margherita was bland. The Cesar salad was served with whole romain leaves of lettuce on the plate, not cut up at all...! It was a lot of work to eat the 'okay' salad. The outside patio dining area is nice though.
