Restaurant: Taka Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I have a hard time eating sushi anywhere other than Taka - the creativity, quality, and diversity of the menu never fail to impress me. From the soups to the cooked items to the rolls to the sashimi, Taka delivers. It's not cheap, but it's nowhere near the ridiculous prices that MF charges. And Taka does send out what is likely the best sushi restaurant email newsletter in the country - be sure to check it out.
