Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
If Bottega Louie were a man, I would marry him.. . The Caprese Salad was the best I've ever had; the buratta cheese was delicious.. . Be forewarned -- some of the pizzas come without cheese.. . The Branzino comes with the tail and skin, but no bones. Â So good.
