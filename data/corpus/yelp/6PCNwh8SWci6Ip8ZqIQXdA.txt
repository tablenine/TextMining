This place is great, the food comes out quick, and it IS good! I can't realy add any more because I have one PROBLEM just one!. . The sassy eggs. I love them, but take away the tomato ketchup on top,. . It ruins the whole dish, surely a good chef can come up with his own sauce! Next time I will be getting the Sassy eggs but I will have to ask for no ketchup?. . Ketchup should be the diners choice and never the Chefs choice. Edit - Delete
