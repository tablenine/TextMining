Restaurant: Flying Biscuit Midtown
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Met a couple of friends at this location, this weekend. I had a much better experience with the atmosphere and food here then I did with the Norcross location a few months back. Norcross wasnt bad but, it wasnt good either it was very unremarkable. . . The one in Midtown is in a great location with lots of foot traffic to people watch and to help it give a lively vibe overall. . . The wait was about 1 hour so, if you plan on heading here for a late breakfast on a beautiful Saturday morning be prepared. If you need help staying awake while you wait then there is a Caribou Coffee just across the street to run backup for your patience if you need. . . Grits and biscuits, its in my blood.
