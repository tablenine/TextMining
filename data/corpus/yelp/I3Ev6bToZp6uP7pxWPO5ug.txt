Very dark, salty food....a lot of money for a small portion as there is no rice added unless you pay for it.. . salty salty salty, Penny's Noodle Shop has a bigger better menu.. A little over cooked.. Young crowd who need to eat around bucktown, Try Blue Bird, great food, Hot Chocolate well the best for what they do.. . Be smart and try other great restaurants around this over priced salty small weird menu layout and walk away.
