Not sure why everyone loves this place so much.  It's very good, but really, at the end of the day, you are gonna pay almost $20 for a sausage and a beer.  Granted, the sausages ARE fantastic and the vibe is Berlin-cool, but the annoying factor of long lines getting your order outweigh the positives sometimes here.  The most annoying thing is when people have 5 minutes or more to look at the menu while in line, then they ask the cash register guy/gal who is working like 14 questions about the menu or they vacillate on what to order as the rest of us wait hungry behind in line.  Figure that out BEFORE you get to the register people!   Let's keep that line moving.  Bottom line?  Good food but not an amazing "experience."  Better for lunch than dinner in my book.   German beer freaks will love it, though.
