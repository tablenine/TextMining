Restaurant: The Modern
Category: French
Just a warning, if you are going to the Modern for dinner, expect tapas or tasting style plates.  Your bill will average around $50 for two "appetizers" and an entree.  . . Our reservation was quickly overrun because the museum staff was not available to unlock the entrance to the Modern. Arg. Food was ecclectic but average.  Again, very small plates, but that is the idea.  If I were forced to choose, I'd make this a drink and dessert destination.  Try the beignets or the apple struedel.  Very tasty.. . Hosts and folks that bus the tables are more than friendly, but the waitstaff definitely leaves something to be desired.  If you're in a pinch after walking through the MOMA, land here for cocktails and a "snack".  Wouldn't make this a special evening out though.
