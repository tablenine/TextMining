Restaurant: Penny&#39;s Noodle Shop
Category: Thai
Penny's is a great and inexpensive place for a quick bite to eat.  I ordered the spring rolls which were not that good.  They really didn't have much flavor.  However, the Tom Yum was excellent, they serve a pretty good size bowl of the soup and plenty of shrimp, it was also spicy.  I also recommend the Thai fried rice (spicy), a lot of flavor, and pretty big portion.    Overall, I would go again, I live in the area, the food and price are just right.
