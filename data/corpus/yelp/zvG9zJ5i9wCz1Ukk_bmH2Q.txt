Had dinner at Terroni last night - wasn't sure what to expect from the reviews that had service all over the place.  I wasn't blown away by the service but it wasn't horrible.  I think 5 different people ended up bringing us our food - the second person asked us if we wanted some bread which she promptly brought over - no olive oil for dipping though maybe we should have asked.  Our actual waitress seemed busy but took the time to provide a recomendation or two and was nice to our group.. . The place was very loud but it had a nice lively atmosphere.  I had the pasta with italian sausage - the sausage was in crumbles and i was hoping for slices but it was still a very good dish.  Everyone i was eating with seemed to enjoy their pasta dishes as well.. . I want to come back and try the pizza's - i like the fact that they don't cut them - reminds me of the time i spent in europe.  Also a really great location - great alternative to eating in the grove if you are in the neighborhood for a movie or shopping.
