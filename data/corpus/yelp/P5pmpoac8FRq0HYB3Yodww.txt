We were wondering around Little Tokyo after a Garth Brooks concert at Staples (don't ask!) and saw a long line outside this Ramen and Rice bowl joint - so obviously we tried it.  It was a 40 minute wait, but well worth it!  I got the house ramen and pork katsu bowl combo.  The ramen is the best I have in all of Los Angeles - the broth is absolutely fantastic!  The katsu rice bowl was good, nothing extrodinary like the ramen, but good.  Will definitely come back again, but probably around 2-3 to avoid long waits!
