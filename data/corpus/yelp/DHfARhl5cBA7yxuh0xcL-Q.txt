just read Trisha W's review, i don't need to say anything else.  except to maybe say i was glad i took an anti-anixety pill before entering frontierland cause i had to wait 90 minutes (with a reservation) with tacky buckhead people and angry heat lamps in the foyer.   listen up chef people: you can't make defrosted lobster taste good just by decorating it with lots of colorful sauces.  sometimes the clothes do not make the taco.
