Oh gosh look at all of these great reviews, well thats what Â convinced me check this place out. So I went and did not have the best pizza in the world like everyone said. . I got the traditional cheese pizza and it was just missing something in the sauce,like salt or something. I mean it was not the best, the texture was just not right. Nice atmosphere but not the greatest pizza. Mullberrys is way better!
