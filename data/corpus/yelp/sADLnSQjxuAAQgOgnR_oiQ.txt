Convenient location; Very nice Decor; Outdoor seating.. . However, nothing to write home about for sushi.  I only say that because there was way too much sushi rice on the rolls - a good sushi roll will have a very thin layer of sushi rice so that you can taste more of the fish.  If they wanted to improve their business, they should hire a true blue Japanese trained sushi chef (they know how to roll sushi!). . Service was pretty good and they have outside seating.. . A good but not great place to eat.  Better alternative would be Circle Sushi in Roswell.
