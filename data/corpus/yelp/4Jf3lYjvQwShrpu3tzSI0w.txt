Yes, it's a great location, and yes, the servers and atmosphere are lovely, but the food here is  so "meh" that I don't understand why there is always such a crowd.  Maybe people just haven't been to M.Henry or Over Easy (two of many brunch spots that trump Selmarie any day).. . On my second visit, I had an omlette with asparagus and prosciutto and fontina -- in theory sounds delicious -- that totally flopped.  The asparagus had not been sauteed or cooked at all before entering the omlette, so the whole thing tasted a bit like raw asparagus.  Despite the saltiness of the prosciutto, the omlette fell flat.  Not much flavor there at all. . . The breakfast potatoes look and taste like the Ore-ida variety from Jewel.  The toast was decent but it's toast...not much to screw up there.. . My second visit confirmed my feelings about this place.  I just don't see how a mediocre pricey brunch place like this can survive in Chicago when their food isn't any better than diner fare.
