Restaurant: Furaibo Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Came here with some friends because we were told they had the 'best chicken wings', and personally they are not #1 to me but they were quite good.  What I like about Furaibo is that they offer many dishes in small portions and reasonable prices, so you can pick and choose to customize your meal.  Most other Japanese restaurants I've been to, you are limited to plates or bento selections, and it would be too expensive to order two things (for example, one place I've been to doesn't offer udon and tempura together, and separately they are $8-10 per item, and too much food for one person since they are two entrees).  Tried many dishes here aside from the chicken, which include oysters, scallops, beef sashimi, yakitori.. I ate chicken hearts for the first time and that was interesting.  Everything was delicious.  Impressive menu selection as well, as I saw traditional Japanese dishes I've never seen offered elsewhere, such as niku-jaga (meat and potatoes).  It was busy the night we ate here, and doesn't seem like the place to go if you just want a quick bite.  Food comes out fast and drinks are refilled often, but it took forever for us to get the check and pay for it.
