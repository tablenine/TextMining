Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Every time I visit LA I would stop by for a Pink's hot dog! Simply the best hot dog in town!! However, the wait is too long so I always order two hot dogs! Save the 2nd one for midnight snack or for breakfast :9. . Consider taking a walk down melrose ave to burn off those calories.
