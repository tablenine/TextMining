Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
My husband and I thought we would try this place because we love bbq but it was just ok.  Smoque and Twin Anchors have far better bbq than Smoke Daddy.  The food wasn't bad but as good of hype this restaurant is getting I expected a lot better.  We will be sticking with Smoque and Twin Anchors from now on.  Oh and I would say the best thing on the menu was the sweet potato fries.
