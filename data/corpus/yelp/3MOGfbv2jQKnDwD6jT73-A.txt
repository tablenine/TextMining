delicious sausage and accoutrement. expensive, but good draft beer selection, e.g., 7-dollar spaten.. . parking not so good. which is ironic because you feel like you're eating in a nicely-lit parking garage. . great place to come with a friend, but i wouldn't bring a date here.... . i had to yell out my beer request to the bartender to get his attention... i was thirsty.
