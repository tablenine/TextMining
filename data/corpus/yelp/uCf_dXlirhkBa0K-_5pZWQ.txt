So this place has the best thing ever!  A wedding cake kit.  For $15.00 you get a box with apiece of each cake they have.  In the other box, you have containers of all their fillings and frosting.  It is like fondue, but you dont have to heat anything up!. . I dont know if I will get my cake there, but the cakes are yummy!
