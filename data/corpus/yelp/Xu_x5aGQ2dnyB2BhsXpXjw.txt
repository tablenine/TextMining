Delicious Latin food. If you go on a Wednesday they have an awesome fixed price menu. For $37 a person you get guacamole and chips, a salad, a plate of three different tapas and depending on the size of your party between two and four entrees with mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies. You also get a wine pairing with each course. I went with two friends and even though we only split two entrees (they are served family style) we couldn't finish everything. Definitely worth the price. Make reservations though, they fill up fast.
