Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
I'm (wait for it) in (wait for it) love (wait for it) with (wait for it) Pizzeria Mozza!!  After I got over the bad first date with Pizzeria Mozza, I realized that I love it!  I've been meaning to do a rewrite, so, I can make it official.  Pizzeria Mozza is my favorite non-Asian restaurant.   Now, I can put it on the top of my favorite restaurant list because of course it's not official till that happens. My perfect night with Pizzeria Mozza would have:. . Mozza Caprese: not the same boring Caprese you find at other restaurants. The flavors of this Caprese is mind blowing! . Pizza Bianca:  Great for cheese lovers!  The crispy sage adds a whole dimension. . Butterscotch budino: Heavenly, creamy pudding with sea salt and rosemary cookies. . Oh, I'm tempted to make reservations just thinking about it.... But Virginia stop! It's a recession and you just ate there a month ago!
