I wish I liked this place more. The first time I went, I loved it. Went with a big group of people and had a beautiful dinner. Everything was perfectly done (steak) I had the smores desert, which was a little too much all around, and I love sweet, rich food.. . I went recently with my family for my birthday...meh. I had the ONLY vegetarian option on the menu, which is a little disappointing. It was good...but not 24$ good. My mango martini was delicious...and honestly, people have complained about the sushi, but I thought it was pretty good! Of course, I didn't have any fish...just cucumber, avocado and carrot. Still, it was one of the better experiences I've had with sushi. We had the cookie sandwich for dessert...and yes, it was mouthwatering, but really, 10 dollars? Come on. I can drive over to Westwood and get the same thing for 1.50 and have more icecream and cookie options. . . With all the food in mind, I would have given it 4 stars. I think it is way too expensive, but the view is breathtaking and the restaurant is really beautiful. Our waiter (the second time) was an ass. He asked for my ID, which is fine...but I only had my passport, because my new license hadn't come in the mail yet. He said they normally don't take passports but he'll let it slide. What the hell? Passports are more valid than driver's licenses last time I checked. He was not friendly at all. The guy pouring us water was 1000 times more efficient as a server compared to this jackass. He made me feel like an idiot basically as soon as we sat down, which is a bad way to start your dining experience.. . Overall, good food but too expensive. The waiter was an ass - so the service was mediocre. I'm sure I'll be back...but maybe only for drinks and the view. Undecided, which is disappointing considering we spent over 300 dollars.
