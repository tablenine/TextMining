I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars.  I think this is a nice little place.  It's got sort of a local bar/restaurant feel - but hipper.  It can get SUPER crowded so be prepared for that during peak drink/dine hours.  I got the fish tacos and really liked them.  We had some sushi rolls that we split that were all really good.  The drinks were all a hit.  I had the hub punch which I really liked.  I've had some good experiences there, and it's a fun place to go if you want to be in a jam packed place with loud music on a Saturday night, or if you just want to chill with some friends over a cocktail during the day.  I dropped it down to 3 stars because I don't think the food was particularly impressive or unique if you're going there just to dine.  It was still really tasty though.
