Have been here a few times in the past and everything was wonderful. (As to be expected of a buckhead life establishment) Although my last experience was less then satisfactory! The waitress was rude and things felt hectic in the restaurant! The quality of the food was good all accept for the lamb... it was so over-seasoned and fatty we barely ate the two and half bites you get! I will say on a good note the watermelon salad was wonderful and the live music and overall design of the restaurant is good for everything from- girls night- date night! i don't know that i will be going back here for a while.... also... the bloody mary we got was sooo terrible we drank about two sips
