Yay! finally got to cross Fraiche off my 'to-do' list! The occasion: Vday, hence, the 4-course prix fixe dinner.  Loved the cool, laid back ambiance, the romantic dim-lighting, the outdoor patio, and the bar area.  If i lived in Culver City, I'd definitely make this a regular hangout spot.. . The food:. . -bread basket w/ olive tapenade:  standard. . 1ST COURSE:. -smoked salmon on toast w/ side of greens:  standard. -tuna tartare w/ potato chips:  the tuna tartare...again standard fare.  i only wished the fragile potato chips were swapped for something more sturdy, kept breaking off...perhaps a thicker potato chip or a fried wonton.. . 2ND COURSE:. -lobster risotto w/ asparagus, cherry tomatoes, basil:  really creamy and decadent!. -Duck Agnolotti:  Clam shell mushrooms, truffle butter:  heavy buttery taste, didn't care for it too much.. . ENTREES:. -Short Ribs:  good. -Monkfish "Francaise"-Spinach, white wine, potato puree, shallots.  AMAZING!!  loved this dish.. . DESSERTS:. -pine nut pie w/ ice cream:  unique, tasty dessert.. -Red Velvet dessert w/ ice cream:  looked nothing like red velvet.  looked more like a giant oreo cookie.  it was delicious, though.  i really enjoyed it.. . I'd return here for the ambiance, monkfish, lobster risotto and desserts.   Would also like to check out happy hour.
