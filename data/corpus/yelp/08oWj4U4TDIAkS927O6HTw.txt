Restaurant: Birds Rotisserie Chicken Cafe &amp; Bar
Category: American (New)
The chicken is moist and the garlic dipping sauce is glee in a ramekin.  When the weather is just right, as it always is, it's nice to sit out on the patio and watch the pedestrian traffic.  Though bring sun block and a hat because there's little to no shade.  Service is slow but if you're having a casual lunch after a long hike in Griffith Park it's not a big deal. . . My favorite part about Birds is the doggie chicken.  A menu selection specifically intended for their canine guests who are thoughtlessly left out of the dining experience at other restaurants.  I expected only a small bowl of funky chicken parts but what my dog got was a full-sized cup of the shredded chicken Birds actually uses in their sandwiches.  Bam (see picture in profile) definitely enjoyed it and for only a dollar I might order it next time...and the servers are nice enough not to stare when you feed your dog using silverware.
