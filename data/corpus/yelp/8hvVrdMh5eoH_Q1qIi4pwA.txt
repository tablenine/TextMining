Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
It's fun, it's wild, it's dirty, it's good, it's delicious... it's Asia!. . I have never been to a "restaurant" in the states that reminded me so much of Asia! The place is wild!. . If you want to have a fun yet wild experience, a taste of Asia, this may be a place for you. If you are faint-hearted, then you may pass this place immediately.. . Let me start by describing the setting. The place is wild. It's dirty like Asia, but not dirty to a point where you will be stepping on things every other step; however, it is definitely not your fine dining restaurant. You can either choose to sit indoor or outdoor; we sat outdoor. There is a big umbrella kinda thing so you definitely won't get wet if it starts to rain. The table were small and cramped, but it was fun a big group.. . The price is rather cheap for Korean BBQ at night, $17.99 per person. Not to mention, it is all you can eat too. The quality of the meat is acceptable with a lot of choices. Bulgogi, chicken, ribs, briskets, pork belly... you name it they probably got it. There are also a lot of banchan, sidedishes, with unlimited refills. There are also mango, pineapple, and yogurt soju which people seemed to enjoy a lot.. . I think one of the highlight is when the waiters/waitresses spray bottles of champagne on birthday people! It's a riot, because everyone in the restaurant would scream and shout while the person is being sprayed! The whole restaurant would smell really good afterward.. . Oh, just a tip.. remember to eat the meat with the rice paper. It's like a taste of heaven. Okay, maybe not, but close.. . Overall it was a pleasant experience. If you want a taste of Asia.. I would recommend you to come. Also, prepared of smelling like what you ate when you leave!
