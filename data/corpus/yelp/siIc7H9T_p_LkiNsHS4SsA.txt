pretty mediocre food.  i don't know what the hubub is all about.  i got the rib tips and both in that and the sweet potato fries, all i tasted was cinnamon (or some similar spice)- overpowered everything in the food.  mac and cheese was decent but not stellar.  i'm not sure if that's typical of midwestern BBQ (i've heard cincinnati chili uses a lot of cinnamon?).. . i had this to-go and the staff seemed pretty friendly/helpful.. . my search for barbeque continues...
