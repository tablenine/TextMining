Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
i love orochon. love love love! but i love it because of the level of spicynesss that can be achieved in their bowls of ramen. i understand that ramen is supposed to be more about the flavor of the noodles and the soup base and how well it tastes when blended together with the additional toppings. but when i come to orochon, i come craving one thing only: the spice. and for that, i give this place 4 stars. if you want true ramen for the noodles and the soup flavor, go to the other places other yelpers have suggested. if you want spicy ramen, come here.. . i've heard horror stories about the special #2 and although i love a good challenge, i still like to enjoy my meal. so i got #2 with the miso base. the miso base kind of dilutes the spicyness a little, so take that into account when ordering. the base price of the soup + noodles is pretty cheap, but when you start adding in extra toppings like egg or pork chashu, it adds up really fast. so be prepared to spend a little bit more than at.. say daikokuya. but if you love spicy dishes as much as i do, i think you'll find it worth the extra couple of bucks.. . can't say this is my go-to ramen place. there's too many other good places to choose from like shinsengumi or daikokuya or santouka or foo foo tei. but i'll definitely be back to try to work my way up to special #1 at least. yumm can't wait!
