I really like this one as opposed to the Santa Monica one because it's so Â much bigger. I tend to not have trouble finding a spot to chill (because frankly I'm not afraid to "bitch-up" and throw elbows) but yes, WAY BIGGER. AND BETTER PARKING.. . They have EXCELLENT Craftbeers and well made bar drinks. I usually get their FO burger. I want to try other dishes but I just love the aioli (acckkkkk) and the juicy burger with skinny pomme fritte (NOMNOMNOM).. . The crowd is full of yuppies though. Like the people that the "What White People Like Blog" make fun of. . . For reals.
