Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
mmm.. great pizza!  very fresh ingredients on top of crispy crust.   although i personally like giordano's crust better, i think lou's has better toppings.   however the drink selection is pretty limited, and the restaurant feels cramped.  still, i would definitely come back for more pizza here.
