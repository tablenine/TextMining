Restaurant: The Water Grill
Category: Seafood
Came here for DineLA with friends on a Sunday night.  It was my first time dining here, so I didn't know what to expect.  The entrance from 6th street is seemingly small, but once you open and walk in, the dining area is vast and almost breathtaking.  Clean, neat, sophisticated.. . Now, to the nitty gritty...   We opted to bring out own wines (since they do NOT charge corkage fee), and the selection we brought were not on their wine list either.. . I ordered:. -Water Grill Clam Chowder. -Loch Duarte Salmon. -Ice Cream Assortment. . The clam chowder was DELISH, full of chunky carrots &amp; potatoes with bits of clams in a not too creamy of a soup base.  The flavor was delightful.  I finished that 1st course in a heartbeat.  Definitely a must try.. . As for the Loch Duarte Salmon, I'm not sure if I truely enjoyed it.  The salmon itself was a lil on the dry side.  But the flavor was delish.. . Ice Cream assortment was OK.  It's Ice Cream, so you can't really go wrong.  My friend had their Sorbet Assortment instead, and that was DELISH...I would say if you were to pick...get the Sorbet.. . My friend ordered the Wild Jumbo Pacific Shrimp and Kurobuta Pork Belly.  Man-oh-man, that pork belly was done just right.  Fatty, juicy, and flavorbursting.  Makes me drool just reliving it right now.. . I'm not sure if I'd come back, but if I do, I may want to venture OUTSIDE of the DineLA menu and see what this establishment really has to offer, since they are known for their seafood.
