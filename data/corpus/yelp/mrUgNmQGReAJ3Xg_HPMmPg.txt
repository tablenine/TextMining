I was late to board the Kogi train.  So by the time I tried my first Kogi taco, I was really amped and ready for the bite of heaven that everyone had told me this was going to be.... stop the record... I thought is was ok at best.  :(. . Really, I'd rather just have some regular Korean BBQ.  This fusion is just not that great.
