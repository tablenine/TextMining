Ok, so I can't really be a fan because I've only been here once. I took a blind date to this place at her suggestion. I've never seen her since but I'll definitely go back to Ford's. The burger is well worth it-I've seen some other reviews dissing on the burger but the onion rings alone make it worth coming back. Biting into one there was no grease and the onion itself almost disappeared in my mouth. Sublime. The burger was super tasty. I have to say I'd rather pay the same price for the same burger in a place with less trendy people though.I thought the chairs were uncomfortable as well-especially since the food was rather pricey.
