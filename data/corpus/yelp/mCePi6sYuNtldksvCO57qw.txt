Restaurant: Red Light
Category: Asian Fusion
I just tried out Red Light last night with my wife and some friends. I read many of the yelp reviews before I left and I noticed that the reviews are really all over the place. Sadly, I have to agree with the negative reviews. Everything about Red Light was meh. The waitstaff was fine, maybe a little hard to find at times. My wife and I shared the crab cake appetizer. It was a very common crab cake. The sauce overpowered the dish too. For my entree, I had the Asian paella. Now I love paella, but this was not paella. It was a helping of white rice mixed with a little bit of sausage and some mussels and clams surrounding it. The chocolate bag was the saving grace as it was very good. Honestly, I am happy that I tried Red Light, but I don't think that I would ever need to go back.
