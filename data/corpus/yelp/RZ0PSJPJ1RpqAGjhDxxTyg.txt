Stupendously good, incredibly fresh, titillatingly flavorful food! Holy good lord. I've been back four times now. Still the best food I've had in all of LA county. A bargain for the quality of the ingredients.  Eat up before they move to a more spacious location and raise their prices! (And.... since they are now on their way to a new location, let me say that I'll still be eating here as often as possible!)
