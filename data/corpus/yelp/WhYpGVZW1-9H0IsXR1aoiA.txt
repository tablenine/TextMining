I agree with Nicki, I found this place mediocre. Cool toppings which tasted nice but the proteins were not seasoned at all. I think that's why Kuma's kicks every buger's butt is because of the patty is seasoned to perfection at the get go. Sweet potatoe fries were done perfectly. The place is very 'california' in its apearance, so that's annoying. Rock and roll photos on the wall, but I'm forced to listen to emenem. I don't like metal but i'd rather have kumas ear bleeding metal music over the pop crap I heard at the counter. . Cool concept, season your proteins better and maybe this will be something. Ambiance sucked for me though.
