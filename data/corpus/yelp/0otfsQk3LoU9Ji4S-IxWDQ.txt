#6. That's all you need to know when you go to this tastebud orgy.. throw a sangria in the mix and you're set for the rest of the night. .     I've often thought, "what would be my last meal?" this is IT people. the garlic chicken with white rice, black beans, extra mojo de ajo, and a glass or 7 of the fucking delicious sangria. .     One thing though, if you have any plans after versailles, they might not happen. food coma sets in pretty heavily if you really attack your meal, and the urge to chill out with a drink at home seems alot better than going to long beach and bar hopping.
