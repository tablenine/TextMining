Been here for Happy Hour and Tapas Sunday.. Both are excellent.. . I have not dined off the regular menu.... yet. . . Happy Hour - $3 tacos. Several variaties to choose from. They were all yummy. Choirzo, Spicy Pork and Potato.... Also, 1/2 off on Sangria and Beer and Mojitos. Great Deal!!. . Tapas Sunday - Everything we ordered was great. Being that its tapas night, and the portions are all super small... you can order plenty of things to try. . . Oh and we also had the Rainforest Macadamia Brownie. [Vanilla Ice Cream, Chocolate Sauce, Dulce de Leche, Toasted Coconut] It was soooooo GOOD!! The perfect mix of flavors. The toasted coconut was my favorite!!!. . Parking can be a little tricky. There is a structure off of Figueroa just past Ciudad. They do validate so be sure to ask your server. . . Also, they provide a free shuttle service to and from the Ahmenson. Works out perfect to have dinner here then head off to your show.
