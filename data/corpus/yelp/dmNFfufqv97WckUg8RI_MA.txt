it's good! it's really the most original vegan i've had ever. some of the portions like in the bowls are really too big, it's insane. kind of expensive for quick lunch but not if you go with a sit down dinner expectation. the space is weird here, you order downstairs and you go eat upstairs in a loft. it feels cramped and some students from UCLA kinda hog it in a nice way (remember when you had to find a place to study cause your roommate was like having sex in your room or something?), but it is actually cool to watch the chefs cook from up high, you will feel like a vegan vulture, waiting for your food to be made. So, crowded, not cheap, why 4 stars? because it's good quality and you get tastes and textures out of vegan food not present in either the thai-vegan quickies or white-snooty blandies like RFD (i like RFD but admit it most of the food is bland).. . PS: when you have to take a meaty out to eat, i think this is the place to take them first. most carnivores get annoyed with me when i take them to vegan, but not when i take them here. it's a gateway restaurant.. . after eating here, i always ruin it and get non-vegan (but the best ever) frozen yogurt for dessert at red mango. damn i need to go review that now...
