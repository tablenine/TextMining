Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
I think Umami is going to be a big hit.  Nice low key space, with good food and reasonable prices in an area that doesn't have a lot of good burgers around.  Went here last Friday with my lady to have some burgers.  We read about the service kinks they were trying to iron out and this seems to still be a little issue.  The BYOB makes eating here very attractive.  We had the california and the umami burger - both very juicy and well cooked.  The bun was like a nice toasty brioche.  Toasted well and very soft.  It was a good compliment.  The fries are different - they serve about 9 of them stacked up like Lincoln logs.  They were fat and big like french toast sticks from BK.  I liked them.  $8 for a burger and $2 for fries.  There were some other yummies that we didn't try but certainly will in the future.  Parking lot if awful but after 7pm La Brea is wide open.
