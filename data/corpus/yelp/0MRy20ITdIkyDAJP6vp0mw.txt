Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
It's true. Porto's is incredible in terms of both taste and cost.. . This location is split between the cafe and bakery.  It's constantly packed on the weekends, but fortunately  they have employees to help you find an available table within minutes.. . The sandwiches range from $4-$6, and their breakfast items are less than $4. Can you believe it??  The portions are definitely decent, and the Turkey Sandwich, Steak Fajita, and Pastrami sandwiches are so delicious.  Their natural smoothies are amazing too (mango, guava, etc.) and they aren't artificial-tasting or too sweet.  The Dulce de Leche Latte is fantastic too, way better than a Starbucks frappaccino, and not overpoweringly sugary.. . A trip to Porto's isn't complete without pastries! *cough*cough- CHEESE ROLLS *cough*cough.  The pastries are just so perfectly crafted, with flaky crusts and just the right amount of sweetness.  A DOZEN for just $7! So amazing.. . Parking can be annoying sometimes, though there is a lot in back.
