Once in about every 6 months I crave a burger....6 months came up and someone suggested The Counter. The (turkey) burger was quite tasty topped with I don't remember. Now, the service was a bit dicey...I believe our waitress rolled her eyes when someone in my group asked to add something to his order after it was placed. Not a biggie...adding is easy...taking away is hard. This was just one time so I won't hold it against them.. . I would go back. I will also try my darn hardest to resist the shakes because they look soooo good.
