Restaurant: Paco&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
My parents first took me here when I was about 10 years old and I still come here, it's my ultimate favorite Mexican Restaurant! The place is always packed no matter what time of day you go, so most of the time I like ordering my food by phone and picking it up. They have homemade tortillas which are absolutely delicious, although they have a good selection of items on the menu I have never ordered anything else but the carne asada because it is just too good to pass up. My favorite is the Carne Asada a la Tapiquena because it comes with sauteed onion and green chilies, an enchilada, rice and beans.
