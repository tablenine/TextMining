Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Expect long wait anytime of the day.  I'm not a hot dog lover at all, but I love Pink's!  Line up with a group of friends is quite a fun thing to do, and it is part of the Pink's experience.  It builds up your anticipation and desire as the wonderful scent of grilled bacon/hotdog/hamburger keeps filling up the air.  . . Then you'll debate with your friends whether to get the Martha Stewart's Dog (a 10 inch Stretch Dog with mustard, relish, onions, tomatoes, sauerkraut, bacon and sour cream); the Harry Potter Dog (spicy Polish sausage with grilled onions and mushrooms, bacon, nacho cheese and jalapeos) or Lord of the Ring Dog (topped with tons of onion rings).  Anything is good here, I don't think you'll go wrong.  My personal favorite is the Harry Potter Dog.  It's not too monstrous and gloppy.    . . PLEASE, make sure you know what to order when it's your turn!!  I hate it when people still say errr..... umm.... and examine the menu when it's their turn.  Don't do that! You'll get a lot of angry stare.. . Pink Staff are busy and still quite friendly.  Make sure they get your order right by saying it at least twice.  After you pay, you can take a seat from their patio behind the stand, where you can witness how others are gulping down their orange mess like hungry wolves.  Well you know, we all have to wait for at least 35 min....  That's probably why most people said Pink's hot dog are delicious too -- it's the wait.
