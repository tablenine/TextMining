You really can't go wrong when you eat at Phillipe's. I've been going all my life...I'd say I've been a couple dozen times, mostly before a Dodger game. I guess it does hold some sentimental attachments, but I still think it's the best. . I ALWAYS order the beef dip, double dipped...with a side of macaroni salad and a pickle. Sometimes I get an iced tea, mostly just fill up an empty glass with water from the water fountain.. Then we go shopping up the way in Chinatown. . It's a great experience. . Don't forget to dust the sawdust off your shoes before you get in the car to leave! =]
