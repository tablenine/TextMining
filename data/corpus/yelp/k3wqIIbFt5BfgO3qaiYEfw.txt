I really enjoyed the fresh juice... I'd recommend orange, carrot and apple.  The Yuca and Sweet Potato fries were good as was the nori wrapped tofu, but it was fried.  I'd also recommend the eggplant with cheese; I didn't really taste the cheese but the sauce it's in is very good.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and a great place to catch up with friends.
