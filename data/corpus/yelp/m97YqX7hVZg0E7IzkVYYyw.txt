Probably the most overrated place I've ever been to.  C'mon Yelpers, this place is really not all that great.  . . I guess it was Ok, but it seems to be a bunch of hype to me.  . . Sure, they are very efficient and the place is HUGE for a sandwich shop.  I had a hard time finding a table despite there being so many.  Ended up eating outside which actually was quite nice for people watching.  Quite a phenomenon actually to see them turn so many people in such a short period of time.  The service was friendly, efficient and very quick.. . I had the potato balls that everyone mentions in their reviews.  They were average at best.  Tasted like something I buy frozen at the grocery store and toss in the oven for 15 minutes for a drunken food fix.. . The pastrami sandwich was nothing special at all.  The bread was mediocre.  The sandwich was of a decent size for the price, but I just can't get past the fact that the bread was only mediocre at best and this place has 4.5 stars after 800+ reviews.  WAY OVERRATED!!!!!. . We saw Jay Leno standing and chatting on the corner adjacent to Porto's.  Can't really miss that big-ol-chin!. . Don't go out of your way to come here like I did!!!
