Restaurant: Wow Bao
Category: Chinese
Entering the restaurant greets you with two computer kiosks where you can order.  I found this odd because I thought you had to order like this, but the interface was a little difficult to deal with.  Fortunately, you can order inside like normal.  So, I think it's unnecessary to have the kiosks in the first place.  I ordered the 3 for 5 special which included dumplings, peanut noodles, and a rice dish.  I got the pork dumplings and the chicken curry over rice.  I enjoyed the rice and curry although i prefer short grain rice.  This was more chinese restaurant rice.  Also, the peanut noodle sauce was very spicy.  Too spicy for me in fact.  The noodles were okay and the dumplings were okay.  My friend got the pad thai salad and two baos: bbq and teriyaki.  The Terikyaki was supposed to be spicy chicken so that was dissapointing.  The buns are okay.  Definitely not traditional and a little on the salty side.  The salad was delicious though.  Fresh and flavorful.  Overall, a good place if you're craving cheap asian eats.  But definitely you're getting what you're paying for.
