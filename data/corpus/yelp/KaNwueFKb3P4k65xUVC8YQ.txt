I loved this place the minute it opened...unfortunately MANY minutes have since passed and it's slowly slid down my list of hip and happenin' yummy  joints. . . When it first opened, the place it overtook...well, no one went to.  So upon opening, no one really went there.  The all of a sudden...WHAM!  Apparently people clued in while waiting in line at Doughboy's on a Sunday...they began to migrate down the street and hover along the curb...just WAITING for a seat at Toast.. . Food is good enough...LOUD inside (my dad hated it!)...we had a gaggle of women laughing hysterically behind us on some sofas inside last time.  Ick.  Service is dicey at best on account of it being so busy...you don't get the attention you may deserve.. . As for food...for breakfast...the scrambles are quite tasty coupled with a bowl of fruit and a bagel or english muffin.  For lunch...they have an extensive list of soups!!  . . Parkin's a bitch...be prepared.
