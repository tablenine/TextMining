I really loved their innovative menu items and their lovely outdoor patio.  This was definitely not your run of the mill brunch joint.  I wanted to try everything, but ended up ordering a fresh OJ mimosa and their challah french toast which they served with a bluberry peach compote and creme anglaise.  My friend had the oatmeal pancakes with cinnamon butter and some other delicious things.  I'd love to try more things on this menu if I get a chance.
