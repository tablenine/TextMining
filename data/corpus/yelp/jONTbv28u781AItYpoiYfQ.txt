Restaurant: Zaya Mediterranean Cuisine
Category: Greek
Service - great. Server answered my questions appropriately with knowledge of dishes. Hostess opened door for us as we entered restaurant.. Atmosphere - dimly lit. Nice interior - modern style, trendy.. Things I tried on my veggie platter:. 1. Hummus - pretty good.  No "store bought" taste.. 2. Labneh - sour cream consistency and appearance with olive oil on top.  Not that good but I've never tried it before.. 3. Falafel - very good!. 4. Lentil dish (forgot name) - very good!. 5. Tomato stew with chickpeas (forgot name) - also very good!. 6. Pita bread - awesome. Warm, soft, fresh. They serve this with olive oil mixed with some kind of spices.. NOTE: I had not tried labneh, lentil dish, tomato stew w/ chickpeas before my visit to Zaya so I don't have anything to compare it to.
