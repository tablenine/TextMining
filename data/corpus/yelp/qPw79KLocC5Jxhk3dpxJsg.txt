The food was very creative. I had the pan roasted salmon. My friends had the tilapia, chicken negro modelo and the filet mignon. We also tried a couple appetizers - the tamales are really good. I had a great margarita and the mojitos were decent. The bread pudding with pineapple and coconut was awesome! It was REALLY loud though with a band playing Cuban music all night. Not the best place for a deep conversation. But the atmosphere was chill and hip. I will go back for sure, but due to the slightly inflated prices, this will not be a regular spot.
