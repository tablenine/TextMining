I don't get it.  Overall, it was OK.  My boyfriend ordered rare tuna and it was literally raw.  It looked like it had never touched a hot surface.  Maybe it's supposed to be like that, but it doesn't say that on the menu and our server didn't imply it was raw.  He actually ended up getting sick after he ate it too.  He eats sushi regularly, and that normally doens't happen to him.  The desserts were really good. We got the variety plate and I'm glad the meal ended on a pleasant note.  The service was good and the atmosphere was nothing spectacular.  Maybe I went on a bad night or something because I really don't understand why everyone loves this place?
