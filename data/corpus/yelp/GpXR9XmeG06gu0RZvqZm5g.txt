Great for birthday parties and business meals. A little TOO pricey for dates and such.. . Went here for a friend's birthday party. It's a bit of a trek to drive up to the location (it's past The Magic Castle tucked deep in the Hollywood hills) but once I got there everything was smooth sailing.. . $8 valet parking (+$2 tip-out = $10). Not bad all things considered.. . I had the Wagyu steak ($39) which was excellent. The beef was on par with a solid Filet Mignon from a place like Morton's or Ruth's Chris, but the sides really made it exceptional.. . Next time I come here I'm thinking of trying out their entree-sized sushi platter. One of the other people in our group got it and it looked delish.
