The ordering/seating system is just bizarre. We waited outside for 20 minutes before we were allowed to wait inside. There were at least 8 open seats at the communal tables the whole time. After waiting inside in a little hallway in the back we were finally called up to order, then seated at a table with 6 other people. I think the communal table thing is a weird and ineffective trend- if I wanted to eat with strangers I'd do . http://match.com. . . . The food, on the other hand, was really really good. The duck dumplings were fantastic. I was very surprised by the quality of the kimchi- I haven't had anything this good west of Seoul. Both noodle dishes we had, the ramen and egg noodles were great. I'll be back, I just hope they start seating people like a normal restaurant sometime soon.
