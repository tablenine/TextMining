It gets a 3 for now. Nothing knock out good but nothing bad except the spinach dip, i would be embarrassed if its house made. The crostini sandwiches are pretty good. The scenery is neat, the service is very friendly and accommodating. Since I am insane and make the server open the beer bottle in font of me. . Ill def be back and try a little more and update my review later. They have a pool table which is nice and the crowd is very mixed. It was also much larger than I thought from the outside
