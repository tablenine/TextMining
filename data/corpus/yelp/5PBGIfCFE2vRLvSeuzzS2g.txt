Went here with some con-buddies while in town for Dragon*Con. Wow! The blue-cheese bison burger I had was *fantastic*, absolutely juicy, tasty, blue-y and... bisony? The crab cake appetizer was also delicious; I've had some dry, uninspiring crab cakes in the past but was blown away by this, far and away the best crab experience I've had. Our server was very friendly and made good recommendations, and our group was made to feel extremely welcome. Two Long Islands each probably didn't hurt. ;) Definitely going to be on the dinner agenda again next year!
