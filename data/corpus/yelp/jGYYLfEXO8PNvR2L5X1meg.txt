Phillipe serves The. Best. French dip sandwich I have had in my entire life, and I've tasted them coast to coast.  I absolutely love their melt-in-your-mouth, perfectly cooked generous helpings of  beef on crusty but soft bread.  You choose whether you want the sandwich dry, once dipped, or twice dipped. I go with the once dipped with melted bleu cheese on top.. . This is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten, and I can't imagine that it won't be the same for you.  You will never need another French dip place after you go here.  Plus, the sandwiches here are twice as big and much cheaper than Cole's.. . The restaurant itself is super casual, cafeteria style eating with pre-made sides and long tables.  You'll be surrounded with everyone from people in 3 piece suits to those who have no permanent address.  . . This rating is for the sandwich and atmosphere; I haven't been called by the sides--they look meh.  But who cares, the sandwich will stuff you beyond need for anything else.. . Go. Go. Go.
