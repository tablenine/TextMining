Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
This is the most kitschy Roscoe's I have been to. The walls are covered with headshots of your favorite brothas and sistaz of hollywood. The man at the door is dressed in a sharp suit and full of... personality. . . Don't go here on a Sunday morning unless you want to wait for a really long time. Drive by on a Sunday morning to see the line of people in the coolest church clothes ever. . . The parking is a bummer, though, but it's worth it for the bomb ass food.
