Restaurant: Shorty&#39;s
Category: Pizza
This place gets packed fast. Going at peak times is rather difficult. The menu offers a lot of typical dishes of a pizzeria. However, nothing jumps up to induce your taste buds. I had a vegan friendly pizza with lots of veggies. There was nothing special to it. No pizazz from my pizza. If one of your friends wants to get some pizza and you are in the Toco Hills area you might want to check Shorty's. Yet, there is a Mellow Mushroom down the street with better tasting pizza.
