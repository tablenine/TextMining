Honestly, I love garlic.  But I'm not sure if I like garlic so much that I end up smelling like it for the next three days to come.  I ordered the prime rib and the appetizer that everyone was raving about and it was pretty good.  I even tried the garlic ice cream but not sure if I will try it again.  The service was pretty good and everyone was friendly enough although the decor is a little heavy with multicolored drapes and random accents of furniture and pottery everywhere.  Overall, it was a memorable experience but just be prepared to REEK of garlic out of every pore of your being afterwards.
