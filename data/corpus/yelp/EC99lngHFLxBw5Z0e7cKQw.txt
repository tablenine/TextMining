Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Quite possibly the WORST!!!! service I have ever received anywhere.. . I went to Ford's last month with a few co-workers, for LA's restaurant week.  What began as a fun little trek away from the office, ended with me in tears AND in the emergency room.... . As soon as my co-workers and I began to order our lunches, I let the server know that I had a food allergy to egg, and I asked her to inform the kitchen.  With each dish that came out, I verified with the server that the food was egg-free.  I could tell she was annoyed with me asking (which unfortunately happens plenty of times I go out to eat), but the bitch assured me that none of the food had egg in it.. . The food was fine, and I was having fun being out talking office gossip with my lunchtime crew.  By the time lunch was coming to an end, I had already dismissed the rudeness from our server.  Dessert came, and again, I was told that the dish was safe for me to eat.  Two bites into my apple crumble dessert, I felt nauseous and damn near vomited on the person sitting next to me!  . . Everyone in the restaurant stared at me, shocked.  Crying, I demanded that I get a word with the chef, but he never came out to show his face.  Our server was speechless.  The manager was such an ignorant airhead, that all she offered me was to have me write my phone number down for her so she could make sure I was alright later on??!?!!?  Couldn't she see that my life was in danger?  Wasn't there some kind of protocol she should be following in case of accidents like this??  Nobody called an ambulance.   They even tried to still charge me for my meal.. . So much for faith in humanity.
