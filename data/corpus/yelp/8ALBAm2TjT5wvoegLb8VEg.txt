Restaurant: The Veggie Grill
Category: Vegetarian
Vegetarianism is a way of life that I've chosen to ignore. Even more specific, I doubt I can even make it through single vegetarian meal without craving the all too good meaty flavor. However, I am one for trying new things and the Veggie Grill is definitely a modern concept that I can now say I've had once in my life. . . There's a pretty good selection of different sandwiches and salads, but the whole time, I felt like I was being cheated; that something very subtle was awry from my typical sandwich/salad. I give it up to this place for attempting to copycat the chicken patty, the burger patty and even sliced beef. However, for me, the texture fell way short and there wasn't any spice combo or sauce that could have really pushed the meal towards really being enjoyed. On the bright side, the sweet potato fries were delicious and when dipped in the chipotle flavored fake mayo, they weren't half bad. . . I'm gonna leave this one for the true veggie heads out there, but for all of us meat lovers, surely its worth a try just once in your life.
