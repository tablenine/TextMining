Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
After reading the reviews and enjoying a little bubbly myself, we decided to give Pops for Champagne a try.  We went on a Saturday around 11pm and it was busy, but not overcrowded.  We decided to try out the Jazz lounge downstairs.  I HIGHLY recommend heading downstairs if you appreciate jazz.  There was an $8 cover each, not bad for the big city.  It is a very intimate setting with colorful, contemporary lighting done in a very laid-back way.  We ordered a bottle off the Sweet Champagne list from Spain that was only $30 and AMAZING!!!  The bartender provided tableside service and was very attentive to refilling our glasses.  He obviously enjoyed the trio that was playing as much as we did.  It was the end of the night and we had already had time to converse at dinner and the bar, so we just wanted to sit back and relax and be entertained.  This is NOT the place to go if you want to chat with people.  I would consider it rude to the musicians and others who obviously head there for the music if you were chatting away during sets.  Between sets, though, there is about 15-20 minutes to converse.  We had a wonderful experience.  It can be romantic with someone you know.  We sat along the wall on a booth with a small bistro table.  Just what we wanted to end our evening!!
