Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Wow, people LOVE this place. My friend took me here for dinner a month or so ago, and I remember having to wait outside in the cold for Â a good 30 minutes before we were finally seated. We sat around for a while on the chairs outside of the restaurant, and tweeted to their Twitter account to seat us just because there was nothing else left to do. The restaurant itself is a little tiny and somewhat cramped; it wasn't like I was attempting to eavesdrop on neighboring conversations, but it was a little difficult to not hear every word they were saying. . . Anyhow, onto the food! The ramen here is exceptionally good. The waiters/waitresses ask you precisely how you like it to be cooked and within minutes (even on busy days), you have your bowl set right in front of you. I ordered half a bowl for a cheaper price for my already stuffed tummy, as did my friend. The broth was amazing, and he couldn't stop drinking it even after all the ramen was gone. . . Oh. &amp; the service, you ask? They're polite and patient. I don't know about you, but I definitely like being greeted and thanked as I come and go (:. . Superior quality for a decent price. I will definitely be back.
