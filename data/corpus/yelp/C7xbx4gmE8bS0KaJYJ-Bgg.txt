I'm a garlic and noodle fanatic, how can I not love this place for their famous garlic noodle????? The garlic noodle, that I can't find anywhere else is very mouth watering, yet after you eat it, you won't have the bite or the smell of garlic, it's awesome, specially when you go with someone you love that you can kiss him/her back after having a garlicky dish ;). The seafood is great too! They have pretty good selection of wine. The funny thing is they have a bib ready just for you in case you spill all over or a messy eater.
