Tasty, but pay attention... Love the wine, the flights make for a very entertaining  and interactive dining experience.  The food tasted great, I had the B.W.C. Sloppy Joe's Sandwich.  I don't know why they call it a Sloppy Joe's  Sandwich, it has every definition of a Pulled Pork Sandwich.  Also, while eating my fries, I found several Rotten potatoes on my plate and on my partner's plate.  That pretty much ruined my appetite, which is a shame, because my food was very yummy!  I would definitely go back for some wine tasting, but I might think twice before ordering food again.
