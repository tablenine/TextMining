Tossing another review of this place into the pot is as overkill as your sixteenth piece of filet mignon wrapped in bacon, but what the hell? You'll still down it.. . Despite my mild reservations about single-handedly depleting an entire cow farm in one night, I enjoyed the experience (it's not just a meal). Fogo de Chao is an epic battle between quantity and quality, with quantity eking out a much-deserved win. I do not feel like $52 is outrageous for this much good munch - the fact that the salad bar and sides aren't afterthoughts is impressive in itself. The service is impeccable - they've got their circus of carnivorous indulgence down to a science. And I was happy that they served at least one decent South American beer (Xingu).. . Next time I'm going to go stoned - a rating revision may be in order afterward.
