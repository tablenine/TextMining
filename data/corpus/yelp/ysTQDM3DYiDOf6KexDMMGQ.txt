Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I shared the #3. The chicken is delish and the waffle goes amazingly with it. The food itself was definitely good and filling, but the place only gets a 3 star because of the service. Our waitress was very aggressive. I ordered a #3 and she brought a #1. When nobody claimed it, she kept saying that it was our fault and someone forgot what they ordered. I kept saying I ordered a #3 and she said she repeated the entire order back at us and nobody said anything. I wasn't being defensive or accusing her for anything...I really just wanted my order. But she continued putting the blame on me. JUST GIVE ME MY FOOD! At the end the difference between a 3 and a 1 is just 3 pieces of meat extra, so she gave it to me...but still had a huge attitude about it. Seriously, what's her problem!. . Ugh. I hate bad service.
