Stopped by Krog last night with some friends. This might be my favorite and possible the best "neighborhood wine bar" only because they are simple -- cheeses, meats, tasy bites and lots of excellent wines. I also like it because it is small and not as "commercial". Ofcourse that means you cannot go here with large groups but thats the point. The atmosphere is so relaxed, cool -- something like a bar in SoHo or in Europe except its here in the ATL. The best seats are outside especially this time of year when its coolish outside.  The meat is cured really well and they have numberous great choices of wine bottles open if all you want is a couple glasses.  Also worth mentioning is the staff who is very good and knowledgeable and the desserts -- especially the gelati. I would recommend the Tramezzi, Cheeses, Antipasti. The Charcuterie and hummus are to die for. Enjoy!
