Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant

I been here ever since I was a kid.  I was there when they moved from the small restaurant they had next door to the current one.  . . This has always been one of my favorite places to go for sushi.  The only drawback is that it is cash only and for sushi thats a lot of cash but I do think its a great place to go.
