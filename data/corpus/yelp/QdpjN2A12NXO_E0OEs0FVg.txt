I think this is where the original Chicago Deep Dish pizza started. This place is pretty touristy since it's in downtown Chicago and a lot of people from out of town know about it. The wait can get pretty long which is not very fun. If you like deep dish you will most likely enjoy the pizza here-I'm more of a thin crust girl.
