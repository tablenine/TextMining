Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
This used to be my favorite Thai place, but when it moved to its new location, the quality really went downhill.  They spent a lot of money into making the restaurant look hip, and must of fired their old cooks or something.  I might come here to introduce friends to Thai food, but I wouldn't come here when there are better hole-in-the wall Thai places in the area.. . And you have to do valet parking...street parking if you are lucky.
