I've lived in the valley for over 30 years. This place is on the bottom of the list as far as Mexican restaurants go. I don't know what the big deal is?  Maybe because it's in a trendy area.  Or maybe because Nick and Jessica on that shitty MTV newlywed show would go there?  So if you are into the trendy "look at me I'm famous" spots than this place is for you.  I'll admit they have decent margaritas but that's it!   The food is mediocre and way way overpriced!  I mean $6.50 for a taco ala cart, you serious?   It better be a taco made by an Aztec god which it isn't.  There's soo many better places to go in the valley. Don't believe the hype!
