So Fat Cat has a special "Spicy Vinegar."  I don't know if they make it in-house or not.  I didn't find it very spicy or vinegary ... I love spicy food but I dislike vinegar, but since I dashed it all over my fries, I was left eating soggy french fries.  It also ran underneath the bun of my burger so my burger was also soggy.  Anyway, this is all just to say that they have this unique "spicy vinegar" but I didn't find it to be anything special.. . They have a wide variety of brews on tap and it bottles, and the prices are reasonable.. . I came here most recently on St. Patrick's Day to meet up with a friend, and the bar atmosphere was pleasantly relaxed.  The bartenders were working hard to keep up with the demand, but the other patrons seemed understanding and patient.. . Fat Cat is a nice neighborhood bar - but now that I've tried their spicy vinegar, I have no reason to return.
