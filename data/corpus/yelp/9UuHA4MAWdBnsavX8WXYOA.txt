I live in Lincon Square and I have grown to love this place. I live right around the block from it and this past weekend i just realized why this place is so fabulous. . . Some friends, my boyfriend and I went to Lula Cafe in Logan Square and than came back here for some extra wine and chatter. Right away we were greated like we were family. We told the waiter that we would be 6 people and he didn't get scared :) points for him. . As i sat at the bar and looked at the menu, the owner came up to me and made some suggsetions based on my love for whte wine. He was very nice and let me taste a couple different ones till i made my final choice. My boyfriend opted for the Sangria! WOW i was so jealous it was delicious!!! A MUST TRY! Than him and i decided to order some lemon chessecake- it was delicious but a little toooo lemony. Than the rest of our grouped ordered. One my friends was very excited to have found some old french apple beer that she drank while on vacation with friends... so she ordered it and was very very happy. . In other words i love this place and i hope it sticks around.
