Stopped by on a crazy hot day (4/13/08), and had the exact opposite experience that N.oah Q (see below) had.  Service, while not overly friendly, was efficient, and pleasant (it was very, very busy...no time for chit chat!).  My salad was DELICIOUS (cobb).  The greens were crisp and fresh, and the chicken was amazingly tender and juicy.  They seem to know what most other people don't...chicken breast is only good if you don't over cook it!  :)  I washed down my salad with an exquisite Arnold Palmer that was cool refreshing, and light (not overly sweet).  . . Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to visiting again soon.
