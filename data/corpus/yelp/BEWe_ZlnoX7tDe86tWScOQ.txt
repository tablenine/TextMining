My husband and I have been dining here since they opened last summer. Â We love sitting on the patio on Sunday afternoons-it's only a mile and change from our front door, so we spend our weekends walking about midtown and this is a favorite watering hole.. FAVE ITEMS: Sweet Tea Cocktail (Matt, bring it back on specials!), Boiled Peanuts, Smoked Wings, Pulled Pork Sandwich.. They even started serving brunch back in December-we were fortunate enough to be the first guests in the door and place the first order that day-definitely a good southern brunch!. . Don't listen to the nay-sayers, check this place out for yourself, you won't regret it...Great bunch of guys doing a great job!
