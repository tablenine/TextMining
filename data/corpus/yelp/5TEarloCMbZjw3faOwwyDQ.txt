I've been here twice, most recently yesterday. I've ordered the same thing twice... The Wimpy Burger.. . I really like that burger! It is really, really good and the fries aren't bad. Mind you, I dislike 90% of the restaurant burgers I eat. I'm all about the hamburger stand type burger.. . The atmosphere is very "a la hipstrer" and is fine. I will continue coming to Fred 62 for a quality hamburger.
