Restaurant: Crustacean
Category: Vietnamese
A friend took me to Thanh Long restaurant in San Francisco, and I loved it!  So I asked the restaurant manager if they have another restaurant in Los Angeles....and lucky me, to my surprise, she said yes... it's called Crustacean.  I simpy love the way they prepare their dungeoness crab, and together with their garlic noodle, they are simply heaven....
