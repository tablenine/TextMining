Nice atmosphere but screams "West Hollywood.". . I was in LA during the day and met my good friend for drinks in the evening. I had two sake flights and she had some mixed drinks (red and fruity, name unknown). ~$90 for four drinks, tax and tip. Oh wait, it's LA, not surprising!. . Regardless of sticker shock, I thought it was a great place to meet for drinks. . . Sushi at Geisha House? LOL. Not a place to order sushi.
