nope.. . the food is 3 star worthy. that's it.. i don't see the big deal with adding taco sauce and kimchi.. it's good...but no where even in the same realm as the hype Kogi has created. although, truly, it's the Los Angeles flock of sheep that has created the hype.. . so, 3 stars for food, -1 for the 45 min. wait.. . go see for yourself. i absolutely will not go back.. . i'll stick with the taco truck on western and the korean bbq in k-town.
