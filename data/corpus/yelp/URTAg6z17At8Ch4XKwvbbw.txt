Restaurant: The Mermaid Inn
Category: Seafood
i really really want to love mermaid inn, i do.  but unfortunately, i don't (well not 5 stars at least).  i may not love it, but i'm in the extreme like phase!  my friend and ventured over to mermaid inn on a warm, beautiful night and were given a table outdoors.  yay!  does anyone know where to buy those free crackers?...because we loved them!  we shared the mussels as an appetizer, which were delicious.  then, we both ordered the spaghetti with shrimp and scallops.  this is where i had the problem...the pasta dish was barely lukewarm, and actually needed to be heated up more.  besides this minor issue, i really liked everything we had, including the free chocolate mousse.  i'll be back and hopefully next time my meal will be hot!
