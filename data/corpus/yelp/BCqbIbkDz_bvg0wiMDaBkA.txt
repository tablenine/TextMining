The food was decent, prices were commensurate with everything else in the area.  We went here for a work lunch and it fit the bill, though I wouldn't necessarily go back on my own.  I found the service pretty lackluster.  We had to specifically ask for refills and the free muffins that everyone else got, and our waiter gave the impression that we were bothering him.  I could see all that if it was busy, but it frankly was pretty empty.  Not my favorite, but on a food basis alone it was ok.
