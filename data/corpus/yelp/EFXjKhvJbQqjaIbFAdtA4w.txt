I am not going to lie, I love this place.  It does not look too appealing from the outside (I was a bit hesitant to try it for a long time), but go inside, order a cappucino milkshake and a grilled cheese and try to tell me that this place is not delicious.  I have tried several other items off of their menu and most of them have been good, but nothing tops the grilled cheese.  It has a relaxed atmosphere so no one is ever pushing you out the door, which I like.  Try it!
