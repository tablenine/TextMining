Oh Porto's! What deal did you make with the devil to become so good? Did you mortgage your soul to the Dark Prince himself?. . And as for you Dear Reader, do you really need yet another Yelper to tell you to try the potato balls? Probably not, but I'm going to tell you to try the potato balls. The eclairs and napoleons are pretty sublime, too.. . There's a reason Porto's is always packed.
