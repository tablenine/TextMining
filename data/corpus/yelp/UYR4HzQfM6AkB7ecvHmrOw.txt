Looks like my parents and I found a new location for our Sunday lunches, besides M Cafe. My dad loved his grilled flatiron steak. My mom looooved her albacore plate. I loved the happy vegan salad, which definitely made me a happy vegan. It was like a salad of salads. Intense! . . I love that they cater to a wide range of tastes on a relatively small menu. Awesome.
