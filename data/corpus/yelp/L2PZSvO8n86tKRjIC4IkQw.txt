Restaurant: The Twisted Spoke
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The twisted spoke seems to be an establishment that cannot decide whether it's a bar or restaurant.  Unfortunately, you get the filth of the bar atmosphere with a restaurant component thrown in. . As far as the food is concerned, I think it is pretty normal bar fare. The kind of thing that you'd order to keep yourself from drinking on an empty stomach.  As with most other reviewers my main complaint is that the place needs to be scrubbed with bleach and then scrubbed again, with a good sanding between scrubbings. . The tables, condiment bottles, menus all have a film of slime on them.  I think that the price makes this place just ok rather than good. And the filth makes it a place I'd drive past to get a meal that was cooked under sanitary conditions.  However the rooftop seating is quite nice. . A Good place to drink, I'm not too hip on the grub.
