Restaurant: Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant
Category: Chinese
I was visiting from Houston and read all the yelp reviews and decided to drive from Ontario, CA to try this restaurant.  This is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever eaten.  I've traveled extensively around the US and this is as good as it gets when it comes to seafood.. . I was by myself and order 3 dishes and people looked at me as though I was in a Man vs. Food episode.  . . The clams in basil sauce was sublime. The sauce was outstanding and you could throw the sauce on some biscuits to have your Chinese version of biscuits and gravy. The clams were fresh, juicy and plumb.  . . The shrimp in garlic sauce was also very good.  The flavorful shrimp was paired with a spicy sauce.  . . The standout was the 2 1/2 lbs of crab in their special sauce.  The dish is very similar to the Vietnamese salt and pepper crab dish.  This sauce was not too salty or sweet.  It was perfect and allow the crab to stand on its own.  . . This is definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in the US.   It was as memorable as eating at R&amp;G Lounge in San Francisco.
