(ppl are going to be mad at my reivew). . ok, so everyone loves Souper Jenny. I am even on the email list and get the menus each day. . . I was finally able to get here one cold, rainy afternoon. It was grilled cheese night! I got a Jewish bagel with turkey, melted cheese and a side salad with blue cheese (i hate blue cheese) and these soaked pears (yummy).. . the walk-area where you order and pay for your food is really tiny and narrow. i had almost no room to move around and close my umbrella, etc. . . NPWH though. . . i lvoe that everyone was having wine with their grilled cheeses. . . my friend got the chicken salad as his side. it was so good. my 2nd favorite i have ever had. it's so moist and full of texture. i wonder if they ever have chicken salad sandwiches. . . anywoo, the place was very crowded. we were lucky to get the last open table (the couches in the back). . all-in-all i enjoyed my time here. although I'd rather not pay $12 for a side salad (the peaches and dressing were great) and a bagel with cheese and turkey). . i would go back for the environment and chicken salad.
