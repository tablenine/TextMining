I am addicted to the atmosphere, interior design and fonts at this restaurant. I would go back even if the food wasn't fantastic. . The high ceilings, the intimate little booths, the authentic NY deli style is just awesome.. I routinely go out of my way to have lunch or dinner here.. It can be slightly pricey, but apparently not too much since I always find myself going back.. I have heard of bad experiences from others, but never had one on my own.
