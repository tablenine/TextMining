I came here for the first time after strolling down Valley Blvd and remembering that this place is supposed to be really good.  I actually found their menu to be very minimal in terms of variety since (1) I didn't want to order Hainan chicken like my friend (2) I didn't want to eat curry because I had that for lunch and (3) Pasta/pizza did not sound so good since this reminds me so much of my nasty college culinary skills.  So I had the duck salad and the meat was pretty dry.  Salad was from the supermarket pack (ice berg lettuce galore).  Add the meat and it was over 7 bucks!  My friend really enjoyed the Hainan chicken and he finished it all!  Despite for the boring salad, they also had some good bread that came with it.  Yummy.  Like most Asian places, they would fill up your water cups and that would be equivalent to their customer service.  The indoor dining area is small so you can hear everyone talking/laughing.  This place doesn't accept credit cards!  Would definitely try the Hainan chicken if only it had vegetables too; can't subsist on a meat/carb diet!
