I have a new brunch crush. It's on you, Flo! . . Let's face it: People can be pretty boorish at brunch. They're kind of hungover, need their coffee and eggs and want to be seated RIGHT NOW. That's why having a lovely and patient hostess (like the one at Flo this morning) can make all the difference in the world in getting your meal off to a good start. She handled our party upgrade from 2 to 3 without skipping a beat and kept us updated on our status while we waited to be seated. . . Food? Off the chain! My 2 scrambled eggs with peppery bacon, home fries and multigrain toast was SO yummy. Just what you want in comfort food. The eggs were a perfect scramble, the multigrain toast was thick and hearty and the bacon was oh-so-scrumptious. The only teensy complaint? The home fries are just okay. They're screaming for some extra flavor of some kind. I was also lucky enough to get a nibble of my friend's polenta hash. Sweet mother of god, I'm ordering this the next time I come in. Huge chunks of veggies, poached eggs and polenta hash? Yes, please!! . . Service? Just okay. I believe our waiter came to take our order and drop off the bill. But its fine. My girls and I were having a private dish session about the previous night's activities, so we didn't really care for the interruption, but if you're a stickler for perfect service, Flo might not be your ideal destination. Personally, as long as my coffee cup is kept full (it was) I consider brunch service to be a-ok. . . The best part? I can walk there from my apartment. So the walk home can help burn off those extra bacon calories!
