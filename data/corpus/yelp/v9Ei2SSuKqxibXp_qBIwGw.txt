i really love this place. i really do...except ive only been here a couple times and i order the same thing. haha. i just really really love their cobb salad. i dont think ive had a better one yet!. the bacon and blue cheese really make the salad. the bacon is like a pork chip. and the cheese is not too overwhelming either. the best part is the balsamic dressing they have. everything goes so well together all the flavors mesh really well and makes my tastebuds really happy. . my bf had the curried chicken wrap. that was realy good as well. we also had various teas, but its the cobb that makes us want to go back. i heart alcove.
