Restaurant: Pasta Da Pulcinella
Category: Italian
I am so behind on reviews!. . This place was interesting.  I like the location, kind of tucked away in the midtown area.  The patio and inside had a very nice feel- rather intimate, kind of like being back in Europe. . . The food was fine. Not spectacular but not bad.  I think I am spoiled from having eaten Italian in native Italian communities. I was not overly impressed. The pasta and ingredients tasted fresh but I was not overwhelmed by the taste or texture. I had their signature apple and sausage dish. The mixture of tastes were really enjoyable, but it didn't "sweep me off my feet".  . . I also subtract a point because this seems to be a popular spot for younger folks (ie GATECH undergrads).  I don't mind them, but they greatly subtracted from the romance factor. . . I am willing to give this place another shot. It wasn't bad but could have been much better.
