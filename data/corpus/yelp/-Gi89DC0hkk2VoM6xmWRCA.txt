MMmmmmm truffle burger melts in your mouth, but for the price of the burger and the size, oh my lord I don't really know if its worth it. For the size of the burger and the price...i don't think it really goes hand in hand, but the truffle burger does taste delicious, but I don't know if it's really worth 12 dollars. Â It's a little steep in my eyes, but at least I tried it once :)
