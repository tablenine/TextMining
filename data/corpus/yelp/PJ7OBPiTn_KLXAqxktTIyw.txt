Restaurant: Green Sprout
Category: Vegetarian
Green Sprout was delicious. I had it delivered and the delivery guy was extremely friendly, but couldn't speak english well. Regardless, the delivery was relatively quick.. . I got Chicken Drumsticks, Mongolian Beef and coconut Bubble Tea. The drumsticks, as repeatedly mentioned on this page, were excellent. Mongolian Beef was alright, too sweet for my liking, and Bubble Tea was superb. The proximity to Emory and vast vegetarian menu will make this my favorite chinese place for the next few years.
