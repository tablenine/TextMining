Restaurant: The Flying Biscuit
Category: American (Traditional)
I was in Atlanta for a total of 4 days.  And yes, my co-worker insisted we eat here twice.. . First time we came here I had a mexican omelette dish which was very good.  I went with a side of fruit and a biscuit, and thought the biscuit was great, especially with the jelly that came with it.  I didn't like the hashbrowns my colleague got I would avoid going with the potatoes - way too mushy.  . . The next day I came back to lunch.  I thought the chicken BLT was good, as was the potato soup I got with it, but definitely a very heavy lunch and I came back to my hotel in a food coma.  Overall, I loved the decor of the place (check out the cute purple chandelier in the women's bathroom) but only 3 stars because I didn't like much of the menu.
