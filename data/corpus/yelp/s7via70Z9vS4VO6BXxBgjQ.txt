One word = AMAZING. One of the best, if not the best gastropubs in LA. My husband and I come here everytime we are in the area. We always get our usual = burger + sweet potato fries + good beer. Things couldn't be easier. Friendly and knowledgable staff are everywhere making sure you're happy. Tip if you are a newbie: DO NOT ask for condiments for your burger. Its a no no.
