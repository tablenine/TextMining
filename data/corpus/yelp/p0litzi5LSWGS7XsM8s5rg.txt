Restaurant: Rodan
Category: Nightlife
Is it a bird, is it a bar, is it restaurant?  Its all of the above.. . AMBIANCE. First, its named after the Japanese movie monster Godzilla ally and sometimes pain-in-the-scale, whose bird-like, pteranodon features gave it the name Rodan, not to be confused by the progenitor of modern sculpture, french artist Auguste Rodin (pronounced the same way).. . Beyond the name, the place is a modern Japanese hipster restaurant bar with a well stocked set of liquor and beer.  Very adequate seating and not too dark.  . . MENU. It has a large selection of Asian influenced food which I did not see too much of because I drank too much.  We did order the pork satay (nicely spiced good sized slices of grilled pork) and the pork cigarette rolls (tighlty rolled pork eggrolls in a thin waferlike shell).  Both were very well done and I will have to go back to try the rest.. . CAVEATS. It will get super-crowded, but this is a GOOD thing - but if you get there early or on a weeknight (which I think is the best time to go), you should go.. . All in all, a good place to start or end the night, even if Chicago is under a giant monster threat.  In fact, better yet.
