Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Meh. I've experienced better. . . That pretty much sums up this review.. I waited for 2 hours expecting to devour something AMAZING. . Unfortunately, the prime rib and mashed potatoes were both dry. . . This was a DRY experience. Or maybe I'm not a fan of prime rib? . I'd choose Houston's over Lawry's any day.
