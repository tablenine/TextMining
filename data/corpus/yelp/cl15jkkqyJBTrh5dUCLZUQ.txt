Restaurant: Maggiano&#39;s Little Italy
Category: Italian
In town for a quick conference the other day, and ended up having lunch and breakfast at Maggiano's. Not because it is good, but because Buckhead is a desert of culinary options, and actually because it was too cold to walk to the Palm.. . The food is ok, and the prices are appropriate, but the dining area was so filthy. I really don't dig on that whole "clear your own table" thing, especially during the morning hours when everything is so sticky. . . Bonus: the coke tasted great. I don't know what was up with their machine, but it was better than any other fountain coke I've had. Except McDonalds. Say what you want about the golden arches - there are few things more enjoyable than a medium fountain coke from Mickey D's. I wish I had went there for lunch. And breakfast.
