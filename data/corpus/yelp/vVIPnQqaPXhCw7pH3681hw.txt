Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Palms Thai is a fairly large restaurant with the famous Thai Elvis is much skinnier than Graceland Elvis but somehow the voice booming out -sounds remarkably similar. I was Â a little disappointed that Thai Elvis did not do any Thai versions of good classics but the singing was pretty good. Perhaps he could have cracked some jokes with the audience too.. . Now the food- I have to admit it was good. I wanted to not like it for the gimmicky Elvis. Or the fact that its huge and impersonal...but the curry , the bbq chicken were all fairly authentic and I would actually just go for the food.. . great for a fun date- not too good for group conversation as unlike most asian restaurants they have long rectangular tables not round ones.
