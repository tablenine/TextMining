1st, they let us make reservations for 10 in their small cozy place and the service was spot on.  Our waiter was chill and came back THREE times to check if we were ready with our wine choices.  Our group (except one) was unable to make entree choices bc everything sounded soo good.  . . We got a bottle of red which I didn't try and a yummy delicious Riesling to start off while they served us little baguettes brushed in olive oil and seasoned with salt and rosemary.  The headcheese was like chunky pate and very savory.  I ended choosing the polenta mainly for the truffle mascarpone cheese and mushrooms which I highly recommend ($16).  The bite of polenta cake, cheese, arugula, pearl onion and freakin awesome sauce was quite heavenly. The macaroni and cheese was alrite.  I had a bite of my friend's maytag blue cheese/caramelized onion burger ($15) and it was SO GOOD.  The bun actually held up and wasn't soggy.  . . Overall it's on the pricey side so don't come unprepared but the food is pretty awesome and original.
