I read a lot of reviews here on Yelp that read something like "I'm from Philly and these cheesesteak's ain't philly cheesesteaks" or "I'm from Chicago and this deep-dish pizza ain't Chicago deep-dish pizza" or  I'm from Scotland and  this haggis is not Scottish haggis".  Inside I always kind of frown when I read this because I usually don't care if they think it's authentic - is it good?  Well, here is my chance to jump on  the bandwagon.. . The claim to fame of  this place seems to be the pulled pork sandwich - hence the name "Oinkster", even  though they have a lot of other  things on the menu.  Well, I lived in North Carolina for 10 years and I am VERY familiar with bar-b-qued pork - be pulled, chopped, sliced, pureed (just kidding).  Trying to live by my own words, I wanted to judge the Oinkster Pulled Pork Sandwich on it own merits. Unfortunately, those merits were disappointing.  The pork was so juicy, like it had been sitting in a puddle of of pork juice, that it seemed like it had been boiled, rather slow cooked.  The juice quickly overwhelmed the roll it was served on and resulting in a greasy mess. On top of that it was damn near flavorless.  No smoky flavor. No meaty flavor.  No faint, but distinct tang of vinegar and pepper. Disappointing indeed.  Still, it wasn't "bad", just not that great.  That said, despite what others have said, I did like the fries a lot - skinny and crispy.  As others have noted, the garlic aioli that is served with them is tasty but overwhelming.  I'd stick with the Ketchup these bad boys unless you want exude garlic for he next few day.. . I will also say that I like the look of the place - it reminds me on old school fast food joints, and for what it is, that is a good thing.  The also get bonus points for not only having beer on  the menu, but decent beers at that.
