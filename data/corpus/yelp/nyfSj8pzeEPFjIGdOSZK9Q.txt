Yum!! I always get extra back fat and some sort of combo that includes even more pork. The worst part about this place is having to wait outside while smelling all the pork ramen goodness teasing your very soul. The kitchen is very fast pace and it's a wonder how much the chefs can get done in such a small area. Once you get in I promise you will ravage your ramen as soon as it lands on your table. Only reason I did not give this place a full five stars is the sometimes lengthy weight.
