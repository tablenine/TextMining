I have eaten here many of times. The sushi is always fresh. Service is always quick and friendly. and you never have to wait to be seated even being in the heart of the Highlands. One of the best places in Atlanta for Sushi but I wish Mirror of Korea was still open which was right around the corner... There are no AUTHENTIC sushi restraunts left in the city... are there?
