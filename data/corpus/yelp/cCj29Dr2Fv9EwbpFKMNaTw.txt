A year ago - heck, even a few months ago, I'd be the last person you'd expect to see eating from a truck. Unlike some councilmen, I have nothing against them; I've just never had the opportunity. I eat out, drive to eat out, drive to get take out or get delivery. It's LA (and I could also talk about not eating from a food truck in NYC, but that would be blasphemy coming from a former NYCer yet again I ate out, cabbed out, or subwayed out but I digress and this would take a whole 'nother review). . . So come to this week. I'm driving (again) and see this proverbial food truck on Olympic. The next day, I'm sitting at work and see the same truck parked in a lot across the way. I facebook about it being likely destiny and am prompted to try it out. So I do..... . And it's good. It's not phenomenal, but it's good. I like the tofu more than the meatier dishes - the soft tofu blends better with the vegetables, which surprisingly and generously cover both types of protein. There's a solid subtle taste of spice per bite. For $2 per taco and $5 burritos, that's a deal or not depending on who you ask. Also, I had the advantage of seeing the line dwindle and disappear before I ventured to the truck. I still doubt I'd spend more than half my lunch hour waiting in front of a food truck, but this one is worth trying at least once.
