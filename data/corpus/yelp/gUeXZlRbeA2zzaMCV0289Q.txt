Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
i gave into the hype and tried father's office last night - . . i ordered the bone marrow, father's office burger, zucchini potato soup and a couple of beers.. . i'll make this short and sweet - father's office is a def. must visit - the burger is out of this world - the patty is the best i've had anywhere and that onion goo spread is great and the spinach is a nice touch. the bone marrow is wayyy to oily for my taste and the soup was nice.. . however,. . the price is a tab bit high - $15 burger? $7 beer? i could eat 7 In N Out burgers or 6 from The Habit... it's a great place to grub but I wouldn't make it a habit of eating here often.
