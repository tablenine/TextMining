You come here for the view and the romantic vibe, not for the food so much. The food, is good, but the view! It's the only restaurant I found so far that has such a wonderful view of LA at night. . . I agree with the previous reviews, your friends from out of town will thank you for taking them here. It's one of those "spots" that they'll remember after a trip in LA. For locals, it's just another expensive Japanese restaurant. . . Impressed with:. - the view (yes, i really do like it). . Not Impressed with:. - Dining area, they really need to upgrade this part of the restaurant. It's old and even feels a little dirty for some reason.. - the Bang for your Buck, food is average but the price, you're really paying for your ambiance here. . - Parking- Valet only.
