i pass by this place every day on my way to/from work and i've always wanted to try it based off of the hype. everyone says its "amazing" and the wait is insanely long or getting a reservation is insanely hard. i figured that one day i'd have to get my ass down there to check it out. well that day was today. my bf and i got a reservation for 5:45pm. our first res was for 11pm!!!! that's all they had. but we were able to change it to 5:45 which is more reasonable, just on the other end of the spectrum. . . when we got there and walked inside i immediately realized how small it was. this must be part of the reason it's so hard to get a reservation. we were seated promptly next to a table of 4. we were literally RIGHT NEXT to them. they really pack you in at this place. . . the menu is full of random pizza ingredients which we had no idea what they were. so there were a lot of questions for our waiter. we finally agreed on a mushroom/cheese pizza and a prosciutto Â and arugula pizza. i really loved the mushroom one but the prosciutto one was weird because i thought the arugula would be slightly baked in. but no, it was just sitting on top. sort of like a salad. it was odd. it tasted pretty good but it was just odd. . . anyway, overall i would say that yes the place is good. the food is good. but waiting over an hour or eating really early or really late is not worth it. if you want to go maybe just book your res like 2 wks in advance and then you won't have to mess with your schedule just to eat there.
