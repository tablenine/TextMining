Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
Wow! This place is a unique food experience. CPOG does not do pizza traditionally or even how Chicago typically does deep dish. It is basically eating pizza (toppings, sauce, and cheese) out of a crust bowl, like a pizza pot pie. It is very tasty and filling especially if you try to consume the whole bowl afterward, but the best attraction for me on the menu is not the pizza. The Mediterranean bread is amazing, a seasoned flatbread the size of the table that the whole group can tear apart and consume while waiting for the main course. . . Last I was there they were cash only and they have never taken reservations so it is best to get in early and prepare for a half hour to 45 minute wait but its worth it.
