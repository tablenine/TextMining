this review is ONLY for their straciatella gelato.. . i could pretty much live on it for the rest of my life. . . every other item served at ugo is utter garbage. i've been back for the food after that first review i wrote and was equally disappointed. food sucks, dessert sucks.. . but that straciatella? it rules my world.
