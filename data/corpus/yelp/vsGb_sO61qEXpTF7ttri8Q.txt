Okay, on top of everything I wrote before, make sure you try their salad. The dressing so strangely... AMAZING! Something about the dressing, it's like crack. If you get a large size, it comes with their delish pizza bread too.. . P.S. Yesterday, I saw 3 couples (that came together) taking up the entire bar in the place sharing 3 Hainan Chicken and sipping 6 waters. I know we're asian and all, but PLEASE don't do this. It's like half their restaurant and the check is less than $20. So irritating.
