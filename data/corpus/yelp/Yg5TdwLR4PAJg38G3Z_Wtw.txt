Restaurant: Waikikie Hawaiian BBQ
Category: Hawaiian
I had driven past this place many times and finally decided to try it. I wanted to sample a wide range of items so I got a combo in addition to a teriyaki wings order. . . Some people have commented on how small the portion sizes are and I have to agree. In my combo I had like 2 short ribs and 2 thin pieces of Chicken which was a bit weak. . . That being said the macaroni salad was good and the wings were my favorite thing that I had here. . . For being the only Hawaiian BBQ option in Atlanta its not that bad and Ill be back.
