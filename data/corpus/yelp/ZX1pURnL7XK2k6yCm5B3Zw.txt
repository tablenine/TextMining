Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
went with co-workers to geisha house, we had a big party and got a nice round booth upstairs. it was sunday night so guess it probably is way more packed on the weekend nights... still, the atmosphere was really awesome, loved the random fireplaces in that column in the middle of the room. walking thru the doorway into the restaurant is cool... the service was really good but i dunno, the food was great but just nothing too special... not that much better than a good sushi place around town here in the bay area!! but we had fun and hey, we got to expense it to our firm!! :) first time i ever had sparkling saki.. pretty good!! Â deserts were yummy. :)
