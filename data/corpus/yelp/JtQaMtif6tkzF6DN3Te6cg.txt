I love this place!  The food is always delicious and has an asian/hawaiian influence that adds colorful flavors.  The short ribs are boneless and plentiful, leaving enough to take home for a sandwich the next day.  I had a venison special that was cooke medium rare and it melted in my mouth.  The hoisin-mustard crusted tuna is also one of my favorites.  The brunch is always good too...I recommend the banana and macadamia nut pancakes.. . The food isn't all.  Great atmosphere, and you can dress casual and relaxed.  The service is excellent also, makes me feel special even when I walk in with a baseball cap.  The place is affordable for me as they always have coupons in the mail, and I also go to . http://restaurant.com.  for $25 off.
