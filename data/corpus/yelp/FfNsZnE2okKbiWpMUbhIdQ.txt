Restaurant: Hashiguchi Jr.
Category: Japanese
I went to Hashiguchi Jr. the other night and I came away not very impressed. The prices were ridiculous for the size of the sushi rolls you got. Also the waitress neglected to bring out our appetizer. The sushi that we got was ok, nothing fantastic. Slightly better than RuSan's because I don't think I was served any cat food. I'll stick to Sushi Avenue or if I'm feeling extra fancy, Hayakawa.
