Tried Sola last night.  Loved the atmosphere and the food was delicious, however the service could have been a little better, and the portions were a little too small...   We both had the cheese and grape sald for an appetizer, which was very light and very tasty. For my entree, I had the pork, which was absolutely incredible. It was a flight of 3 different cuts. The porkbelly was just about the most scrumptios thing I have eaten all year. My only complaint about the dish was that the portion was tiny. I seriously could have eaten 2 more plates of food. My date chose the duck, which was also top notch, and a perfect portion for her 100lb body, but I think I would have left hungry if chose that dish as well..   All in all, I was pretty impressed with the place. I was able to get a cupon for "buy one get one free" entrees through my office, so our total tab for: 2 appetizers, 2 entress and 3 glasses of wine came to $80 (without the cupon, it would have been about $120) This would have ben a 5 star rating had the waiter ben a little moe attentive, and the poritons about 30% larger. I mean come on, for $120, two people should both leave full. But that being said, the food was still dynamite!
