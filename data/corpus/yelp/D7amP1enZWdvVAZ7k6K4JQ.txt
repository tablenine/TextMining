Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
so after seeing fogo de chao being featured on the food network one night, i have not stopped drooling over the idea of actually going there, so finally, my husband and i venture into beverly hills and try this much hyped up place. upon seating, the waiter explains how the red/green system works, ask what you want to drink and then bring in the side dishes : fried polenta (yum), fried plantains (double yum!!), and the cheese puffs (yum yum yum!!!) ....these dishes never go half-full because they keep replacing them with new ones once you stick a fork in it!!! then comes the meat ...... once you get the green button up, the meat just keeps coming!!! i would say they come every 30 seconds .... the meats are awesome.... but indeed, the amount they come in and the frequency is quite overwhelming!!! by the time all the meats make their rounds, we were stuffed ... no room for seconds .... no room even for me to look at the salad bar!!!! my suggestion is to just resist the urge to say YES to the gauchos(no matter how cute they are) and actually put the red button up .... and when its RED ..make sure they dont pressure you into tasting that bacon wrapped filet mignon when you are still full to the brim! take your time .... let the food digest.....and linger there ... hah ... for the price ..($50 btw, w/out drinks).. you should be allowed to stay at least 3 hours!! Â i suggest ending your meal with the PAPAYA CREAM .... papaya has an enzyme that breaks down and digests protein real quick .... you wont be sorry .....you'll thank the waiter for bringing it over =) if you feel like exploding after all that meat, the papaya cream will be the cure ....... all in all, fogo was a good experience ..... we shouldve taken our time though instead of being gluttons and scarfing the meat down as fast as they fell on our plates ..........
