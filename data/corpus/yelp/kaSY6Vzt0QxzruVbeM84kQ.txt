Went on a Saturday morning before going to Madame Tussauds. There were a lot of people waiting, but we got a table within 15 minutes :] . . I ordered the muscle beach? I think that's what it was called :p Either way it was delicious. The organic tea that accompanied my meal was superb as well. Service was impeccable. Although they did forget our silverware they were very apologetic.. . I'm looking forward to coming by again and trying the brioche french toast..YUMM!!
