This place is awesome!  Great crowd, so diverse.  . . They have this black bean veggie sandwhich on marble bread with red peppers and mushrroms that is to die for!  (side of tots). . The only down fall to this place, the noise....a little loud, but with good food, plenty of beer and and a lively bunch, no problemo!
