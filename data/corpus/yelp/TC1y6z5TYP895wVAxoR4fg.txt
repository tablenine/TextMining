Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
THIS PLACE IS THE BOMB! The side dishes are delicious and flavorful. And you cannot forget about the meat.. . My friend brought me here when I visited him and the wait was long, it was kind of crowded, and the service was slow BUT I still love this place anyways. The food is so gooood. Never really had Korean BBQ this good before. I especially like the noodle wrap on the side so you can put your meant in there and dip it in the hot sauce or THE BOMBASS SESAME OIL SAUCE. I'm not sure if they have a place like this in Northern California but they need to bring that deliciousness up here because I need some in my life, constantly. Best Korean BBQ I ever had in my life. SOOOO MUCH MEAT. SOOOO WORTH IT!
