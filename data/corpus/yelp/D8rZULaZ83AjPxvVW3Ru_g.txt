Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
You just can't go wrong with a dessert place...especially Milk. You name it, they have it...from ice cream, coffee, cake, cookies, muffins, candy...etc. It's a sugar-lover's dream! (they also serve lunch items here, like salads and sandwhiches). . . With such a large selection, it's hard to decide. Rest assured that whatever you're in the mood for, they'll probably have it. My recommendations so far...the blue velvet cake, their ice cream sundaes, and croissant bread pudding. Not just good...orgasmically good! They make a mean cup of java...and their milkshakes are awesome. There is something for everyone.. . Milk is a small shop, seating is limited, and you're better off taking it to go. Staff are extra friendly, and the atmosphere is fun. Parking is a hassle, as there are only metered street parking. But it is well worth the time if you are in the area. I wish it was open later than 10pm on weeknights. Prices are fair, and Â the selection outstanding. The quality is top notch. For those looking to get their sugar fix, Milk is the place for you. No need to feel guilty, just walk it off later. Come check it out!
