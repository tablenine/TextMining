Category: Barbeque
$15 all you can eat ... what more can you ask for :o). . I typically try to avoid peak meal times when i come here because it gets extremely crowded and stuffy.  Also, anticipate a wait if you plan to come on a Friday or Saturday night.  They do try to load you up on the sides and salad but don't fall for it just have them pile on the meat :o)  Do save some room for the steamed egg that they bring out towards the end and the sweet rice tea.. . Don't wear nice clothes because you'll smell like BBQ for the next 8 to 12 hours or until you take them off ... lol . . I do agree with everyone that the service is not so great and valet is a little sketchy but i can deal for some yummy BBQ.
