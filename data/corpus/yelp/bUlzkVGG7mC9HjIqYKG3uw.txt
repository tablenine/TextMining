Amazing food and atmosphere. I came here with a couple of friends. We had a couple of drinks at the bar prior to being seated. We had the procuitto pizza, mussels w/chorizo and the gnocchi. All the dishes are all good. But you must try the mussels. It was excellent!! This restaurant reminds me of the time when i was in italy.
