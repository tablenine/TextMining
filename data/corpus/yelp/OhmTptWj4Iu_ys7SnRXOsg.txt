So, everyone is talking about the Happy Hour at Sun Dial and it has reminded me of my first visit to the Sun Dial.  It was what my creepy date had hoped would be prelude to a night cap in his room, a few floors below...but that is a whole 'nother story!!!!. Anyway, I have only had cocktails in the bar and I must say on a clear night the view is amazing.  This is definitely a must visit, if you really want to wow some out of town guests.. The only negative (aside from my date that particular night) is that the drinks are expensive.  Be prepared to drop some major cash, if you plan to stay for any length of time.
