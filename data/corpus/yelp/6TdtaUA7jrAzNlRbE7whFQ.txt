The burger was good. It's really just not up to the hype, that's all.. . I had the green chili burger, because (as my list of best burgers shows) my #1 favorite hamburger in the WORLD is a New Mexican green chili burger from Albuquerque. I wanted to see if this one was going to be my local heart throb... but it didn't even come close.. . The fries are the fun part- because you get fun dipping sauces. Here's a tip: go with a date so you BOTH smell like garlic! De-lish.. . But the burgers were good, and no better than that. I recommend it to people who are in the neighborhood and want to walk to a good burger joint. However, Fatburger is just as close...
