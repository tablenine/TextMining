Restaurant: Serpas
Category: American (New)
My brunch at Serpas was not so good. The food was below average, but high priced. I heard that the other meals here are wonderful. Normally, I would like to come back for super, as I usually give a restaurant a second chance. However, our waiter was just terrible. At least I didn't have the waiter at the next table. He spilled drinks all over two customers and their infant child. For me, if I have bad food and bad service, I don't go back to a restaurant. . . I will be blunt; my experience at Serpas was bad.
