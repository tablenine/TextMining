I never heard of this place surprisingly. It's a small little diner across the street from the west side pavillion. I recommend this place if your in the mood for a greasy burger (Don't wear your fancy clothes here unless you want them to smell like grease). Both the steak and hickory burger are great if you need to cure that hangover or cravings for something greasy. The pies are nothing special either but they seem famous for those. So if you have time, try to stop by at least once.
