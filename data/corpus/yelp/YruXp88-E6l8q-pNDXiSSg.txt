The people who said the burgers are good are not lying.  I wasn't really feeling the vibe when someone suggested SFU, since none of my usual favorites (combo tacos, gazpacho, grouper fingers) were sounding that good.  So I opted for the burger with bacon and avocado.  Very generous burger, very juicy!  I think the avocado and bacon made it excellent, since the meat itself didn't seem to have too much seasoning.  The meat and toppings definitely overwhelm the bun, which ended up soggy from all the juiciness (a good problem to have, but still a problem in my book).  The fries were also too soggy for my taste, as was the okra.  Maybe it just took me so long to put a dent in the massive burger that by the time I got to the sides, all the grease had soaked in and made them soggy.. . We'd had the oysters to start.  Decent enough, however, it the crackers didn't show up for a while, so we were forced to ask the guy at the table next to us who had a whole basket of crackers and had not touched them in 20 minutes if we could take his.  Fortunately, we agreed, else we would have been staring at raw oysters getting warmer while we drank all the beer that was meant to wash them down.
