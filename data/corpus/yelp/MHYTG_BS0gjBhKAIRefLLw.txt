Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I recently had my first visit to Lawry's The Prime Rib... one of many stops on my current Beef Binge...  . . I had the Lawry's Cut of prime rib... not too thick... not too thin.  I saw a man at another table get the Diamond Jim Brady Cut... it was huge!    Gave me the willies.  . . I loved their famous Spinning Bowl Salad and the Yorkshire pudding was awesome.  Side dishes are standard steakhouse fare... creamed spinach... creamed corn... buttered peas... mashed potatoes.  . . Vegetarians don't have to be excluded from the Lawry's experience.  Their menu features a Vegetarian Special... this night happened to be wild mushroom raviolis.. . An interesting experience... You feel like you've stepped into a restaurant stuck in a time-warp.  Very old-school, but in a good way... service was great and attentive.    Food is great.. . Lawry's is definitely a special occasion restaurant.  Great for birthdays.  I brought a cake to the restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday.  Our server brought it over for dinner and sang.  It was a delightful surprise for my mom.  There was a $1.50 per slice cutting fee though!  Not a problem for a party of 4, so take that into consideration if you have a large party.
