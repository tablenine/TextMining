Umm, no.  Check, please or not....this place is not good to me!  . . The menu is super barren--I kind of had to force myself to order something.  . We started off with the mushroom dumplings.  What a strange flavor these things had; the accompanying sauce didn't help its case.  NEXT.. . For our 'entrees' chose the ramen noodle type dish with pork belly.  It just had an odd flavor to it.  I think it was the herbs used for the broth, but it really reminded me of an ancient Chinese or Korean medicinal root.  . . We also got the short rib dish.  If I had to come back to this restaurant, I would only order that again.  The short ribs were sufficiently flavored and seemingly grilled.  It was tasty even though I am not a short rib fan (too much fat) and the serving was pretty small.. . Oh yea, the seating was communal and uncomfortable, the restaurant was cold.  The staff was very nice.. . I have no idea why I try fusion type spots, aside from my tried and true...
