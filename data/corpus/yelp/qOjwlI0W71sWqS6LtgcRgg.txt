Restaurant: Houston&#39;s Restaurant
Category: American (New)
I went to a chain restaurant twice in a week; this was my second.. First thing that I didn't like: they didn't have an apple martini.  That's ok...had a cosmos. The plan was to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen for 2 years but the noise level at 8pm on a weeknight was insane.  People were screaming at each other at the top of their lungs.. Since we couldn't have a conversation, we just decided to get some dinner before we both turned deaf in the bar area.. I realized my friend was an idiot when I told him we should get the bizarre non-Japanese sounding rolls: shrimp and macademia rolls.. His response: Sushi frightens me.. First of all,  rolls aren't true "sushi".... but I realized it was pretty useless explaining that to him.. What I had: artichoke appetizer and a rack of ribs $ 20 something.. My friend had salmon with brussels sprouts with brown sugar. ew. My ribs with skinny fries were good, but arrived lukewarm.. Tasted his fish and sweet brussel sprouts...unremarkable.. Company was a little off too.... We argued about his religion. (which religion? can't tell you Yelpers) He lectured me on HIS superior faith..  He asked me who my favorite candidate was. (which one? can't tell you Yelpers)  I told him...ooops.  We debated heatedly for a while, then.... It was a day after the Spitzer scandal broke out.  He said: All guys cheat on their gfs and wives anyway...at least he didn't get caught with a transgender lover or something.         . Strongly discouraged : discussing politics, sex, and religion over dinner... chain restaurant or not.
