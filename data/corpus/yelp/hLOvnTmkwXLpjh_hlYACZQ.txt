Restaurant: Taste on Melrose
Category: American (New)
I love this little cute restaurant!! For appetizer I usually get their pear and gorgonzola pizzette (or whatever they call it) And I absolutely LOVE the pork chops here..It comes with their yummy mac&amp;cheese w/ truffle oil.. mm mm mm mmm. Â They've yet to fail on their specials (at least the ones I've tried) and their Aphrodisiac menu was sooo yum! The price is decent and the wait staff is fun and diligent. Parking can be a bitch but hey, that's what you get for going to a restaurant on melrose &amp; la cienga right? Or you can always valet. They have a great selection of wine as well. If you want to eat a good meal in a fun atmosphere at a decent price go to taste!
