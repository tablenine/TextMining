Went to Zenkichi on a wednesday night .. didnt know what to expect becoz i don't know anyone personally who's been there but read a few reviews and it seemed nice.. We got there at 8:30.. it was very quiet n nice.. totally not what i expected..  it has a series of small private booths.. great for celebrating.. n there's a lil buzzer on the table so every time u want to call the server just buzz!. We got the omakase.. .n were very glad... it was very different from what iv normally eaten at a sushi restaurant but it was very nice. im not someone who can eat smelly fish or very slimy fish but this food was great! Be sure to tell ur preferences to the server and they can substitute it with something milder.. they just replaced one thing for me- rest was usual.. We also did a sake tasting- 3 different one's for $18... so worth it coz i have no experience with sake but each one of those was great.. All in all we had a lovely, romantic, delicious dinner.. n its very well priced- paid about 75 pp.. . Highly recommended.. specially to celebrate something.. . P.S- Its not child friendly.. they tell u that when u make reservations.     (no kids below 14)
