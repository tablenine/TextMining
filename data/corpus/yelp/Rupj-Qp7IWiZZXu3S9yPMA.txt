Restaurant: Papa Cristos
Category: Greek
A great restaurant with greek cuisine tastes and desserts.. this is where they filmed the movie "my big fat greek wedding".. I wasn't really too thrilled with the movie, but their gyros are awesome! Â This is as authentic as you can get! People are friendly and jolly... Great prices! Parking is a real bitch, even though you have a parking lot right around the back. It's not the restaurant's parking lot, they seem to share with a lot of different stores around it. . . once again, u want authentic greek food, this is it!. . try to meet papa cristo, he's a jolly cute man~*
