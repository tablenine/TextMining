Restaurant: Bar Celona
Category: Wine Bars
One of the first restaurants I dined at since moving to California.  It was nice sitting outside on a Sunday afternoon, taking in the sights and sounds of Colorado Ave, but as for the tapas, they were just average.  . . I love a good tapas place cuz you get to try all different tastes and textures, instead of having just one plate to pick at for your whole meal. But Bar Celona was just whatever. Their steamed mussels were good, but their ahi salad was just okay.  Prolly shouldn't have ordered the ahi tuna salad at a Spanish restaurant but our server recommended it. We also got a combo plate that had a little bit of everything: spanish tortilla, lamb empanada (good), and some chicken thing, don't really remember. Sangria was decent, but Bar Celona, for its location and price could do much better. Menu is sorta small compared to other tapas places i'm used to. And I think all tapas places should have bacon wrapped dates!!. . I guess since they prolly get a lot of business from just the foot traffic on Colorado, they manage to get by with sub par food. Unfortunately, that just doens't cut it for me! Adios!
