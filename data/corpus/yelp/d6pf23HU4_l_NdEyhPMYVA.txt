I guess I just don't get the Bill Kim lovefest.  I tried giving his new endeavor a shot after being severely disappointed at Urban Belly because I was interested in his take on the Kogi craze in LA.(which I was unimpressed with during my trip to LA a couple months ago) . Three of us ordered the kogi, lemongrass chicken, and meatball sammiches with sides of tostones, maple glazed butternut squash with pho spices and the brussels sprouts with chorizo.  Without drinks, this set us back $50.  I thought it was a little expensive considering the portion size of the sides but it wasn't too bad.  After we got our sammiches, we noticed that only my meatball sammiches was put together.  The Kogi and lemongrass chicken were, for some reason, separated parts for you to put together yourself.  Maybe I'm just ignorant but what's the point of that???  And there was only meat and bread, no vegetables or anything.  For a $10 item, can a brother get some lettuce!. Flavor wise, the Kogi tasted like bulgogi that you can get anywhere.  Pretty uninspired if you ask me.  The lemongrass was nothing special according to my friend.  My meatball was good.  I like the gingery meatballs and the noodles inside the pita actually tasted great.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  The tostones were very good, as was the butternut squash.   The brussels sprouts in chorizo that other yelpers seem to love, disappointed.  It disappointed in that if you are looking for a combination of the two flavors, you ain't gonna taste it.  All I could taste was chorizo.  Luckily I love chorizo so it didn't bother me much but go order it expecting to taste brussel sprouts (which for some might be a good thing). I probably won't be going back even though the food was just OK.  And service?  What service? You do everything yourself except get the food from the kitchen.
