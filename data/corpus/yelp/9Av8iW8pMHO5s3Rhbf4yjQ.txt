OK, we got caught up in the hype after seeing The Oinkster on TV.. . My sweetie and I went to Eagle Rock on Saturday night, stood in line with 20 to 30 people and had Saturday night dinner here.. . We had:. Oinkster pastrami. Pull Pork BBQ sandwich. Belgium Fries. Cold Beers. . For a local burger stand, I give it the thumbs up. The 2 sandwiches were done well and a beer along with the sandwich hits the spot.. . From Pasadena for us, this is a local joint. I usually go to The Hat for a pastrami locally, but I will go here from now on.. . Don't get carried away and think that The Oinkster's pastrami is up to par with Langer's in the MacArthur Park area of LA, but for a close by place to go, this is just fine.. . The line moved along, and once you ordered your food, it was served fairly quickly.. . Lot's of little kids were running around. The menu is not really set up for kids..Classic Hamburger 1/3 pound $ 4.75 and small fries $ 2.25.. . Good experience.
