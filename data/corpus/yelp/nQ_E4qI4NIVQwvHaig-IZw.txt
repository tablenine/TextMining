I loved Real Food Daily for years before I moved to LA.  Now that I am here I am likely to eat here between 1- 3 times a week...depending on my schedule and budget.. . The restaurant itself is clean and bustling.  My husband and I generally prefer to sit on the patio when it's possible since the dining room can be very loud and busy in the evenings.. . My all time favourite is the Club Sandwich, with either the potato salad or caesar salad on the side.  The caesar can often be too lemony, but it comes with delectable blue corn croutons that have a touch of sweetness that is great addition to the salad.  . . My husband is a meat eater but loves the tempeh meat loaf, with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes.  He orders it ALL the time.  He recently tried the linguine with tempeh meatballs which he said was also tasty.. . Also recommended:. -TV dinner with seitan, mashed potatoes and caesar salad. -the burrito. -any of their weekly specials. -their vegan chocolate chip cookie.  delish.. . Not so tasty;. -the pick it yourself rice bowl which i've done a few times -  the tofu was kind of dry and hard and the veggies seemed old and oversteamed.  i don't love any of their dressings, either. -the yin yang salad - not bad but nothin' special. -soba noodle thing - their peanut sauce is not especially tasty. -the hummous. - peach cobbler - almost inedible.  . . We often have the same few servers and they are amazing, knowledgeable and friendly.  One time I had to resist wanting to bitch slap of the idiotic, rude and annoying host dudes, but he is thankfully not often there. . . Delish.
