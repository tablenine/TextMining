Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm an originalist, and I had to learn the hard way at Pink's.. I got the Lord of the Rings (Hot Dog with Onion Rings and BBQ) while my friends got the the Planet Hollywood (Polish dog with cheese, bacon, chili, and CANNED mushrooms). The menu is massive; it will definitely overwhelm the first timer. Who would have thought you could add so much to the humble hotdog? Oh well, only in America.... My girl and I are semi-clean freaks, so try picturing two girls eating their hotdogs with a fork and knife. Yeah, definitely not the experience I was hoping for. I did try her polish dog, and it has that nice meaty texture that you're always hoping a polish dog would give you.. So about three bites in, I said "screw it," took off the onion rings, and dug in. The hotdog Â itself is really good; that nice crunch of the casing and the complimenting warm, soft hot dog bun only added to the junk food euphoria I was in. MMM, drool. Wash it down with a nice bottle of soda (I always thought soda tastes better in a glass bottle), and you're good to go.. Oh yeah, we also ordered the chili fries. Really good, if you're in an excessive fatty mood. The fries are seasoned man!. Bottom line:. Be an originalist, just get a hot dog and add your own trimmings.
