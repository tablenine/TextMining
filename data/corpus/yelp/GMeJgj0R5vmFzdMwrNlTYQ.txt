I'm not a fan of spicy, but even the #6, the second least spicy was more spicy than I expected. I think if you get a Special #2. the soup becomes yellow-orange.. . Adding extra ingredients adds up quickly. I added like three (egg, cha shu, bean sprouts) and the bowl of ramen was over $10!. . The cha shu was very good with the noodles. Overall, the ramen bowl was pretty good. I wish there was more noodles but it would cost more to add noodles so I didn't add any. . . For non-spicy ramen eaters, it's not worth $10-12 for a ramen! However without considering money, it was a satisfying meal.
