Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
Where do I start? When you walk into Manna, you definitely feel like you have entered another country.... the layout is a trip with large tents that resemble an outdoor market in a faraway land. The banchan (sides) are all incredible. My mates said the beef was decent but the pork was icky. I thought the chicken was awful. And everyone is right... service is horrible unless you are a huge party. They work best with a large table.... otherwise you wait. On our way out, we passed the kitchen. It reminded me of a scene right out of Hostel..... with a lady butchering meat, surrounded by buckets of parts. Crazy. 2 1/2 stars. Maybe worth trying once for the experience. A fun night but meat is way, way better at other AYCE Korean places.
