Coming here on a Sunday is a daunting task and I might also have to say insane!.  After the long wait and the chit chat with some douchebag about his script about to get produced We got sat and were given the moderate service that a super busy restaurant is bound to and in predictably slightly too long wait our food came. I had what the menu calls, "The After School Special" tomato soup and a grilled cheese. Not daring, not fancy just satisfying.. I kept thinking that there was some actress from a crumby Disney program sitting next to me but i withheld my urges and did not throw feces on her. i thought about jumping up and down on her table too but my companions would not have liked that; they're a bit conservative
