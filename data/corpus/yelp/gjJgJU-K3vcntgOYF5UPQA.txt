I used to come here in high school around 2 am with my friends like 2 years ago. It was one of those places we'd take a 40 minute drive to just because we didn't want to go home.  The lines were long and usually there were interesting people to talk to. Don't get the regular chilly cheese dog. It's not worth it. Or the chilli fries. But even though the fries are average, I usually get it because an unhealthy meal is not complete without a Yoohoo! and fries.. . I forgot the name of the dog  I got last week b/c its so damn long. Something like uhh Swiss Cheese Pastrami Polish dog? My bf and I fought over the last piece. Literally.. it was so dumb. . . Pretty much, try to get the things that are out of the ordinary so you'll feel like you enjoyed your meal more. Other than that, go to Costcos or something if you just want to play it safe. Oh, and go with friends. I think it's the trip that makes it exciting.
