Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
Be prepared to wait a long time for a table at Din Tai Fung, bring a book, a snack, whatever it takes.  This place is worth the wait and xiao long bao is their claim to fame.   Xiao long baos are pork soup dumplings that come in a large bamboo steamer and served with ginger and soy sauce.    . . Tricks to eating the delicious yet dangerous dumplings:. . 1. Technique: You can eat them in one bite (Caution: see number 2 below). Or you can also place the dumpling on a soup spoon, hold the dumpling with your chopsticks and pierce the wrapper with your teeth.  Suck out the soup first and then eat the remaining pork and wrapper from your spoon.  . 2. Bravery and patience: The broth is hot and it will burn you.  Just be patient and not pop them in your mouth as soon as they come of the kitchen.  . 3. Be prepared:  Like the boy scouts, always be prepared.  Bring a band aid and another shirt.  No matter what you do, you will get pork broth all over you.
