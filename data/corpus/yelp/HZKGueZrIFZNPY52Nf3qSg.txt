Restaurant: Osteria Mozza
Category: Italian
After living a year in LA and hearing rave after rave about Mozza Osteria I finally had my experience. And that is exactly what it was, an out of this world experience for the palate. . Ordering an appetizer is a must, I can't remember the name of it but the description of the dish will have you convinced. It's a sort of pancake that's made from a minestroone soup that is soaked in bread, then fried and served with melted cheese. It's savory and delicious. We also ordered from their famous mozzerella bar, I can't explain how a cheese so basic can be so light, I will never take mozzerella forgranted again. . For entrees I recommend the quail and lamb, both meats I would normally never eat but when in Rome. The sauces in each dish really bring out the flavors in the meat yet mild down the gamey taste. You can really taste all the different layers of flavor. Trout was also supreme, who ever thought trout could melt in your mouth the way bass does. And talk about a very extensive wine list. The wine menu alone was a 10 page book. The food here is so so awesome.. The restaurant decor is nice and comfortable and the staff is very attentive and knowledgeable. This place is worth every penny!
