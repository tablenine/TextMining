Restaurant: Panes Bread Cafe
Category: Sandwiches
Can you say "Monster Cookie?". . Panes always has the freshest ingredients and they make everything from scratch so the food does take a little bit longer then fast food. The prices here are phenomenal and the portion sizes are great. A huge sandwich and a bag of chips for $5.00, that is a deal in today's world of F&amp;B. Another thing to note, try their great soups of the day. it changes randomly, but do not miss the Tortilla, Black Bean or Corn Chowder. If you are making dinner at home, stop and pick up a fresh baked baguette or a loaf of sourdough. . . The Key - If you are taking out, call ahead and it will be ready when you get there and all of the people waiting will look at you with envy. I have the number programmed in my phone.
