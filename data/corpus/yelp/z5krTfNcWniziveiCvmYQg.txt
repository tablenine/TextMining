Restaurant: Jerry&#39;s Sandwiches
Category: Sandwiches
I am so glad to live near Jerry's! We love the millions of variations of sandwiches and beer! Plus they have some nice lemonade and other special non-alcoholic drink specials (which makes me happy since I don't tolerate alcohol too well).. . My favorite is the egg salad sandwich on the pretzel roll - the homemade potato chips are perfectly crisp and a bit spicy and I also like the mac and cheese side dish. The baked beans are also yummy and not at all like the canned ones.. . I would be sure to ask if the sauce on the sandwich is on the sweet or savory side. They seem to like to make their sandwiches with some sweet sauces, which don't always appeal to me and its not clear on the menu. For instance I had the tandoori chicken sandwich and it did not taste like tandoori chicken - it tasted like one of those thanksgiving turkey sandwiches, where they think its avant garde to put canned cranberry sauce in the turkey sandwich. I am sure the ingredients were good, I just don't dig sweet sauce in my sandwiches that are suppose to be savory.. . Oh we sat at the bar and watched the bar tender make bloody mary's - the guy mashed up in the base of a pint glass: onions, cilantro, and jalapeno peppers. Then he added ice and filled it nearly 1/2 with vodka and then poured in the Tabasco brand bloody mix after adding Worcestershire and lots of Tabasco - it looked amazing! I think I will have one next time - but sadly with little to none of the vodka...
