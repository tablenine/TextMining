So I'd seen this place several times on my treks to Latin Thing (right next door!!) and with the mixed reviews, wasn't sure what to expect.  At first sight, the place was packed with the half a dozen stools full and with the line of patrons waiting for their sandwiches stretching to the front door.  This was a good sign.  What I couldn't understand was why there was a line in the first place.  Now, I realize that fresh sandwiches are great.  BUT is it that bad to make a Banh Mi earlier that day and have it waiting for clients, esp when you get that busy and your space is that tiny.  Or at least, have a couple premade sandwiches for anyone in a hurry.  . . In any case, the owners probably have adjusted things since they've opened and here's how they fared on my scorecard:. . - Bread - quite good, I didn't have any issues with the bread being too crusty, in fact, it was very soft.  . - Pate/terrine - uhm, did not like.  Sorry. I wasn't sure whether they had mixed the pate with some mayo or other sauce but it wasn't pretty.. - veggies - very good (cucumber, cilantro, picked carrots). - cha lua (pork roll - used to make this from scratch with my mom) - wish the slices weren't so thin and the portions of this were a little more generous.. - sweetened pork sausage? - kind of like related to what you'd find inside a steamed meat bun, on a sweet side and kinda weird in a basic banh mi for me.. . Granted, what I think of when I think of a basic bahn mi is good baguette with a slight spread of terrine, several half-moon shapped slices of cha lua, some veggies and that's it.  I went with the Spicy Baoguette and for me, it barely registered on my spicemeter.  So take other people's comments on the spiciness relatively.   All in all, this is prob a 2.5 for me.
