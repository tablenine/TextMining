Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
"You have to be retarded to mess up a grilled cheese sandwich". . The boyfriend loves grilled cheese and was in love with the idea of the grilled cheese truck. However, fantasy and reality are often very different. The Grill cheese truck needs to get better ingredients and learn how to cook. . . We ordered: the regular grilled cheese, tater tots, the dessert melt, and tomato soup.. . How can you screw up grilled cheese sandwich? it's a sandwich!. What can't be excused: DRY, STALE bread served on their menu. We were shocked at first bite because it tasted like cardboard with cheese in the middle. Â The dessert was the same, dry, hard carboard bread with nutella &amp; other stuff smacked dab in the middle. Unappetizing. Undistinguisable. Yuck.. . Also, the tomato soup itself tasted like marinara sauce, the kind that you use to dip fried mozarella sticks. Gross!. .  I can seriously make better version of these things at home. . I want my money back.
