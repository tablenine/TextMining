I am very, very, very torn about my rating for Phillippe's. On one side of the spectrum, I am very disappointed that Phillippe's did not live up to expectations (damn you Food Network and Travel Channel for the hype!); on the other side of the spectrum, I kinda wanted another sammich from this place the day after I tried it. Also, their hot mustard is beast and I'm hating myself for not grabbing a bottle. . . Honestly, the draw for this place for me is it's location of being so damn far from me (yea, sounds weird to me too). Since LA/Chinatown is so damn far from SD, Phillipe's becomes a commodity to me. Since Phillippe's is so damn far and I really can't get to it, it makes me crave their sammiches even more. . . A true rating would be 3 1/2 stars, but I'm giving this place the benefit of a doubt with a generous 4 stars.
