Sausage-tastic fever!  You get to pick your sausage from the sausagery-case - they are a tiny bit pricey - 2 sausage, 2 frites &amp; 1 drink was about $30, but fancy-pants fever sausage, in a good way.  Serious French Fry Fever Magic!  Amazing french fries with a selection of ridiculously delicious and sinfully-plumpening dipping sauce.  I enjoy the bacon blue cheese.  OMG.  yes.   Perhaps not the wisest late-night-eatery-choice, as it sits with you for a while.   I lived in Holland for a year, and these frites equal the deliciousness and authenticity of Frites of Maastricht.   Go.  ps:  Awesome vintage soda-selection - pricy, but cool and tasty!
