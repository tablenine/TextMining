YUMMM. Newly obsessed.. . Came here on a busy Friday night only 45 minutes before a LACMA screening, so we were pretty anxious to eat and run. In fact, given our faraway parking spot, we were worried we wouldn't make it! But I'm happy to let everyone know that our order was taken within 5 minutes of being seated, and our burgers served within 15 minutes - pretty good for a full restaurant, I think. . . I wish that we had more time to enjoy our meal - I had the truffle burger, and I don't know what was in it (mushrooms? some crunchy thing? I scarfed that ish down) but it was seriously droolworthy. It was perfectly juicy, and despite its small size, definitely got you full. I also tried the sweet potato fries, which were pretty good... though I'm biased towards The Counter fries. . . Definitely coming back soon to try more burger options with the Milk ice cream sandwiches... which, strangely enough, sound like a great combination.
