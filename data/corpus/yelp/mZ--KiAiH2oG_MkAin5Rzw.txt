Inventive Tacos - always a good sign. We had the salmon and pesto; the ahi tuna with mango; and the duck with sweet corn salsa. Three tacos is plenty of food (per person). We loved the salmon and duck ones, but the tuna was average - surprising, considering it sounded so good on the menu. . . Their Paloma cocktail (tequila, fresh lime, grapefruit) was a nice touch, I'd definitely go back just for the cocktail. . . The service was reasonable, though perhaps a little terse at times, and the decor is pleasant without being too trendy feeling. I guess it just didn't feel incredibly special or super-gourmet, which at the time I had been hoping for....
