Restaurant: The Apple Pan
Category: Burgers
I love this place. It's so good. The pie has this incredible crust that just adds to the amazingly delicious apple filling. The pie is just right and not too sweet or overwhelmed with that gooey sugary stuff. The burgers and fries are good too and the service is prompt and direct.. . Although our server was like the soup nazi from Seinfeld, he was cool. To sum it up, my friends and I put it like this, "It was the fastest, best meal I've ever had." And that's no joke. We were in and out of there in a matter of 20 minutes. That including fries a burger and a piece of the apple pie a la mode style.. . and Dont be impatient with the wait for some counter space. The turnover rate is impressively quick. You have to stay and feel out the surroundings, it totally adds to the ambiance and the nostalgia of the food.. . Enjoy!
