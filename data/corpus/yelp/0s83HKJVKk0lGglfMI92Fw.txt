Definitely five stars. Even without any real frame of reference my taste buds tell me that I will not find another ramen joint better than this one. This place consistently delivers each time I go. Everything on the menu is great and prepared really well, even if the cooks in the back look like they're on parole. I usually order the combo set which comes with a bowl of crisp lettuce and onion salad (ask for the dressing on the side cause they drench it), a bowl of sushi rice with salmon egg on top, and a regular bowl of their other-worldly noodles. The broth is thick and delicious, noodles are cooked slightly past al-dente, and the pork just melts in your mouth. Even the green onions taste like they were cut seconds ago. Can't say enough good things about it.
