Restaurant: Maggiano&#39;s Little Italy
Category: Italian
So today at lunch was my first time stepping into this Maggianos, ironic, b/c I literally work next door (in the Sovereign building).  I can now say my experience wasn't "shout hallelujah" great, neither was it call the board of health bad.  It was- ok.. . I was slightly taken aback while I waited for my co-workers to come in from the wall art.  It was a picture of a dining hall in the 1920s, with a row of all black waiters/waitresses waiting in tandem as a crowd of fancy Caucasians ate their meals.  I mean, seriously?  I know that happened- but doe we need to be reminded of it in a Italian restaurant in 2008?  Maybe an oversight of management, but, yikes.. . That being said, my lunch of the Cobb Chicken Sand-which served with chips was pretty good!  The bread was slightly too small to hold the lightly battered chicken, avocado, red onions and arugula.  Which was OK, because I secretly licked my fingers.  . . My waiter, Andre, was friendly and attentive.  I was slightly bummed when he cleared my plate, only because i had a small handful of chips left.  Maybe he was secretly doing me a favor- since the sand-which portion was SO big.. . Will I go back- sure.
