This is by far the best sushi you will find anywhere. After eating here, I am completely ruined (read: spoiled) and I can no longer eat sushi from other sub-par places. I've taken 2 friends and my fiance on separate occasions and they all loved it as well.. . Sit at the sushi bar, the chefs are amazing and their fish is as fresh as can be.
