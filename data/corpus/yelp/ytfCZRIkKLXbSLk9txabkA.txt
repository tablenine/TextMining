Restaurant: Taqueria del Sol
Category: Tex-Mex
Apparently Yelp didn't know there was a Taqueria del Sol on Cheshire Bridge Road EITHER! I had to add the listing myself! I didn't know about it until on my way to a cut flower wholesale shop on Friday that's also off of Cheshire Bridge. Since I love TDS but HATE the attitude at the Howell Mill location, I decided I would give this one a shot.. . I was not let down. Same great food, a reeeealllly nice lady working behind the counter, a great guy that brought out my food and was oh so helpful in retrieving a bag and container for my leftover chips and quacamole.. . Oh and I only had to wait in line behind three people. No lines out the door here, at 1:00 PM, prime lunch time.. . Thank you thank you thank you God for this location, so that I can enjoy TDS closer to my work without the hassle of the rude people at Howel Mill!!!
