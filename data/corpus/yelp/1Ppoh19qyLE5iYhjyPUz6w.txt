FYI: As I'm writing this, I AM SHAKING in my chair waiting for the next time I choose to stop here-I CANNOT wait for the Blue Velvet Experience! So, with that said can some of you Milk alumni PM me a slice?. . My first Milk experience was the past Saturday night. We couldn't figure out a good dessert spot to go before deciding on a movie! Milk was proposed by the only one who'd been and I'm SOOOOOOO GLAD! Good spot (not for parking) on popular Beverly Blvd, nice place to talk and people watch =)  I ordered a shake which is my usual when I can't decide on a "NEW THING" at a new place. The chocolate shake was RICH and had the most delicious choc. crunchies on top! Yea, uuh...I finished the whole thing...no, seriously. . . Two words- AAAAH MAZING. one word- Blueberry Velvet Slice. . I am on a mission...I was gonna give 4 stars because we wanted to sit under the heater outside but the table was reserved for a "burnch" of peeps =\       ...next time!. . This place is worth it!
