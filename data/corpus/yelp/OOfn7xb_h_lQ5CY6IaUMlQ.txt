Love, Love, Love this place.... .    When we first walked in I was a bit surprised by the fact that there was a fridge with sausages, a register and four chairs. Luckily my exploratory nature helped to reveal the dining area in back. Even though we arrived at 10 the place was packed and we had to hunt for chairs. There are a few picnic tables set up in the middle for communal seating which I think is a great idea but the evening called for table seating arrangements. I loved that all of the chairs are mismatched and include everything from cinder blocks to low riding cushioned chairs ( I'm 5'4 and too short to sit comfortably in the cushy chairs, fyi). .   For munchies I had the duck, bacon, jalapeno sausage which was so, so yummy. My friend and I split the truffled fries which were good, but I have to admit, I would probably leave out the truffle oil next time. The beer was great and on a superficial note, I really like that each beer comes in a glass with the name of the beer you are drinking on it. I got the Duchess ale which was sweet and tangy and was a great substitute for my fist choice of the apple ale, which was tapped out. .   As a bay area lady I'll have to keep wurstkuche on my list of places to visit when I am in town. As much as I'd love to have a place like this in SF I think it's a uniquely LA establishment.
