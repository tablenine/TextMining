Restaurant: Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ
Category: Korean
Pretty good K-bbq. It's not AYCE, so expect to pay a little bit more. The waitresses speak English here and provide attentive service (unusual for a korean restaurant in general). The banchan is plentiful (not necessarily knock-your-socks-off, delicious) and meat is succulent. Â I didn't think it was THE BEST Kbbq in Ktown but it's pretty decent.
