Heaven on Earth. The Pancakes are Ginormous! One order of any pancakes can literally feed a village. Definitely considering sharing - sharing is caring.. . The wait for a table was long and my friends and I considered if it was worth it... and let me tell you my yelping friends - the wait is worth it! . . 5 stars across the board and an LA establishment that you should try at least once! I recommend the Golden Ticket Pancake that had banannas, struessel, carmel, walnuts and other yummy ingredients. . . Enjoy over-indulging at the Griddle!
