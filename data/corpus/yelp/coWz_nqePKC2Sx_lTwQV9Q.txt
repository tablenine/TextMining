Restaurant: Manuel&#39;s Tavern
Category: American (Traditional)
Those that live here in Atlanta all agreed that I needed to hit Manuel's early on. They sure weren't kidding. I feel it's like the American equivalent of an Irish Pub.. . What? I know you're thinking that. So let me explain. The food is always fresh and of good quality. It's also hearty and creative. One could actually take their family to this bar and not feel as though they're dooming their children to heart disease. You'd have to look at the menu to see what I mean.. . And of course this IS a bar, so the beer (and wine) matter. I'm not a beer guy, but when I go out with friends I never have had one not say that there's a specific beer they live for that they serve there. The wine selection, my own pick of poison, is short but good. Not cheap swill, not pretentious overpriced rotten grape juice. Just good flavor for the price wines, exactly what I like.. . I almost worry about giving it 5 stars as it'll just add to it's positive ratings and encourage more people to go here when it's already borderline full every time I go... but I also wouldn't want to keep it a secret and deprive folks of possibly the best bar in all of Atlanta.. . Oh, and yes, non-smoking is available. =)
