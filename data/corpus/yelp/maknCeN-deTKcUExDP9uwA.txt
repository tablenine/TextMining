Loved the fun and 'exotic' staff...so friendly...but the food was really, really mediocre.  Had the cheeseburger sliders and the crab cake sliders and didn't really like either.  Not offensive, but not very good either.  The sweet potato fries were delicious though.  So, go for people watching at the outdoor tables, but not for the food.  Too bad...there are too many great restos in Andersonville so don't waste your time at this one.  (Oh, and I AM a 'foodie')
