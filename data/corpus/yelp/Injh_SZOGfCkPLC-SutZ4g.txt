HOLY CRAP!! Not only did my nana pankcakes overflow off of my plate, but they were easily the best I've ever tasted! A recent LA transplant, I was looking for a good greasy spoon spot to grab a bite with my girlfriend, and low and behold I found The Griddle. My coffee came to in the form of my own personal French Press (a feature that had me at hello) and my pancakes...OH DEAR GOD! My pancakes were flippin' unbelievable! I am now a loyal lover of this place. Great filling food. Great prices. Awesome service.
