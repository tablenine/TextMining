If you don't want to wait in line and enjoy marveling at the work of each sushi chef's knife, request to sit at the bar. Trust me, you'll love it here. . . The bf and I always sit at the bar so we were delighted when they seated us right away, given that the line was 10 names long. The minimum order is 4 per person which is great because I can definitely eat my fill of sushi. . . Long story short, the sushi here is orgasmically good. It literally melts in your mouth and you can definitely taste quality here. We ordered salmon, yellow tail, halibut (omg this is to die for), tomago (just a tad sweet for my taste), toro sashimi, tuna sashimi, octopus sashimi, squid sushi, miso soup, and a large sake. Everything was superb and I can't wait to get my sushi on again! . . Tip: Order the miso soup, it's only $1 which is a STEAL for miso soup in J-town.
