I went here (twice now) on the recommendation of a hipster foodie-friend and was not disappointed!  The asparagus-leek soup and the split pea soup were full of flavor and delicious.  I also had half of the "uptown" and half of the "LA club" - both of which were yum.  The complimentary olive tapenade was also really delicious and so is the iced tea!  The only negative is that they don't take reservations, but despite having to wait the hostess kept checking on us and letting us know where we were in the queue.  I much prefer BluJam to places like Toast, Doughboys, and Mani's.  Also the servers and bussers were very efficient.
