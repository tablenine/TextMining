I've only had kogi once, when the truck came over to Rosemead.. . One cold, freezing, Winter Tuesday night, I stood in line in my flip-flops and light sweater out in the cold for 1 hour and 40 minutes just to try these famous tacos.. . Was it worth it?  Yes!  . . Would I wait in line again for another 2 hours?  uh...maybe not. . . I got the kalbi taco ($2), the chicken taco ($2), and the spicy pork ($2).  I liked the kalbi the best.  really good and unique flavors.  Delicious.  I couldn't really tell the difference between the chicken and the spicy pork because it was all mixed in together!  But there's a decent amount of greens and a unique Korean flavor to the tacos.  The tacos are definitely small so you should order more than one! =)  haha  . . If the line wasn't so long, I might go back again to try their other menu items.
