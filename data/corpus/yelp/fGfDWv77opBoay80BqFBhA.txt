Great atmosphere.  Trendy. Hip.  Friendly.  Great Food.  Ive been there many times and all their food has been great so far.  Parking is rather hard sometimes unless you go late at night.  Its an awesome place to go just hang out or have a late night snack or have some dessert.  I would recommend the soba, the veggie sandwich, and the bossa nova.  Their homemade vanilla ice cream on a big belgian waffle is SO delicious.  They have hilarious t-shirts, and a great staff.
