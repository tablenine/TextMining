this place never disappoints.  food is delicious, variety is great, and i always leave with a smile on my face.  . . my friends and i went and got four pounds of crawfish (the whole shabang is a must!) with sausages and an order of a dozen oysters for $65 (tip included).  i don't think thats too bad!  we got the medium which was a perfect kick but not too spicy. . the only downside is the wait and service.  if you don't get there early, you'll be waiting for hours on end.  the service isn't that great either.  you gotta get their attention in order to get refills or additional items.. . if you can put up with bad service but want excellent seafood, this is the place to go!
