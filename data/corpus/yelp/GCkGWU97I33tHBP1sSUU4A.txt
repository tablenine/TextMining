Category: Diners
Found this place on a trip last year, and I stop every time I'm in town. . . The Love Letters (French toast) is the best breakfast, and I love the Sloppy Joe with Chipotle and bell peppers.. . It's open 24 hours, and I've never waited longer than 5 minutes for seating, no matter what time of day I go.. . Fred 62 is definitely a favorite.
