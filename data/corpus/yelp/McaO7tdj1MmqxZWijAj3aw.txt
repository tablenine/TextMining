Every time I think I can get away from El Barco, it keeps pulling me back.  The service is TERRIBLE as it seems almost everyone agrees upon.  There are 10 waitresses waiting on everyone and it appears that they all have short attention spans.  The only time they seem to pay attention is as you are walking out and they are checking to see how much you have tipped them.  We once got a nice eye-roll when the tip was mediocre for the comparable mediocre service.  My first eye-roll since junior high. The managers don't seem to provide any greater service either.  I once sent back a shrimp ceviche tostada because it was ridiculously salty and they refused at first to take it off our check.  The manager explained (GET THIS) that the reason the ceviche was so salty was because their shrimp was SOOOO fresh that they were the cause of the saltiness in the ceviche. WTF? I've had seafood straight out of the ocean and did not taste remotely salty. "Really dude? You're going to fight me over removing a $5 tostada from a total check of over $100. Choose your battles."  Anywho...the food and drinks are tasty and since we have yet to find a better seafood restaurant, we will be returning to El Barco until further notice.
