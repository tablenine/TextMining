This place was pretty good. I took a friend of mine here for his birthday. . . When we first got there it appeared to be closed and there was a sign up about a private party. This confused me because I had made dinner reservations. Oh and the valet was nowhere to be found. After waiting a few minutes my friend ran in and they told him that they were open (still not sure why the sign was up) and they did have the reservation. Then the valet finally came out. . . From that point on it was all smooth sailing. The cocktails were yummy and just strong enough. Make sure to try the Hawaiian Martini. Yum! I had the butterfish which absolutely melts in your mouth! The presentation of the food was also impressive. I almost didn't want to dig in and mess it up! . . The waiter was nice and very attentive without being overbearing. I liked the decor. It was very dim though but I guess that's romantic. Since I was there with a friend I didn't see it that way. lol. . I definitely want to go back here but I'm going to have save up some dough first! Maybe I should kill my shopping habit first...
