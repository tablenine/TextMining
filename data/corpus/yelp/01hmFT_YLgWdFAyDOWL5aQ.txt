Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
The place, too small, the food too small, the food too salty, the price way too much !. The burger not bad just not worth it. . The concept not bad, just not worth it.. When you can go to "The Counter" and get as good if not a better burger way more food for the money and less hipster bull shit !. Sorry Umami, you wana last in LA you better get your shit together.. Bummer.
