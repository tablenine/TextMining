Restaurant: Umami Burger
Category: Burgers
Probably the best Burger I've ever had!!!  Miracle mile is slowly starting to get some great places.  Luna Park and now this?  Luna Park's Burger is also great.  You can build it however you want, which I like (try the Smoked Paprika Onions).  . But, Wow!  Umami burgers are sooo tasty.  they don't serve booze though, so maybe stop at Luna Park first, have a few, then walk down to Umami
