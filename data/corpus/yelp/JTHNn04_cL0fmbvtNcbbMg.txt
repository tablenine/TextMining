FANTASTIC.. . I've been wanting to go here for...months. I finally went last night and I am SO glad that I did.. . First of all, it's a great date spot. It's got a nice modern yet cozy deco to it...very open and just felt very fun. Our waitress was super nice and helpful. I'm a mess with pairing wines with entrees, and she made excellent suggestions to both me and my date. She was also really attentive without being annoying. . . I had the vegetable strudel...and WOW. I paired it with their Zinfandel and it was just delightful. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the delicious goat cheese just wrapped it all together. My date had the ratatouille stuffed chicken breast. He was really really happy with his choice too.. . I would come back here in a second. Great food, wonderful service. Definitely a Lincoln Square staple.
