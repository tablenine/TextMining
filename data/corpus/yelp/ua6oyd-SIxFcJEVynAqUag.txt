Carne Asada.  . . You say, "Carne Asada?  Isn't that meat?"  I'm telling you, try Carne Asada here first and you will try everything else after - because you won't believe it.   Veggie thing is secondary for me -- I mean, go here for tasty food.  Veggie thing is an extra benefit.  Sweet potato fries are very good -- best I had in my life -- I mean, how many sweet potatoes have you had in the past?  All other sweet potato fries will be compared to here from now.  . . Since I found this place a couple months ago, I've been coming here almost once a week.  Probably brought 10 meat eater friends here to their initial dismay -- and they made it one of their favorite lunch joints in the neighborhood.   Little expensive for "fast food" - usually ends up about $12/ person for lunch -- but with easy parking, nice decor, and hip-beautiful-healthy-business crowd to gaze in a friendly location, you really can't go wrong.  . . I like it so much that I'd invest in this franchise if it becomes available.
