By far the most crowded breakfast cafe place I've ever been to.  I don't think it's because of the food either (read: star sightings).  . . The decor is nice though I must admit.  We were seated at the loveseat table...two loveseats on each side of a coffee table.  VERY comfy to relax and chill but it made it somewhat difficult to eat.  Who cares, after the meal you get to lean back and let the food digest.. . The eggs benedict were good but the hollandaise sauce was a bit too thick and clumpy...yeah...I don't know either.  . . The omelettes and fresh fruit are the place's redeeming factor.  One of the greatest denver omelettes around...although a bit over priced.  Cold refreshing blueberry, pineapple, mango, honeydew, watermelon, and cantaloupe hits the spot on a hot summer day.
