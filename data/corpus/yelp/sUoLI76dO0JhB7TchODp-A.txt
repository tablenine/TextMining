Restaurant: Clarke&#39;s
Category: Diners
I used to go here at least twice a week. Smoke up, coffee, friends, and ruckus 'til sunrise.. . But ever since the smoking ban, the new renovations, and fresh crop of waiters/waitresses - it's been anything but worth my time for a 24 hour diner.. . Admittedly, a select few staff veterans improve my experience there, and the food is consistent for a diner in this area. But I rarely see the veteran staff (those who know what they're doing and stop by more than twice), and I only order what has always been good for me, a Clark Burger.. . So I couldn't say my opinions are a fair assessment, but I gotta say. Clark's just isn't what it used to be, and not the rehabbed bar area(what used to be the smoking area) nor a handful more of flat screens on the ceiling corners will save them. I've been in and out for the past few years, and lately - it's been significantly less.. . There's definitely better diners out there in the area. It's the worth the walk in my opinion.
