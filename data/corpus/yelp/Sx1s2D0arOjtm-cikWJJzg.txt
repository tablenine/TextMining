A little correction to the website: the prix-fixe menu on Thursdays is now $21.95. It's still a very good deal given that fact that you can choose any appetizer, any entree and any dessert from the menu. I had the mozzarella wrapped in cooked prosciutto served with greens and a balsamic dressing, the spaghetti al Gamberetti (fresh shimp, fresh spinash, fresh tomatoes, garlic, olive oil) and a pecan-crusted chocolate tart. It was not amazingly good but all the ingredients were fresh and high quality. Reuben had the carpaccio served with shaved parmesan, capers and sliced mushrooms - very nice - and a veal dish that was amazing. His tiramisu was very light and creamy. It was packed and a little loud and the service was not the most attentive one but it's definitely a good destination for a good meal. And yes, this spread is darn good!!!
