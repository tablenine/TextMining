Yum!! This place is great. As a visitor in LA, I ate at several restaurants... This was my favorite of all. Quick, clean, fresh and inexpensive. The HUGE Cobb Salad is to die for and tasted great with their specialty brownie (perfect to split for a nice sugar cap). The rest of the menu sounded delishh. The staff is friendly, patient and hard-working. . . Only thing that was bothersome: they left the side doors to the patio open - which brought in some seriously cold air. But, honestly, how often is it cold in LA? Can't wait to come back to LA and eat on the patio when its beautiful out.
