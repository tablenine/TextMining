Just as good as everyone else says!  Everything tastes so fresh and has amazing flavor combos.. I think someone else mentioned get there around 2:30pm- then there shouldnt be as much of a wait.  I think there is always a small wait.. The only reason I could never give it 5 stars was flies.  Flies outside while you waited and then....flies inside while you ate!  Didnt understand that and I hope they do something about it because it was annoying and a little gross. :(
