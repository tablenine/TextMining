As most that know me, I'm very much the bar-holder-upper, and therefore the service behind said 1.5-2.5 feet of wood is paramount to my decision on liking a place, or not. Landmark have at least one great bartender in Zig, or Zigga as he was allowing me to call him the nights I was there one for Yelp's party and the other on Fri for a follow-up..  As for the Yelp party, No-One could keep the consistency of a mohitto after 2/300 of them have alreay gone out, so its no surprise that I heard complaints about the freebies, though Zigga was breaking his hump to look after everyone with a smile (v.tough). I blame mainly the 10 cane, which I think Jacob mentioned in here.. . The management while nice here, did not expect this to be as huge a party as it was and ran out of everything, mint including, and in some cases patience.They should have had at least one more bartender and two floor staff, but perhaps it was their intent not to give out free drinks/food so freely. I have worked these type of parties before, so I know that it is practiced like this frequently elsewhere.. . The decor is note-worthy, and this place was definitely filled with a different crowd on its original opening that i attended. Now they have a "frat and sour" crowd with that eerie look, like they've all shopped together at Abercrummie. Pity really but its hard to keep the crowd you want I suppose. When you want the $$ you take the crowd you get usually, not the one you may have wanted originally.... I give Landmark maybe 2 more years before they will need to change their concept to attract the masses.
