Last week was the first time I had been to this location.  Normally I go to the one on Lincoln, and yes, it's typically for brunch.  I've eaten there once for dinner and my friends like to order food from there for their parties.  . . Came here with the bf and there were 2-3 ladies just standing around, but no one around to seat.  Keep in mind, this is about 10am on a Monday.  I look, no one.  After the lady at the register finishes ringing something up, she looks at me with a huge smile and asks how many.  I like her.  As she's about to seat us she tells some ladies just standing around (out of sight from the entrance) that she was saying there were people there.  "Oh, I just saw some lady there on the phone".........."Yeah, because there was a lady on the phone.  However, there were more people, and there's more behind them."  The lady who sat us was really friendly, upbeat and apologetic.  Order my bloody mary.  It wasn't bad, but I've had better.  The crunchy french toast didn't taste right at first, and since I don't use syrup, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it this time.. . After a few bites it tasted alright.  The chicken sausage for $3 was a single link sliced in half.  Whatever, it was good.  The boy had eggs and they looked gross, but then again, most restaurant eggs do.  His potatoes were delicious.  Better than usual.  . . I want to like this location, but I think I'll stick to the one on Lincoln.
