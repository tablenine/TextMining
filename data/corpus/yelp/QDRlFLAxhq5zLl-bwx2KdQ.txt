I really thought I was a garlic person until I came to eat here.  Everything I ate was so excessive that I reeked of it the whole night.  The interior was super cute, I sat in a two person booth and it was very intimate with the private overhanging.  The service was top-notch, the waiter was very entertaining.  . . I think I would've enjoyed the food more if it didn't taste like garlic overkill.  The appetizer I ordered was the Bagna Calda, (Garlic soaking in a hot tub) which was good for one piece of bread, but then way too much.  Entre Lemon Garlic Salmon, was so so, not at all memorable and for desert Garlic Ice Cream.  I thought this was disgusting!  I couldn't stomach this at all and I tried really hard to have an open mind.  The waiter says that some people absolutely love it (but he didn't).  The waiter was nice enough and surprised me with a free mud pie dessert.  . . Overall cute place, worth a visit to see what its all about, but not some place I would choose to go back to.
