All my friends rave about this place - alright, so I took my girlfriend to try it out one day. She warned me that it's not as great as most people say it is - I trust her. I ordered about three or four dishes, I ate and was full, but not quite satisfied. A part of me just wonders why I paid $12 bucks for a pot of sui-long-bao.. . I am giving it a three because 1) sometimes it is very hard to get the attention from a waitress, 2) lines are just crazy, 3) My bill averages out about $55 dollars for 2 people, 4) Parking is horrible unless you park in the other plaza - . . Anyways - The food is great, my wallet doesn't agree with the prices, and the lines don't agree with my growling stomach.  If you do decide to go here, I suggest going in small groups, 2 - 4 people max.  It is much easier to get a table.  Also, if you go on Saturday's, make the sacrifice and get up early - 9 - 10 AM, its an ideal time.  Anywhere passed this, the huge families start occupying the place.. . Here are my recommendations:. -  Shrimp Fried Rice. -  Wonton Soup. -  Juicey Pork Bun. -  Mince Pork Noodles (dry). . Happy eating!
