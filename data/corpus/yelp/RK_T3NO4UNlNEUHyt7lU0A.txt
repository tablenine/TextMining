Restaurant: Fraiche
Category: Italian
Fraiche is perfect for a casual dinner with friends or a first date. Both times, I found the service to be impeccable, very accommodating of my requested modifications to the menu items. Always gracious. And the food, oh my ... so good. For appetizers, the beet salad is also amazing, As many others have suggested here, you cannot go wrong with the monkfish. I've also tried the striped bass - very good. After-dinner lattes Â came replete with the foam in the shape of a heart. So lovely.
