Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
It's late at night and your with your homies, hungry and well...it's gonna be that kind of night. . . Roscoes isn't so much food as it is a meal, that you shouldn't have, but you can't stop yourself from.  I have never eaten here during the day, or at a reasonable hour.  And yet they serve Waffles at your beck and call. Only in America my friends.. . If you have never been here,  and have heard hype ect.... don't believe it as much as understand who and why people eat here.. . Who eats here?. I do for one and secondly people who are willing to eat chicken and waffels in the same meal, defying the laws of breakfast and dinner. Not brunch not linner but   Brinner.. . They serve half chickens legs, breast ect. depending on what your willing to eat in one sitting they  will have your size, they will have gravey they will have greens they will have rice. . . The chicken is not the greatest you've ever had. But that was never the point. this leads me to the Why?. . Why eat here?. This is the sort of place that is meant for friends looking to fill up at night, wanting to experience not novelty but a genuine meal.. . There is usaully a wait, and the first thing you notice is the the very distinct Roscoe whiff that come from inside... think chicken.. . This one in particular is smaller than the one on Pico. But service is decent.. . I recommend the orange juice mixed with the lemonade... I enjoy  these.
