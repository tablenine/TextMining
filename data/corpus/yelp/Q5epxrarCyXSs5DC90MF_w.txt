Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
There are few things in this world better than fried chicken OR waffles.  . . But not together.  They don't belong.  Being from Chicago, I was always hypnotized by this Los Angeles legend of Chicken and Waffles.  I love them both dearly...more than my family, and could never put them together.. . Then I had Roscoe's.  I was expecting an awesome tag team combination of flavor like TANGO AND CASH but all I got was SONNY AND CHER.  . . How are these waffles good?  They're just chewy pancakes.  A good waffle has got TEXTURE.. . The fried chicken was some of the best fried chicken I ever had though.  Absolutely outstanding.  I think I'm gonna skip the waffle next time and get some grits.
