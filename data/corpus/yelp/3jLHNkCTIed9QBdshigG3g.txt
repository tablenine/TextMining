Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
Hands, down, this place has the best Hainan chicken (costs $6.95 if I remember correctly), which is what Savoy is famous for.  And it's probably the only place where DARK meat (yes, I said it people, DARK meat) costs more than white meat.  $2 more to be exact.  Apparently, people don't mind the extra cost either because my best friend orders only dark meat when he orders their signature dish.  . . I have not yet ventured onto their Asianized Italian dishes, but i heard they're pretty freaking awesome. (They looked yummy from what I can see, especially since I've noticed lots of people ordering them.). . Don't forget to order their unlimited lemon ice tea.  You'll go through them fast enough to justify the cost.  Not only that, you can refill it one last time before you leave. :) (That's right! That's how we Chinese roll!!). . Don't expect this place to be anything fancy.  It's literally a hole in the wall place.  So if you're trying to impress a date, DO NOT bring him/her here.  Alternatively, you can order to-go and eat the food at the comfort of your own home.  Yes, parking is horrible (blah blah blah...) but it's not impossible to find.  People are just lazy and don't want to park more than a block away. . . Remember to bring cash with you because it's a cash only place.  (That's right! We're shady like that!!)
