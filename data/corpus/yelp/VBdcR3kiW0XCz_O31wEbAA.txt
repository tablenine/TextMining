Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
I love love love ramen, i even have a ramen-in buddy. we heard of orochon from a friend at work and rushed on over there. the wait was pretty bad but the ramen was worth the wait. the broth is perfect and it comes in good portions. i got the soysauce ramen at level 4. im sorry im not beefy enough to the specials that come firey hot and fire engine red. . . after going once i went everyday for a week with my sister and friends. never got tired of it...just wish the service was better :(
