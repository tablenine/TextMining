definitely an experience and i'm glad i went.  the good:. . 1.  it's different.  cheesy at first, but fun after the first drink.. 2.  close-up gallery: AWESOME.  worth the 45-min. wait in the cramped, stuffy hall with the "warm-up" magician that wasn't funny.  once you get in, it's very intimate and the guy was great.  some of the shit he pulled made my jaw drop, and i was 10 feet away.  sorry, can't remember his name.. 3.  my friend's filet mignon was pretty damn good, and the garlic green beans were very tasty, though overall everything was very very overpriced.. . the bad:. 1.  suit and tie for guys is required -- fine.  but don't have that dress code and not turn on the air conditioning.. 2.  don't tell me to show up at 5:30 and not have a show 'til 7pm.. 3.  don't charge me $30 for mediocre salmon with potato fingerlings that are dry and unseasoned.. 4.  don't have one bartender serving 50 people that have to wait around for an hour and a half.. 5.  the main stage show was BAD.  the first five minutes consisted of a large woman (that looked like a freakish, goth David Bowie) whipping umbrellas out of her flowing robe with gigantic sleeves, and making faces that read "ooooooohhh, what'd you think of THAT umbrella?!"  and i SAW her take the bird out of her friggin' pocket later in the show.  i give her credit for getting up and performing, but it was all lighting and bad music; really not entertaining, especially compared to the close-up gallery.
