This is a review for the Tuesday night Party, Beige.. . I've been coming here on and off for years, more years, in fact, than I'd actually like to remember. The decor and design haven't changed at all, neither, really, has the menu or drinks.. . The food is okay, mediocre standard-fare (a decent hamburger, acceptable fried calamari), priced just about what you'd expect... The drinks are on the expensive side, so I always pre-drink and sometimes even go outside to "make a phone call.". . Now, for the crowd -- somehow, forever, this place has attracted beautiful people. It's a beautiful space and all, but most venues usually lose their steam after awhile-- not here, I've spotted celebrity after celebrity time and time again.. . I like the wandering and rambling nature of the place. But sometimes this can get annoying, it seems all that some people actually do is walk around and around all night long... And then there's people's tendency to stick with their friends and stand around the entire time, not talking to anybody... And then there's the center area where people dance, oh boy I can't even count how many times I've been unwillingly groped and fondled there -- you can hear a lot of keys jangling in the bathroom.. . The door guy is totally cool.. . I don't frequent this place, it's not really my style or scene, but I was here last night, and I'm pretty sure I'll be back many more times in the future.
