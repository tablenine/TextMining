Category: Breakfast & Brunch
There are certain things about "breakfast" that I consider weaknesses -- Bloody Mary's and biscuits and gravy.. . I think Wishbone knows me. Seriously. I know Southern breakfast is sort of an acquired taste, but if you haven't acquired it, you probably suck and are seriously missing out on life. Cheese grits... mmm... cajun omelets... I could go on and on. Wishbone is cute bustling, and a good place to cure a Sunday morning hangover.
