2 and half stars for sure!!!!!. . Its in a cool location with some pretty awesome artwork/graffiti across the street. We sat outside and it took forever for someone to help us or acknowledge we were there. I ordered the tower of power which is a HUGE turkey club that was very hard to eat and enjoy it was pretty much tasteless. My girlfriend had the b.l.t.l.a. a b.l.t. with avocado and hers was the same bland as well. Also the fries were really greasy... The lemonade was overly tart as well. Guess we went on a bad day or something.
