Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
It takes a lot for me to actually write a review about a place but I just had to, I wish someone would've told me you can pass on Fords Filling Station it's completely overpriced and service is slow. . I was starving last Sunday morning and we stopped at 3 places who all seemed to be closed for breakfast on Saturdays....WTF??!! So by the time we got here I was already irritated b/c I was so hungry. :( . Because we didn't know exactly what we wanted to order the first time the waitor came over we had to wait another 10 minutes to get our chance to order. Then when the food finally came we had no silverware and had to get up ourselves if we wanted to eat our food while it was hot. The food was meh so so ... I could've made something better myself, which I will next time Ford's is the only option. Sorry Ford's, we wont be back...
