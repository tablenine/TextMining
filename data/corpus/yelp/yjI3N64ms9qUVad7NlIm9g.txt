I like this place only while the sun is still shining.  After dark, the crazies come out and it is really pretty uncomfortable.  The food is greasy and burnt to high hell - it's good for what it is.  I can't stand the people that come to and work here at night, though.. . Also, that bit with the health department... don't think I forgot that it was closed for a while due to several violations.
