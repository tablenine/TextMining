Okay, so I did hear the best pick-up line from the waiter at this place. I was dining with my friend and he came over and asked where I was from. I clarified was he inquiring about my ethnicity. At this point my friend who is clearly annoyed asks him why he want to know. His reply, "Because I want to move there!". . Fun and lively space, especially if you want to dine al fresco. You can people watch while sipping chilled wine and noshing on yummy bites. The service can be a bit slow so don't go starving and plan on it taking some time.
