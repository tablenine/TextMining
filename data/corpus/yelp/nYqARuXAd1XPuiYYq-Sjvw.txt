i know im going to get tons of haters because of my two star review-- but hear me out before you de-friend me. . . kogi is just alright. . the food is whatever. maybe its just me, but i think their tacos are super tiny and i always feel a little cheated because ive waited in a line comparable to the line for space mountain at disneyland and all i have to show for it are these little tacos :[ a little disheartening i must say.. . so kogi is alright in my book, but lets be real-- kogi is a bunch of hype. . there ive said it, please dont beat me up :[
