Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Went there today for a family get together. Culver City has some great restaurants and this is one of them. This is just my first time there but Ford's has got a great comfortable feeling to it. Big hits at brunch today were the fish n' chips and flatbread pizzas. I ended up picking off something from the specials menu - the Blue Maxx. Poached egg with hollandaise sauce, potatoes and some bacon. Great portions that left me perfectly hungry at dinner time. We stayed a couple of hours with just general family catching-up to-dos and nary a glance for staying so long. With endless refills of my arnie palmer, this was a great stay for a Â family Sunday.
