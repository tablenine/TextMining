As I began to write this review I read George W's review and pretty much agree with the cole slaw bit.  I hate, hate cole slaw... But on their Pastrami Deli sandwich it finds an amazing partner in crime, pastrami and cole slaw are a mach made in heaven... . . The deli itself, on the inside, definitely stepped right out of the 50s and 60s.  It's pretty cool and nostalgic with it's decor and pictures of family hanging on the walls.. . The #19 is the most popular item and it's what I had of course.  The food is pricey but well worth it, if you've never been or if you particularly love well made deli pastrami.  Also, I shared an order of potato pancakes and had a chocolate shake.  Let me tell you two things: 1. It was all amazing.  2. That meal is not ideal when you're going to run any length of time or distance the morning after.  It's a gut bomb, kids.. . The location is right next to Mac Arthur Park in an ecclectic, largely South American, neighborhood; definitely worth a walk around.. . Come here.  You'll thank me.
