Restaurant: Mercer Kitchen
Category: American (New)
I've become accustomed to finding great dining (and shopping) when visiting SoHo (LOVE it there) and The Mercer Kitchen didn't disappoint.. . A subterranean dining room at its namesake hotel,  Mercer is a casual spot that is able to maintain an intimate, swank feel despite the communal tables and open kitchen floorplan. The service was excellent: friendly and swift; the folks in the kitchen looked like they were having fun preparing the beautiful dishes.. . The restaurant is another creation from world-renknowned chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten and serves "American-Provencal" fare (another easy way to my heart); I enjoyed a beet and goat cheese salad, followed by a steak and asparagus entree, topped off with lemon meringue pie. And copious amounts of wine, of course. . . Magnifique!. . PS: you have to love a place that plays  Stephane Pompougnac/Hotel Costes on its website.
