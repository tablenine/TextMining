i had high hopes for this place.  i felt la needed a french bistro and i was happy to hear that dave myers was the man behind it all.  reviews from friends started to trickle in and their views were average at best. i guess that tamed my expectations down to a level of reasonableness.  i started with a drink concocted by the mixologist.  the drink was great but i cant remember what the hell was in it.  all i know was that i chose vodka as the base.  the bread was good but the butter stole the show. i swear i wouldve eaten that butter with a spoon as if it was ice cream but showing restraint was probably the best move.  i ordered the marrow to start.  it was yummy but a bit salty.  then i followed it up with the braised short rib with a potato puree.  i know a lot of you are probably thinking that it's a boring dish to get but i honestly couldnt find anything else i really wanted.  i just had coq au vin the week before and i got sick of steak frites when i was paris.  the flavor was on point but i've had better short rib at several other restaurants.  it could've been more tender...more delicate.  the puree was fine but it's hard to mess puree up.  i think it's actually hard to mess short rib up too but at least the flavor was there.  all in all, i enjoyed trying this place because ive been wanting to go for some time.  i stopped at scoops afterwards and the brown bread ice cream really hit the spot for me.
