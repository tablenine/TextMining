Things that are awesome: PBR, the largest pile of nachos I have ever seen, the commentary of Larson's 1956 perfect game being played in the bathrooms. . . Definitely a fun place to go watch sports, drink a beer, eat something doused in saturated animal fat (mmmmmmmm). Not a great spot to have a conversation, but that's to be expected. It was also kind of sterile, and though I enjoy the bathroom commentary, it otherwise is kind of exactly like every other flat-screen sports bar. Those nachos were kind of awesome, however, and worth the trip.
