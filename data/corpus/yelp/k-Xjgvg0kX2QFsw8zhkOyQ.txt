I really wanted the tasting menu, but they weren't offering it because the cooks in the kitchen were all pretty green and the chef didn't think that they would be up to the task.  I'm unsure whether to view this as a plus, that they don't want to serve things that won't be up to snuff, or as a negative, where they weren't up to going whole hog.. . I split the cote de boeuf with someone for $100.  It was a massive bone-in rib-eye with some greens and cheese-flavored mashed potatoes that were more like potato-flavored cheese.  You could cut the mashed potatoes with a knife, which means that it was pretty great.  The steak was perfectly prepared, with a very brown veal reduction along side it.  I could not complain at all.. . Another person had the Japanese Wagyu beef, which was a paltry $150 for a small steak.  Given that it was $150, I was a bit disappointed to see it a bit overcooked, but it made me feel thrifty only spending $50.. . We were too full for dessert, and price was about $100 per person after everything, excluding the crazy Wagyu, of course.. . It is interesting to see that the home of so many 1980s cliches is still good.  The appetizers were good, too, a risotto and something else, but I guess not that memorable.
