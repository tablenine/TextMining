Restaurant: Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder Co.
Category: Pizza
Nothing I can say that hasn't been said before. It's a very simple menu. Get a house salad &amp; Mediterranean Bread to start. Then you can get their Pizza pot pie or one of their over Grinder sandwiches. . The place is very small and almost always has a wait. You cannot make reservations so plan on waiting 30 - 45 minutes. . The service is always good and the owners are always there working very hard.
