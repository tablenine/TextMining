Restaurant: Palm&#39;s Thai Restaurant
Category: Thai
Pay NO attention to the naysayers.  The critiques of Palms are all the same...superficial and generally without much merit.  Without dwelling on the negative for too long, I'll say it simply about Palms-haters:  They act like a hipster music fan whose favorite independent band got played on MTV and went platinum.  I'll leave it at that.. . Palms is inexpensive, of great quality, and the servings are generous.  I highly recommend the Dried Chili With Cashew Nut (with fried tofu or any meat of your choice).  Also, the soups are amazing (get the "pot" size for two people).  I love the spicy fried rice, and the shrimp cakes are fantastic.  In general, you cannot lose here.  Advice: "medium" spicy is all you'll ever need, unless you're masochistic.  . . Palms is authentic while being approachable, a rare feat.  Also, the Thai Elvis sings here.  Need I say more?
