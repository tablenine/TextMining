I'm not entirely surprised by the experiences of others Yelpers at Fox Sports Grill, but my first time was actually quite all right.  I liked the upscale sports bar atmosphere... it is one of those places that can be packed with people, but it would never really bother you.  TV's abound, but are unobtrusive.. . The food was pretty decent as well.  I had pizza, which was good enough for me--maybe not if you're a pizza snob--and my husband had some chicken sandwich that he claimed was "on time".  The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the fried green tomatoes we got as an appetizer... of course, I shouldn't be surprised since I found the best fried green tomatoes ever made at The Feed Store in College Park, GA.. . All in all, if you're in Atlantic Station and want to catch the game, along with some decent food, stop in.  If you're looking for an authentic sports fanatic spot or super tasty grub, then yelp on my friend.
