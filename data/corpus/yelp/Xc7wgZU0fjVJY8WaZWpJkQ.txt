OMFG!. BLEU BOY BURGER. Bleu cheese crumbles and bacon cooked on top of a grilled 1/2 pound burger. Perfect medium rare.  This, my friends, is an orgasm served on a bun.  Ice cold, long necked beer was the perfect compliment.. Bartender served us at the bar, and he was a great guy.. As Arnold would say, "I'll be back."
