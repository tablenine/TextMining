Pro: It comes to your neighborhood! Quick service, decent price for the food. Crazy Korean Mexican food. . . Con: It's outdoors, smokers will be there. Could use better description on where they will be. . . Kogi is a magical silver bus that brings strangers together to wait in the cold for food. We got there early to be the first in line around 9:45, only to be greeted by a police squad car there ready for crowd control. That give me a good sign of how much madness will be generated by this bus by midnite. . . Tried the slidera and hot dog, both a bit pricy, but consider the expanse of the bus and fuel, it's all worth it. The relish was especially impressive, making the everyday slider and hot dog so much better. . . btw. crazy korean guy that doesn't speak a word of coherent english will be calling out random things that may or may not be your name. pay attention to the food he is holding if you want to receive what you ordered.
