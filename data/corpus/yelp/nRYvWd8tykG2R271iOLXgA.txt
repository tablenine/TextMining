Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Lawry's is a great upper scale restaurant that, for us everyday-ers,  is mainly  for once-in-awhile occasions (as if you don't already know). The atmosphere makes you feel very fancy because you're ushered around like royalty when you walk in. They also have a nice bar up in the front for drinks and free snacks for people waiting for a table. Also, just to note, the waitresses are all adorned in some old-school a$$ dresses and aprons, not sure what is is, but it's definitely not the ordinary waiting attire so it helps solidify the uniqueness of the experience. . . Now in discussing the food, I would have to say that its definitely delicious. Their prime rib is by far the best I've ever tasted, but then again, I've never been that big of a prime rib kind of guy so my experience doesn't serve as any spectacular precedence. On the other hand, I do eat sides! The sides are all very, very good---from the mashed potatoes to the creamed corn (MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE). . . However, I also tried the creamed spinach, which regrettably turned out to not be my favorite--I'm not sure if it just wasn't that good there, or it's just how creamed spinach is supposed to taste...if it is, then God help those who do enjoy it (shudder). . . Anyway, for the price, you get more than enough food to be fulfill even the heartiest of eaters because they also include an endless basket of bread, a salad of your choice, and pudding bread with your meal. Overall, a great dining experience. The only reason it gets four stars is because for the price, I'd actually rather go to Ruth's Chris for my special occasions.
