Restaurant: Hub 51
Category: American (New)
Went Saturday night, my impression was that the restaurant was a warehouse-sized twenty-ish meat market. I saw very few people under 35. Line of people at the door, doormen vetting them, etc. ((We went right in because our hosts are friends of the Lettuce Entertain You empire.)). . Service was great, food and drinks were great, music was WAY too loud for easy conversation. Based on music volume I would call this more of a bar than a restaurant, and I hate bars. I want to like Hub 51 more, based upon the beautiful interior and good food, but I guess the twenty-somethings demand to be deafened so Hub 51 is going to deliver.
