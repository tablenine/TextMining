5 Stars for the coffee, 4 for the food and prices. . The best coffee in LA, hands down.. . The design of the interior is a kind of slight hipster take on Kelly Wearstler (The Viceroy, Maison 140, Avalon hotel)'s work. . . The ground coffee to go comes in a distinctive sleek black tin that I suggest holding onto, as they knock off $2 when you get a refill.. . Their house coffee is amazingly strong and tasty, even when iced (slow-filtered, I gather) . . The food is tasty (I had a pancetta salad last time I was there), but quite overpriced, specially for such small portions.
