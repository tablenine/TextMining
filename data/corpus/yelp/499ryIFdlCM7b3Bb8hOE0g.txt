I used to work across the street from Langer's and I've probably had almost everything on the menu. This place doesn't disappoint. From soup to salad, sandwiches to steaks - they're all good and tasty. Â Big portions too - sandwiches are enough for two. Best club sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. I don't miss the area but I definitely miss this place :-/
