Restaurant: Sticky Rice
Category: Thai
Sticky Rice is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant because of these three words: Thai Noodle Soup.. . And here's the kicker - I always, always, always order Lard Nar/Lad Nar/Lard Na when dining Thai. It's my most favorite dish, hands down. But when I come here I know to always order the Thai Noodle Soup. It's everything I want and everything I need on any given day -- be it in the middle of a snowstorm or a hot, sunny July day. . . The Thai Noodle Soup is the best soup ever cooked, nay ever created, I'm serious. It's base, a hearty, dark brown beef broth is packed with a multitude of flavors. The noodles are thin and perfect for absorbing all the beefy goodness. Next up are the mouthful sized chunks of delicious beef that float beside the crunchy fried shrimp bits. Â Perfection comes in a bowl at $5.95 per serving.. . Yesterday my boyfriend, a Sticky Rice veteran, ordered one of his staples to go with the Thai Noodle soup, he got the Yum Nuer, a sliced beef salad that mingles with basil, mint, onion and tomatoes in a savory vinegar sauce. My mom took one bite of it and absolutely became addicted. I don't blame her. . . Their pad thai is also quite tasty, light, limey and crunchy. The Lard Nar is not so amazing, it's just "alright," because it usually comes doused in the brown gravy making it more like a soup but not quite so. . . The Thai Noodle soup and the Yum Nuer are so AMAZING that I'm willing to overlook the lackluster Lard Nar, keep it up Sticky Rice, I done love it!!
