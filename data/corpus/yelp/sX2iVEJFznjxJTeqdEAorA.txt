Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
Always order the manuel special it feed four adults , i can finish one myself sometimes , prices are reasonable they accept credit cards now.. Don't wait in line to be seated inside it will take to long do yourself a favor and order from the side window and eat outside its faster and way better atmosphere.
