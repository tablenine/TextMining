Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Talk about disappointing! I gave it two chances because it had so much promise. There are some restaurants where bad service is worth dealing with because the food is so amazing, this ain't one of them. . . Each time I have been there it seems like there has been a salt explosion in the kitchen....had my hamburger come over on the Nina the Pinta or the Santa Maria? Why so much salt?  . . The staff was hilarious, and when I say hilarious I mean terrible. There were like 6 girls "hosting", and about three "serving". "Hosting" is in quotes because I found two of them to be so rude I almost left. "Serving" is in quotes because, well, it's an insult to other servers of this world to say these people do that.  I will forgive this because the manager of this place is to blame. Fire some "hosts", hire some "waiters", and hide the salt!
