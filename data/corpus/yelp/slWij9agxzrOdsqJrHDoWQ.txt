Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
When the In-n-Out philosophy of high quality ingredients and minimal menu meets the fish taco world.. . I'm one of those odd folk who hold a bitter contempt about the neverending sun down here, but I'll tell you this, nothing accompanies a Los Angelean summer like some fish tacos.  Fried to order, a (usually) fresh condiment bar to the side, and reasonable prices.  A tip though, the tacos will get wet pretty quick once you put on the slaw and salsa.  Order half of what you were originally going to eat, then come back and order your second helping.  They're fast when it comes to cooking up orders and its way better than having a sadface soggy taco when it's wholly unnecessary.. . I also think the owner of this place must be Jimmy Buffet's Mexican cousin.
