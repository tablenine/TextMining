I was excited to try this out - I met a friend out for dinner. . . The place is small - very dim lighting - there's a closed off section on one side that is good for a big group, kind of private/cool. . . My  biggest complaint is the service. Our waiter was a complete retard. He messed up our first round of drinks... martinis were not as strong as I like... . . The sushi was good - real good. The host dropped off the first plate of rolls, and we asked for more ginger - he kept walking and waved his hand and said, "I got you". . then...no ginger. . . For the second plate / sashimi platter - we waited so long, that my food digested, I moved my bowels and came back and we were still waiting -- we found out that it was sitting at the sushi bar - and he just never picked it up!  . . Then we had to remind him of our second drink order, remind him of the check, reminded to take the credit card- the guy was a complete retard (did I mention that?). . Then, we walked out - no "thank you" - the host was too busy checking his nails... . . so stoopid. . . bill was $125 for two people - you'd think the service would be better...
