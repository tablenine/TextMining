Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
I love this place.  Pre or post- USC games, this is the best kind of grub.  I don't stray too much from the tacos with cheese (why would you?) but everything everybody else has eaten here is great.  The guacamole is thin, but good.  I'm not a super big fan of the salsa-- it doesn't have a lot of flavor. . . Overall, I definitely recommend!
