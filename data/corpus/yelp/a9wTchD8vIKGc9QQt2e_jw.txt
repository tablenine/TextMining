Nice wine selection and the cheese ravioli is a much try.  Outdoor seating is preferred.  The kitchen can get pretty noisy so try to sit as far away as possible if you sit indoors.  Great spot next to the parking garage and right across the street from the Culver Hotel and movie theater.  A great place for a nice dinner before hitting up downtown Culver.
