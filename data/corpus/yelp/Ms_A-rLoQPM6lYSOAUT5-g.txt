Restaurant: The Real Chow Baby
Category: Asian Fusion
It's all about the hype.  And they hype here is good.  But, it's all hype.  The food is as stimulating as you make it.  That's the thing about Mongolian BBQ spots, if you can't mix the sauces and spices right, then you probably won't like your dish.  But, if you're good at mixing it up then you'll probably like the chow, baby.. . The parking situation here is surprising bearable.  They have complimentary valet and parking on the streets if you can find a space.  Inside, there's a bar just to the right, which is needed because the wait on a Wednesday night was about 40 minutes!  We all had a drink to pass the time.  We sat on the patio which was covered as the sun went down but I imagine great in the summer time.  Our waitress was quick and efficient, keeping in mind that she really didn't have to do anything or take orders.  One thing that I didn't like was that when my friend was on his second bowl, she started refilling the soy sauce containers, and restocking our table, while we were still sitting there.  Not cool.  She could have waited until we left.. . I prefer Hot Stix.  It's newer and fresher and just better.
