Ok-the first time I tried Versailles I was really turned off because the garlic shrimp I ordered were served to me in like a quart of butter. Mind you, I like butter, I just don't like my shrimp swimming in it. However, most recently, I was pleasantly surprised. Despite the fact that it was a busy busy Saturday night, and there was, as there probably usually is, a long line outside, we were seated quickly and waited on just as fast. This time I order the halibut which was mighty, mighty delicious. The beans and rice were also good and it was all topped of with, my fave, fried bananas. Wow, this place loves their butter a little too much.
