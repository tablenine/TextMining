Restaurant: Ford&#39;s Filling Station
Category: American (New)
Pecan tart was good.  My friend said the duck confit was good.  Unfortunately, this item apparently is only for DineLA so it doesn't really tell you much about the restaurant in general.  The only thing we ate that is on the regular menu was the hummus.  It was nothing special and lacked seasoning.  Plus I was still tasting the garlic hours later. . . The atmosphere was nice,  and the server was attentive, but the one thing that really grossed me out was this kid that I'm guessing was the owner's or chef's son.  He seemed like a nice kid, but I saw him  walk to the kitchen (it opens into the dining area) a couple of times, and grab food from the area the cooks were working and put it in his mouth.  Isn't this a health code violation?  Pretty sure that's not only gross but unsanitary.  Luckily our plates had already been brought out but still...probably won't be coming back here.
