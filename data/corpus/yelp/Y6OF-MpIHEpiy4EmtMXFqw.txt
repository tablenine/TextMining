Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
A true dining experience at it's best. . . I know, some of you are thinking how dare I surround myself with such meat. But in all honesty, despite being Pescetarian, I loved my experience at Lawry's. . . A group of us came here on a Friday evening to celebrate a friend's birthday. We were seated in one of the private rooms near the wine cellar. Prior to being seated, we waited in the foyer where they served meatballs in a lounge type room. Right across from this room was the bar, where some of us grabbed a few drinks. A little something to smooth the passageway for the food to come. . . The dining experience at Lawry's is exceptional. The wait staff really take the time to let you know that YOU are the guest. Sit back, eat and enjoy. . . The prime rib is brought out to your table in a cart by the Carving Chef. Who then in turn cuts it to your perfection. Rare? Medium rare? Well done? You got it. The prices range depending on cut and size. Ranging anywhere from $35-$50/plate. . . Each prime rib dinner includes their famous original spinning bowl salad (Amazing!), yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes, whipped cream horseradish. . . Now of course, being Pescetarian I myself did not have Lawry's famous Prime rib. I had the Atlantic lobster tails ($44). Juicy, tender, flavorful....WOW! My mouth is watering just thinking about the taste. . . Like I said, despite being Pescetarian and surrounded by meat...one can completely enjoy their Lawry's experience. A dining participation worth every penny!. . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~. 5/5 Ambiance - The mood, character, quality, tone, atmosphere.. 5/5 Service - Helpful, accommodating, efficient, delivery and speed?. 4/5  Food / Merchandise - Quality, taste, presentation.. 3/5  Price - Reasonable, inexpensive, high priced?.
