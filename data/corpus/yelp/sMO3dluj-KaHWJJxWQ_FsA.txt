After 3 failed attempts to catch the Kogi truck, my friends and I were finally able to collaborate on a chilly Thursday night to see if this Mexican-Korean combo lived up to it's hype. . . Um, yeah. It did. . . I ordered the short rib taco and the Kogi sliders. Damn, so good. . The funny thing is, it was 11pm and there was minimal lighting in the parking lot, so my friends and I didn't really know what we were eating. Obviously, there was beef, but as far as what went on top of it- we couldn't figure it out. It was some type of slaw and I believe some type of cheese. Â Whatever, it worked and it was delicious.. . We were at O'hara's in the Circle so the line wasn't too long and we were served quickly. I'd say about an hour from start to finish. . . I will definitely become a KT regular.
