Restaurant: La Crêperie

I was looking for a breakfast place and a friend recommended we go to La Creperie for crepes.  Looking for a new place to try, I agreed.  When I first stepped in, I thought the place is very small. But then found out there's a back room so it's a decent size place.  Even then the tables are cramped pretty close together making getting in and out of your seats an adventure in contorting your bodies.. . I ordered the chocolate &amp; peanut butter crepe.  The buckwheat crepe was yummy!  Although there's quite a bit of chocolate and peanut butter in there.  I had to squeeze some out otherwise, I won't be able to talk with all that PB in my mouth.  . . The service was good and I will certainly be back to try their savory crepes next time.
