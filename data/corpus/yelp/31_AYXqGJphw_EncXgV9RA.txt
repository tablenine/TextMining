This food is good, period. You forget it's vegan. The only thing to remind you is how interesting the combinations are. Spaghetti with cashew cheese? Amazing! TV Dinner made with meatloaf lentil? Delish!. . The wine selection is also fantastic! I highly recommend this place to go for a nice meal of trying different things. I am not vegetarian and found this to be my favorite restaurant so far in los angeles!
