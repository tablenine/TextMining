Category: Sandwiches
Its a grand old place, with requisite sawdust and pickled eggs at the counter. The meat may be overcooked; I prefer the pork sandwich to the beef for this reason. But in this rare case the meat is not the main feature of the sandwich. Its a combination of the au jus, bread and the utterly fantastic mustard. . . I prefer to skulk upstairs and eat in the private rooms where somewhere on the ancient exposed brick it says Phares '88. Look up, whats that on the ceiling? Why it looks like... it is! A little yellow chilli pepper! Looks like the Chillipepper Bandito has struck again, aye caramba!
