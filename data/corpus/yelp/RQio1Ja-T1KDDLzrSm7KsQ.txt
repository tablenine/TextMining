UH I'm so full..... . . I would of gave this place 5 stars but they lacked in service. . 10 pm and the place was still packed. I felt bad for the servers that were running around trying to fill every-ones needs. Kudos for them for trying to keep up. Even though they were busy, they couldn't of been nicer. . . OK, the food is amazing! So far my favorite Japanese joint. The Nabeyaki Udon soup was perfect, went great with my bottle of sake! Broth is perfectly flavored along with everything else we had. . Great homemade flan.. More reasons to love this place, its opened til 3am on the weekends!! OH and its super cheap.
