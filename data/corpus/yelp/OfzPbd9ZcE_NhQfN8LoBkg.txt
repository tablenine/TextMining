Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Johnnies is a favorite stop in Culver City after a night of music at the Cinema Bar or Cozy Inn or if it's just one of those days where you feel like there's not enough grease in your life.  . . Pastrami snobs step aside, this place has better pastrami than 90% of the other deli's in LA, and at $10 for a sky-high stacked sandwich, you can't go wrong.  Plus the 50's diner style is as rad as it gets.  . . In a town full of slick chains this place is a welcomed respite.
