Upon entry I was pretty excited: the layout and design of this place is modern but fitting of a "beer bar" and the number of beer specials on the huge chalkboards hanging high above the bar got my thirst going.  The beers (plenty were consumed) were delicious, despite picking a pretty wide range of different types from different countries. . . I was ecstatic at the idea of a juicy, warm and pink-centered naturally raised grass fed burger.  However, my medium-rare burger had not one bite of "rareness" or pinkness to it and I am of the type who think that meat too well done is meat ruined.  The fries, however, were incredible.  My recommendation would be to get fries and substitute the burger for a few more beers.
