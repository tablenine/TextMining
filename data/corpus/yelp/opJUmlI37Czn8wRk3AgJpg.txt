First off, the drink/ bar menu slection is 5 stars stellar alone...only problem is the hefty price tag...yes its 90210, my bad.. . Try the Mille Feuille dessert...puffy pastry layers and chocolate creme...cept...I wished they woudl have offered the original Mille Feuille which is vanille.. . The filet mignon was nothing to brag about.  When I go out to an established eatery, I usually don't get too brave, and always go for something expensive, and familiar.  . . I'm glad I ate dessert first...which is a bad habit of mine that often ruins my entree, but this way, it's almost as though I know my meals are really tasty or not, because if I'm so full, and I still want to eat, it's tasty...and I can be forthright about it.. . Lastly, I am annoyed that they anglacized their menu, the items are mostly French, and there is virtually no mention of the Viet/Asian dishes...makes it seem like these are all "original fusion" dishes.  Not the case.. . I gave no points for decor, I should, but, I didn't.  . . Enjoy, God Bless.
