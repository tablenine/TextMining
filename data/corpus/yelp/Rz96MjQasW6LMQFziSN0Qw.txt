Oh man!! talk about finger lickin AWESOME!!! If you are a seafood fan and love the tastes of creole  and cajun food...you have to checkout this place...bring friends...because you can get more of a variety with what you order that way and YOU ARE GONNA want to try multiple items on the menu.  Special mention to the shrimp and the blue crab and get a side order (or two) of the sausage and the potatos...MMMMMM.... . You'll be eating with your hands...no utensils here and make sure you don't wear white (big big no no) unless you don't mind going home with evidence of your gluttony...:-). . They don't take reservations and the line out the door gets pretty long fast...so be strategic...choose your closest friends (not too many) and go step in line.
