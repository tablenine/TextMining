Me: Where are you taking me for valentines?. Him: I'm not telling.... Me: It's a zoo. Him: No. Me: It's a McDonalds. Him: No. Me: It's Perez Hilton's House. Him: Shutup and look cute.. Me: Ok.... . So cute! SO cute. Very obviously the place you take your future fiancee, or other similarly important people. Like your new wife's mother. . . The service was not great. It was okay but I credit it to mostly the waiter seemingly having to serve everyone on the patio -- which was quite a few couples. Any case, I ordered the roasted chicken with black truffle sauce and it was AWESOME. I mean ahh....I wanted to lick the plate to eat more sauce. We followed it with a flourless chocolate cake (mmmm) and some earl grey tea (love). . . Had some wine but I wasn't totally impressed. The one I wanted was too popular and gone and the one they gave me was okay. BUT it is so cute. So cute. It's all greeny and flowery and pretty patio lights. It's warm and sweet and...sigh. . . Exit all my male yelp friends' approval for me, enter all the yelp girls swooning along.
