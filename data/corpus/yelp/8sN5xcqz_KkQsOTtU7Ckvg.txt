Dinner for two including one salad, two cocktails, two entrees $150. I would not go back. I can't remember anything good about dinner. I do remember the $14 martini that had a huge block of ice in it. The glass looked full and I was curious about how much alcohol was in the glass without the ice. I lifted the block of ice that seemed to weigh a pound and the the alcohol left in the glass only filled 1/4 of the glass! That was a rip-off disguised as "cocktail presentation"!! Skip it, skip it, skip it! Much hype about nothing!!!
