If you've been here before and you weren't totally thrilled, I recommend trying the daily specials. Different, exciting, delicious, fun. I never leave dissapointed with the special.. . Hubby, on the other hand, is a stick-to-the-same kind of guy. He'll order that same chicken salad with the tortilla strips every time.
