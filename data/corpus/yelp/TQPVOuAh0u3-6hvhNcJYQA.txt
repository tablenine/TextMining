Exhausted after a long trip from the East Coast, my friends and I dug into the best plantains I've had in years. As one of my friends said, "This food was made with love," and Gloria's warmth made that feel very true. Everything we had was delicious--a huge seafood soup, shrimp with garlic, and home-made flan. Mexican and Salvadoran sodas were perfect accompaniments to our dinners. We left stuffed, warm, and completely charmed by the food and ambiance at Gloria's. Next time I'm in LA, I know where I'll be for dinner.
