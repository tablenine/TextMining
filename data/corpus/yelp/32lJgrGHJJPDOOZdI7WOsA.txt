Restaurant: Phoenix Restaurant
Category: Dim Sum
This is dim sum for the non-dim sum eaters and the first timers. Why do I say this? The prices and the dish variety. What they have is pretty solid taste-wise, I just wished they lower the outrageous prices. . . * please note, it's not that the restaurant is expensive in the grand scheme of restaurants, but it is pricey for dim sum.
