Restaurant: Great NY Noodle Town
Category: Chinese
Just a warning...this is going to be a review based on the fact that the meals I consume at NY Noodletown are usually done after a night of drinking and take place between the hours of 2-4am. essentially, my expectations and ideas of good food have been lowered. . Ambiance: lights turned on full blast to see all the other happy drunk and often red (Asians) patrons. . Service: grouchy Chinese waiters. when are they not? . Food: hits the spot. i LOVE their wonton noodle soup. i dislike thick rubbery wonton skin/wrappers and at NY Noodletown they are very thin and delicate with shrimp and pork as filling. very good. try it with wide rice noodles and extra scallions.
