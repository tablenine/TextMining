We had a delicious time at Feast on Saturday!. We went in for an early 6PM dinner before the Bull's game.  There were a lot of families with small children.. . I ordered the butternut squash ravioli which was amazing!. The other entrees at the table were tuna and whitefish.. We had the mac&amp;cheese and crab cakes to start, and I liked the mac&amp;cheese better than the crab cakes.  The corn salsa on the crab cakes were yummy though.. . I really wanted the molten lava cake, but our server informed us that it takes about 15 minutes, and we didn't have 15 minutes to spare before tip-off, so we went with a ganache cheesecake and the berry tart.  Both were decent, but I bet I would have loved that lava cake!. . Service was decently attentive, but the tables are really close together.  We almost had a french fry land at our table from a small child next to us.. . I would definitely come for half price wine nights on Mondays and Tuesdays!  I loved the pinot noir that I had!  Excellent choices for wine by the glass!
