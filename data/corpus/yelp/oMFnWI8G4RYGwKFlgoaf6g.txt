We were generously given a gift certificate here, and I'm very thankful!!! First walking in you can't help but notice the beautiful limestone wall from floor to ceiling... made me want to re-do my new fireplace.. . My husband and I enjoyed the 3 course dinner for $25... I got my feet wet with the sangria salad (very yum and fresh), dove in deep with delicious salmon, and came up for air only to devour a wonderful trio of cupcakes (chocolate, carrot, and lavender).. . The waitstaff was great except for some weird reason, they thought it was my birthday so I had a candle in one of my cupcakes and they sang to me. Meh, they were just a couple months off so I kept quiet ;)
