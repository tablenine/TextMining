This place takes me back to the motherland.. It's one stop shopping, no nonsense, classic Greek taverna food. . An authentic Greek deli, well equipped with the best Greek cheeses you'll find in California (they have the same kind at places like Jons, but they are all inferior). Yes a Greek deli with olives, sausages, tzazkiki, hummus, melinzansalata, spicy feta dip, and taramasalata. (to be honest with you, not a fan of the 'baba ganouj' maybe because it's not actually Greek and why buy tacos from a pizzeria?) FRESH bread straight out of the oven, and FRESH GREEK COOKIES coated with sesame seeds and laced with hints of vanilla, honey, and spice. . . * Greek wine aficionados, this is your place. Or, if you want to delve into one of the hidden diamonds of the worlds, drink Greek white wine. Heck, they will cork it for you, and you can take it over to the table with you. . . And of course, I have tried almost everything on the taverna menu. . DO get the shrimp santorini - it's a dish of large shrimps with the most delicious tomatoey bath you can imagine. . DO get the lamb sandwich (although I'm a big eater, usually can only eat half). The lamb sandwich is better than the lamb dish for some reason. . DO try any of the souvlaki/kebab plates. The meat is tender and delicious and I'm one of the pickiest meat eaters around these necks of the woods. . DO order the horta. They grow it themselves in typical resourceful immigrant fashion so you know it's fresh and organic. It may have a little cerveza or horchata spilt on it, but don't let that stop you from having a good time. PS. the reason why Greeks live so long is because they consume MASS amounts of horta. This stuff is magic.. . This place is authentic and I can vouch for that. The prices are great and the ambiance of the Byzantine-Latino headquarters is priceless.
