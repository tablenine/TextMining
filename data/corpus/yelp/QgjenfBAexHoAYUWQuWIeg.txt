Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
I know that many people swear by daikokuya, but i'm still on the santouka bandwagon. i'm not saying daikokuya is bad by any means, its still one of the best places to get ramen. the pork broth is pretty amazing, especially when you put a bunch of grated garlic in the broth (i'm korean). but when i eat ramen, i like a simple clean broth with perfectly cooked noodles. Â if you want a kick in your ramen, order the kotteri: pork broth with pork fat added to it. i usually get the combination of salmon roe rice with ramen and call it a day. I wanted to give this restaurant a four because of my love for santouka, but i couldn't bring myself to do it. the ramen here is too good for a four star rating, but if i had to rate the line to get into the restaurant i would have to give it 0 stars.
