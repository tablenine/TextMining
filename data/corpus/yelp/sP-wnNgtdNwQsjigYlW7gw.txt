Restaurant: Chabuya Tokyo Noodle Bar
Category: Japanese
I often crave the warm soupy noodles of Chabuya on cold days...or as cold as it get in LA.. . I love the original with miso and pork chiu siu. I think the noodles with the miso broth taste so much better. Much more flavor. I had the vegetable ramen once and it wasn't as good. . . I also enjoy the pork chiu siu. The bread is really tasty. It's that sweetish bread they serve with peking duck. And there's a tomatoe miso or something sauce that's really good.. . i hear the rice bowls are good too.
