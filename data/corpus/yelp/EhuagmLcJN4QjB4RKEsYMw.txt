Amazing gyros.. . That's all that needs to be said.  Seriously.  I could go on about how u can tell this isn't just the pre-made stuff that most Greek places serve [something like this: . http://www.kronosprodu....  ].  I could go on about how great and fresh the pitas are or how delicious the tzatziki is as well.  But I'm not going to do that.. . Go to Papa Cristo's, order a gyros...and find happiness in your belly.
