Restaurant: Kopi Travelers Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
One of my favorite eateries in the city of Chicago. I discovered it shortly after moving to Chicago, and regularly would make the trek in below-freezing weather from Hyde Park to Andersonville to pretend to study there, in fact, simply basking in the colorfully painted, uplifting, expansive atmosphere (and to pretend that I lived in Andersonville.) After having tried out many coffee shops in the city of Chicago, this one is still by far the best, when you combine food selection, staff amiability, and relaxed, stimulating ambiance. As someone who has recovered from several addictions to reading travel guides, it's nice to take a break from your food and peruse all the guides in the back, and I've also very conveniently bought birthday presents for various friends and relatives in the store, which sells pretty high quality international craft products. It's nice that they let you hang out over a cup of coffee. In the summer, there's outdoor seating beyond the indoor tables, and regardless of the season, there's good music playing. As for food, the pesto/mozzarella baguette and the "lox n' eggs" (or anything they do with eggs) is superb, as is the Cafe Vienna with cinnamon in the coffee realm. Just a nourishing place for the soul that fits in perfectly with the North Clark Street retail scene.
