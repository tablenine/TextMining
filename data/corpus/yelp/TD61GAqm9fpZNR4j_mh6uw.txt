I've only been here once, but I plan to go to it again.  I went with my girlfriend for her birthday and we sat in the courtyard and it was beautiful.  At the time we went, the restaurant just opened up for dinner service so there weren't many customers at all.  The service was great over all although it was a tad slow at the end when collecting the check (I would think all restaurants would get this quickly =P ).  This is an excellent place to bring a date or for an anniversary or something along those lines.  It has a great view overlooking LA, especially during sunset.  The food was good over all, but then again, I've only tried 2 dishes and a dessert.  Over all, presentation of the food is good and the restaurant is clean.
