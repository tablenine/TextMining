I ordered the #1 "Scoes" and I was pleased with the quality of the chicken but a little disappointed in the waffles as they tasted somewhat frozenish. For the sides I Â ordered giblets, candy yams, collared greens and cornbread. Everything was excellent and I was surprised at how sweet and delicious the candy yams are and they aren't kidding about the candy part! Besides the fried chicken I highly recommend giblets since they are so chewy and yummy!
