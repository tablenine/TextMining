I feel like a kid in a candy store in Porto's.  Everything is just so good!  My favs are of course the potato balls w/ tapatio sauce and the chicken croquettes are like Thanksgiving Dinner in a bite.  The chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies are the best! And oh you gotta try the red velvet cup cake.  You really can't go wrong here.   The sandwiches are really good too and I love the banana chips that come with them.  My only complaint is the amount of plastic garbage that Porto's seems to generate with each order.  If they could figure out a way to use less plastic bags it would be an easy 5 stars.
