Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Although I have had Porto's food before this was the first time I had actually gone into the bakery myself to get it. Oh my gosh I could not believe how huge this operation was and how packed it was at 6:00 Pm! The pros: The food is good and cheap and they have a pretty good selection of baked goods and bread and it is all fresh. The Cons: The lines were confusing and long. I realized after waiting in the longer line that I could have gotten what I ordered in the express line with a shorter wait (minus a couple of cookies that I really didn't need anyway) but oh well. I also thought they could have had prices for the stuff in the display case and better labeling so you know what it is and how much it is. But Porto's is a classic that you must try at least once.
