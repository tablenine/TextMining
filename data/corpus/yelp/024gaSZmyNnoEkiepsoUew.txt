The most expensive meal I will probably ever have. This place is definitely the place to go if you want to see celebrities. We had dinner here on a Friday night and saw Dolly Parton, Wolfgang Puck (who was gracious enough to stop by our table and say hi), Â Maria Shriver and Arnold Schwarzenegger (yeah, I know! The dude from Kindergarten cop!!!). . . I read through some of the reviews before coming here and decided to go with the bone marrow flan for starters and I'm so glad I did. You definitely will not go wrong with this. For the main course I had the Japanese Wagyu New York steak and it was definitely not my cup of tea. Although the steak was only 6 ounces I felt incredibly full after just 5 bites. I knew the steak was high in fat but I didn't know it would leave me feeling so full (in a gross way) so quickly. I guess it was just too rich for me. No pun intended.. . The Yukon Gold Potato puree was heavenly but the mushrooms were a miss. Definitely not worth trying. Also, the apple crumble wasn't great either just good. Service here was impeccable and not pretentious at all, even with all the stars around us.
