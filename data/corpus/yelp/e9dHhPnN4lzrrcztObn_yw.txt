Restaurant: Milk
Category: Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt
I have been to Milk twice, and have come up with one conclusion:. If you go to Milk, you must order items that contain milk or those that you would drink a glass of milk with.. . My first trip to Milk was for lunch.  The panini sandwiches were good, but standard.  Nothing to rave about.  The highlight of my Milk experiences are with their ice cream and baked goods.  . . Ice cream:. - Pistachio Halvah (middle eastern confection made from sesame paste and honey).  Yum.. - Coffee Toffe - buzzingly good. - Lady Bug ice cream sandwich - I love the french macaron cookie they use to sandwich their strawberry (sorbet).  The cookie gives the sandwich great texture - crispy, chewy, light.  Called the lady bug for it's vibrant red color and half of it is dipped in dark chocolate.  A wonderful combination.  I can't wait to try the other flavors they have.. . Baked goodies:. - Blue Velvet Cake - I love red velvet cake and had to try this one.  Cream cheese frosting was good; nothing deviating from the standard.  The cake is a shocking electric blue.  Moist, dense cake.  The flavor was indiscernible, so I couldn't decipher the "blue" in the velvet cake.  My only clue was a blueberry candy that dots each slice.  . . -  Walnut White Chocolate Crumbles - I love Russian tea cakes (or snowball cookies), and these give you an added bonus of white chocolate.. . -  Chocolate Chip Cookies - Where's the milk, Milk?  These are great.. . Line was out the door both times I went, so seating can be scarce.  Parking on Beverly or residential street.
