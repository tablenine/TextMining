Restaurant: Din Tai Fung Dumpling House
Category: Chinese
How should I put it? . Let me first say this; the food is high quality and stays very truthful to it's original format in Taiwan. The original Taipei store is right next to my college (Tam Kung university, Taipei campus), and even back then (more than 20 years ago) it is already crowded and expensive. . the restaurant is also very famous in Taiwan, the EVA airline even contracted them to prepare food for their first class/business class passengers. its dumpling and many other dishes are famous. i personally enjoy their shrimp fried rice, steamed buns and beef noodle soup. . i tried the L.A. location and i was very satisfied with the quality and it brings back a lot of memories. i have to say their business plan is very smart, the layout/setup is clean, bright, trendy(newly opened store, which is next to its older store) with open kitchen to attract more "mainstream" clienteles, not exclusively to Chinese market. so in that sense, it is a place attracts many Americans food lovers and Chinese who bring their American friends to show case Chinese dishes. . The food quality is as good as ever, the portion is smaller so it feels expensive. it is a "showcase" restaurant.  For those who feel the quantity is important, there are plenty of noodle houses who serve won ton and dumplings in the Arcadia neighborhood for around $6.  Din Tai Fung is a successful, and good restaurant, it is a little pricy comapring to other Chinese place, but i would recommend it to friends.
