I've given this place so many chances to make me change my mind about it.. Maybe it has to do with the time I go there. I always try to beat the rush and get there on a Sunday or Saturday morning at opening time, and at that time, the service is lame at it's best. The chicken is good when it's fully cooked. I've gotten on a few occasions bloody fried chicken. And don't go about saying anything about it, you will get the killer looks from the staff. Oh.....order  the grits if you don't want to explain that you don't like grits...because if you say "skip the grits"....you get a "What?? No grits shuga???" No maam....no grits please.. I truely believe that this is one of the most overrated joints in Pasadena. I've given up on it.  A hesitant two stars at the best, only because you can't give one and a half star.
