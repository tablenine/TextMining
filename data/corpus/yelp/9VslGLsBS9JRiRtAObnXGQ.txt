I'm not too crazy about fish, but they make an amazing burger (Can't remember what it's called - but its the only non-fish thing on the menu). It has blu cheese and bacon - so good! I have had the tuna appetizer though - with peanuts, a cream sauce and greens. Their fish is so fresh and the seasoning is amazing. i've also had the crab with blood orange butter and toast, which is amazing.. . They also have great cocktails - the Luke's Lemonade is my favorite. My boyfriend like the Greyhound proper, although I don't like grapefruit.. . Its right around the street from the Panatges Theatre, so its perfect for a dinner and a show type of night.
