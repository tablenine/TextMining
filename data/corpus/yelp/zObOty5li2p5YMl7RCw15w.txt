Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
This place is so over-hyped.  I've lived in New York where people can make real pizza.  The pizza here almost tastes as bad as the frozen variety (and not the rising crust type either).  The wait was horrendous... over an hour wasted for some really lousy pizza.. . The $1 slices you can get near Port Authority are better than this place.
