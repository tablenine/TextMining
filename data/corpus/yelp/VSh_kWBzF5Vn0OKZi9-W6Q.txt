This place rocks! . . Craft is absolutely delicious. Everything tastes amazing and I love that they bring you all of these additional things to try, including lemon muffins wrapped up for breakfast that came with the bill.. . My fiance and I went and had oysters (amazing), the trout appetizer (fresh and delicious), scallops (awesome) and short ribs (incredible). We also got some great vegetable sides, which were well prepared but pretty pricey. For dessert we had a sorbet/ice cream/gelato trio that was great too. They have a huge dessert menu and we wanted to try everything but were stuffed by the end of dinner. I didn't feel that the portions were too small...though we ordered a lot. . . The decor is nice though the tables feel really high and I felt like a little kid. The service is incredible. I would give it 4.5 stars if possible.
