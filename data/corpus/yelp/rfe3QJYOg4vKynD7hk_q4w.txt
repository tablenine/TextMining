Restaurant: Coalfire Pizza
Category: Pizza
I still like real NYC pizza but the thin crust pizza of Coalfire is good, too. I ordered a 14" sausage-mushroom-onion and got a 14" sausage-mushroom-redpeppers pizza instead. I still tipped the staff well for the service and enjoyed the Caprese Salad a lot. I could not finish any of this alone as much as people tell me thin crust is so light to eat. I would go back since it's so close to my place and recommend this to my friends. yap.
