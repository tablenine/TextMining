good food - overpriced.. . this is basically a cafeteria style conveyor belt way of selecting food and then having it prepared.  it was fresh and delicious but way overpriced!. . if you get a small salad, it's $5 - and that's basically just greens.. if you want meat/protein added to it - it's another $5 - which is the price of their large specialty salads which are $10.. . if you want a sandwich, it comes with a small sized salad for $10.. . i don't like splitting my meals because no one wants what i want and vice versa... and i don't like taking home leftovers, but there really is no in-between here.  . . and what's the deal about leaving a tip??? tipping them for doing their job of mixing together salads that are already overpriced? there's no table service here - save for the busboy.  whatever.  . . the food was fresh and tasty - i loved my steak sandwich and salad - but if i'd eaten the whole thing, then my diet would have been out the door - these portions are out of control.
