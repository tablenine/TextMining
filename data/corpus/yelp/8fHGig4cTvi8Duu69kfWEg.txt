Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
As far as AYCE Korean restaurants go, I wasn't too impressed by this place.  . . I came here with a group of 25 for a friend's birthday.  Service was good and we all had a great time.  For the birthday girl, they popped open a champagne bottle, and did a fun performance.  If you have a birthday group, it's a good place to go....but keep in mind that people are aware of that.  For this reason, the birthday celebrations are loud and frequent and it gets annoying after the 4th or 5th one in a row.. . As far as food quality goes...it was good, but not as good as meats I have had at Tahoe Galbi and Road to Seoul.  I think meats are better marinated there.
