This place is just OK.  I've been twice...the second time was not my choice.  4th and Swift was slammed.   . . The Concentric guys need to focus more on the food and service then on being uber avant-garde.  For example, every glass of water has to come from behind the bar.  It takes forever to get a glass of water at your table and even longer at the bar during peak times due to the oversight of putting in a side station.  The bartenders are a bottle neck....there are only 3-4.  They are outnumbered.  The food is OK and seems to be a little overpriced.   I know they have an image to uphold.  . . "One" is still my favorite Concentric restaurant. Bob please slow down building your restaurant empire.  I normally like your stuff but you seem to be overlooking the detail these days.  BTW at "TAP" please stop the condensation from dripping on the patrons at the bar before opening a new restaurant.
