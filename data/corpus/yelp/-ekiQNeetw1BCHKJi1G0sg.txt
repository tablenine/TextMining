Absolutely amazing! I love the food and I love the people. Randy and I often sit and talk as I eat (when and if it is ever slow or quiet). . . What really won me over was the fact that when Randy, who had just learned of my dietary restrictions for Lent, made a special plate just for me. . . I love the personal feel when I go to Bab's and you miss that when you go to your classic chain. The food is fresh and tasty. And the sweet potato fries are to die for (yum).. . I will definitely be going back and I am definitely telling all of my friends to give Bab's a try!
