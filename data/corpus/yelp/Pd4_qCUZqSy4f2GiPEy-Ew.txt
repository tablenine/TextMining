If you truly enjoy a good izakaya place, then you're having too much beer and sake to correctly judge the quality of the food. At that point, only one rule comes into play for prioritized ordering: what dishes come out the fastest.. . Here's my list that will guarantee food coma bliss or a messy bathroom floor: Â Fried Oysters, Buttered Asparagus, Spinach and Bacon, Cheese and Fish Cakes, Steak, Fried Halibut.. Of course, I tend to think the taste priority is that exact list in reverse order, but your stomach needs to be pampered with as much grease possible. Keep it classy Sawtelle.
