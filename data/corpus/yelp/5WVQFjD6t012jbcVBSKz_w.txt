Z and I went here last night for dinner and left sated. Our waitress was wonderful. I believe her name was Anglika and she had an eastern European accent, possibly Polish. I presented her the three flatbreads I was interested in trying, she decided that I should go with the cheese and wild herb but that I should add mushrooms. I went with her suggestion and it was dreamy. It is not a large flatbread, but definitely good for one person. It looked like I was going to have leftovers but than I just couldn't stop. It was so good. I wanted to split a salad with Z but instead I got a $9 watermelon margarita. It is very froufrou, very pink, and is served in a martini glass. It was very drinkable with barely a boozy taste. When I stood up at the end of the meal, I realized I was a bit tipsy. Good job, Crust. . . We asked Anglika about desert and she said there was a chocolate cake that was vegan and just a bit dry but it was great a la mode. They also had carrot cake and both chocolate and vanilla ice creams made from grass-fed cows. We went with the carrot cake which was one of the best I've ever had. Waiters who actually eat the food at the place they wait and speak their mind rule. I will be coming here again especially with my environment loving friends. Num!
