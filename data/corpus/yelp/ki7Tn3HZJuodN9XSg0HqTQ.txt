The building this restaurant is located in is fairly nondescript so you really don't know what to expect as far as the interior.  Once you enter the steel door and pass through the curtain the large contemporary dining room is revealed and it is really quite stunning. . . On my most recent visit, I was meeting a friend for drinks and an early dinner.  I was running ahead of schedule and arrived at 5 and was told they don't open until 5:30.  However, the hostess was very gracious and got me a glass of cabernet and escorted me to a lounge area in the back that had two really comfy chairs, a chaise lounge, telephone and flat screen TV.  So, I enjoyed my wine, watched CNN and, of course, texted while I waited for my friend.. . I have been to this restaurant several times and never have I been disappointed with the food.  My most recent meal was the smoked brisket.  It was so tender and tasty that it melted in my mouth and I love the red pepper grits and tend to order them every time I go.  However, I need to order the truffled mac-n-cheddar sometime as I may be missing out on another wonderful side dish.  . . For the excellent food, service and atmosphere I give One five stars.
