Great Irish joint.  I've been to the one on Harms in the northern suburbs, but a bunch of popped in here during a weeknight.  There was a good amount of traffic from office workers and people watching the game.  . . Burgers were good.  Fish &amp; chips were delish.  If I'm walking around printer's row, I'll definitely pop back in.
