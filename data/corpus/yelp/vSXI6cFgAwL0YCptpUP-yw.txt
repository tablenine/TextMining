Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
This is one of my favorite places to eat when visiting my sister because it's consistently good.  . . We are for sure a garlic family, I pretty much don't taste garlic anymore unless there is a lot.  And there is a lot at The Stinking Rose.  The Bagna Calda is a must order, they are always generous with the warm rolls.  The Arugula Pesto pasta is my favorite, as close to my Dad's cooking as I'll ever get in a restaurant.  Just don't order the Neon Ravioli if you're hungry.  . . The service is usually good, but maybe that's because we get the same waiter that remembers us.  The atmosphere is a big plus.  I almost forget that I'm in LA when I'm inside this dark cozy restaurant.. . Make sure you make a trip to the bathroom, girls.  There's a freaky fertility chair that will be sure to add some fun to the evening.
