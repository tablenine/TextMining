Restaurant: Cho Sun Ok Restaurant
Category: Korean
Maybe if you're Korean, maybe the place is "OK".  If not, then 'fogettaboutit'.  Panchans (for non-Koreans), not spicy and not much variety.  Had to ask several times, until we got at least SOME of the real Korean stuff.  As for the Cook at the Table Dinners, again we were not allowed to cook our own (while the Korean diners were).  Also, not provided with the plate of spliced green onions like all other Korean Diners (we like onions too!).  Also, not really impressed with 'stone-top' cooking versus real over-the-coals BBQ.  Also, really surprised NO ONE was provided with at least grean lettuce leaves for roll-ups of the BBQ meat, like other Korean BBQ's (let alone the even better large radish roll-ups) along with garlic cloves.  Enough experimenting with 'other' Korean restaurants, I'll stick with the best -- Kang Nam (where you get EVERYTHING -- even korean pancake and soup included, for virtually same price; and all the wonderful Korean panchans -- and not treated like a 2nd-class citizen).
