The location is actually in a pretty quiet intersection. Right across the street from the Scientology Church looming over the cafe. It was a bit hard to find the place. There's no sign around the location other than the window. I went on a Saturday at around 10:30. Everything went swimmingly. We got a table right away. Outside too. The sun was beating down on me but luckily someone helped us move the umbrella. I ordered the savory salmon eggs benedict. It was good but the egg was too yolky. Covered everything. The smoked salmon was good but the egg didn't really help balance it out. I kept having to sop it up with the yolk. They also added some veggies under the yolk which didn't really make sense to me. It wasn't leafy. It was attached to the stems. I would've picked a different veggie. My friend picked the chorizo baked egg and kept having to go to the restroom to blow her nose. She didn't know it was going to be so spicy. Next time, I'll go with my first instinct and try that french toast!
