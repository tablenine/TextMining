There are few things in this world that I enjoy more than watching "Commando" for the 527th time on my couch with my Snuggie -- a small, chill BYOB place is one of those things. I've been here twice, and I'm a fan. . . The wait on a Friday night was about 20 min, but my buddies and I cracked open some Lagunitas' and we were fine. The wait on Sunday afternoon was nothing.  . . Food:. Hot and Sour soup - If it were socially acceptable, I would eat cilantro 24/8 (that's not a typo) - and they loaded the cilantro on. So that's OK in my book. . We all shared the BBQ Kogi, the blackened tilapia, tostones, brussel sprouts and chorizo, and squash with sweet potatoes.. . I think the side plates are the highlight of this place. The chorizo and brussel sprouts was my favorite dish. Similar to hiphop artists-turned-actors, brussel sprouts get a bad rap these days. But hey, who didn't love Ice Cube in "Friday"? And don't even get me started on the genius of Tone-Loc in "Ace Ventura".  Tostones - amazing sauce. The squash and sweet potatoes were a bit too sweet, but they reminded me of Thanksgiving, which is always nice....mmm Turkey. . . The BBQ Kogi was great - personally I could have used a bit more kick, but tasty nonetheless. The tilapia was good, but I think it is better without the bread as a lot of the flavor is lost (a thought which was shared by the person behind me with celiac sprue). . . Drinks:. BYOB - enough said. . . All in all, a great place to go with some of your more chill friends. It is a pretty gritty/cafeteria atmosphere which is kinda cool. I'm definitely coming back, maybe next time with my snuggie.
