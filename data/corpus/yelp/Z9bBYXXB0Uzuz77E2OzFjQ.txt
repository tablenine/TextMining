I went as part of a school project with two friends. They have an extensive wine list, in my opinion, and it seemed quite interesting to try and pair these with the non-meat dishes. . . The answer to all dishes is Riesling Spatlese, in case you were curious. . . But wines aside, the meal started strong, then ended on a "meh" note. I started with the soft boiled egg salad, bursting with silky buttery flavor. Friends had the bubblegum pear salad and the sweet potato-coconut soup thingy. Awesomeness abounded. Next course, I had the beet and goat cheese terrine (beets rule!), then the boys had sunchoke ravioli and the ... some won ton potsticker looking thing. Better than the first! The last thing for me was the grits dish, soooooo velvety good. But my friends struck out on the spiced hush puppies and the udon noodles (few and far too salty). Then they burned his dessert. Grrrrr! . . Jeremy, our sever, was a good guy and was very accommodating to us pick culinary students, so...that's why it's three stars instead of two. Believe it or not, I'm going back because I have a groupon to the place. But now I know what to stick with (GRITS and BEETS NATION) and what to avoid (brioche and chocolate dish).
