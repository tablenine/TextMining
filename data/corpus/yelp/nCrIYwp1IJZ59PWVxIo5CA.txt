FREQUENT VISITOR! LOVE IT!. . I love this place and will keep coming here forever and ever. Even though I've only tried a few things, most of the menu is just great and very affordable. Its nice to go somewhere that the food is reasonable priced and the taste is amazing. It gets crowded on some nights, but its still worth the wait in comparison to other restaurants in the area. AND this furaibo is much better than the one in rowland heights.. . WHAT TO ORDER:. -chicken karaage. -chicken wings or breast/jane at all levels of spicy. -rice ball plain. -pitcher of sapporo. -house sake (warm). . Go during off hours (especially Sun-Thurs and at the beginning of the dinner hour). And park in the parking lot behind the restaurant if they have spaces, i love that this place has a parking lot!
