Anyone who was out last night knows what a perfect evening it was for outdoor dining / drinking. I don't know what the actual temperature was, but with the breeze being neither hot nor cold, JCT's upstairs bar is an absolutely awesome spot (included was a nice, albeit limited, view of the city). . . The inside bar is an open space that makes it feel as if you're seated outdoors. And then the actual outdoor space has a sizable deck with tables and chairs, in addition to intimate nooks for lounging. Very cool. . . So the "crowd" last night was not the least bit eclectic, but if you want chill, this place is light and mellow and perfect for when you want to actually talk and drink (not sure if things get "crazy" on a weekend night, but I'd be surprised if they did). And if guys wearing Brooks Brothers and/or Gap do it for you, then you may want to wander in here and take a look (although I suspected most of them were barely out of college, and those that were older seemed very married, even if they were sans wedding ring...I have a nose for that kind of thing). . . So I just drank. Sorry. The food being served looked great, and even though the "Angry Mussels" and Oysters on the half shell were ample portions, I wasn't hungry enough to throw down the extra cash on food. The food is not cheap, however I thought the drinks were comparable to average bar prices. . . I had a chance to walk through the dining space downstairs (in order to use the bathroom), and it's very spacious and nice (including the bathroom). I took a mental note that JCT would be a great place to take out of town guests, or a good "first date" (for some). I'm just not one of those people and would only go here for the bar space upstairs.
