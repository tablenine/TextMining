Restaurant: Nick&#39;s Food To Go
Category: Greek
Ahhh, Nick's.  This hole-in-the-wall will pull at your heartstrings and serves as a wonderful reminder of what a true family owned business is.  And the food, oh, the food.  I recently moved to Grant Park, which increased my proximity to this little gem... everyday on my way home I drive past, and the little blue and white building draws me in with the wonderful smell of roasting lamb, lemon pepper and garlic.. . The Gyros and Hummus are where its at.  They use a wonderfully fresh and fluffy pita thats brushed with garlic oil and toasted on a grill, the cucumber yogurt sauce serves as a wonderful counter-agent to the blast of fresh garlic and lemon pepper.  Go 'All-the-Way' and you wont forget it... add feta and you'll get weak in the knees.  Six kinds of meat to chooses from?  Oh yeah... but stick to the chargrilled chicken or lamb, which are clear winners.. . The Gyros are HUGE, but I can never seem to pass up the insane good deal of making it a 'plate' or 'combo'... I mean, Greak fries, Greek salad, gyro and a drink for $10?!  What?  yeah, thats right... let your inner recessionista sing and go for it.. . Nick and Mamma head up the joint... pay attention to the special board behind the counter, if it says hummus - get it.  If it says greek lasagna - get it.  If it says baklava - get it.  Get it?
