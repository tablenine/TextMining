Indeed, Herbivore in SF is the gimpy, runty, diseased sibling of Real Food Daily.  This is a great place for a casual meal. I am a fan of their club sandwiches, and once they had a special for an eggplant lasagne that was amazing.  I wish Herbivore could be magically replaced by RFD.  This is what vegan comfort food is all about.
