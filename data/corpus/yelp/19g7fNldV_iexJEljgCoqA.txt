This place is great.  Probably one of the best Mexican restaurants in the city.  It has a great selection of food at very reasonable prices.  . . Dinner for two including one app. $32.  Not to mention its BYOB.. . Would have given it five stars if the server was a little more attentive and salsa a little spicier.
