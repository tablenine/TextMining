it's true, it's very confusing when you first walk in and there are so many people just standing around.  This place was packed.  I too wasn't sure if I was supposed to order food first then then sit down or wait to be seated.  If you get past the crowd there is a host/hostess table in the middle of the large room where someone will take your name down.  Come early or be prepared to wait.  It was an hour wait for us on the Thursday night.  The portabello fries live up to the hype, crunchy, tasty, earthy, delicious.  The salad was fantastic and the meatball sliders and garlic fries were yummy.  The sausage pizza was good but nothing really out of the ordinary.  The macroons are completely overpriced, small, dry and a complete disappointment.  Our server was nice, attentive and got the job done.  All in all, we enjoyed ourselves and I wouldn't mind trying the other items on the menu.  The food, service and atmosphere were good so I'll be back.
