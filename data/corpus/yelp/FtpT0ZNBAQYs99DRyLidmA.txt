Restaurant: Rosa Mexicano
Category: Wine Bars
Visited Rosa Mexicano with my mother for her birthday.  We came here for brunch as a IKEA pregame spot.  I always prefer to head into IKEA full and at least two drinks down!. . We started with the guacamole that was made fresh for us on the spot.....moved on to margaritas that definitely had a kick and I didn't leave a bite of my eggs on the plate.  The breakfast was AMAZING!. . Those that bashed the food might be on the right track for lunch/dinner but the brunch was oh so tasty.  I thought that the spirited staff, killer decor and amazing margarita more than made up for any downfall in the food.  . . Just like any other place in Atlanta you will pay more for the experience so if you are a tight wad and just in search of Mexican food.....then  head to your nearest El Torerro.
