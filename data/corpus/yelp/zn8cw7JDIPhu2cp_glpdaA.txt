Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
The chicken and waffles combination is ridiculously good.  I had to be dragged to my first Roscoe's visit.  I pretty much went kicking and screaming because chicken + waffles?!  Really?!  Who's idea was that??  Apparently it was the idea of some GENIUS because seriously.  It works.  But the thing about it is, it can't just be ANY chicken and waffle combination.  It has to be ROSCOE'S chicken and waffles.  It's something about the way they prepare them.  Separately, they're very good chicken and very good waffles.  But together?  Phenomenal.  It can't be explained through words.  Go try it.  Then you'll understand.
