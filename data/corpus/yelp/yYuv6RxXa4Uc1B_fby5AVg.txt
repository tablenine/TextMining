this place is great. their wings were a-mazing. better than hot wings caf√© and hooters combined. everything is very deicious and very cheap. my gf and I ordered 6 or 7 plates and the bill came out to 23 dollars and we came out full...and im a big eater. im only giving 4 stars due to the fact that their extra spicy wings weren't spicy at all and I only showed up for the wings.
