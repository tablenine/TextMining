Thanks to my cousins I found this awesome bakery. I ordered some of their cheese rolls and the guava cheese rolls, the potato balls, and a croissant. It was all good =) My favorite is the guava cheese rolls...mostly because I love guava. The potato balls had a nice meat filling in them. Didn't expect that. The line is winding and not too long, even though it will look like it but the line moves pretty fast. Mostly because people who go there tend to already know what they want. So scout ahead.
