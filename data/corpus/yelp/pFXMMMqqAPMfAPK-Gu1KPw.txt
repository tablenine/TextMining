first time to step into this place, and hearing all the rave reviews.. not sure if i will step back into this place. i only wanted dessert so i came with with a friend for pie. tried the pecan pie, hoping it would taste home made but it had a taste like it was freeze dried. my friend ended up ordering the chocolate cream pie and french fries (gross combo) but i looked @ the fries, omg, can there be any more oil on there. thats disgusting. there goes my arteries. i am sure i will step into this place again, because i havent tried out the other items they have to offer. but we'll see.
