I went to Katsu-ya on a Thursday night after going to the gym. It was 8 PM, which I guess is the new trendy time to go to dinner. My problem with this place was not exactly the food, but rather the wait. When I walked in I was told that there would be a 45 minute wait. I was hungry, but not STARVING. I decided to wait it out since when you roll up your ONLY option is to valet. The problem with that is that there are about 15 people ahead of you on the list and you have to pay $3.50 to get your car back that they just took away, So I sat.. And sat and sat. It was over an hour before anyone asked me if I would like a drink or to order an appetizer. I have to say they were fairly efficient moving people in and out; however since I was alone, I feel that I was passed over several times to seat people at tables for two.. . The moral of the story - MAKE A RESERVATION - even if you do, people wait. Wait and wait and wait.. . They had a ton of specials which looked fantastic when other people were trying them. I tried one of their hand rolls in soy paper, which was pretty good. The Unagi was a little salty, and surly not the best I've ever had. The Tuna was a delightful pink color, looked fresh, but was just ok. I also had the BSC, which took forever to get. I've had much better elsewhere.. . What I don't understand is why so many people chose this place. There are a bunch of places just down the street that are equally as good or better (Tama sushi for sushi and specials, Asenebo for their specials - fish.). . I felt captured - I had waited 10 minutes, what is 10 minutes more? I had waited 45 minutes, what is 10 minutes more? And they had my car...
