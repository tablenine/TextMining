THE BEST MASTRO'S!!!!  I've been to Ocean Club in Newport, the Costa Mesa one, and the Beverly Hills location.  The BH location is by far the best in terms of food.  The atmosphere is obviously better at Ocean Club.  But...the food is not salty as it is at Ocean Club and Costa Mesa.  Every single time I get mac &amp; cheese, it's ridiculously salty.  The gnocchi is much better at the BH location...it's PERFECTION!  Seafood tower is a must, but beware...the lobster is ridiculously pricey for not a lot of meat.  I guess that's expected though.. . OVERALL:  I LOVE THIS LOCATION!!  Best food I've had in a long long time!
