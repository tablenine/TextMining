5 stars based on sandwiches &amp; potato balls. This place is a 45min drive from my house but when I'm craving an authentic cuban sandwich I can't drive fast enough. Cuban sandwich: Soft roll, stuffed with your choose of pulled porked, garlic pork, sliced pork, breaded pork, ham, pickles, swiss cheese pressed down like a panini. Potato ball: Potato on the outside, ground beef with onion on the inside. Try it once and your hooked. Why would so many yelpers rate this place with 5 stars? Because its great. Always to full to try the pastries, but they look goood!!
