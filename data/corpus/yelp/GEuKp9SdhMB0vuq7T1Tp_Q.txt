It's all good, really.  There is something on the menu to please everyone: Tater tots, corndogs, burgers (beef, bison, turkey, black bean).  The potato salad is amazing.   They offer deli style sandwiches and huge salads as well.  The food is just excellent.   They have a great formula and stick to it.  They are very generous in their servings: food and drink (they pour very generously).  They have a great bar and a large selection of bottled beer.  The bar at the L5P location is small; the one in Midtown is huge.  .  I have always had good service here as well.  They demand respect from their customers, but what's wrong with that?  They have a mostly tattooed staff.   The atmosphere is very casual.  On weekends, there can be a wait, but if you are a burger connoisseur, they are worth the wait. . Oh, they believe in smokers rights, or rather they are against government babysitting, so unfortunately (or fortunately for those of us who can't stand screaming children) it's 18 and up.
