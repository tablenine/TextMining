Restaurant: Newport Tan Cang Seafood Restaurant
Category: Chinese
Chinese = Delicious. The food of course.. . After waiting a grueling 1 1/2 hours for my sister and her in-laws to arrive at the house we were effin starving. My sister decided to go over to their usual spot. I thought my sister was kidding when she had said she always came to Newport Tang Cang but to my surprise the owner and the waiters actually know her. Before even taking a look at the menu, I wanted to order what I've been craving for in ages; salted fish &amp; chicken fried rice.... OMG... DroOOoOlz. When the waiter came, I immediately asked for it but to my disappointment they no longer had it in the menu. Why you ask? He told us because someone was actually psycho enough to sue them, the reason being because the people that ordered it expected the chicken and fish to be large pieces, not knowing it was all diced up and mixed, making it a Fried Rice. *sigh* I don't know if it's an Asian thing but we all know that it's all seasonings and pieces of chicken and fish just thrown in there. My world was crushed to find they didn't have what I've been craving for. :*(*. . But, not completely crushed because everything was down right good. We ordered: Mayonnaise Shrimps with Walnut, Salted Fried Pork Chops, Hot and Sour Soup, Fillet Fish with Basil, Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce, and the ever so delicious Newport Special Lobster. MmmMmmMmMM.......... . All in all, the meal was what we just needed. The service was just great. Our waiter was one of the funniest and best ones I ever had. And as we were about to leave the table, he said "Salamat!!!!!" ("Thank You" in Tagalog). . My mission to get some Salted Fish and Chicken fried rice continues..............
