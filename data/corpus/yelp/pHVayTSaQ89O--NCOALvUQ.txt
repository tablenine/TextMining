I don't give many places 5 Yelp stars but Langer's get one hands down!  A buddy took me to this place for the first time and before we got there, he asked me if I liked pastrami.  I mean, it's alrite...my idea of pastrami has always been at places like "The Hat" or "Johnny's Pastrami."  But my buddy said that I haven't had pastrami until I've had pastrami at Langer's.  . . Anyways we got there and I had what EVERYONE else was having - their #19 pastrami sandwich on rye with cheese and russian cole slaw.  Let me tell you --- IT WAS THE SHIZNIT!!!  Went there again with my wife and --- IT WAS THE SHIZNIT!!!. . You just gotta love places that the locals who know food go to.  One tip: just be careful going here because it is in the middle of a ghetto-ass neighborhood.  The streets stink of piss and trash is everywhere but at least there's free one hour Langer's parking (the lot is about a 2 minute walk from the restaurant).  . . Stop what you're doing now!  Go here!
