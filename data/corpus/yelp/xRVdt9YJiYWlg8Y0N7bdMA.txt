This is one of the top 3 beer places in Atlanta, perhaps the best.  Great belgian beers upstairs, and good domestic micro selection as well.  The food is actually very good, i recommend the fish &amp; chips and the perogies are the best outside of Pittsburgh &amp; Chicago.  The burger is the only thing I would not recommend.  Also in winter they serve soups that are the best I have ever had.  Overall a great place, but be wary of crowded times as this place gets packed!  Cheers!
