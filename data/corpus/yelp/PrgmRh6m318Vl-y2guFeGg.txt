this place totally does not need another review. i'm sure all the info you need you can find already posted here and on their website. . . here's what i will tell you:. after i moved away from LA i thought about milk for twelve (12) days in a row. yes, almost two weeks. i couldn't stop thinking about all the glorious treats miles and miles away from me. i'm thinking of moving back soon and i'm seriously considering finding a place within walking distance and then working the rest of my life around that.
