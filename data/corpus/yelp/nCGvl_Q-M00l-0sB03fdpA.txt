Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
No other Korean BBQ place can beat this. It's an over-sized tent, a brilliant way to make a smoking-friendly restaurant. They are so smoking friendly that they even sell Marlboro lights and reds at the register. . I've been to this place before it turned all you can eat and little has changed. Sure, the quality has gone down a bit, you are turned away if you are less than party of 10 before 10pm on weekends and the place gets more business than they can handle but I keep on coming back here.. I stick to their galbi and spicy marinated pork and ask the waitress to keep the beers coming. Side dishes are good, salad is good, and even their soup is good. No complaints! Oh and service? I love to push those little buttons to have a server come in matter of seconds. On weekends they will play that FOBish "happy birthday" song and it's great to see reactions of your friends when they hear it for the first time. You will laugh your little booty off. In the end everyone's eating, drinking, laughing and smoking. Just the way it should be
