Restaurant: David Burke&#39;s Primehouse
Category: Steakhouses
First, I have to admit that steak houses don't do that much for me.  I get irritated by the fact that everything has to be ordered a la carte and I am not usually impressed by the steak.  So David Burke's Primehouse had to seriously wow me to get 5 stars.. . As much as I hate to admit it, I have to say that the steak was indeed phenomenol.  Probably the best steak I've ever had.. . Things that pissed me off - everything, and I do mean everything, has to be ordered a la carte.  This includes the sauce for your steak if you want some, sides which are quite small, and anything else you can think of.  This is the main reason why I'm giving them a 3 star rating.  If you're going to spend a small fortune on a piece of meat, it would help psychologically if it came with at least one side dish.  I am not opposed to spending money on food - in fact, we spend most of our money on dining out - so the fact that I was appalled at the price of the steak means a lot.. . I did enjoy the doughnuts with the do-it-yourself sauces, but it didn't douse my anger at the pricey, pricey bill.  . . The service and atmosphere were fine, but I would never go back if I had to pay out of my own pocket.
