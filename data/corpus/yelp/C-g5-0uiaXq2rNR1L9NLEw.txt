Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
UPDATE: Took away a star because 50% of my dinner mates had major digestion problems for rest of the weekend.  Thank goodness I don't eat pizza.. . ******************. . Freshman year college beau, Greg (1 of 3) only ate pizza, hamburgers, and occasionally Taco Bell, period. So for well over a dozen years (telling of my age) I  did not touch any of the said food items.. . 2007 has been a mile marker for me, I think I've eaten pizza about 4-5 times, Which is 4-5 times more than I wanted to.. . I'm currently in Chi-town and the token local guy out of the retreat group took us to Lou's. It's a tradition, I hear.. . One thing he didn't know: I'm allergic to tomatoes (not resulting in death allergic reaction, luckily and I do like what I can't have).  Second thing he didn't know: I HATE Cheese.  Albeit, I did warn him I am a protein gal. . . So I've been traveling via a flight that didn't serve or sell lunch, I was starving.  at Lou's I ended up with a really big, yet soggy and uneventful Cesar salad but a very tasty cup of chicken and veggie soup (with tomatoes, but who cares).. . Where am I getting at... The two large stuffed pizza looks absolutely soaked in grease and not edible unless I really want a heart attack before I'm 40 yrs young.  I did try one,  I scrapped off the nasty cheese and toppings, the crust ended up pretty good.. . Lack of choices didn't help. but I did find our waitress very friendly bringing me 12 sugars for my 32 oz of tea at every refill and the soup, crust on the pizza, plus the cookie pizza with ice cream were delish.. . After I get back to Cali, I need to detox from all the grease I've eaten and going to eat in chicago.
