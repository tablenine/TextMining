This is one of the first restaurants I was taken to when I was living in Los Angeles over 10 years ago. How I wish I could find a Cuban restaurant somewhere around me... Simply delicious and super filling. I love the plantains!!! Â Two dishes that stood out to me was the lechon asado and garlic chicken!
