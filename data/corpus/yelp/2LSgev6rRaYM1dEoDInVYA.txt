I would give this place 6 stars if I could.   For the sandwich lovers like myself, this place is a definite must try.  The pastrami sandwiches here are just too good.  I usually say "so good" when i have a great meal, but I say "so good" between every bite because it's just that ridiculously good!  If I had a list of things you must eat before you die, their pastrami sandwich would be on it.  . . Unlike other sandwich places that offer pastrami, their pastrami cuts are thick, less fatty, juicy, and super tender.  Their sandwich is sooooo good; its a whooping $14 dollars.  But its oh so worth it.  I would choose their pastrami sandwich over good steak any day (but not great  steak).  If only they had more variations to their sandwiches.  It doesn't come with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, or other good veggies that some people might want in their sandwiches.  . . If they lowered their sandwich prices, I would go there DAILY!  But for now when I'm feeling like I need my bang for the buck, I'll go to other sandwich joint.... . I HELLA approve this one.
