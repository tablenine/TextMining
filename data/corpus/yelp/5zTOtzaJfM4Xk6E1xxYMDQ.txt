Ahhh corned beef hash the way it's supposed to be. Not like the bowl of oil that my cafeteria serves up every morning. Food was good! I was a little disappointed with the home fries because they were extremely mushy (and I know I can make better than that). But what they lacked in home fries, they made up in home made beef sausages (and a freebie second helping too... shhhh said the host). . . Be prepared to wait a while. The line was out the door when we arrived (prime brunch time ~11a) but they served us cookies and hot coffee! Now that's service. Not a service you get very often anymore and it's a shame... it really makes a difference. . . The damage wasn't too bad at ~$12 per person. The reason I'm giving them 4 stars is just cuz I thought the place was a little sloppy on the clean up of the tables. I know they were busy but a wet table is pretty gross. But go for the food! It's totally worth it.
