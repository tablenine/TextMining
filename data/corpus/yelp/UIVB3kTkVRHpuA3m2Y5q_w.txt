Category: Sushi Bars
Hands down my favorite place for sushi.  This place actually converted me from being a non-sushi eater.  Although, I have to admit that I still haven't branched out from tuna and yellowtail.. . I absolutely love Katsuya's Crispy Rice Spicy Tuna, Shishito Peppers, Albacore with Crispy Onion, Baked Crab Hand Rolls and the Robert Roll (shrimp tempura and spicy tuna topped with avocado).  And they have a delicious but rather unhealthy Crab Mozzarella dish.  Imagine snow crab chunks surrounded by a pillow of mozzarella cheese and flash fried in tempura batter.  Yum yum.. . This Katsuya is far better than its SBE restaurant counterparts located in other touristy locales (i.e. Las Vegas, Hollywood, etc.).  Yes, this restaurant is a lot smaller and a lot less swankier than the other Katsuyas, but you can't beat their prices and the quality of food here. This Katsuya is a quarter of the price of the other ones, and I'd even argue that the food is also better.   This Katsuya is tiny, so it's always packed.  Call ahead.. . Decor = 3 stars. Food = 5 stars. Service = 4 stars. Value = 4 stars
