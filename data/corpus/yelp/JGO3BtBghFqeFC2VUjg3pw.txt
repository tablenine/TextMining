The decor here is beautiful, however, the quality is lacking.  We went here on a night when they also had a special that included an appetizer, entree and dessert for each person.  The appetizers weren't memorable.  For dinner, we went with the two house specialties, the Duck trio and the Filet Mignon.  Neither were impressive. They also charged us an unusually high corking fee for our bottle of wine that we brought. Overall, we were highly unimpressed with the mediocre food. Not recommended.
