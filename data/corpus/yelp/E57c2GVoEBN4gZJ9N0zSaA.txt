Even though I would never come here normally because it is in the heart of Lincoln Park, parking is a pain in the behind, and it can get a bit crowded. . . However, coming here in the late morning/early afternoon during the week it isn't so bad. The service was pretty good, and it wasn't that busy. . . I ordered the breakfast burrito with avocado. It had tons of cheese, bell peppers, eggs, onions, and tomatoes. Yummy! It came with some spicy salsa and sour cream. I also ordered a side of the potatoes because I heard so much about these great things. Boy--were they yummy!!. . Would I come here on a Sunday morning? Hell no. Would come here on a Tuesday at 11:54 am? Sure would.
