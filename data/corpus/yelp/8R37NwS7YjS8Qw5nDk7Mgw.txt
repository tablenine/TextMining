I wish this place was closer to me.  I would eat here everyday.  They now use Daiya as a cheese substitute.  Its really awesome.. . I have had everything on their menu.  The crispy chikin' is my favorite with the kale salad.  I could kill that twice a day everyday for the rest of my life..... . Go here.
