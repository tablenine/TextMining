Restaurant: ilili
Category: Middle Eastern
ilili was great!  The atmosphere is very trendy and chic - there is a lounge and restaurant.  The restaurant is good for both groups of friends and dates.  . . The food was pretty good - my favorite was the fried cheese.  I'm actually not a fan of stuffed grape leaves - but these were decent (again, biased here as I don't really like them in general).  We didn't try many of the meat dishes, mostly the vegetable dishes, which were very good.  The desserts were excellent, as was the turkish coffee.  . . I would recommend this place, and will def come back for the happy hour specials during the week!
