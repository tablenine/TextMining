I'm the 300th review!!!!  Wait, is that a good thing or a bad thing?. . Anyhoo, Porto's is simply amazing..... . I found Porto's on the way to the airport one day.  I've been craving the pan con lechon sandwich ever since....   something this good can't be legal!  I also am in love with the fried banana chips.  I betcha can't eat just one!  . . The wait can be quite long but well worth it!  I just love this place.
