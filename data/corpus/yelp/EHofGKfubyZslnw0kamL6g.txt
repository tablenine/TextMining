i love mozza. especially there caprese salad! sooo freaking good!! I took my boyfriend there for his birthday. I was smart to make a reservation in advance otherwise we'd have to wait like an hour. we ordered the caprese salad, as i stated before, my favorite!! had the bone marrow, oily, not a fan but i knew he'd like it. we shared the fennel sausage pizza. perfect amount of food for the two of us plus a bottle of wine, waiters recommendation. everything was great but the server was not very attentive. oh wells, it happens.
