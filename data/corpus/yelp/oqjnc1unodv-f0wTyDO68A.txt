Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
I'm not an idiot, I know that hot dogs are unhealthy.  But they really are tasty little devils!. . It was around 1 am.  Hubby and I were driving home.  We were both starving.  Pink's is obviously famous in LA.   We had to check it out since the line wasn't obscenely long.  Don't get me wrong, the line was by no stretch of the imagination short.. . The loving husband stood outside in the cold.  I stayed in the car looking up the menu on his blackberry.  I ordered the spicy Polish dog with sauerkraut and a million other toppings, french fries and a side of chili.  If I'm going to indulge in sinful delights, I'm going all out.  Come on lard!!!!!!!. . Hubby got back to the car in what seemed like an eternity.  The line moved at a snail's pace.  The poor man.  I started snacking on the fries in the car.  They were so good!  The fries tasted like curly fries, all seasoned.  I felt a bit ill afterward, I now think the fries may have had a flour coating.  The hot dog was UNBELIEVABLE.   Spicy.  Crisp outside and delicious moist inside.  I can honestly say the best hot dog experience of my life.  The chili was mushy and weird.. . I like my hot dog piled with a bazillion toppings.  I love love love spicy dogs.  The hot dog had flecks of red chili pepper inside.  This was an ultimate hot dog eating experience.
