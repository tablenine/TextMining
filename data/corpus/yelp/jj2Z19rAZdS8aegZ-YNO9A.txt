This review is a year in the making. That's right. A year. Girls night out. Friday night. 6 ladies. Dinner. Drinks. . I was the only repeat diner in attendance so I was the tour guide through the menu. . *Miso Glazed Salmon Roll . *Spicy Tuna Roll . *Ahi Tuna Poke: Tuna, Avocado, Asian rice crackers. Sushi grade tuna was luscious. . *Peeky Toe Crab Nachos: Tortilla Chips, Roasted Tomato Salsa, Guacamole, White Cheddar Oaxaca Cheese, Sour Cream. Simply awe-inspiring. Keeping your appetizer choices fresh is a pretty daunting task for most restaurants since you see NEARLY the same apps everywhere. These nachos are killer. Biggest hit of the night. . *Shrimp Ceviche with tortilla chips: Key West Pink Shrimp, Jicama, Lime and Orange Juice. Simply refreshing and light. Tasty. . . While I didn't get to order The Dude: bone-in, Parmesan crusted rib-eye steak served with saut√©ed mushrooms and a side of cheesy mashed potatoes; this time (my dining companion who promised to split it with me feigned a full belly). I had it in the past and it is an instant coronary. I think of The Dude often and fondly. . . The interior? Look I don't work for Architectural Digest. I'm here for the great food &amp; drinks. Total mix of people, downtowners, people celebrating b-days, etc. Yes it is a bit loud, but it's Friday night downtown. Meant to be loud. . Duuuude.
