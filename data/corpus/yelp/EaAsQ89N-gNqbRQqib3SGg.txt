I went to Wishbone on a Sunday, early afternoon. I have dined here several times, so I'm not a Wishbone newb ;) . It appeared to be crowded, but we were seated right away. So far, so good. Waiter came over, got our drink orders , and I ordered the Peppar Bloody Mary. Not a bad way to start the day so far. Then, things took a turn for the worst. We had to ask our server for water several times- seemed like the guy was overwhelmed; I observed people sitting nearby getting perturbed also. Food took over an hour to get out the kitchen - perhaps they were waiting for the chickens to lay the eggs first?. Long wait aside, I ordered crawfish cakes, with cheese grits and home style potatoes, along with biscuits. Overall, the food was good; I took a chance on the craw fish cakes- nice hint of spicy, not too hot; moist, plenty of meat; just the right portion size, with a decent hollandaise sauce over them. Potatoes were decent, but forgettable. Cheese grits, superb as usual. Not a bad place to go, but wish the service would have been better. Some places have their bad days, so that's what I'm chalking this up as.
