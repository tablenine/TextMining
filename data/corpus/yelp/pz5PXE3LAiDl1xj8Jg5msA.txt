Restaurant: Wurstk√ºche
Category: Hot Dogs
A few things:. . 1) It's pronounced: vurst-koosha. . 2) They don't serve hot dogs, they serve delicious sausages. If you want a hot dog go to Pink's on La Brea and crap your pants afterwards.. . 3) On the subject of Pink's, Wurstkuche also has ridiculous lines - but thankfully Wurstkuche's line isn't comprised of overweight tourists. If you go in the evening over the weekend, expect to wait in line to order your meal for upwards of 30 minutes, then wait another 30 to receive it. Go on a Tuesday if the wait is too much for you... I use my time to drink copious amounts of their large selection of German/Belgian draft beer.. . 4) On a busy night, the place is loud and the seating is primarily on long picnic tables you might find in a German beer hall. So be prepared to saddle up next to strangers and shout over the noise. They have a great DJ who was cool enough to play a track from my band's new album off my iPod.. . Standouts:. . The blue cheese, bacon and walnut dipping sauce. It's supposed to be for your fries, but you should go ahead and dip your sausage in it. .. . The rattlesnake and rabbit wurst.
