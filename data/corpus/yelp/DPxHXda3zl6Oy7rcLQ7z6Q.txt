WoW! This place was terrific, organic and vegan!  I had the TV dinner because I could not resist the thought.  The mashed potatoes were awesome, the meatloaf fantastic and the veggies super tasty.  Topped it off with a fruit cobbler and it was just like a TV dinner.. . Add an organic porter for a filling fulfilling meal.  I wish I lived closer.
