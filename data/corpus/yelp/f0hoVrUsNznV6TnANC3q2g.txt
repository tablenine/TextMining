Restaurant: Hae Woon Dae BBQ
Category: Korean
This was an excellent Korean barbeque experience, my favorite thus far. I came with a large group (10 or so) and had a great time.. . The service was very good, with conversations about the food, preparation, and answering our questions while they prepared it.. . We ordered a few different types of meat--bulgogi, beef, pork--and some seafood pancakes for appetizers (I'm generally not a seafood fan but these were awesome). We also ordered two types of soup, the spicier of which was better (of course). (I forget their names; sorry.). . This was a very representative example of Korean barbeque and a fine one at that; this would be a place I'll take friends for an evening out whether they're familiar with Korean barbeque or not.
