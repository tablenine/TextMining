What a disappointment! We went for Mother's Day and were happy to see they had availability when we waited until the Monday before to make reservations. Reality = ugh. The buffet was boring, boring, boring: white bread or small, dry biscuits (no whole grain choice), cheese, (cheddar, manchego, bleu), salad (overdressed spring mix with radishes), waffles of undetermined seasoning (dry, cold), fried chicken (overcooked and bland), collard green soup (the ONLY vegetable other than the simple salad), eggs Benedict (bland and predictable, overcooked eggs, tough muffins), pork tenderloin, salmon (surprisingly tasteless), bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, and potatoes O'Brien. Â Where were the seasonal choices? It's spring!. . The desserts were saved by the warm toffee puddings, but again, where was the seasonality? They had carrot cake (dry), chocolate cake with a sort of German chocolate filling (cake was dry), banana cake (dry) with meringue, and whole pineapples for presenting skewers of grapes and strawberry quarters. The grapes were sad and split and you'd have to get 2 skewers of fruit to get a whole strawberry. They also had a selection of cookies that no one other than kids touched.. . Service was adequate, not friendly or welcoming but my water glass stayed full. It was really like no one gave a crap--not the chefs, not the staff. We won't be returning. There are too many good restaurants in Atlanta!
