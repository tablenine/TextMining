Lil' Frankies is my go to inexpensive yet scrumptious italian place in the city. I have been here on 4 or more occasions between birthday parties to new years eve. Each of the rooms has a different environment/feel to it. It's nice to hop around a little bit. I have never had a waiter who I didn't like. Great people. . . As far as food goes, the pasta is out of this world...specifically the beet ravioli special. It has been a special every time I was there but supposedly it is not a guarantee. You can't go wrong with most of the pasta dishes though (regular menu items and specials as well). The roasted eggplant side dish is also really simple and delicious. The nutella panini/crepe thing is the best dessert by far! . . The best part about this place is that I usually go (even on new years!) and spend $40 or under. Once I spent more...only because a friend of mine ordered two $45 bottles without my knowledge for our party of 6. But it was only like $60 so it was cool. I can't give this place 5 stars out of principal. It is in my opinion that it is not difficult to create inexpensive italian food. There should be more places like Lil Frankies!
