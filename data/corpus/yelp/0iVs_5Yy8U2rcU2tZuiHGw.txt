Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
Good: Cool retro feel, lots of history, friendly waitresses.. . Bad: Wearing shorts on the plastic booths and feeling very aware of your flabby thighs sticking to the seat.  Looking around and realizing that almost everyone in there is incredibly fat.  Looking down at your sandwich and realizing that you will, be, too.. . The worst part?  It's just not very good.  I want to get fat eating YUMMY stuff.  (Also: it's overpriced.  Walk a few blocks to Don Felix and spend ~$3 on a delicious meal that's less fatty despite the lard they use.)
