Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
This is absolutely NOT a date spot.  You will spray seafood juices everywhere, you will slobber, you will lick your fingers, you will suck crawfish brains, and your fingers and face will smell like garlic and seafood for days.  MESSY MESSY place!. . But since I wasn't there on a date, none of this matters.  you just dive right into it like a barbarian, pawing at the shellfish, cracking and sucking on crab, and gnawing on dripping buttered corn.  Yummy.. . Downsides are the way-too-loud music and the longish wait, and the fact that it's way the hell out in Alhambra!  But hey, go and get a foot massage after, grab a boba, and make a night of it in the 626!
