We showed up pretty early for lunch since we were told that people start lining up at 10:30. Doors open at 11:15. So we got lost and showed up at around 10:45ish. We were the second people there. 11 rolls around and people come flooding through the gates. We stood in line and when the doors open, some group really has the audacity to just walk in right in front of everyone. Gr! So basically there was plenty of room for all the people in line but I would suggest getting here early because a wait forms immediately. . . They are pretty prepared and speedy because right away they ask for drinks, bring out the plates of sashimi and leave it chilling on a counter in preparation of all of those who they know are going to order it. So we ordered the sashimi (pretty typical) and the combination sashimi with teriyaki beef. Both are such a great deal. Large portions and great quality. The sashimi is fresh and the beef is pretty typical teriyaki beef. It was good, not drenched in sauce and not too fatty. For the price this place is good, but I can't say it's the best sashimi I've had. They charge for hot tea also, just an fyi. Overall good experience.
