Restaurant: Wisteria
Category: American (New)
I don't know what to think of Wisteria. Had reservation at 9PM on a Friday. The place was packed, and we were forced to wait quite a while before a table became available. Maybe she was just flustered, but the hostess was unpleasant. We were about to walk-out after the long wait (for a late-ish reservation), when we were finally shown a table. It was noisy! Not the place for a romantic meal as I had hoped. . . Our server was pleasant enough compared to the hostess. We had some nice drinks and a couple of small appetizers. I had the Pork Tenderloin, and she had the Skillet Fried Chicken. Both were good but not great. . . I've certainly had worse restaurant experiences around Atlanta, but I've also had much better. I didn't find any reason to return to Wisteria.
