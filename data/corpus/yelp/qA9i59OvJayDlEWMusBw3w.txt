I didn't think it was possible, but I put myself into a cinnamon roll coma after coming to this place. For the first time in a long time, I decided to not finish my super healthy omlette with veggies so that I could scarf down the rest of the frosting that had solidified on the place. Upon returning home, I also had frosting on my shirt...and I admit...the thought crossed my mind to eat that too. Nothing beats these gooey masterpieces.. . I would say, the only reason to order breakfast here is so that you can get these as your side. I did order breakfast, and with my own omelette concoction of spinach, feta and tomatoes I squeaked with joy when it came to me in this souffle shape as opposed to the regular-ol' flap over. Waitress had forgotten my grapefruit juice, but was kind enough to remember and then give it to us free-of-charge.. . This is not your IKEA Sweden, this is old school sweden and it's inviting, warm and puts you into sugar comas.
