i've always been meaning on trying out this place but finally got the chance to check it out during RW. Â Surprisingly, compared to other RW menus, I thought they gave a decent amount of food.... Got the Sea Bass which was perfectly seasoned, with sashimi which was just average and the chocolate cake which was good.... I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, but wasn't blown away... I would go back again but wouldn't hold my breath or go out of my way for it.... I would recommend this place for RW where you get a good idea of their specialties at a very good price.... nice date place or with a small group of friends
