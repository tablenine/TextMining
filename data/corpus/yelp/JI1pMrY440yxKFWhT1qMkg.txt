Restaurant: Shabu Shabu House Restaurant
Category: Japanese
I've been to quite a lot of shabu shabu restaurants but none of them could ever truly measure up to the ponzu sauce of this place. The ponzu sauce is just so terribly delicious, they sell it to the public in a bottle. If you're too late and they sell out that day, you'd have to wait for more the next day. They don't offer "Sukiyaki" soups or any other flavored soups for that matter. This small establishment also doesn't offer any other types of meat other than their perfectly sliced rib-eye. The one thing I'm not too crazy about is the customer service (rush, rush, rush!) but I don't blame them because there is always a wait to get into this place and the faster we eat, the more customers get in. I'd say the wait lasts for about 20 minutes. So, if you're ever in the Downtown, Los Angeles area and you're craving some meat and veggies dipped in soup and sauce, this is the place to be!
