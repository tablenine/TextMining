LA Mill is an interesting addition to the Silverlake dining scene.  Although I am not a local, I do spend a considerable amount of time in this district when I come to LA to visit family, it does seem a little out of place for this neighborhood - Hollywood Regency meets modern, Mid-century Modern in a hipster enclave. . On the face of it, the prices appear to be rather high for items such as sandwiches and drinks, however, I felt that the quality of the food items warranted the cost.  The service was surprisingly friendly, but only after we were seated and made to wait at the front of the cafe for some time for a table that was already vacant.  Our group dined mostly on sandwiches and while they were all prepared quite nicely, I felt that that presentation was a little much, in terms of the types of serving boards and plates that are used from the meal to the drinks.. . While I am not much of a coffee drinker, the roasts that we tried were delish, so much so that after lunch, we wandered into the shop next door and took home 4 pounds of various blends for ourselves and for local friends, the coffee alone is worthy of 4 stars and incredibly reasonably priced.  It is packed in a not so environmentally friendly tin container, but we were told if we brought the container back for a refill, it would reduce the cost of the coffee by a dollar.
