Awesome subs.   We had the italian, a roast beef and prosciutto with fresh mozzarella.   For $4.50 per, they were a great deal and super yummy.   We also brought home some eggplant salad and medium giardienira.   This place gets really packed on the weekends but they are efficient and very friendly.
