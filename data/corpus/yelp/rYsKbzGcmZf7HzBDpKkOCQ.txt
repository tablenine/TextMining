My husband and I came here late on a Friday night and were happy to be seated right away on the patio. We ordered cocktails and two pizzas and loved every last bite. I kind of wish we would have sat inside at the bar because that bar area looks SOOOO cool and hip-great ambience.. . Overall, we enjoyed ourselves. The grapefruit mojito was awesome (though not very strong for a lush like me), the beer list was expansive, and the pizzas were flavorful and delicious. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and recommended beers and pizzas-we were very happy with his recommendations.. . On the downside, the pizzas weren't very big for the price and the hostess didn't say ONE word to us. She just kind of looked at us like she couldn't understand why we were there. What part of "table for two" don't you understand??? In my opinion, there is absolutely zero excuse for a snobby hostess at a pizza place or any restaurant for that matter. If you're that grumpy, get a different job. . . I am definitely looking forward to going back for more mojitos and maybe a calzone (which someone at a table near me ordered and it looked incredible).. . Oh yeah, and the food is all local and the planters outside are filled with basil and various other herbs. How cool is that?!?
