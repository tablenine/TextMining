Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Day 10 of my Cheap Eats quest.. . Once again, I feel a crucifixion coming on.  I went to Roscoe's for the first time tonight, which is sort of a shocker seeing that it's the LA institution that it is. My first introduction to Roscoe's was shortly after I moved to LA, when my roommates friend told me told me that every time she goes there she ends up spending the rest of the day in the bathroom, "but it's totally worth it".  I couldn't really imagine anything being worth that, but I figured Roscoe's must be something really special.. . After going there I must say, I wasn't that impressed.  I got the Carol C Special, because with a name like Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles you kind of have to get the chicken and waffles. . . The waffle was really nothing special.  The fried chicken breast was good, and definitely satisfying after I'd been dreaming of fried chicken for weeks.  My boyfriend was shocked to see me eat every last morsel of chicken.  Still, it was no better than any other fried chicken I've ever had.
