Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
So for the longest time I've always heard about the infamous Roscoe's Chicken &amp; Waffles. Â So while visiting a friend in LA we decided to come here for dinner. I was a little skeptical at first thinking "oh this place is hella hyped up, it's just gonna be whatever, I'm gonna end up paying $10 for a meal that's just okay" but oh no my friends, was I wrong. To my surprise the food here was unbelievably good. The chicken is cripsy on the outside, moist on the inside. The waffles were flavorful. But when you mix them together it's even better, I mean how can it not be, one delicious item plus another delicious item equals a ridiculously delicious dish. . . The place, however, is kind of small. The service was just all right, the valet guy was totally gross preying on out-of-town girls (really creepy). But above all I'd still come back. I'm actually a little jealous that there's none in the bay because I find myself craving for it. Damn you So-Cal!! I guess I'll just have to wait until my next visit to LA.
