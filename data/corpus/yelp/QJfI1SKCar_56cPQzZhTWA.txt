I've heard rave reviews about this place from friends and family, then I saw it on the Food Network so I finally decided to give it a try.. . I ordered the beef sandwich, double dipped. The first thought that entered my head after my first bite "eh".. . Maybe it was hyped up and I expected a lot. But I rather spend that money on a $5 Subway sandwich...at least there I can get a footlong sandwich.
