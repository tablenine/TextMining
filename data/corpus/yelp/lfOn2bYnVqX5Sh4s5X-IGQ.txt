PLEASE TRY THE ROCK SHRIMP HERE!!!. . It literally tastes like amaebi that was gently deep fried on the outside, the sauce is spectacular!!!!! Their foie gras on top of beef tenders and blue crab hand rolls were delicious as well. The sushi is definitely new agey without that annoying fusion feel. There are tons of dishes served here that you wouldn't find at other japanese sushi restaurants and this place will please both sushi connoisseurs and novices alike. There are many Katsu-Ya's in the LA area but this one by far is the best.. . Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the mozzarella mochi dish. Was a bit too gooey for me
