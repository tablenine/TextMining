Restaurant: Hide Sushi Japanese Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Hide is no frills, quality and affordable sushi in "little Osaka" aka Sawtelle off Olympic.  Honestly one of the best deals I've had for fresh and authentic sushi, when you want a quick and filling sushi dinner or lunch.  . . Parking is behind the restaurant- just validate inside!  Restaurant is CASH ONLY.. . Bright, bustling and authentic, Hide was fun and casual for a great sushi dinner.  Highlights were the yellowtail scallion roll and the tuna and salmon sushi.  Great miso as well, and I can't wait to try more.  . . I always walk down to Bear Papa's or Yogurtland afterward! I love this area!
