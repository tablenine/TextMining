very discreet location.. but it's in the rambutan thai plaza.. . the spring rolls are yum.  It has beef and shrimp in it and the beef tastes like bulgogi (korean beef w sweet marinade).  . . The Pho tai was nothing special.  On the bland side and the flavor just wasn't there.  The beef is real soft and mushy.
