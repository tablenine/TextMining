I guess I was a bit disappointed in this place. it wasn't as authentic as I had hoped for! My Bao's were mostly dough and little filling, plus it's seems like there's something missing, like a rice vinegar sauce or something to dip them in! They were a bit dry. I think they accidentally gave me a coconut Bao instead of the curry and it was my fav!
