Yeah this is on Highland Ave. now, across the street from P'Cheen. Moving was the best thing that ever happened to this place. The space now is just really really cool. And it's pretty big with a patio in the back.. . I guess the pizza is pretty good. You know what they say about pizza being like sex... even if it's bad it's still pretty good. That's what I think about Johnny's. I like it because it's a local spot and I've been eating their pies since my baby days of going there after little league games on weekends to celebrate. . . But this spot ain't yo' momma's Johnny's. The bar aspect gets pretty rowdy after 10 on Wednesdays (at least) when they do a kareoke where talented people haven't been scared away yet.. . So for everyone still crying in their soup about the Jake's being gone... why not go to a familiar location and drown your sorrows in $3 well drinks and tasty shot specials.
