I wasn't surprised to see over 700 reviews on this gem. Hands-down best French Dip.......okay, I'm gonna be honest, it was my FIRST French Dip. Now that the bar has been set so high, I fear having any other French Dip sandwich because I will surely be disappointed. Then the coleslaw was freakin' awesome. Not sure what made it so special but I couldn't get enough.  As if we hadn't eaten enough already, we had to end our meal with the banana cream pie. PEOPLE!!! This pie is one of a kind. It's in a class all by itself.  Sure, banana cream pie also happens to be the best pie in the WORLD, but this one really rocked my world. By the time all was said, ate, and done, you almost had to roll me out of there.
