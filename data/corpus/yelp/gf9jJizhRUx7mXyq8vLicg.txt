Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
It's my first day in Chicago, I'm super hungry, and I've been craving pizza for weeks. Couple that with the fact that deep dish is my favorite kind of pizza, and you've got the most excellent welcoming ever. Aside from the 45 minute wait, this place is perfect welcoming ever. But they were so nice about the wait too, that I really didn't mind. . . So thank you Lou's for being a great representative of Chicago Pizza =). Thank you. really.
