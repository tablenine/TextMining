Great bakery. I go there sometimes for lunch. I like their potato balls. There sandwiches(especially pulled pork) are pretty good. When i want a light lunch i get their Chicken Cesar Salad and whole wheat bread, it is very very good. I also ordered birthday cakes from them. Parisian chocolate is superb.. There is one problem with it, the service is kinda slow so it takes a while to get the food.
