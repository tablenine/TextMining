I really enjoy going here.  My sister and I would hit the bar and have a great time.  The bartenders would make terrific drinks and after sparking conversations with them - would give us their made-up concoctions on the house!  We always have a blast!  Try the Piscorita - pretty refreshing.  The food isn't too shabby either.  I've had the goat cheese fritters- i just love anything goat cheese, peruvian ceviche - pretty good.  My sister had the Argentine Gaucho Steak and she loved it.  I on the other hand had the seasonal fish with tamarind glaze and was not too thrilled, but I won't knock them for that because the ambiance is great.  All in all, I've had some fantastic times here with my sister and that pretty much is priceless - CORNY or what?!  : )
