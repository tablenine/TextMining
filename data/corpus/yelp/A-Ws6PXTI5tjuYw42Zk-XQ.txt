Restaurant: Savoy Kitchen
Category: Chinese
Savoy is a very small restaurant which makes it difficult for me to stop by to try their food. There's usually a wait, lack of parking spaces or seatings. . . I ordered the hainan chicken and chrysanthemum tea. Both were incredibly delicious. The hainan chicken dish is $6.95! Large portion for the price. The tea was great, but non-refillable for $2. The rice was flavored and the sauces it came with were excellent. By far, the best hainan chicken I've ever had.. . CASH ONLY
