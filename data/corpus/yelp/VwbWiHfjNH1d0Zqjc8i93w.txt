Restaurant: Kevin Rathbun Steak
Category: Steakhouses
Possibly the best steak I have ever eaten without a sauce (lol).  We were at a table of 6, we tried three appetizers including the ahi tuna poke which was good and I don't normally eat that stuff, 6 of the sides and 3 of the desserts and lots of wine.  I like the ambiance of the restaurant, the service was fantastic.  Valet Parking was a bit slow getting our cars.  But hey, we were happy, buzzed and full so who cares?
