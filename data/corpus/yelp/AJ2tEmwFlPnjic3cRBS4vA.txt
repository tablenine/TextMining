Great food.. . Slightly more expensive than I expected based on the press.. . Embarrassing Interior Decoration.  You guys do know that you are solidly in Bucktown, right?  It says Humboldt Park on the wall, but there is no way.  It also says other embarrassing platitudes.  I mean, I think we can all agree "more bike lanes" but why is it on your restaurant wall?  It's so phony.  But the phoniest, most annoying thing is the menu design.  "U kud lik dis" is a heading.. . I wasn't sure if it should get 3 or 4 stars, but for me, the food is the most important part, and it's such an improvement over Vella that I edged it up.
