Restaurant: The Original El Taco
Category: Mexican
Dear El Taco,. . I love you.. . With your delicious &amp; dangerous fro-mos, and your tantalizing &amp; tasty tacos...you put me in a comatose, and I love every minute of it. And the fact that I always win a shot of tequila or cheese dip with your intriguing spinning wheel never hurts either ;-). . However, please bring back the chicken taco from the beginning...I do miss it, though the new rendition is quite fabulous. Maybe have both? One can never have enough chicken-ey goodness.. . That is all for now. I'll dream of your chorizo till next time. Gracias.. . Love,. Courtney
