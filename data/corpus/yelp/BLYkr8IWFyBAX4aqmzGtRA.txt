Yelpers, you lie to me!  This is a 2.5 rating, tops.. . $40 here will feed three people.  That's pretty pricey for diner food, so I would expect the food to be really a notch above in taste and quality.  Sadly, that's just not the case.. . While I was ordering, I got really excited when they asked how I wanted my burger done (medium rare--with gruyere!).  My little brother ordered the same with American cheese.  A couple complaints--1) the burgers were WELL DONE, 2) my brother had asked them to hold the lettuce and tomatoes (they did not), 3) both my brother and my burgers were falling apart--literally--the patties didn't hold together! 4) the reuben sandwich my older brother ordered was *disgustingly* salty.  Like, dipped in sea brine salty--like, almost not edible.  Oh, and 5) I didn't like their garlic aioli!!  And I love my aioli :(. . The sad excuse for a reuben and overcooked patties aside, this is decent food with decent ingredients.  But looking at the menu and the price list, you think you're getting gourmet and this is seriously standard.  If I wanted my burger well done I'd have gone to a cheap burger joint!  . . So a couple recommendations : if you're banking on tasty, go to Father's Office.  If you're looking for a fifties diner, try Mel's.  And if you're looking for delicious and cheap, go to In n' Out or Yuca's in Los Feliz.. . If you do head over to Oinkster after reading all this, get their Taro milkshake.  And fries.  No complaints there-- both are delicious.  And maybe if you're looking for medium rare, say rare?  My best guess.
