I am torn about Birds. Actually I would give this place a 3.5. . . Don't get me wrong, I liked my dining experience here. It sits in a very cute area neighboring a bookstore, some other restaurants, and shops. . . The food was very enjoyable and I loved their menu options when it came to dipping sauces, sides, etc. . . It was a bit too noisy for my liking, as I generally walk the other way when it comes to crowded sports bars. The interior was nicely decorated. Parking may be a bit tough. You are limited to shelling out the money for valet, or just searching around for residential street parking. Either way, I would come back to Birds again.
