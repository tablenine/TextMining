Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Hello all,  I came to try the Supposed best fish Taco; but I was disappointed. They are good- Believe me I am a picky fish and shrimp taco eater. They have great infused salsas; but they are not as authentic. Don't get me wrong they are good and it would be my second choice when Ricky's Fish Tacos is not open.  Hands down Ricky's Fish Tacos is the best and his Salsas too.
