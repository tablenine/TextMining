I have absolutely NO PATIENCE when it comes to waiting in line for 30 minutes to get into a breakfast joint, however, I've done it here, and I'll do it again for PEANUT BUBBA!! That's the crack version of French Toast, dammmmmmmm good. So good in fact that I'm so glad I live in Burbank and this place is a bit of a schlepp for me so I don't go too often. If it was around the corner I'd be 10 sizes bigger than the size 10 I already am. It's loud, it's full of L.A./Hollywood trendoids, and there's usually always a wait. Whatever,  just DO IT. And don't expect to make any big plans for the rest of the day after eating here unless it involves a couch and a remote. Digestive Z-ZZZ--ZZZ's and that's even with lots of their amazing french press coffee. GUT BOMB-o-RAMA!
