My meal : bacon-wrapped dates, tilapia, and bananas foster bread pudding. Each item was delicious, and the tilapia was darn near perfection. Cleaned my plate. Friends and family I've taken here have also had the lamb burgers and specials and always rave. Excellent service as well. BYOB - get wine down the street at Kafka!
