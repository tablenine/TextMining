Good food. High prices. . Rich old white men. That all I gotta say. Kind of sleezy on weekends, you can go to the upstairs bar and find lets call them 'promiscuous women' waiting to get free drinks and taken home. When you see that I guess it brings a certain kind of vibe.. . Great steak tho, but I prefer Mortons.
