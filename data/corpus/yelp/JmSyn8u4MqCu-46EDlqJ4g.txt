Restaurant: Griddle Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Griddle Cafe is a good place to get your morning food.. . I came here right when it opened at 7:00AM on a weekday.. The portions are very large. I don't think I finished my omelet.. . Don't remember exactly what I ordered but I remember that it was good. I'm sure most other things on the menu are good. How can you go wrong with breakfast food?. . They have a few flat screens in the place for your entertainment. They have an authentic oval shaped table/bar to eat at. Pretty neat to eat at it to get that hole-in-the-wall cafe feeling.. . Check this place out if you're in LA!
