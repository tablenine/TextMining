I always enjoyed coming here when I worked in Pasadena...especially if it was paid for by work!  I am a big beer fan, so being able to have something new everytime is fun for me. . . I really enjoy their happy hour, their prices are pretty decent, and their appetizers are tasty.  For the most part the service is pretty good, too.. . The best time to come here is when a major sporting event is happening.  They have flat screens all over the place, and the environment is usually really exciting.  I loved watching world series games here.
