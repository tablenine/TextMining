I really, really like this place and I hope it's busy at lunch.  I've been for dinner a few times and it's always pretty slow.. . That can be a plus because the staff is super sweet and talkative without getting in your business.. . I went for the Tuesday night Steak Frites special (you have to go to the website to see the web specials--they also have daily specials on the menu when you arrive).  This was one of the most flavorful steaks I have ever had.  Truly--it was better than Bone's, Morton's and it was only $15!  (including a glass of wine!) As far as a price comparison goes, it's about the same price as the steak &amp; potatoes special at Bookhouse Pub, but you have to order their special before 7pm! . . My boyfriend grew up in Destin, so he is truly a seafood snob.  He rarely orders it in Atlanta because he says it's never good.  But, he always gets the scallop special here.  It comes on a bed of lemon risotto and damn that stuff is delish!. . Please go to Social--don't let it go out of business--it's tucked away on the back side of the building that French American Brasserie is in, but it is truly worth the extra 30 steps to find it!
