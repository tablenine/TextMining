The hubs &amp; I went to The Grange for brunch last Sunday &amp; fell in love. Seriously. I have a thing against waiting in line for brunch. I would have a rage blackout if I was forced in line at the Biscuit. . . We seated ourselves immediately &amp; the server strapped the coffee bucket to my face within 5 flat. Heavenly.. . We ate the delightful &amp; mammoth full Irish breakfast. It's breakfast at around 10 bucks, but most of the items are specialty items-- rashers, pudding, etc. &amp; it's huge, so it's not over-priced at all.. . I love black &amp; white pudding. I also love that its named black or white "pudding" cause if it were called what it actually is-- pig blood or pig fat sausage, I may never have tried it. If you eat meat &amp; like sausage, get it. . . The service was great &amp; the changes they've made to the joint since it was The Angel are fantastic. . . We'll be going for dinner. Soon.
