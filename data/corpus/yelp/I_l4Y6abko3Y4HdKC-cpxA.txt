Restaurant: Toro Sushi

My love affair with sushi started in Bloomington, IN, as a freshman at IU.  From that point on, I have been on a crusade to find the holy grail of sushi rolls.  My quest has made stops across the Midwest (where it all began), East Coast (NYC and Jersey), and Europe (Seville, Spain).  That said, I am by no means a sushi expert or snob; I simply like the stuff.  I celebrate most big events with some sushi and sake.   . . When looking for a sushi joint too break in my 27th year, a friend recommended Toro.  To cut to the chase, I have to say, Toro's rolls were amongst the best I've ever consumed.  You must try the "O.". . The atmosphere is perfect: no frills decor and tight seating.  A genuine mom-and-pop feel.  No bells and whistles, the emphasis is on the food. The only drawback is the limited seating.  I went on a Tuesday at 6:30pm and waited until after 8:00pm for a 4-top table.  Go expecting at least an hour and half wait.  Also, you will be seated much faster if you are rolling two or less.  Enjoy.
