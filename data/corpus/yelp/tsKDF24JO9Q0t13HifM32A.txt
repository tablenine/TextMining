3.5 stars is the most I can give this place. . I find it hard to give this place a 4th star, the food was good and had pretty large portions, however it's about the taste. This tasted like most breakfast places I've been to. Not saying it's bad, just not worth all the hype that made us wait there for 45 minutes! If it was a shorter wait, maybe I would've thought/tasted differently, but standing outside inhaling car exhaust and other people's cigarette smoke while slowly dying from hunger made me expect great things! All I tasted was huge pancakes, eggs, sausage, etc. As I was reading the menu I saw the somewhat pricey food and thought it must be REALLY good because of the price, but nope, they justify the price by giving you large portions! so you are definitely not getting ripped off.. . A few members from my party had grilled sandwiches (lunch stuff, I think it was a chicken avocado or something) and that was freaken DELICIOUS! Make sure you try one of those if you want more than just generic omelets! Pancakes were good, many options to choose from, maybe the ones we got just wasn't spectacular, but flopping whipped cream and powder sugar on a pancake doesn't make it that much more special. French toast was much better than pancakes.
