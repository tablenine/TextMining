This place is awful. It's the type of place you eat at hung over after jr.partying yourself to death at like 10, 11 o'clock at night. I swear after I had one bite I said to my friends "God damn, I need a drink because this food is so bad!". . They are cash only. If you waste your money here I promise you'll be wishing you would have used that cash to tip a bartender for making you the hardest drink of your life to get rid of the bad after taste.. . I had multiple chicken bones in my burrito that were about as fine as fish bones. It was just gross. If you really REALLY want mexican food, La Pasadita is even better than this place. Just don't do it. You should thank me for warning you.
