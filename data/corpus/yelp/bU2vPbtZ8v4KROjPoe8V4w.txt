Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
Super shiteous valet wait on a Wednesday night at 6:45. However, that was the only bad thing about my experience at Pizzeria Mozza. I didn't have reservations but there was room at the bar so my boyfriend and I sat, were greeted, served water and beer (for the bf), and ordered. We had the chopped salad (very good!), fennel sausage pizza (delish!!), and finished it all off with 3 scoops of gelato (pistachio, espresso, and mint and chip, all super tasty and not too sweet). The total with tip was 58 bucks! not bad at all and very satisfied in the belly area. Valet was 10 bucks + tip.
