Maybe it was an "off day."  It started so well too.  We were waiting in the long line that extended from inside the restaurant to the outside sidewalk and the waiter kept bringing us appetizers while we waited! Yummy! cookies, orange slices, cinnamon french toast... (!?)  What an incredibly awesome thing to do.  Shouldn't EVERY restaurant do this??. But it was down hill from there.  Tried an egg cream for the first time. Are they supposed to be room temperature? YECH.  Eggs benedict had two slices of Hormel ham.  One of the eggs was over cooked and hard boiled while the potatoes were undercooked.  The pancakes were good, and the fruit butter was tasty. But all in all - disappointing. The bill was nice though. 30 bucks.
