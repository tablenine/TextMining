The best carne asada EVER...yummy chili dogs...the menu is small but it's all good. Â This place is basically a tiny shack in a parking lot and while there are some benches and tables, it's usually a place to get food that you take and go or eat in your car. . . The only negatives to this place are that they don't take cards and they are open only during the day so it's hit or miss if i'll make it before it closes.
