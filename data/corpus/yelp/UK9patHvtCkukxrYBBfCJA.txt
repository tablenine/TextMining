A good spot to gather with a small, intimate group of 4-6.  Their small plates are good, but maybe a little skimpy, depending on how many people you have, I suppose.  Every time we get the hummus, we always have to ask for more bread.  Maybe we are just oinkers!  . . Nice atmosphere in a small space.  The food and overall quality is good, but I am driven to go there more so for the atmosphere than the food.
