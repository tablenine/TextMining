Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
The name didn't really draw me in but my friend couldn't stop talking about this great tapas place so we finally got together, brought our wine, and went to dinner here.. . The place is pretty small but looks comfy.  The walls are lined with corks from wine bottles, pretty neat.  It is a BYOB with no corkage fee, which is awesome.  There is a wine shop next door  that is owned by Cobras so you can buy your drinks there and just bring it in the restaurant.. . I want to eat NOW:. albondigas (9),  . skirt steak (19), . goat cheese w/ warm grapes (7). eggplant mixture with sliced bread (6). flan. (FAVORITE) asparagus w. machengo cheese (9). bacon wrapped prawns (16). . I would want to come back just to try the other things on their menu because there is a pretty big selection to chose from.  Like i said earlier, the food is solid but the prices are kinda high but i could say the same about many other places too.  At least this place is a little more unique.
