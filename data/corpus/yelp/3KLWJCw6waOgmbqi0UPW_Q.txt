Started with a glass of champage (1 star).  For an appetizer I had the Escargots (1 star), they were very garlicky with loads of parsley. Great to share, I was almost full by the time my main entree arrived.  Didn't see the burger! (Minus 1 star) So, I ordered the Steak Frittes.  Not so thrilled.  The fries were double fried which made them seem old.  The piece of meat of was HUGE, should have shared again.  Nice service (1 star) and lots of cute gay boys.  Will go back and give it another chance.  Not sure about the platic chairs, hum?
