Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
The general manager contacted me through Yelp, apologized for my shitty experience at his restaurant, and offered me a gift card.  I thought wow, that's pretty cool.  I could use the GC at one of their other locations.  So I replied to his email and gave him my address.  Three months later and I have yet to see that GC.  NICE!!!  Once again, Mastro's has disappointed me.
