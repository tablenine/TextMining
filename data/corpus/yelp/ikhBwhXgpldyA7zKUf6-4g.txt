I'm not really sure you can really call this sushi. It's more like someone's take on sushi. Nothing I had resembled or tasted like sushi I've had anywhere else. And I don't mean this in a good way.. . I ordered a crunchy spicy tuna roll, and was served a ball of rice that had been coated in flour and deep fried, and then topped with pureed tuna paste. It was gross - and greasy I might add. I ordered about 5 rolls (I can't remember all the names) and I could literally not find an identifiable piece of fresh fish in ANY of them. Everything had a fish paste in place of actual fresh fish. Â . . The plus side is the happy hour menu. Ra offers a wide variety of sushi and appetizers at a great price during the happy hour. You can also get beers and mixed drinks for about $4-5. . . SO...if you're a serious sushi lover...RUN. BUT, if you the kind of sushi "lover" that only orders California rolls...this is the place for you. It's also not a bad place to drop in after work and have a few drinks...maybe if you get a little tipsy you'll actually think you're eating real sushi.
