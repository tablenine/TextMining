My Sunday evening visit a few weeks back was super cozy.  Exactly what you want out of a Sunday evening.  . . Lots of desserts to choose from.  Our selections were ok, but honestly, being a home baker I am pretty particular.  I think most would be happy with the big selection.  Coffees were good.  . . But I think what makes this place is its coziness and charm.  Our visit included a totally free and entertaining little violin concert at the table next to us.  Just completely by chance, there was a small 90th birthday going on.  How sweet.  Servers enjoyed it too, but didn't seem surprised by it.  . . Almost like this kind of stuff happens alot at Selmarie.
