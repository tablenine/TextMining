I wanted to like this place. I really did. It's in a great neighborhood, the waitress was friendly and very helpful, and the service was good. The food, on the other hand, was abysmal.. . I had the Journeyman's Steak, medium-well, which is how I always get my steaks. It came out hard and bloody. It was like eating into a car tire. I spent half the time struggling to cut into the steak with my knife and the other half trying to chew it. Not fun at all. I was here on a date and couldn't unwind because I was, for one, worried that I looked like a cow grazing on grass. That's how tough this steak was.. . The fries that came with the steak were the only highlight of the meal. I asked the waitress for mustard and received the most delicious dijon mustard I have ever had. At that point, I gave up on the steak and just ate fries. The fries were very good, which is why this place is getting 2 stars instead of one. At least something was edible.. . I might go back for their fries with their amazing mustard, but as for a meal? Nope.
