Yeah the wait is ridiculous. Expect to wait at least 1.5 hours during peak hours, which is almost all the time. And a much longer wait if you have a big party. And they won't seat you until everyone in your party is there. But once you get seated and order your food, the food comes pretty quickly. . . I'm from New Orleans and so I love seafood. So finding this place was like hitting the jackpot since I only visit N.O. once a year! The seasoning at BC is the best compared to any other place I've been to in Los Angeles. Â I get either the Whole Sha-bang or Rajun Cajun seasoning with Medium spiciness. That's just a little spicy. The seasoning could get soaked into the little creatures better, but I can't complain cuz i don't know how to do it either. We usually get the Dungeness crab or crawfish and fries. mmm. *drool. And if I want to spoil myself, I get oysters too. . . The servers are pretty nice and attentive too. But once you're done eating they want you to get out quick to get another party in. . . There's a very small parking lot. Fits about 6 cars. I can usually find street parking within a block. . . They would get five stars if they would just expand.
