Restaurant: Taco Cabana
Category: Tex-Mex
I ordered tacos. My friend ordered something else. We ate here last week and I can't remember a thing about the place except for the salsa bar- literally a buffet of cilantro, limes, and salsas. I believe the salsa buffet bar was the best thing about the place. I say I'd never go again but reading other reviews has revealed Taco Cabana is open 24-hours...
