NOTE:  New hours posted!  . . Mon-Fri: 11am-3pm, 5pm-9:30pm. Sat: 10am-9:30pm (yes, that's all day folks!). Sun: 10am-9pm (woo again!). . Din Tai Fung always delivers, but based on this single dining experience I'd have to add the 5th star.  Service staff was on top of things and friendly, it wasn't too crowded, we (Craig H and I) were seated within 2 minutes (giving us a chance to decide what we want on the order form).. . Tonight we had:. - 2 orders of juice pork dumplings... fantastic as ever.. - Fried noodle with chicken... first time I've had it, and it was great.  Great texture and flavor.. - Pork bun... for some reason I thought it was going to be BBQ pork, but this was just as good, using the same pork filling as the juicy pork dumplings, so all the juices get absorbed into the bun itself.. - Sauteed green beans... yum! wok'ed with garlic,salt, and pepper... perfectly cooked and not limp.. . I did have to ask for condiments (our table had none), but they came out immediate, so no-fault there.  I want more... they need to be open 24/7.
