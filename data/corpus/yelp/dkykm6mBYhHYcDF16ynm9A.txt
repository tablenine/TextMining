This place has the worst service ever with the rudest servers! The nerdy skinny white guy with glasses and brown hair would not seat us because our friend was parking his car.  Okay, I understand this if the place is packed and there are other people waiting for tables.  However, it was not.  There were also two other tables of two sitting at a four-top.  When my husband asked the guy why they were allowed to be seated and we weren't, he said, 'It just matters.  That's why.'  What a loser.  I've heard several other similar stories of the same kind of treatment.  Left and went elsewhere where we were treated in a welcoming manner - ya know, the way most restaurants should treat you when you walk in and you're gonna spend money there.  Seriously, it's just a burger.   Get a grip.
