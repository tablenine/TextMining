Restaurant: Daikokuya
Category: Japanese
Daikokuya is one of my all time ramen favorites in the US. Their kotteri ramen is so amazingly fatty and flavorful. One of the best ramen broths that you will ever be able to enjoy in the US. The noodles are cooked to perfection and everything that comes in the ramen is just delicious. Aside from the ramen, I've tried a variety of dishes and all were really good. Sometimes ramen joints only focus on their ramen, understandably. But Daikokuya took the time and effort to make sure their non-ramen options are just as tasty. . . ~ Sliced Roast Pork: this is melt in your mouth goodness. ~ Gyoza - Made in house and you can tell. The ingredients are mixed perfectly for a yummy bite every time. ~ Sausage - kurobuta sausage served with a side of spicy mustard. These little bad boys are juicy and have a nice, crispy skin. ~ Chicken teriyaki - pretty standard but the teriyaki sauce is awesome. . There is always a line, so be prepared to wait. There's a cool little Japanese gift, anime, toy store next door to kill some time and get out of the heat. And don't forget about Fugetsu-Do down the street!!
