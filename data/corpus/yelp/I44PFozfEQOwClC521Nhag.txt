If one needed an example of the over-commercialization and packaging of 'indie-ness,' one need not look further than Fred '62 in (as one Griffith Park Fire television reporter described as) "tony" Los Feliz.  As an admitted 'yindie,' I do not mind paying $13.62 for nachos, but I'm fortunate enough to afford such tortillian luxuries.  For the true indie set, those who have shunned selling out to 50-hour work weeks in the financial district, I cannot recommend Fred's without feeling a bit hypocritical.. On a more culinary note, Fred's delivers what any 'high end' diner should: great food, interesting menu choices, and a hip atmosphere.  I've been diner-ing here for the past few years, and I enjoy Fred 62's contribution to the North Vermont lunch counter scene.
