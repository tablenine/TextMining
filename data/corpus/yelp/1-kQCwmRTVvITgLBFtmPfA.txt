Wurstkuche is a shining beacon for those who love meat on a bun, fries, relatively obscure beer, and great design.  Add to that a fine soundtrack and a young, diverse clientele, and the model may start to sound familiar.. . The similarities between Wurstkuche and its burger-based doppelganger on the Westside all but end there; the entrepreneurs behind this beer house deserve credit for blazing a trail at a time when a "me too" approach would have been safer and easier.. . Although I'd prefer house-made sausage, the team at Wurskuche has done a nice job of sourcing their tube meats.  I tried four: the Austin Blues, Bratwurst, Duck and Bacon, and Rattlesnake and Rabbit.  All were excellent, with attention clearly paid to grind, casing, and seasoning.  With sausage this good, you don't need toppings or mustard.. . Unfortunately, I can't say as much for the fries, although I may have been there on an evening when the fry-oil temperature was off.  They bordered on soggy, and were served lukewarm.  . . My only other complaint is the butcher paper on the communal tables.  It's better in theory than it is in practice.  Sitting down to a grease-stained mess is kind of a turnoff in a room that's so impeccably designed.  . . Overall, these are minor flaws and I'm sure this welcome addition to the local landscape will quickly become an institution.  Judging by the number of reviews on yelp, it looks like it's already there.
