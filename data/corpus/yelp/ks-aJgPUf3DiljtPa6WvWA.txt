Restaurant: The Cheesecake Factory
Category: Desserts
I wouldn't ever go here normally but once my ex's parents were in town doing the touristy thing and they took us out to eat here.  I don't remember much about the food except that the portions are ridiculously huge!  How are you supposed to have any cheesecake if you can't even make it through half your entree?  I just don't understand.
