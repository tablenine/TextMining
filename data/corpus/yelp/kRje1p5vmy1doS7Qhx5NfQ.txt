Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Titos is one of my favorite places, so much so, that I travel the 33 miles from my house once a week to have their tacos! My husband loves their burritos and always asks for a bean and cheese burrito with meat sauce! it you want something more hearty then just ask for it with meat! For me the tacos are the best because the combination of the tacos, chips and salsa is the greatest and will always keep me coming back for more! everyone I know that lives around titos tacos loves it as much as I do! What is in a Tito's taco? shredded beef, lettuce, cheese (extra), in a hard tortilla shell...Now smother the taco with the salsa and that is the best! Oh one more thing titos always has a line so regardless of what other people might say about it they always have lots of people there!
