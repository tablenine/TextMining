First time I went here I wasn't very fond of the soup broth. Second time I went here I added the garlic paste and it was one of my favorite meals in LA ever. The garlic complimented the pork perfectly. I got the pork ramen and eel combo. The eel is very delicious. The wait was around thirty minutes but it was worth it. This a great nighttime place. We were last call at 12:50.
