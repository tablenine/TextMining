Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Caveat: Not a place for a first date, unless your savage side is particularly charming. . The Good: . shrimp (fat and succulent!). fried catfish (surprisingly tender). oysters on the half shell (raw, fresh, deelicious!) . crawfish (it's the only seafood that absorbs all the flavor, but you gotta work for the meat) . corn (sweet and juicyy). . The Bad: . super dirty, but that can be fun . the seafood doesn't absorb the oily sauces very well, double dipping is a guarantee. the dungeoness crab. waste of money. just don't do it.. . My fingers smelled so yummy after dinner!
