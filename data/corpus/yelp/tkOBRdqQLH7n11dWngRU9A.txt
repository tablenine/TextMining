Category: Specialty Food
I like this place for lunch. Their sandwiches are lovely (the tarragon chicken salad is a personal favorite, my friend Laura loves the ham and brie, and I have a coworker who is addicted to the meatloaf) and the salad case is mouthwatering (I'll often do the salad trio - three salads of your choice, don't miss the snap pea and asparagus with tarragon shallot dressing!). The housemade pickles are utterly divine.  Good selection of fun fizzy drinks.  I know I'm going to get shot for this, but skip the cupcakes, they're not that good; what they DO have that is AMAZING is a hazelnut meringue/apricot cream torte that is AWESOME and totally worth the $7 a slice (I have a recipe for it, from the out-of-print San Franciso Dinner Party Cookbook, which is where their recipe is from, so I know how to make it, I just can't even think about eating a whole one!). We often order from them at the office when we need lunches catered in, and they don't disappoint.. . The cons: Yes, parking is a pain in the $@%!. Trying to find a place to sit is a disaster, which is a giant turnoff; if I'm going to spend that much on food, I better be able to sit down. And the clientele here are a total turnoff; a cadre of hipper-than-thou Hollywood types who can't be neighborly to save their lives. Ick. So if you go here, be prepared to be really turned off by the people sitting near you. Seriously, I never experience that kind of quintessential LA social-leprosy-unless-you're-famous as I do here. I tend to not patronize the kind of joints that appeal to that kind of people so I guess I'm a spoiled brat or something. . . That said, the food is worth it for a nice, tasty lunch, if you're feeling patient and not in a hurry.
