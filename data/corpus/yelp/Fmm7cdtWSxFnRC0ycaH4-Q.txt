Toast is definitely a breakfast scene on Sunday mornings.  I went with a few girlfriends and thoroughly enjoyed my mocha with its heart-shaped design in the foam and two accompanying mini chocolate chip cookies.. . Also, as much as I love the breakfast potatoes, opt for the fruit.  You get strawberries, blackberries, mangos....not your run of the mill cantelope, honeydew and grape concotion circa 1970 cafeteria style.  My Denver scramble and toast were great.  Just don't skip on the awesome blackberry jam.. . And for the guys, I can't help but mention there were several beautiful girls there.  Wow, stunners.  Some good genetics.  I'm taking my little brother there next time because he needs a girlfriend.
