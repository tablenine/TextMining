PORTOS BAKERY was AMAZING! I came here twice in one day! lol. . Tried the cheese rolls, guava cheese roll, the potato balls, feta cheese bread thing, some other pastries, red velevet cupcake, and the CHICKEN CROQUETTE!! that croquette was amazing! must try! Â . . Basically, anything in this store is DELISH and CHEAP! So grab a box and fill it up with yummy pastries!. . nothing in here will disappoint.
