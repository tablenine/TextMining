Had a nice lunch there one Sunday afternoon.  We arrived there at around noon to no line (surprise surprise!) but the place was already busy after having been open for an hour.   I had the steak sandwich with just the basic salad that had various types of marinated tomato.  My boyfriend had the ahi tuna hot plate with a caesar salad.  I was super impressed with their ahi (I had to steal just a bite).  I wasn't disappointed in my sandwich, but I should try their salads (as it is what they are known for) the next time I go there.   Great service, yummy lemonade, the side salad I had was just too good, definitely will go there again and again.
