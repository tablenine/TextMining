went for dinner last nite. been to the garden grove location twice and this is my first to this one. not too bad of a wait on thur compared to the weekend nightmares of waiting in agony. we had 8 lbs of king crab (overload on the ordering), 4 lbs of shrimp, corn, sausages and fries. all with the whole shebang sauce. king crab is awesome b/c you get the big chunks of meat with li'l hassle compared to the dungeness crab and the crawfish. best bang for your buck is the shrimp. fries are awesome and corn is amazing with it being coated in sauce in the bag. my hands were oozing with sauce and starting to coagulate by the end of the meal. plus i had some flying particles from people cracking the crab so it was not a pretty sight. bill came to like $230 and could feed 6 hungry fellas and leave you with the feeling of wanting to upchuck due to the excessive sodium and seafood. but coming every once in awhile is quite nice. hit up BC during weekdays and avoid the weekends. parking on the street at the valley spot ain't too bad either.
