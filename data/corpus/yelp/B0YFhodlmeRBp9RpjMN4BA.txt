Mainly due to Man Vs Food but Â I don't know how many times I've walked down Little Tokyo and someone who clearly has never been here ask where that place with the spicy noodle bowl from TV is. . . Well, I point the way and yes, explain that it will be hot and you will typically see some moron try to eat the hottest bowl they saw on travel channel.. it's just a given. But that's no reason why you can't sit back, relax and enjoy the show of someone making a fool of themselves. . . While I can hold my own with spicy food, I really don't want to sit in pain here. I have a buddy who went with some friends and the guy who took the challenge was in pain for a good two hours after trying it. . . Don't be like that. Just come in here, regardless of their hottest bowls, their not-so-stomach-killing ones are really good. And yes, the line out the door may be due to those trying to show how much of a man they are by chowing down hot stuff. . . Plow through it and enjoy some good roman. tongue destroying or not.
