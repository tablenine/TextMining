Restaurant: Gato Bizco Caf√©
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Every time I go into Gato Bizco for weekend brunch, I marvel at the herds waiting to get into Flying Biscuit across the street. Gato Bizco offers superior food, service, and ambiance. Hell's bells, the biscuits are even far and away better.. . The diner style set-up with an open range and counter seating give the feeling of being in someone's comfy kitchen. Hanging Golden Pothos curtain the front windows to dapple the morning sun trying to break in. And there's always room for one more friend to squeeze into the squishy booths. . . And, oh my, am I waxing purple with this review, so Gato Bizco must be really good, right?
