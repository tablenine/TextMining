Ugh. I'm surprised this place has such a high rating right now. . . I used to eat here quite a bit (mainly because it's the closest restaurant to where I worked). It's expensive for what you get - you pay quite a bit of change for a huge plate of bland, sub par food.. . I've tried quite a few of their menu items - their pancakes are dry and spongy, their cakes are dry as well. I got fed up with the lack of quality in the food and the fact that my carryout order was almost always screwed up. The only thing I ended up eating there near the end of my 11 City stint was the cheese fries. Now, the cheese is good. However, they always managed to (somehow) screw up the fries. Cold. Burned. When I came to the realization that this place had issues cooking fries, Â I stopped eating here. . . The wait-staff is rude (on the phone, at least) and the owner is kind of a douche. He's pretty abusive to his staff and he won't hesitate to publicly humiliate them in front of customers.. . There's so many other places in the South Loop to eat. Go to Bongo Room, Yolk or Ma &amp; I and get tastier food at a better price.
