We received a gift certificate to Opera and decided to celebrate our 1st Anniversary here.  We'd only been once before, a few years ago, for New Year's Eve (which the staff wore costumes of favorite opera characters....sort of bizarre).  Anyway, they have a nice, small, but varied menu, including a section of entirely vegan options.  Lovely food presentation, nice atmosphere, and kitchy art work.  The only thing that left a little to be desired was their orange dreamsicle martini and the orange beef was a little more fried than flavorful (apparently, I was in an orange mood).   Everything else was great though and the raspberry sorbet was fantastic.
