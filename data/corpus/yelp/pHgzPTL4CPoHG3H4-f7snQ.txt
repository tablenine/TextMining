Restaurant: Bossa Nova Brazilian Cuisine
Category: Brazilian
We entered Bossa Nova with high hopes from previous visits.. . I ordered a beer, which was described by the waitress as an "amber". Out came a Fischer Amber, a French beer served in a large bottle. Had I known those details, I would have ordered something else. Also, it was served almost lukewarm. . . We started off with a salad; mixed greens, candied apples, walnuts, blue cheese dressing. It was fresh but otherwise uninspired. We did ask for the dressing on the side, but I have a hard time imagining how much better it would be if THEY poured the dressing on top. . . We ordered a custom pizza "well done". When it first arrived, it was not close to well done. After taking it back and cooking it for a while (took about 15 minutes), it returned, and was still not well done. We resigned to eating it at this point, since we were still pretty hungry, and probably pushing our luck with the cooks. It tasted very good, but the little details took away from the experience.. . We asked for a side of marinara for the pizza. When the bill came, they charged $3.29 for a pathetic little cup of bland sauce. Yikes!. . The service was just mediocre. The waitress was pleasant, but just not very good.. . All in all, there are too many better restaurants in L.A. to warrant a second visit.
