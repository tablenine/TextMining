Restaurant: Zocalo Mexican Restaurant
Category: Mexican
I finally stuffed my face at Zocalo, after living in the neighborhood for almost 3 years. Now, I wonder why I waited so long to try out this Mexican jewel.. . My friend and I began the evening with margaritas; I chose a salt-rimmed pomegranate mix that was sweet enough for me to love and for my male companion to hate. :). . The line on that rainy Sunday night was horrendous--hungry people flocked to the deck in droves. Although my sugary, tipsy-turvy beverage kept me entertained during the wait for a table, I estimate I stood against the bar for a good 30 minutes before being seated.. . The chips and salsa were good--nothing spectacular--although my entree was fabulous: Quesadilla del Mar. The four flour quadrants were stuffed with lobster meat, cheese and jalape√±o, topped on the outside with mango salsa. The accompanying scoop of rice was dotted with an occasional green pea, while the mixed green salad embodied what I consider a true salad--romaine, watercress and arugula, not lifeless iceberg.. . My friend ordered the absolutely amazing Alambre: cheese, grilled and crammed with beef, peppers and onions--served with tacos to fill with the sinful slabs of meat. I plan to order the Alambre next time.. . The restaurant was dark, so I didn't catch anything about the decor.. . I especially appreciated that I didn't leave Zocalo feeling like a fat whale, barely able to stand. The food wasn't greasy at all and agreed with my stomach much better than the typical Mexican fare.
