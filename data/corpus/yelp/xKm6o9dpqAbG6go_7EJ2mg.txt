I come here all the time since I live nearby. Most of the time, it's a good experience; I've had a 'meh' meal once with some dry chicken. The wait staff are friendly enough, not overbearingly friendly which is not what I'm really interested in, anyways. I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a seat, even at it's busiest. (Don't be alarmed by their small seating area in the front, there's a whole giant area in the back.). . The food is all comfort food. I love their Fried Chicken Sandwich with curly fries. Their Puff Patry Pot Pie is excellent, too. Their breakfasts are filling and hot and their Chipotle Bloody Mary is satisfying. . . I'll have to admit that this place can be a little bit hit and miss, but when it hits, it's very good, and when it misses, it's still ok.
