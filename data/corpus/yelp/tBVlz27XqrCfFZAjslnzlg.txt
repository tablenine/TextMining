Went for fathers day and decided on their Sunday tapas menu instead of the pre set menu.  Good choice. Thought the boneless ribs were top notch! Favorites include tri tip, manchego cheese buñuelos, calamari, &amp; salt cod fritters. There were three of us and we tried almost everything they have.  Personally thought it was worth the $$.  Next time, I'm trying something off the regular menu.
