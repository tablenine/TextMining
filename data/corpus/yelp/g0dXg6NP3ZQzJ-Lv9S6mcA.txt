Restaurant: Savage Pizza
Category: Pizza
Savage is our favorite pizza in Atlanta &amp; has great service for the most part. Heather &amp; Olivia are great but watch out for Sarah F. I wouldn't reccomend eating there if she is in the restaurant. Otherwise the food is delicious and the staff are friendly. Â They'll help you create the most fantastic combinations.
