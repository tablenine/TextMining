I'm very mixed about this place. One one hand, the food is delicious. In terms of Chinese/Thai, it's well seasoned and flavored, is light and healthy, with lots of fresh vegetables. . . But holy crap, does that service blow, and I mean BLOOOOOW. After my party arrived, our waiter arrived 10 minutes after we were seated, and asked if we wanted any appetizers. We had to yell over the overly loud music that we wanted Crab Rangoon. 25 minutes pass, with no more watier, no other ordering, no crab rangoon. Finally he gets back, and takes our food and drink orders. It took another 15 minutes before our drinks arrived and another 20 minutes after that before our food arrived. It was ridiculous. The only plus side of the service is that at least they have servers refilling your water frequently so at least you have that.. . Granted, this was a Friday night, but there's bad service, and there's BAD SERVICE.. . Will I be back? Maybe, like I said, the food is really really good. Maybe I'll just try to go for lunch or not on Friday night.
