Restaurant: The Boundary
Category: Sports Bars
My family and I went to Boundary for dinner last Saturday...it took a long time for our waitress, Jasmine, to approach us for our order.  My daughter had the kiddie hamburgers with tater tots.  The tots tasted like old potatoes...my husband ordered a hamburger with garlic mashed potatoes.  He's a great eater, but didn't eat most of the potatoes, and only ate half the burger...didn't want to take it home.  I had asked Jasmine for another drink...martini worth $12 on her tip, and I never got it.  I must say, she was spending a lot of time near the register with her co-workers.  I was a waitress for a few years, and know how hard it can be.  I didn't see Jamine running around as if she were overwhelmed...she was quite casual about everything.  We live close enough to walk to Boundary, but there are so many other great restaurants we can walk to, I don't we'll be walking into Boundary anytime soon...also VERY loud and hard to talk!  When they weren't blasting the TVs, the DJ was blasting his music.  It was only 6:30PM on a Saturday night!
