Went to the jazz club downstairs last week.. . Rudest crowd I've ever seen in 25 years of seeing live music. Pops Management needs to make a decision if this is going to be a listening venue like the Jazz Showcase or just a bar. If they want to make this a listening venue then they need to figure out a way to get everyone to shut up so that those that wish to can actually listen to the music. Otherwise why waste the musicians' time? Just play CD's - it would be a lot cheaper.. . I went to hear the Ryan Cohan Quartet. Ryan is a world class pianist and composer. Everyone else there apparently went to waste $15 so they could talk over the music. . . There is no way I would return to this place. If you like jazz, stick with the Showcase, Green Mill or the Jazz series at symphony hall. If you like to drink and yell, this is your place.
