Fabulous Thai food in great digs down in Cobble Hill.  It has the hip trendy dimly-lit vibe with no attitude.  The massaman chicken curry will rock your socks.  The spicy flat noodles are very good too.  Oh yes, and can you believe, the cooks in the kitchen are Thai, too?. . All that, plus it's soooo cheap.  Every entree is $6-$7 each.  We ordered an entree, appetizers and a bottle of wine for under $20 a person.  What are you waiting for?!?!  It can be a bit crowded, but rightly so...
