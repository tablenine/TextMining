One Word : OVERRATED. . It's all about the hype of feeling "cool" here, but nothing to back it up. Sure,the place is visually quite appealing inside... but the sushi leaves alot to be desired. Especially for the prices!. . Its been sometime since Ive been there, since its drastically gone down hill!
