Category: American (Traditional)
Went here after a late night and trying to find a bite.  This tavern/bar/dive, is decent.  The nachos here are amazing, loaded with a bunch of crap that typical nachos come with, but just in abundance.  This was definitely the highlight.. . I also ordered a pork chop dinner....why did i do this?  I dont know?  I really had a taste for it, but I should have known there was no way I was gonna get some good porkchops at a place like this...completely ridiculous.  It comes with mash potatoes and gravy, and I ordered brocolli with it.. . The brocolli was severely overcooked, so any nutrient that I could even think about getting from this place were obliterated!. . Good server, really good nachos...but the rest of the food kinda uhhh sucked.. . Id definitely give it another shot!
