I don't know why this place isn't more crowded for their brunch buffet.  It's $10 and it's really good.  It's really meat heavy...a low carb lover's dream come true.  I'm not a flan girl, but I really liked it.  I've never come for dinner, only the bruch buffet, but it's a really good option and never a wait.  It's open till 3 for the buffet on Sat. and Sun.. . I came one time and only had sangria and it was good.  IMO, one of the bests in the city.  I think they have half price pitchers one night.
