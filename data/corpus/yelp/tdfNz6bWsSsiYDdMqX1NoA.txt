Restaurant: Casa Bianca Pizza Pie
Category: Pizza
(9/30/2008). Today I had my chops set on eating pizza for dinner so after work my brother came to pick me up at Caltech and off we went to Eagle Rock. I'd been to Casa Bianca only once with some friends about 5 years ago. Being that my brother had never been to Casa Bianca we decided to go.. . We arrived around 5:30 pm and it was already busy. The waiting area has plenty of signed photos of movie stars and musicians to look at while you wait for a booth. We were in luck, we did not have to wait for a table. We both ordered minestrone soup, garlic bread and a large deluxe pizza  with thick crust and garlic for good measure. . . First the Minestrone Soup. The soup had finely diced vegitables with pasta shells. The soup was very flavorful and had just the right amount of salt. Some places can go overboard on the salt. After about 25 minutes our pizza arrived and it looked and smelled great. The cheese was gooey, crust was crispy even on the bottom and the sausage had a nice sweet flavor with the fennel seeds complementing the overall flavor of the sausage.  The bell pepper was cut in large wedges and the mushrooms were juicy. Overall the pizza was delicious. Next time I will have to try the pasta dishes.
