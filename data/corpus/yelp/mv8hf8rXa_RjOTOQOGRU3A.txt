A friend and I came to this spot when we were drawn in by their delightful sangrias.  When we went, it wasn't on the menu, but it was probably the best sangria I've ever had.  We had the white wine sangria and it had large chunks of peach, mango, orange, strawberries, and other fruit I'm sure I'm forgetting, which had been soaked in the wine.  The picture I am about to upload is more than enough to convince you, I'm sure!. . My friend and I came mostly for the sangria, but we also ordered a small pizza appetizer which I thought used fresh ingredients for a perfectly healthy snack.  Afterwards we decided to sample the gelato... and good thing!  The servers behind the gelato window were quite generous in their sampling.  They asked me what I liked and gave me different flavors to try.  Unfortunately I was too buzzed to give an accurate critique of the gelato I got (I believe it was almond flavored) but I enjoyed it nonetheless.. . I recommend outdoor seating on a wonderful California day.  I loved the vibe - casual, busy, lots of chattering beneath the street trees, with people seated for various meals - snacks, desserts, lunches/brunches/dinners, &amp; drinks.  Lovely.
