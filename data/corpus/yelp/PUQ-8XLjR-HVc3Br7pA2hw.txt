Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
So this is the famed place to hit up after you hit up a fun filled night life in Los Angeles.  I've been here a couple of times and its been quite awhile since I've been here.  And still to this very day, the hype goes on.. . The long line for a processed meat shoved inside a bun or even a tortilla for that matter (if you haven't been there yet, you have to see the menu)  after all it is just a HOTDOG that tastes quite mediocre after waiting in line for close to an hour.. . If you want a better hotdog in the Los Angeles area, the Dodger Dog tops the list,  and a close second is the Costco Hotdog, or last but not least, the mexican lady outside the clubs at 2-3 in the morning wrapping her Hotdogs with bacon and then serving it fresh right to you, it does not get any better than this, well at least in Los Angeles.
