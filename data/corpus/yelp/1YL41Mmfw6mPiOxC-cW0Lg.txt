This place is a great steakhouse.  Period.. . The service was absolutely some of the finest I have had anywhere.  A friend of mine brought a couple bottles of Barolo and we paid the $10 corkage fee.. . We got the seared tuna, crab and lobster napoleon, and the smoked salmon to start.  The seared tuna and smoked salmon were nothing mind blowing, just good clean flavors and ingredients.  While the napoleon is quite rich, (maybe too much so) it proved to be a good contrast to the lighter appetizers that the four of us split.  . . As far as the steak goes, I went with the bone-in dry aged new york strip.  I am beginning to taste the difference in dry aged steaks in terms of depth of flavor.  This steak was excellently prepared to rare-medium rare as requested.  My only complaint was that I wish it had a little more external char.  Nonetheless, it was really enjoyable.  The corn pudding side we got really showcased off Bone's southern influence.  The creme brulee dessert was also fantastic.  . . This place is not cheap, but it really is an awesome place to spend a special evening.
