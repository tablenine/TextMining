I've only been here once but the fact that I'm spending time writing a review about this place must say something.  I didn't know what to expect not reading the reviews beforehand and felt like I was in Hollywood for a second, waiting in line...just to get into a restaurant?  Once you're in there's more waiting since you have to nab a table BEFORE you can order.  Once you've accomplished all that, the food better be worth it and you know what?  It is.  Their burgers are delicious, their skinny fries addicting and their beer selection is comprehensive.  I'm not a beer drinker at all but even I found something I liked!  The burgers aren't cheap but I like the ambience and seems to be a great place for groups.  Definitely worth the trouble once that grease is all over your fingers and your taste buds are writhing in delight.
