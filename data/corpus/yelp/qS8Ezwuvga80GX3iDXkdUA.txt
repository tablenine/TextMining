Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
I love the prime rib here ... Actually I use to love to come here to dine in. However, I don't think I will ever dine there again.... The sharing charge is outrageous... Don't get me wrong, the prime rib is divine and it's fork and knife licking good. I kind of prefer taking out and bringing it home to eat. That way, you don't have to wait in line even though you made a reservation, etc etc etc... And you can share the beef bowl with 3 or 4 people without getting stuck with the $20 share charge....(what the .....).
