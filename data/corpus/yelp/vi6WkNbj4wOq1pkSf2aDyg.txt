It doesn't matter how crazy busy this place gets, I always find the workers to be friendly.  I appreciate this since the long lines can easily make the faint of heart give up and walk out.  . . However, walking out was definitely NOT an option since we scored a primo parking space and the cheese rolls were beckoning me to come on in.  . . The waiting was seemless as the vibe was giddy and light--considering it was a Friday afternoon.  Waiting around in line helped me concentrate on what to get.  . . Cheese rolls, cheese rolls, where are they?  Ohhh, they're offering a dozen for $7.95.  Not bad.  But I was still full from lunch.  Okay, I'll just get 2.  Ohhh, they have red velvet cupcake, with a red rose petal on top.  Cute.  Ooooh, they have creme brulee, topped with strawberry and boysenberry.  Okay, that's it.  I can't look at it anything anymore.  What are those?  Potato Balls??!!  Don't even get me started on the chocolate.... . Needless to say, it was pretty hard to decide on what to get.  . . The downside?  Porto's is nowhere near my 'hood and that makes me sad.
