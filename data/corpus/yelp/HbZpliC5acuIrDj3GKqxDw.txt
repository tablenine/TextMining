y'know, the food here is very good, and the baby tuna appetizer was amazing...but like so many sushi places in chicago, i'm not entirely sure what i'm paying so much for. presentation? atmosphere? attitude? name cachet? i dunno. i reckon it's a nice place to go for a special occassion, but i miss being able to get pretension-free japanese food so cheap that i could eat it every day.
