I wish I could tell you how the tacos tasted but the kimchi quesadilla - which I ate first - overwhelmed everything else.  All I could taste was hot, but it was pretty good.  It was also really messy, which is a no-no for me if I have to stand and eat or sit on a sidewalk and eat, which is what you'll end up doing if you want to eat this stuff while it's hot.  . . Was the food wait-in-line for an hour good?  No.  I recommend having a very nice friend stand in line and order for you while you're sitting comfortably at home and meeting up with them once they've ordered.
