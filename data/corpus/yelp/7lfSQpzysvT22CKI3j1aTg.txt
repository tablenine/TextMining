Restaurant: The Grilled Cheese Truck
Category: Sandwiches
Great idea.  The menu is pretty creative and the options are fun.  The line moved quickly and the folks working the truck were nice and friendly.  . . The sandwiches were pretty good.  I got a standard melt with cheddar and apple slices.  I definitely enjoyed it-- especially the little shot of tomato soup I got on the side-- but, as far as grilled cheeses go, most of the ones I've had off the Grateful Dead/Phish lots have pretty much blown these out of the water.  . . That said, my kid got the cheesey mac and cheese melt and loved it.. . I would recommend a little bit of garlic butter as an option to be added while grilling.  It just needs a little bit of pizzaz.  Again, it's good.  Just not Grateful Dead lot, "Phatty Grilled Cheese" good.
