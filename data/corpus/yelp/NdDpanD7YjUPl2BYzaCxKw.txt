Ate at the Amaro Bar on a Tuesday night and ordered the Prix Fixe menu for $35. It includes One appetizer from the Mozzarella Bar, an entree, a dessert, and a glass of wine (red or white). . . Now, this may not be the most helpful review, but I must say the burrata speck cheese appetizer was the bomb! That was my friend's choosing. Mine was the prosciutto with a big honking mozzerella ball on top of it. It's a pretty large plate of prosciutto, so I only recommend those who love it to order this dish. Otherwise, stick with the burrata speck. Mmmm.... my pasta dish was the marinara looking spaghetti and my friend had the clams linguini. I liked my spaghetti better as her clam linguini was too salty. Dessert was not impressive. I got the apple pie cream puff ball with a side of ice cream and she had the pumpkin pie thingamabob. Wasn't impressed with either. We both had white wine with our meals. . . The service was not bad, although not fantastic either. Sitting at the bar, we had people behind us cramping our space, ordering drinks in between us as if we were invisible. I guess that's how snobby west LA folks act, huh?. . I'll definitely come back here for the burrata speck and perhaps try more of the other dishes. . . Valet parking is $10 after 5pm. Boo to that.
