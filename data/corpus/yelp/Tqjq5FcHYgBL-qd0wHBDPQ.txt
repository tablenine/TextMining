Restaurant: Fogo de Chao
Category: Steakhouses
Once upon a time a vegetarian went to fogo de chao to celebrate her carnivorous  husbands birthday dinner. The following is a review simply based on the salad bar...... . For $28 you can dine at Fogo de chao and eat unlimited salad bar and take bites of all the unlimited side dishes that are served with your meat eating companions.  Not a bad deal when you consider how great the salad bar is!. The salad bar is absolutely delicious. The jumbo grilled asparagus and hearts of palm were my favorites. I also had some caprese salad and roasted potatoes. Really good. I had a couple of bites of the fried banana, mashed potatos, and polenta cakes that were served with the meat eaters meals- also VERY good. . . The waiter was a bit annoying - interrupting our conversation multiple times to see if we needed anything. The first 2 times was fine but he literally asked like 9 times. Also be sure to review your check- they marked me down as a meat eater even though I was only eating salad bar. They were very apologetic about that though.  we had the caprihana cocktails which i was expecting to taste more like a mojito but really tasted more like a tequila cocktail- not my style!. . I really enjoyed the company and salad bar at fogo , and i'd happily go back to satisfy my other half:). . Husband would like me to add: ALL MEAT WAS DELICIOUS! :)
