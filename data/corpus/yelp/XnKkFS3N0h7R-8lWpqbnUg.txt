First of all...this place is quite pricey. I somehow ended up spending $80 on dinner and drinks just for my friend and myself! So don't get drunk on their (decent) bloody marys otherwise you're in trouble...lol.. . However, the service is excellent and so is the food. The servers are very attentive, quick and friendly and the food is mouth-wateringly delicious. I totally recommend this place!. . P.S - it is a seafood restaurant...so don't ask for pork chops!
