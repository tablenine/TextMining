I have eaten here a ton of times and brought many folks in with me and had a great experience 9 times out of 10.  The menu is gigantic, as are the portions, and you can get a full fresh sit-down meal for $4 or up to $40, just depends what tickles your fancy.  . . The waitstaff has never been a problem for me, so I don't understand the negative comments about them, but YMMV.  My main complaint is that they don't have a good selection of coffee drinks. Otherwise, I love it!
