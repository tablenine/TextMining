Restaurant: Joan&#39;s on Third
Category: Specialty Food
A great weekend lunch/brunch spot with tons of celebrity gawking, if you're so inclined.  The cheese plates are excellent and their famous cupcakes are alone worth the trip. . Joan is a great woman - her daughter works there and her new son-in-law is the chef.  It's a great family owned &amp; operated spot - I love it!
