i am a west loop resident, so i was hoping for a new place to grab and beer and a quick bite.. . Unfortuntely the service was beyond disappointing.  We would have spent more money on food and drinks but were unsure if we would get them in an appropriate amt of time.. . the food is tasty.  word to the mgrs: work on your customer service!
