Restaurant: The Majestic Diner
Category: Diners
4 1/2 years of living in Atlanta, i've never been here...first time for everything.. . now, I give the Majestic 3 stars not because the food I had was "a-ok" but because just the people watching alone was enough entertainment for me!  I had a simple egg &amp; cheese sandwich...wasn't bad, wasn't good.  i definitely could make it much better at home...however, its 4am and who cares...i already smell like cigarettes from El Bar why not continue the night with a dry egg &amp; cheese sandwich.. . anyway...fun times, well...interesting times.  i'll probably be back, but probably not if i'm sober.
