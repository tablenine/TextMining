people can talk smack all they want... i frequent this place for 3 very good reasons:. . 1) its a 3 minute walk from my place. 2) its fairly cheap (for being so trendy). 3) the food is good. . true, you will wait FOREVER to sit on a nice day, and then 15 minutes for your drinks once you DO get to sit... but if you are in good company and have time to kill, a great place to eat in a great location. . . (patio is the ONLY place to sit worthwhile.)
