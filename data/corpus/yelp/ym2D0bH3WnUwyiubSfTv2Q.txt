OMG I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet!!  I had the most incredible dinner here, and my new favorite cocktail - Moscow Mule.  Impeccable service at a decent price.  We had a great dinner.. . The decor is stunning.  It's very spacious and the conversation just flows throughout the restaurant.  The wait staff makes really personalized recommendations and they make it a point to talk to you like a person and not just another check to pick up.. . I can't wait to go back!
