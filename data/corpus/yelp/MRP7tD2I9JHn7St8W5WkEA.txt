Canter's Deli is a classic late night spot for a solid meal after a solid party. Unfortunately I am not here on yelp to review the food... but fortunately I am here to tell you want no one else is. "How are the bathrooms?" Glad you asked... After a night of minor to heavy drinking you may find yourself in need of relief. So get ready to walk up a flight of stairs (BOO!) oh and did I mention they are one person at a time? I hope there isn't a line. Â The bathrooms are clean just old and small... Hey, it'll get the job done. P.S. get the Matzo Soup and half a Sandwich... CLASSIC. Happy Tinkle Trails...
