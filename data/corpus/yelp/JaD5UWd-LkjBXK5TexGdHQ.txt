This review is purely for the Hainan chicken. Moist, tasty, chickeny, the perfect comfort food. Want to avoid the wait, just take it to go.. . Ah Hainan chicken.... I have posters of it on my bedroom wall. I fantasize about it on long Summer nights. Why would you order anything else here. Perhaps this is heresy but personally I enjoy the white meat version better, and its cheaper. The sauces that it come with send me into a state of ecstasy. I need to stop writing now...
