Ok, so I know that people complain about  the "trying really hard to be cool" crowd that frequents this place, but I stand by my opinion that their food is excellent!  I usually get breakfast items (banana pancakes, egg and potato scrambles, etc), since they serve them all day, but they have very good lunch and dinner items as well.  My suggestion is to go on a week night, since it will be practically empty, and you don't have to deal with the Hollywood posers.  The atmosphere is actually quite pleasant when you're not fighting for a table and the servers' attention!  Also, if you're feeling like dessert, they have the BEST red velvet cake that I've ever eaten!
