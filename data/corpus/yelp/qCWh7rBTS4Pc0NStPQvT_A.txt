Restaurant: Craft Atlanta
Category: American (New)
Ah, my very first review. Why not start with a restaurant that has made not one, but two special occasions ones to remember!? . . Now, I'd like to start by saying that as much of a foodie as I am, and as many times as I've watched Top Chef, I neglected to make the Tom Colicchio / Craft connection before going and I think I was the better for it. I believe that hype and expectations can often get in the way of the authenticity of experiences whether they be of a movie or a meal. If it can be helped, I'd just rather go into both with little or no expectations till the first opening credits scroll across the screen or the first "Hello, how many in your party?" leaves the lips of the host or hostess. . . The space was just drop dead gorgeous and one of the most beautiful in Atlanta. The service from the valet to the wait staff and manager, struck the perfect balance of friendliness (without being fake or overbearing)  and professionalism (without being cold or pretentious) setting the stage for what to me is most important and why I'm there, the food.. . Now to the food! . Delicious, savory, creative, yet familiar. I went on my birthday the first time and Thanksgiving the second. Both times I left (stuffed to the gills)  with my adventurous side completely satisfied and my oh so important comfort food itch scratched. . . Can't wait to go back and share this place with some friends of mine. You know who you are, and when I do, there will definitely be a more detailed and food focused review to follow.
