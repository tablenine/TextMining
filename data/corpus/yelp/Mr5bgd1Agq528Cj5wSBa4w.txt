I've been in here a number of times the past few months, but I've never ventured further than drinks.  I definitely prefer eating at a table instead of a bar, but the few times I've been in here - even during cold snowy weeknights when the place has been dead -  there's been a long wait for a table.  So...I've never had a chance to try out any of their food.  Anyways, what I've had from their drink menu has been good, although the bartenders could be more friendly.  One time my friends and I were having a convo on how slow it was at our jobs, and when asked what I do, I said I was a federal auditor.  The bartender then told me that he was glad he was paying my salary when I didn't have any work to do.  Umm...thanks??
