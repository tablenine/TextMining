I was very disappointed.  I came here with 4 other friends and none of us were impressed.  Our service was horrible.  When we asked what some of the most popular dishes and appetizers were, she suggested the mozzarella sampler.  So we took her advice and what a mistake that was.  It's 3 different types of fresh mozzarella and not dressed with anything, but olive oil.  How boring!  3 bland balls of cheese?  Really? I thought it was going to be more like a cheese plate with fruit.  Why not suggest something like burricotta with radicchio, spiced walnuts, honey &amp; fried rosemary?  When we asked about wine, she sent her manager.  The manager wasn't much help either.  He didn't seem to care.  I've had way better food and service else where.  We all ordered something different and shared.  Nothing spectacular and a little too salty.
