This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Little Tokyo. Sushi is my favorite food and I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants. If you're one of those pseudo-sushi lovers who can only eat California rolls and Dragon rolls, this is not the place for you. And one more thing, those rolls with sauce and imitation crab inside are not "Japanese.". . I went with 3 of my girlfriends and I ordered the dinner SASHIMI DELUXE. I don't remember the exact name of it, but it comes with sashimi, tempura, etc. for 30-something dollars. It's quite a bit of food. And it's good food. The fish is fresh. . . You should definitely try this place. The wait is long, so get yourself a cup of Yogurtland or something while you wait.
