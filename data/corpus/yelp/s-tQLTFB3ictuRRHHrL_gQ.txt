Step one: Valet....$7.  WTF?!  On a Monday.  . . Step two: Drinks: . . Me:Swirl please with an extra shot (my friends did this last time).  . Waiter: Is Patron Silver ok?. Me: Is it made with Patron?. Waiter: No, House tequila. Me: Is the shot served on the side (I remember it being on top of the glass).. Waiter: No, on top.. Me: Why would I get a good shot of tequila mixed with lower quality?. . Totally tried to upsell me.  I guess it's his job, but he acted like Patron was just the usual, I can see people not knowing a lot about tequila just saying sure.  My drink was $11.25 each, I had three.  I was not buzzed.  You do the math.  I can only imagine how expensive they would be with Patron.  . . Food: Over-priced and mine was lukewarm.  I would go back for chips and salsa, guac, or queso next time only.  . . Finished my 3rd drink at the bar to watch a game.  I saw the bartender pour a gentleman a margarita...it looked MUCH stronger than any that he poured and sent to the servers.  . . Another note....there were A LOT of kids/families.  . . I went to a Chevy's one time a long time ago.  4-5 years ago, I liked Uncle Julio's, present day, it's just a glorified, over-priced Chevy's.
