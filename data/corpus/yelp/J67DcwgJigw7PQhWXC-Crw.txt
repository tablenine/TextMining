You love it or you hate it...and I hate it.  Dont come in the summer, cause if you sweat at all for the next 2 days, your sweat smells like garlic.  I had to wash my sheets because I reeked up my whole room.  I am disgusting, I know.  I also had to brush my teeth like 3 times in the middle of the night after I ate here, because I couldnt STAND my own breath.  Thats right.  Take Jessica's advice, use some restraint and dont end up like me...sweaty stinky garlic girl.  Oh, and the food was good but not great.
