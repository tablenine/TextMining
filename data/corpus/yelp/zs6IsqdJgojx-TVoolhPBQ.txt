Bonnie's has the best burger in town. It's totally worth the trip to Park Slope to experience this place. They use their own blend of spice to season their patties, and it makes for a very tasty burger. The fries were awesome as well. Their beer selection is stellar. Your search is over. This is it. The best burger is right here at Bonnie's. They also have this amazing chipotle mayo that goes well on everything. It's a real treat to eat here. One of my favorite spots.
