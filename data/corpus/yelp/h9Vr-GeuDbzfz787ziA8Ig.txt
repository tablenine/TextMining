After all the positive reviews, I thought this place would be really good...instead I found it to be okay.. . I went with a few friends and was able to sample 4 different dishes.. . -Breakfast Burrito - this was okay - it was a bit dry for my taste, although it did have some decent flavor.. . -Brioche French Toast (with Peaches, Berries and Orange Caramel) - Pretty disappointing...it sounds good, but really lacked the rich flavor one would expect from brioche and caramel on the same plate....also, the caramel wasn't really caramel, it was more of just an orange-based syrup.. . -Breakfast Quesadilla - Pretty tasty...flavorful grilled chicken with eggs, veggies and a decent dose of cheese...definitely the best thing on the table.. . -Breakfast deal - A typical eggs, pancakes, sausage, potatoes plate - it looked great, but in the end was just okay.. . The great thing about LA is that it's a big city with lots of options - the next time I'm there, I'll try a different place since it's always good to try new things.
