The sausages are good. I actually thought the fries were GREAT! Thick fries always beats out skinny fries any day. But both do not warrant such a high price. The tzatziki sauce went well with the fries. That was my favorite sauce. I felt the beer menu is very limited. The light beer I had...I did not like. If the orders were made faster, price was cheaper, environment a little more rowdy/social... this place would be great place. Good place to chill but overhyped imo.
