I stopped by late on a Sunday afternoon with a small group of friends. The place was EMPTY. We sat out on the patio and jeesh did we have a bad time!. . First of all, someone in my group ordered a Blue Moon, and the waitress explains that they just ran out. So, disappointed my friend orders something else... only 5 minutes later to have the table next to us (the only other table with people at it in the whole place) get THEIR Blue Moon. So when my friend's Second Choice Drink comes out she asks why she was told that they were out, when they clearly have it? And the waitress explains that they were switching taps. And she didn't think to say that they were out "at this second, but they'd it again in five minutes, do you want to wait?" She eventually gets her Blue Moon. Eventually. . . One of my other friends is a strict vegetarian and they had almost nothing there that she could eat. She was basically forced to order the veggie burger - which I got with her out of a show of solidarity. And do you know what we got? One of those frozen patties that you can buy from the grocery store, over cooked (rubbery and also burnt) on a bun. Let's give it a huge, unenthusiastic hurray. Not. . . Everyone else seemed satisfied with their food and drink... but I wouldn't go back. Not in a million years, not for a million dollars. Well, maybe for a million dollars. But really... only for a million dollars. AND they'd have to pay for my food. Ick.
