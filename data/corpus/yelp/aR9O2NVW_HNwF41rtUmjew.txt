Ok I am a garlic fanatic so this is kinda biased but damn even garlic ice cream!. This has been my Valentines day spot for years and its always a treat my blood pressure drops after every visit, which is kinda ironic since my doctors office is 2 doors down.. The only down side is the parking valets they lost my car once and it took them an hour to find it but the bar is cool.
