Best Italian Sub I've ever had and at the cost of a Subway sandwich?!?! What are these guys doing to be able to give you that much food at such a Â low price?!?!?! You've got to see this to believe it. . . You have to pick up subs from here, btw. It's a small little grocery store so there's no dining in here, folks. I got the 12" Italian sub and the thing was so good I finished it all, barely. I can eat a lot, so for all others, the 12" is some serious food. My dad got the 9" and couldn't finish the last couple bites. His was $4.75 and mine was $5.50. . . Funny story is that my family and I ate Bari Subs in our car in the parking lot at the United Center before the Bulls/Miami playoff game last night. Originally, we had planned on going to May Street Market if we had time, but someone has got to change that review b/c there are no dollar signs to indicate how expensive May Street Market is!!!! For the cost of one entree at May Street, we got 2 x 12" subs, 1 x 9" sub, 3 bags of chips, and 3 drinks (about $26.00)!!! Unheard of in the suburbs and especially in Chicago.. . Eat here, it's awesome. The meats are all fresh and hand sliced, and the grocery has a small little mom and pop charm to it.
