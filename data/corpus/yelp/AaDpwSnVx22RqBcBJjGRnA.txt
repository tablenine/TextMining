I really wanted to like this new eatery that has been getting a lot of buzz lately.  The server we had was excellent, friendly, knowledgeable and courteous.  The service is what I would recommend this place for and if I were able to rate her performance I would give it a 4 out of 5.  However the food presentation left me a bit unsatisfied.  It's not that the menu wasn't diverse enough or lacking in originality it was a few simple problems we found.  First, the tuna was way too salty - you could see the salt all over it - definitely not seasoned to taste.  Second, and this is what really got me, my entree plate was cold - ice cold.  The food I am sure came out hot, but the plate was cold enough that when I tasted my macaroni and cheese under the short ribs (which were excellent) I was quite disappointed.  Also, the espresso was lukewarm with no crema visible.  I had a great time with friends in this lively well designed and decorated space but overall I can't say I would recommend in a city with so much competition.
