Restaurant: Square One Dining
Category: American (New)
Pat Saperstein wrote in her blog EATING L.A. that SquareOne was THE BEST brunch place of '06. Overstatement, I thought to myself. Then I ate there - and goddamn it was good. . . I had the skirt steak and over-easy eggs. When the (cute and friendly) waitress asked me how I wanted my meat, I said "medium." . . My buddy -censored- (-censored- kid brother - who's so shy that he asked not to be identified- and who is a higher-level epicurean than I) said "You should always order that cut of meat medium rare." . . I shot him an annoyed look and asked, "Why didn't you say anything? That's like remaining silent while you watch me eat a cockroach." Â . . Cornholio shrugged.. . My food soon arrived - and guess what? It was medium rare. -cendored- was impressed. I tasted it and it was heaven. I now know how Obelix (from the French comic book ASTERIX and OBELIX) feels when he bites into his "Boar. Boar. Best prime boar.". . Is it better than BLD? I think they're neck-and-neck. Both restaurants are chic (SquareOne has a small dining room, but a rather spacious patio area). Both have amiable wait staffs. And both have exquisite food. Is it the best of '06? I don't know, but it is one of the better places I've ever eaten.. . If you go, go early in the day.
