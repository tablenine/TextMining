Stopped in at Rodan on a busy afternoon...it was Wicker Park fest weekend and the crowds + awful country music was making my head throb.  Rodan was advertising $10 pints and a 1/2 pound burger, and although the idea was clearly stolen from the Paramount Room, the relative quiet and a glass of decent beer was more than enough to lure me in.  . . All I can say is DAMN they blew me away with the burger.  It was huge and the spicy marinate they used did the trick.  The salad it came with was fantastic and a glass of Three Floyds Pride &amp; Joy made it the best meal I had all day.  Of course the service was lacking a bit due to the masses of families and drunken college students, but I was delighted by my meal...$10 well spent!
