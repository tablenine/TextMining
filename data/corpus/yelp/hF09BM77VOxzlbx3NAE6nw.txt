I initially was going to go there with my b/f for valentines but glad we werent able to go.  Went last Saturday night, and I was a little confused.  The outside, is a huge door which makes it appear very exclusive. The two hosts in the front were scantily dressed with an unnecessary pretentiousness.  You are a host get over yourself.  Anyways, seated promptly and waiter was so nice.  He must be used to the noise. It was really loud and he still understood my order.  He also apologize for the loudness.  It was like eating in a club ..weird. . Anyways, ate the Kobe Roll, some Nigiri and Calimari.  As everyone else says, its okay. Nothing special, you can probaly get better at your mom and pop sushi joint and at a cheaper price. . Geisha House did redeem itself with its drinks.  The drinks were the best I have had in Atlanta.  I had a menari which has lychee sake and some other juice, delish.  it will set you back $10 a pop but worth it for a decent drink.. Its expensive food with a less than expensive atmosphere.  I was confused by that.  . In all, would stopover for drinks there b4 hopping somewhere else.
