After hearing some positive reviews on this spot, the lil' lady and I decided to check it out.. . Cool space-  inviting, but not overly hip.  Awesome, and really moderately priced wine list.  Most bottles in the $20s to $30s... . Our food was tasty.  We had artichokes, roasted potatoes, pasta, and grilled quail.  2 apps, 2 drinks, 2, entrees, and it was right around $50.  A killer deal.. . Service was great.  . . I'll go back.
