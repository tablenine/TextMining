A good friend of mine on here doesn't like this place, but he is wrong:) . . Actually the cuban sandwiches and regular food are pretty good, but it's the desserts that will knock you out. Even if the only item they carried were the cheese rolls, they'd still get a stellar review from me. I can seriously eat an entire box by myself in less than a day, kind of sick actually. . . They have dozens of other wonderful choices for pastries, and they have some of my favorite cakes ever. They have a parisian chocolate cake to die for, and a three chocolate mousse cake that amazing. . . There are some definite drawbacks to deal with too. There is always a line. The owners must be so freaking rich by this point, I'd be surprised if they didn't own all of Glendale. Not only is there always a line, there's always five or six or seven lines, at all hours of the day. In fact it wouldn't surprise me if there were lines in the place all night right up to opening the next day, it's ridiculous. Secondly, the parking sucks balls, indelicate I know but the God's honest truth.. . Still, those cheese rolls. Amazing.. . Food - B+. Dessert - A+. Ambience - B-. Service - C+. Value - B
