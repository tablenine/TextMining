Yummy! I had lunch here last Thursday and here I am on Sunday still fantasizing about biting off the top of the pork dumpling and sucking in that amazing juice before I pop it in my mouth and oh the vinegar and ohhhh the ginger, the steammmmmmmm............ I had all the dumplings flavors and original is my favorite. I wish i lived in that dumpling house, I really do.
