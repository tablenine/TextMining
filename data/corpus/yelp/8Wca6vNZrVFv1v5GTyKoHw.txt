Category: Barbeque
Where do I begin?!. . Okay, upon being seated, you are already overwhelmed at the array of side dishes and korean pickled veggies. The kimchee, the gak du ge (radish), bean sprouts, fish cake...on and on..... add the leafy greens and vietnamese rice papers (for the meat, so you wont get grease all over your hands, not happening) and you've got a meal! . . Oh, but the hard part has yet to come....what type of meat to order first? You cant just order all of them at once....so well stick with the staple, chodubagi and kal bi. . . Sizzle sizzle, throw on some tenjan, garlic slices, and lettuce--bam, instant satisfaction, and stanky breath. ALL YOU CAN EAT....how could one go wrong?!. . O, but there is a twist, $12 dollars for a bottle of Soju (which one can purchase for a mere $3 dollars at a nearby korean market.) Â So one suggestion, please don't judge, is to simply bring a few bottles of 'water'. Yes, I sound like a cheapskate, but who fkn cares? I need my Drank while i consume all that meat. . . Bring all your friends and make sure to be hungry when you visit Manna. Bae go pah!!!
