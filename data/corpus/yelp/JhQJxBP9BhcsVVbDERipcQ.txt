Restaurant: Johnnie&#39;s Pastrami Restaurant
Category: American (Traditional)
This is quality "california style" Pastrami--a huge pile of thinly sliced pastrami on a roll--sort of like The Hat.  Also, the fries are awesome.  I fully approve.. . It's weird, though--for some reason pastrami is becoming as expensive as filet mignon in So Cal.  Pretty soon, they're going to start serving it at Morton's.
