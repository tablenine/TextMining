Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Had to kill time due to the Germans designing a crappy VW Beetle and breaking down on a road trip.  We had to choose between two taco shops directly next door to each other, so we chose the one with the line.. . TITO TACO- Big, hard, thick (that's what she said! BAH-ZING!) shell w/ shredded beef, lettuce and QUESO QUESO QUESO.  All around, tacos were perfect minus the beef.  The beef is your typical shredded lack of any flavor meat.  . . They give you a grip of the thick fresh tortilla chips (needs more salt) and a bucket of salsa.  The salsa lacks any type of chunks and is bland.  It basically adds wetness to anything you may think is dry.. . They don't have sour cream at all, not even as an add on.. . Guac- very tasty, but blended.  No chunks at all.. . I would definitely go here again if I ever drive a crappy VW Beetle and break down again in the city of Culver.
