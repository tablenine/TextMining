Their Couscous salad is awesome.  The ambience, setting, layout of tables are enticing as much as the dishes.  Dinner was exceptionally awesome, all in our group had a great time.  I've heard of the Lunch specials(not tried yet).. . Kashk-e-badamjan, Fessenjan, Koubideh are my favorites.  A wonderful place to share the food.  Enjoy the culture, relish the experience with the company.
