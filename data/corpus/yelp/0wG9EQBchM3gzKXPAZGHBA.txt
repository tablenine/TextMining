Restaurant: Crustacean
Category: Vietnamese
I used to eat at Crustacean's about twice a month when I used to work in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills. I can't honestly say the food wasn't spectacular, but the ambience was worth it (although sometimes it got rather loud) and the food was pretty good. . . For the price you're paying, one could expect to receive bigger portions, but I was accustomed to Crustacean's serving sizes as well as prices. Â Maybe because it was such a regular thing for us to do, get off work change clothes, head to Crustacean... maybe it was routine that gives this place a spot in my heart. And because we were regulars, and were always taken care of when we arrived.. . You're paying for the atmosphere, because cornish game hen in the real world doesn't cost $35.00.. . I do however, love, Love, LOVE the garlic noodles. . . Four stars for the atmosphere and service. Lucky for me I had a boss who loved going out to eat at expensive places and loved taking me with her, otherwise there's no way I'd come here of my own free will (and wallet).
