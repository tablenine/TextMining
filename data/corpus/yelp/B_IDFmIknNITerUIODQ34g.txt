Two weeks later, and I'm dreaming about their sesame noodles. So good.. . My advice if your chopstick-fu is weak -- and mine is WEAK: ask for a fork. I think I looked ridiculous. The waitresses TWICE dropped off forks at our table! I finally took the hint.. . Some more dumpling etiquette I picked up:. -Don't pierce your food with a chopstick. Apparently this is bad manners.. -Using your personal chopsticks to serve yourself from a communal plate is the equivalent of double dipping. I should've known better.. -Eating steamed buns -- just pick 'em up and rip them in half. I ate mine like a moron before I looked over and saw how to do that right.
