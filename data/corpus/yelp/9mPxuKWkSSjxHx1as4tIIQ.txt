Restaurant: Hatfield&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
I've been dying to try Hatfield's since I moved to LA.  Finally went last night and was not disappointed.  . . When we were first seated outside I was worried about being cold, but by the end of the dinner I swear I was getting a tan from the heat lamps.  Even thought Yelp lists this place as "dressy" there were many people wearing jeans and other casual attire.  . . First we had a delicious amuse-bouche of deviled quail egg and a shot of carrot ginger soup.  Then we had their cheese bread, which was AMAZING.  For our main course, I ordered the duck, which was good, but my brother got the hanger steak and short ribs which were way better.  Incredibly tender.  For dessert I had the beignets with a shot of malted milkshake (with a little straw!).  Soooo good.  Just when I thought I was going to burst they brought out a final treat from the chef: mini devilsfood cupcakes.  . . Two criticisms: 1. My main course was only luke warm.  Could have been much hotter.  2. People are allowed to smoke in the outside area of the restaurant.  Good for them, not so cool for the other people outside who were not asked whether they wanted to be seated next to smokers.. . Nonetheless, I will definitely be coming back.  Hatfield's offers simple food done right.  Tom Colicchio would aprove.
