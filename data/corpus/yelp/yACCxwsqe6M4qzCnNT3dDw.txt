Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
Father's Office the concept is great - even the Santa Monica one.  However, what the Santa Monica version establishes in theory, the Culver City one makes up for in practice.  There's ample seating inside and out.  2 weeks ago I was there Friday after work and Sunday with the wife.  After meeting a friend at the Santa Monica venue a few weeks ago.  I like the burgers - very solid (I have no beef with the preparation or rules around the beef).  The cheese plate - solid.  And the beer selection.... . I landed on the latest incarnation of my favorite beer - Anderson Valley Boont Amber.  Father's Office is carrying a version called the Huger Boont.  Mind numbing.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.
