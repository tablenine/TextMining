Wow-  This place was great.. . First, correct me if I'm wrong.  They serve 6-8 pm, 8-10pm, 10-12.. . What happens.  We have a group of 20 people.  You sit down.  There's mini beer kegs and hot sake on tables.  There is also edamame.  Out come appetizers of Teri Chicken, Fish and Beer.. . Then the sushi rolls out.  Various types.  Makis and nigiris.  Everyone's doing sake bombs all night..  There's group sake bombs for the entire restaurant.  They have sing-a-longs with songs like Summer Lovin, Pour Some Sugar on Me, etc.  The waiters put on a stage show.  . . Food:  4/5.  Pretty good sushi for being mass produced.. Drinks:  Sake bombs.  I don't know if there's any other choice.. Service:  5/5  Waiters were great.  I dropped some food on the floor and an attendant scooped up my mess in 30 seconds.. Price:  $. Interior:  5/5 (Only in LA category.  Bright lights all over.  I'm sure if I hadn't been drinking and it wasn't dark, the place would look horrible). Exterior:  5/5 (Old movie theater facade.  Adds to the Only in LA mystique). Park:      5/5  (Lot and Street). . Go Back:  If you can't get to Gates or Jack Stack.. Recommendation:  Sure.  It's BBQ!!!
