JUST REMEMBER: It's for slow afternoons, empty Sunday mornings, after-show pick-me-ups, long long long conversations.. . I like to think the waitresses dissappear because they want to give me my space and time to chill-the-hell out. The people-watching is amazing here. You'll always see a punk or a hipster or a mom or a tranny or someone with a weird accent lurking around.. . Some of the food is greasy but it is not wretching stomach-ache food like the nearby Golden Nugget *shudder* . My reccomendation is the cobb salad. They actually put about 2 billion different types of veggies in there and it is bottomless. Soup is amazing. Alcohol in the cider/hot chocolate is amazing. Pick the right meal and it could have hardly any grease in it. I kid you not.. . Bottom line: An unpretentious, kitchy place for slow eaters with nowhere to go. Excellence.
