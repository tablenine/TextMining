its awesome when you live a block away and your kids school is right behind it.  So for everything that I need to bring food for - I bring PORTOS and it does not disappoint.  Potato balls, cheese roll, spinach feta, and the most coveted - Mango Mouse!  Yum!  The carrot cake is awesome too.  Try the pumpkin pie for the holidays.  I can't usually stand pumpkin pies but I got one for my family last thanksgiving and the pie was gonein seconds.  It was the most yummy pumpkin pie ever.  I think they put a lot of cream in it that is why it was BEYOND! This place is awesome for people like me who cannot cook nor turn on a stove. Order their party platter and 90% are very reasonable prices.  $23.00 for 50 potato balls or cheese roll!  You can add $3.00 more and they'll put it in one of those fancy platters and viola!  Like you slaved over night to make it.
