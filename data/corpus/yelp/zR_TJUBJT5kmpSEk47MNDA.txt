Saw it on Triple D and it looked interesting so we drove up there (about 30 minutes) and was really disappointed in the place. Ran out of pastrami, pulled pork and cupcakes. Had the chicken but it was dry. The food is nothing special no matter how much effort was put into trying to make it unique.. . Seating? Practically sit on the floor hunched over tiny ikea coffee tables. Sit outside? Nope, all 5 heat lamps were broken. Fail, fail, fail.
