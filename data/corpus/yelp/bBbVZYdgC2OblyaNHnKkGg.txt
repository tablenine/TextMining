bright and sunny, milk has a spare, clean atmosphere.  I had a few of their shakes and malts and they are all delicious and fun.  the bacon and cheddar scones are great if you want a quick and savory bite.  it's a great place to stop by at if you are in the area and have a hankering for a little sumpin sumpin sweet.
