Restaurant: Ru San&#39;s Buckhead At Tower Place
Category: Sushi Bars
Not the best sushi in town, but the lunch buffet for $10ish is really good.. . I'm not sure why, but Edgewood is better then the Ansley or Buckhead location.. . At this location the buffet layout is pretty poor and I always feel trapped in the corner. Â My wife also feels that it's often too cold in the restaurant.
