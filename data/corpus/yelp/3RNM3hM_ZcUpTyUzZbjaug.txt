It is really tasty for vegetarian food.  It can fill you up without any meat.  The chikn is good in sandwiches and even as chickn strips.  I tried my friends bbq beef sandwich.  I do not recommend ordering the beef, not as good of an imitation of the real thing as the chickn.  The been chili which is more like a been soup is my favorite though.  It is spiced perfectly and goes well with the cream they drop on top of it and the cracker/wafers that are served along side of it.
