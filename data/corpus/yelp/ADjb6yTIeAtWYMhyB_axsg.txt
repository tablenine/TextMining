Pug Burger--done very well with great, fresh ingredients--but so tall it is almost impossible to eat without a fork!  Seriously.. . Oysters were fresh and the selection was large.  Friendly staff.. . Danielle the mixologist is bad ass though.  I first met her while attending a party she catered (for drink pairings) and her choices (and creations) were just mind boggling--truly amazing lady!  I also had the pleasure to sample her drink concoctions at another event in a gallery where I was commissioned to photograph and exhibit...again--perfection.. . Although I did not have any drinks at The Hungry Cat I have to give it Four Stars because Danielle is there behind the bar...although I think I would rate that pug burger about a three......... . If you want to drink--talk to Danielle.  You might pass out--but at least you know you did it in style!
