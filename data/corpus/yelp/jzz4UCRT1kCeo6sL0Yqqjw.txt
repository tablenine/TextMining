Alright, I must compose myself before writing this because I might rant about the bad before the good...... . OK, here I go.. . Good- The cumin pork chop was excellent! If, and I say if, I were to ever go back here, I would definately get the pork chop. . The rock shrimp appetizer was delish. The wasabi mayo was the best dipper.. . Bad- The mac &amp; cheese was a must to order due to all of the great reviews, but it failed in my book. It was soooo salty, ugh, I couldn't eat more than one bite. It really could have been great, but we all know too much salt can kill a dish. . . I had the Kobe burger for my main dish and I wasn't really impressed. The meat was a little dry for a medium and the bun was way too big. I had so much bun left over I could have made another burger.. . The rest. was so dark, I couln't even see the menu. Glad I reviewed it at home before I went. The tables are so close together, DH and I couldn't hear ourselves talk next to the old couple screaming next to us. Also, if you don't want to valet, there is absolutely no place to park.. . I might give it another go, but I wasn't too impressed.
