Go for the bar, stay away from the tables.. . Man, I wish I would have realized that before I went this past Saturday.  I'm not cheap when I tip.  Seriously.  I usually give 20% standard and often go to 25% with no issues.  But the waitress we had was so bad, I actually was using my phone to figure out what we should leave her.  She didn't mention any specials, flat out told us "no" when we asked whether we could get a special rather than our order a minute or so later when we figured out they had specials, and needed to be reminded not so gently about a coffee and tea refill.. . Now, despite an awfully bad service experience, this place maintains a 4 star rating for three primary reasons: (1) it has really, really good brunch food; (2) if you sit at the bar you will be entertained by one of the wittier, saucier "bar" tenders around; and (3) they have a bar that actually serves liquor for breakfast!. . Seriously, the bartender here is amazingly funny.  The first time we ate there, she was bantering with us about some customer showing crack at one of the tables and warning another patron that the guy who was trying to get cozy with her was married.  You couldn't script this stuff better.  Don't piss her off because she's liable to lay you out WWE style, but she is an amazing entertainer and treats the place as though it were her own.. . So go for the food and the bar, stay away from the tables.
