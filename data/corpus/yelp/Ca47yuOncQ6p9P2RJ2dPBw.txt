Came here on a whim, while in town for a long weekend. Absolutely no regrets, if you are a fan of Bongo, this is much more traditional and of course, everything egg is here. I was leery because of the service comments, but maybe they are working on things. I ate here twice, but relatively early both times (before 10). I came back once and there was an hour wait around noon. It's good, but not that good. The pancakes are really, really good here, they have character to them (unlike IHOP which is smooth and brown all around) you can call these are griddled fresh. I choose the apple cinnamon topping and it was not overwelming, the syrup was pretty good, but nothing special. The turkey sausage was terrible, served cold and seemed like they just took the patty out the box and nuked it. Omelette was tasteless (although I did get an egg yolk). I prefer a place that seasons their egg whites with something and Yolk simply adds the cheese and topping of your choice, meaning if you don't bite into a piece of that, there's no taste. The cinnamon bun is divine, but carb central! Waiters were on point, refilled my water and coffee continuously and didn't rush us out. It's spacious, airy and I like the fact the kitchen is open. Single diners need not worry as there is AMPLE counter space where you can look directly into the kitcken. Very nice touch here. The layout here is great and it's a good addition to teh South Loop. Extra star for a clean mens bathroom.
