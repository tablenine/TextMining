Since I am a gourmand wannabe, I made a reservation for this place during a romantic spring break week with my then-boyfriend. It is totally romantic with amazing food - though a little pricey. I chalked it up to just being in LA. Love the jungle-forest like interior which is nice for people watching (because I definitely saw an LA Laker). Beautiful atmosphere, delicious food - wanna pop the q? Go here!
