Restaurant: Buckhead Diner
Category: American (Traditional)
I got one of those dine around town cards from Buckhead Group for $30.00, so my husband and I decided to go on a Sunday afternoon. Not really knowing anything about the restaurant and it being a lazy Sunday afternoon, we were dressed pretty casually, to say the least! I guess I really should not have been to surprised to see the Buckhead ladies all dressed up in their daughter's oops, I mean their finest short dresses, but I was! Not sure what I enjoyed more, the food or the people watching? Okay, it was the food!!. We both started with a bowl of soup and they were both excellent! My husband had the tomato and I had a most excellent corn chowder. I thought the price was pretty high for a bowl of soup ($6.50),but I still can't stop thinking about that soup!! I have even called them a few times since to see if they were having that day, but alas, no corn chowder soup for me! . We ended up splitting the Famous Veal Meatloaf and by the time we were done, you would have thought the plate was never used. All in all, we really enjoyed the food here. I know we will be back and next time I might even dress a little nicer.
