Sitting on their lovely, minimalist patio after a swift 15 minute wait during prime Sunday brunch.  We had a very reasonable brunch for two for under 40 bucks with tax and tip.  . . Friendly, attentive waitstaff.  Excellent quality food.  Delicious garlic roasted potatoes.  Muy caliente homemade salsa! . . The Scientology vibe on that block is "interesting."
