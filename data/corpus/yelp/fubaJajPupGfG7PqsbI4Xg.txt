Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
Their food isn't great (especially for vegetarians) and the servers are bored, but you're not here for a gourmet dinner now, are you? Â You're here some mystery and impossible feats of illusion. And to get your bow-tie-wearing drink on. Aside from the portrait of Doug "There's Always Room For Beauty In the World of Magic" Henning, one of my favorite things about the Castle is the bar, because after a few drinks the evening become much more fun. Tip: getting into the Castle the first time is the hardest, but once you do, hang out in the cellar area, watch some close-up magic, then ask for some guest cards when they're done. If you and all your friends get some, you're set for awhile and can return whenever you want.
