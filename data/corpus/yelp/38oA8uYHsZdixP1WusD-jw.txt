I'd give this place 5 stars, but I can't because I found this place to be ridiculously expensive--by my standards.  Hey can you blame me, I'm an Architecture student! i spend all my money on materials.. . 3 of my friends and I came here because of all the hype we'd heard from Yelp.  We thought it'd be decently priced, but when we got there and saw the menu we thought ourselves idiots for not looking at the pricing that yelp had surveyed.. . Though the food here is super expensive, and that if you're going to split, you have to spend 10 bucks each...it was really confusing to order, the food is actually really good.  The tuna sashimi literally melts in your mouth.  The california rolls were good, and the Miso soup was super good.  The tempura is ultra crunchy which is a definite plus.  . . I really want to go back, but that won't be till I'm a baller.  I mean if you think about it, I should've noticed this place was expensive when I saw Porsche's and Aston Martin's parked in front of it.
