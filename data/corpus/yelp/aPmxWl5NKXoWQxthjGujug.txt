So......just got home from Gioco. Odd that this was my first time here since I live in the hood. Very impressive. Great staff, friendly, attentive, and wonderful. . . We started off with some wine, great selection from bottles to by the glass. We ordered calamari to start and it was good. Not the best, but very good for sure.  We then got the margarita pizza and the Gnochi.. Both were amazing. The shrimp in the gnocchi was great and the pizza was amazing.  The restaurant itself still maintains some authenticity to its gangster past. Very nice, speak easy like. We enjoyed every aspect. No five cause calamari was so-so.. Will be going back here for sure though.
