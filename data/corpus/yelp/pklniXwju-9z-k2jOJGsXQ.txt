It would be perfect if I had liked Feast.  It's local, it's veggie-friendly, has a great patio, and 1/2 priced wine on Monday and Tuesday.  Unfortunately the patio is the only thing I can recommend.  . . First, the service we received was really bad.  I only saw one waiter, and he made us feel like we were a nuisance (and I assure you, we never asked for anything besides the check).  I didn't get more water until after I finished my meal - and water was the only drink I had.  Second, the food was sub-par.  We got the veggie Mexican plate, spinach salad, and crab cakes.  My bf said the crab cakes tasted "off" and there was really no meat to them.  The spinach salad was fine, but the veggie plate was nothing spectacular.  Most offensively, the guacamole that came with it was the size of a thimble.  Third, I would have easily summed up my experience as an off-night at a middle-of-the-road local place if I had not paid a pretty sum for the meal.  The veggie plate was $16, and the tacos were really no better than the taqueria joint down the street.  Next time I'll get my $3 tacos there.. . Perhaps their brunch is better than their dinner, but it will take a lot for me to find that out.
