Husband took me here for a nice lunch.  We sat out on the patio on a nice sunny day.  Their food is pretty good, and their prices weren't that expensive!  The hostess was also very hospitable, and our waters were always refilled in a timely manner.  I can't wait to go back and try dishes other than their pastas!
