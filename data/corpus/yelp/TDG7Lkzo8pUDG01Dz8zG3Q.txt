Restaurant: LottaFrutta
Category: Fruits & Veggies
Lotta Frutta is a fun little place just a stone throw from the King Center and around the corner from Inman Park. I'm so happy to see it thriving. I remember visiting it early on when they weren't open 7 days a week and ran into the owner Myrna on a Sunday who informed me they were closed, however she gave me a little tour of the shop and sent me home with a frozen ice pop with Mora berries. She's a warm person and the colorful shop is painted with her creations. The coffee is a roasted bean from Cuba and beyond that is a secret. I have yet to try their famous fruit cups but it's only a matter of time before I do
