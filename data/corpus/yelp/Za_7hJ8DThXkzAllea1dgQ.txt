I can not believe that the average rating for this place is 3-1/2 stars, and what's with the "hipster pho" reputation?  I really don't understand, nor do I try to, what the principle and philosophy of being a hipster is.  One thing is for sure, the reputation of "hipster pho" is completely bogus.  Yes, they seem to attract younger crowds because, evidently, the place is an eye candy; it's very comfortable.  And I love their hanging lights and high ceilings.  . . So, the food is really good.  It's a simple menu, as opposed to the 50+ options that other restaurants provide.  The minimal amount of choices gives the cooks the opportunity to give each and every item in the menu with love- I know, I'm also cook.  . . The servers are very friendly and punctual.  . . Pho Cafe, or I guess "hipster pho" to cater the vain, is the best Pho place I've ever been to.  Their broth (beef, chicken, vegetarian) is the shit.
