Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
Dolce, like it's neighbor Geisha House, is fine if you're in Atlantic Station on a Monday night, when the food is half price, but otherwise, I wouldn't bother. . . The food is nothing special.  Actually, compared to all the other great Italian food you can get in this city, I think it was overworked - too many flavors blended together, such that you're overwhelmed and can't really taste the main ingredients.  It was bearable because it was half price and you could try multiple items without the guilt of the inflated prices.. . The decor is totally trendy - not at all what you'd expect of a true enoteca.  It's comfortable enough, but I found it interesting that the manager had so little to do (yes, it was a Monday night) that he could constantly walk back to the bar and put the chairs at the perfect angle.. . It was entertaining for people watching, but I doubt I would go back.
