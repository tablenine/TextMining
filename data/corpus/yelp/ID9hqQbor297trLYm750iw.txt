We enjoyed our visit here Saturday night, got in with an early reservation and left when the place was filled up. We were plenty hungry so order accordingly...a carnivorous sampling for sure.. We tried a bottle of BR Cohn, a SyrCab. This stuff was excellent, and we learned that some of the profit from this winery goes to support the troops. Good stuff!. For apps, we decided to try a couple of things we don't see much. We ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow and Lamb Scallopini. Just as we began to sense things were not coming out of the kitchen very timely, the manager stopped by to let us know the first attempt on the bone marrow was burned...so while we wait for another, he sent out the lamb and a flatbread with proscuitto and other tasty bits, on the house. This stuff kept us going until the marrow re-roasted.. The marrow turned out great and an obvious request when we scraped all we could from it was to box it up for our spoiled mutts at home.. For dinner, we had the Veal Chop from the standard menu and the tenderloin from the night's specials menu. Both of these dishes turned out great (and on time). Our waiter, Mike, paired us up a couple of glasses of a cab-bordeaux to finish the meals with.. Dessert was also yummy...a chocolate brulee and a couple of Gran Mariniers.. A solid meal, enjoyable time, and great atmosphere will usually help one overlook the small hicups from the kitchen. Not quite as expensive as our trip to Kevin's Steakhouse, but they certainly have the same grasp on serving Â up great cuts of meat.
