Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
This place is infested with COCKROACHES!!! . My wife and I used to like this place and used to visit a lot. She introduced me to Ramen as she is Japanese. However, the last time we visited with some friends, we took one of the tables that has a ledge against the wall, you could see so many roaches coming in and out of the little gaps that divide the ledge from the wall and perhaps traveling to the other restaurants or shops. This was the most disgusting thing I have experience. Even when we took our jackets which we had placed on the ledges, our jackets already had travelers. Yes, we were about to bring the roaches home. I just happened to notice and we immediately got rid of them and killed them. Even as you wait outside, you could see through the window how the roaches are hanging out and sunbathing while people eat. Yes, sunbathing because once the restaurant is closed, it is their time to eat and shit all over the food we eat. I am never going back to this place. In fact, I had to call the health department and report them. I am not sure if any action was taken but I can tell you I am not waiting to find out.. . By the way, the food was good!
