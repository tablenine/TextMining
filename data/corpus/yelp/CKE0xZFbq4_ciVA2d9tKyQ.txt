Restaurant: Magic Castle
Category: Performing Arts
Similar concept as Disneyland's Club 33 - one can only come here if you're invited by a magician or if you know a friend who knows one that can invite you. There is a strict dress code for gentlemen where jackets are required but they do have some on hand should you fail to get the memo. . . Once in the castle you're allowed into the dining room exactly on the dot of your reservation. Camera and other photography is not allowed but they will gladly come by take your picture and charge you for it should you require a souvenir. The menu is not very extensive so I chose the filet since I knew that couldn't be butchered too badly since kitschy themed restaurants are always hit or miss. Thankfully my steak was cooked just right and my meal ended being quite enjoyable. . . After dinner you're invited to walk around to the different shows and rooms. We were able to see all the shows that night since we had dinner at a reasonable time. The shows were nothing extravagant. Don't expect Lance Burton or Chris Angel type Vegas magic shows or you'll be very sadly disappointed. The shows were more what I would call amateur shows. . . They were still entertaining none the less but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again. It's a great one time experience if you haven't been but the food and the shows weren't so awe inspiring that I would be begging my friend to invite me back.
