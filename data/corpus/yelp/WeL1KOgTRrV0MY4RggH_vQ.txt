Restaurant: Cobras &amp; Matadors
Category: Tapas Bars
I have tried few tapas around LA and this is my favorite.  In my opinion, it even beats AOC.  This restaurant has great ambiance and lively energy.  Food is generally good and you can bring your own wine (no corkage) or can get beer/wine next door.  . . You have to call couple of days ahead for reservation for weekends or else forget about it....unless you want to eat outside which is usually first come first serve.  But no alcohol outside.
