So, yes, the burritos are HUGE (ridiculously huge. Monstrously huge. Unfairly huge.) and delicious.  I would not wait in line on a Friday night for this place, though.. . Also?  Do NOT come with a group large than four.  It's not worth the time and effort and the place is TINY and not really designed to accommodate groups.  If I had known how tiny this place is before-hand I would have either declined to go or instead we sit on the patio outside.  The wait staff makes sure you know that your group is an inconvenience.  . . But if you are hungry (more realistically: starving) on a Saturday afternoon and you and, at most, three friends want to give this place a shot, it definitely won't disappoint.
