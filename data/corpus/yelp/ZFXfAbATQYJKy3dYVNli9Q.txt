Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
Love this place. Cheap eats. You get a veritable mound of fresh greens to add to your Pho - one of the best places in the city to get this soup. Looks like a lot of Vietnamese people come here to eat too, which makes me think the food is pretty authentic. . . This restaurant is not chic by any means. V. basic, even a bit shabby. Which is why I LOVE IT!
