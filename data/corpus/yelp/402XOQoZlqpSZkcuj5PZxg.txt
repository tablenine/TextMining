I had lunch on the roof top today, and it was okay.  There is a different menu for the roof top, so none of the lunch specials applied.  . . I had a gin and tonic and a chicken wrap.  Both were good.  However, it was an expensive lunch.  Before tax and tip that was $15!  I had to order the gin and tonic though, because it was really hot :). . The food was pretty good, and service was fine.  However, I don't like having to ask for water, especially when it's 90 degrees!. . I would go back and sit inside and check out the lunch specials!
