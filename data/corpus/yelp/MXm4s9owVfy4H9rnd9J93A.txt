Restaurant: Alcove Caf√© &amp; Bakery
Category: Bakeries
Yay! I'm a fan.. . The Alcove is THE place in Los Feliz for breakfast, although I would go elsewhere for dinner or lunch. I'm not a huge fan of standing in line to order beforehand, but service is great and the staff is usually very friendly. Looking at the menu, the food is kind of pricey, but I guarantee that you wont eat everything in one sitting because the amount of food is ridiculous. . . Breakfast is great, I usually go for the buttermilk pancakes with strawberries and a latte, which to be honest, could feed two people. They even give you those cute little jars of jam when you order toast. I swear, this place is too adorable. There is actually a pretty good selection for vegetarians, although I can't say the same for vegans. If you live in the area- walk, because parking can be a pain.
