What can be said that hasn't been said before... sooo good, cheap, and fast. Even if the line is out the door, don't be alarmed, you'll be served in a few minutes, somewhat like what I imagine being served by the Soup Nazi must be like. Also no seating, but just eat in your car, even though it may smell of onions for a couple of days after. If you haven't indulged yet, go!
