I would give this place 10 stars if I could. I knew when the wait was 45 min at 9 am - this would be a great place. It did not disappoint. Wait staff was friendly and quick. Food came out fast. Interior is ecclectic cool and reminds me of my fave breakfast place in San Diego. . . It was really hard choosing - so many great options on the menu - but we got the Peanut Bubba french toast and Pumpkin Pancakes. Both were so yummy and HUGE portions. I preferred the pumpkin but both were awesome. Pumpkin had a wonderful flavor and they serve it with a dollop of pumpkin puree on top. Scrumptious!. . The chili menu looked great - definitely want to check this place out for lunch. So worth the wait.
