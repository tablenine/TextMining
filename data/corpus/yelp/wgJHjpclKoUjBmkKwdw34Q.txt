Meh.  Friendly service, no complaints there.  . . My drunken noodles kinda tasted like soap as if they forgot to fully rinse the pan they were using to cook.  . . The bathroom gave me the heeby jeebies.  It's as if took a tiny broom closet and threw a tiny dirty sink and a rickety toilet in it and threw a shaving mirror on the wall.  Certainly wasn't the cleanest.  . . Probably won't be back, I know there's better cheap Thai food out there.
