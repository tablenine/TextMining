Restaurant: Cooper 35 Asian Pub
Category: Bars
Can't believe I am writing a review for Asian Pub, a place that was near and dear to my heart when I was still a member of the Fake ID Club.. . Everyone has to show some respect for the $4 drinks that are really strong.  My friends would traditionally order malibu baybreezes, mojitos, rum and cokes (i.e., drinks that shouldn't be completely see-through).  Yes, it's well alcohol, but I have no clue how Asian Pub makes any money because these drinks were transparent and made the ice melt faster than anything I've ever witnessed.  If you're lucky enough to snag a table, you'll also have some edamame to snack on.. . The food is horrible, even if you're really drunk.  And the bathrooms are really skeevy.. . If you're 21+ and not an NYU student, this might not be the place for you.
