This place is overrated...the food is OKAY, nothing spectacular.  I tried the fried shrimp and huspuppies appetizer  and it was just HORRIBLE...honestly BAD, dont ever order it.  I also ordered the pork belly, there was NO FLAVOR whatsoever..it was literally a piece of fried fat.  The curry didnt compliment the pork well. . . Moving on to the entrees...I had the braised beef cheeks, which were actually very tender and delicious.  It was a little on the heavy side.  My friends had the pork cheeks, short ribs, and scallops...which were all good.  But, nothing really great.   The mixed mushrooms were good.. . The hype about the glazed donuts are definitely overrated.  Id rather goto Krispy kreme!  The dough was too thick and chewy...At least krispy Kreme is light and fluff.   i guess it depends on how u like ur donuts.  . . The service was pretty bad..the young white chick was rude and never served our table.  She kept giving us a weird stare and attitude everytime we asked for something.. . Overall our experience at this restuarant wasnt good...the food was okay, service was bad, and prices are reasonable.  I probably wouldn't go back for another round..but it never hurts to try the place once....
