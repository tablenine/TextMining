Personally, I think this place can use a renovation and upgrade. Place is quite small and there's always long line no matter what time of day you come, so you'd better RSVP before you come. We (party of seven) were seated in Cadillac room, which is located in the lower level of the restaurant, and we had to sit with little elbow room.. The food was excellent. I ordered pork taco and I had to take it home because was not able to finish it, probably because I kept munching those wonderful tortilla chips and salsa. Try their cheese salsa... very yummy..
