Restaurant: Bottega Louie
Category: Pizza
Last night we went to Bottega Louie. Initially my mistake for choosing a restaurant like this since I'm not a fan for places that have the noise level of the Oktoberfest in Munich. I should've known that "mass production" such as this is going to affect the dinner I was about to be served. As a former chef, I knew that no matter how much staff you employ, serving hundreds of meals a night will affect the quality of the food and the service which was friendly but definitely not efficient. I had the pork chops with a side dish of the shaved fennel &amp; sweet onions. I'm clear that pork chops is not the most exciting meal but I know a good pork chop when I taste one. It was cold and TOUGH with a bland apple sauce. My girlfriend &amp; her sister had the mussels/clams and ravioli, which were cold and forgettable. The only dish that was good was the arancini and the prosciutto, mozarella and sage crustini. After receiving the check my very diplomatic girlfriend mentioned the issues to the waitress who's Â reaction was genuine, she apologized graciously and told us we should have brought it to her attention after we got the meal (we would have but after bringing us our dinner she was not seen again). Only when we were more than ready to ask for our check did she pass by our table. She did, however go to the manager and informed him/her of our reaction at which time she told us that we were credited half of the bill. It was a very nice gesture and we all appreciated it, however, if you are looking for a pleasant dining experience this is definitely not it.
