The cubano I had was promising, but was ruined by the bread, which was waaaaaaaaaay too crusty -- seriously, it was all crust. Cubans should be made with bread that has a solid but thin crust, not for the sake of authenticity, but for the sake of edibility. Still, everything on the menu sounded really good, so I'll be headed back sometime.. . I also had the grasshopper ice cream sandwich, which I recommend. The light cookies make for an enjoyable ice cream sandwich (unlike, say, any possible Diddy Riese ice cream sandwich, which can only be enjoyed in the way that pixie sticks can be, i.e. as a feat of strength).
