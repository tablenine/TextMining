This old-school psuedo-diner/shack, standing in the shadow of the Westside Pavilion mall, remains the premiere destination for Angelinos' non-chain burger fixation.  The hickory burger (w/cheese) is as good as it gets, with a patty that is tasty as it is (relatively) lean.  A nice chunk of iceberg lettuce compliments the meat, with a bun that, while wrapped in paper for your protection from drippings, fits quite comfortably in your hot little hands.  A sweet but appropriate hickory sauce seals the deal. . . I can do without the fries.  There's nothing particularly wrong with them - they're just ordinary, overpriced and I'd rather save room for a piece of pie. . . Despite the name, their apple pie is not their best; in fact, it may be their worst (but still edible).  I'm partial to the chocolate or the cherry cream pies, if they have them available that day.  But I was once told by one of the servers that their best pie is the coconut cream.  Normally, I wouldn't choose that type, but I gave it a shot on his advice, and wouldn't you know, but he was dead right! . . Excellent, freshly prepared food &amp; the occasional celebrity sighting make this a perfect place to take meat-eating visitors to.
