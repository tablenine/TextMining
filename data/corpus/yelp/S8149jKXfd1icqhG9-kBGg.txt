Restaurant: Varasano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Great place for dinner any night of the week. Busy on weekends so I'd suggest a reservation. . Caprese salad with hierloom tomatoes is a great start and I've loved every pizza I've tried. . They suggest that you fold and eat your slices, which is fine, but when I brought a friend to dinner and she neglected to read the table tent with instructions or just wasn't interested in eating with her hands, she asked for silverware the server replied that 'they' suggest eating their pizza a certain way. Um, first the customers always right. Two, it's no longer your pizza; it's mine. I'll eat it however I'd like. . For me, I'm happy to conform to their pizza folding rules (because it actually does taste best that way) and I'll definitely keep going back.
