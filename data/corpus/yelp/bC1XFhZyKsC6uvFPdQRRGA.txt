Restaurant: Best Fish Taco in Ensenada
Category: Mexican
Never a disappointment. Owner gave me a taco free my first time because he was such a believer. I ordered two more. I am a pig face, yes. I admit that. But, the tacos were just so good! Shrimp tacos are my favorite but the fish are good too. Load up on toppings at the bar and don't forget the cream sauce finish! 6 tacos and 2 drinks will run you under $20. Always made fresh to order. What more can you ask for?
