Alrighty, I'm a fan!. . I didn't think that this place would have hit the spot for my craves for sushi, but alas, it did! My boyfriend and I were the first to walk in at 530 when it opened for dinner. We were kindly greeted by all of the sushi chefs, and were seated at a table near the sushi bar. The ambiance of the place was sort of trendy with the red wooden walls, japanese cartoon pictures, and wood floors. Service is exceptional. We were promptly asked what we wanted to order by a shy, Japanese speaking waitress who needed everything we ordered to be translated to her coworker. She said the cutest thing after we ordered our dishes, "No rice?" hehe. . My boyfriend and I ordered the SASHIMI DELUXE dinner! It was DELISH! My goodness! I couldn't believe how fresh and tasty each of the fish were! Everything that was on that huge plate was so good, and suprisingly filling! The presentation was very nice as well. We also ordered their spicy tuna roll (nothing special), and their salmon (always good!).. . As for drinks, my boyfriend had the hot green tea. It was pretty good. Oh, I just love my green tea and sushi!. . FYI: They charge $1 for extra ginger. It gets busy at 6pm! (There were no more seats available!). . Our bill came to $64 for the both of us! Not too bad for what we ate! I would definitely venture out here to get some fresh sushi anytime!
