Just damn good.  I got the "baoguette" which is their pork sandwich and it was so simply original in my opinion.  It had high-end/gourmet construction and taste wrapped in low-end/simple bread.  The bread of course was not "low-end" in quality mind you.  I'm now on the hunt for other creative Banh Mi's!
