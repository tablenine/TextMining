Restaurant: Jack&#39;s Pizza &amp; Wings
Category: Pizza
Came here for a cheap lunch. $4 pitcher is great. The slice tasted good, but the wings looked like they shouldn't have been eaten. Alas, they were eaten, but certainly a lowlight of the meal. . . Will come back for cheap eats. I guess you get what you pay for.
