Not to start out overconfident, but I'm from Memphis.  I think you know where I'm going with this so I'll stop short of drumming up tangible awe of my red-checkered childhood where you learn quickly to note the color of squeeze bottle tops (Clear- in the clear, Red- Askin for it, Black- Death Wish).. . This place is good.  Really good.  A Lagunitas Brown Shugga, pulled pork sandwich with extra sauce on the side and cilantro-laced coleslaw dumped on the sandwich itself.  Bite of the companion's Mac N Cheese traded for a few sweet potato fries.. . Couple that with live music on a cold night and you have my resident cure-all for those intermittent bouts of homesick.
