I started my Sunday requesting to eat somethin light before we went sailing...10 minutes into this car ride, I was requesting a medium rare  a filet please...!!. . After a whole day and awesome food, but lack of the medium rareness...I was on mission.  My beloved friends and I purposely arrived at Lala's.  ahhhhh....lala's!. . Fabio, Maral, and I ate us some goodness.  The garlic oil, bread, filet, salad, and whatever Fabio had, so good!!. . I had the 4.95 glass of Malbec.  It was delishioso.  :). . Did I say, that I love you........Did I say that I want to...leave it all behind......(oh sorry.  Listen to Damien Rice). . . :)
