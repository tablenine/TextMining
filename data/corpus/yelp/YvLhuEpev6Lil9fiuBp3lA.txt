I've been here several times now. The only thing I truly appreciated here is the ceviche. Everything else is so-so. I enjoyed their totopos and homemade salsas. I ordered their deep fried red snapper. Visually it's awesome but flavorwise, it needed help. Their garlic oil was actually quite tasty but it was just splashed over the fish while the fish itself lacked SO much flavor. I kind of wish all of their entrees were a little more innovative with their side of grilled veggies.. food kind of loses its appeal when it's accompanied by fat potatoes and carrots and corn.. bleh. . On a different visit, we did their parrillada. huge portions but again not as flavorful as i would like. I did however appreciate that they had limes out.. i know those are usually for cervezas and tequila but they also help the food too! haha so all in all... GOOD ceviche. OK everything else..
