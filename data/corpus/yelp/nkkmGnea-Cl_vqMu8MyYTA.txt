Restaurant: Furaibo Restaurant
Category: Japanese
Furaibo is a short walk from my abode and it is my #1 place to go with groups. They have a huge menu and for those not familiar with the style... think Japanese tappas. I've been here a couple of times and I've never been blown away by the service, but the food always makes up for it. Well, so do the drinks, as I don't think I've ever slowly stood up and ducked out of this place without being a bit smashed.. . There are enough reviews on this place, but I'll say this... a great experience, expect a small wait on Friday and Saturday evenings and I'm available for Sake contests if you happen to see me there.. . Oh, parking in back too.
