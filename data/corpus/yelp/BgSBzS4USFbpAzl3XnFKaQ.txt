this is the original.... this is THE BEST! there's always a line, but it's worth it... . . I've tried all their tacos (the taco sampler) and most I enjoyed.. I've also tried the chilaquiles, the shrimp burrito, and the Enchiladas Suizas... The one that always keeps me comin back is the Enchilada Suiza plate.... sooo delicious..... I love their black beans, their rice, their tomatillo sauce... MY, MY, MY... my mouth salivates just picturing the plate... YUM!. . Another thing I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE is their various selection of Aguas Frescas (fresh fruit juices).... I'm a sucker for fresh fruit juices (I don't do that Bang Horchata, powdered stuff, fountain drink junk), so they automatically get my love for this factor alone! You can't go wrong with any Agua Fresca you choose to order :-P!. . Don't forget to get validated ;)!
