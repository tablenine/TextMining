Really interesting food at a reasonable price.. . A member of our party had a food allergy and the chef came out and talked her through everything, her hawaiian inspiration for the menu (she splits her time between Hawaii and Chicago) and how she prepares the short ribs.. . The evening featured a prix-fix iron-chef type, themed menu that was only $30 pp.  The food was high-quality and interestingly prepared without being too weird.  . . Their winelist is good and the server's recommendations were spot-on.  Additionally, their cocktails have a fun, seasonal (and strong) twist.  The mixologist likes Bourbon and liquers.. . Atmosphere is a little meh, but go for the food. . . Sola is a good place before a show at Martyrs.
