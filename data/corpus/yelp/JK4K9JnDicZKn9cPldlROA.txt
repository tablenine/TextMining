Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Lou Malnati's is the standard. No questions asked. Whenever I eat pizza, I always compare it to how well it stacks up to Malnati's. The sausage deep dish pizza is my personal favorite. . The secret is in their ingredients. The cornmeal that they use for their crust is perfect for deep dish pizza. It doesn't get overburdened with sogginess and retains the flavor very well. . . The goat cheese is also key in that it doesn't leave a sick feeling in your stomach after you have had a couple of pieces. The icing on the cake are the real chunk of tomatoes that they use on top. Absolute perfection. . People ask me all the time what I think the best pizza in Chicago is and I always refer them to Malnati's. If you want genuine Chicago-style pizza look no further!
