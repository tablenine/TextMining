Restaurant: Over Easy Café
Category: American (Traditional)
I'm not down on the Over Easy, just not terribly impressed.  Their coffee (Meinl) is amazing, but the offerings are basic and delish, just nothing had me raving.  The service was fine-- it was early morning and we were the only people in there save for a woman nursing a coffee alone-- and the meal was brought quickly and accurately.  I had some pecan pancakes that were yummy but nothing that special.  I dunno, maybe it was the fact that my boy LOVES it and the last time we tried to go there was a line out the door, down the block--- I just expected more.  To be honest, there's a lot of breakfast joints I preferred to it!. . The place is tiny so on the weekends, don't sleep in.  Also, don't try to make this your group outing.  And maybe-- for my sake-- leave the kiddies at home-- the place would definitely get loud!. . Just not seeing all the love for a place that does a decent breakfast that's a bit overpriced.  I'd rather be back at Tweet for sure.
