Restaurant: Cemitas Puebla
Category: Mexican
YES-yes, I discovered this place when I watched Guy on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives and I was not disappointed at all.  I was greeted by the Dad of the shop and gave us a lesson on the type of bread the Cemita has and the type of tortilla the Taco Arabe carries.  I ordered the Cemita con Carne Enchilada and boy it was hot!!  Tasty - but I found myself sipping on my horchata every time I took a bit out this sandwich - I recommend you get the Horchata - it was great.. . Next I ordered the Taco Arabe - this was my favorite.  The sweet tender meat with the combination of the chipotle sauce gave it a sweet and savory factor.  Next time I am going to order a Cemita Milanesa and Cemita Arabe.  . . I like the environment - very friendly staff and loads of pics of famous people on the wall - I took a picture of Guy and the Dad.
