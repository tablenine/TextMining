I went here a few months ago for my birthday. I absolutely love seafood. I can't quite remember what I had, but it was a white fish? Perhaps the halibut, the preparation of the fish was fine, except I wasn't too fond of the sauce. It tasted like a teriyaki sauce which was too flavorful and overrided the quality of the fish. I just didn't think it complimented it well. Â . . We also had the scallops, which was only mediocre in my opinion. I just tried Spring tonight, and their scallops are amazing. . . The lobster dim sum was quite tasty, that was the only memorable thing.. . There are far too many great restaurants in Chicago for me to return to this place. Glad I tried it, but probably wouldn't come back.
