I've eaten a lot of steak through my years.  It is my opinion that steak is one of the highest expressions of food.  You don't have to taught how to enjoy it as a child.  Everyone just knows it's good as soon as they taste it without the slightest hint of pretense.  Burke's serves up one of the best steaks I've had in years.  The sheer flavor present in their aged rib-eyes brings a tear to an old man's eye.  Welcome to flavor country.. . Their secret, well, one of their secrets since I'm sure there are many more, is that apparently all of their steaks come from a single bull, and two cows.  They don't really play this part up too much since I guess some people might be turned off by it, but I think it's totally rad.  They found this bull who they've named Prime, who produces offspring of the highest order of deliciousness, and they bought him for some ridiculous chunk of change.  They take his seed, and the eggs from two particular cows, and implant them in other cows who act as surrogate mothers.  The result is an entire generation of cows whose meat is perfectly marbled and full of robust flavor.  Truly better living through technology.. . Our server was this great wisecracking David Spade look-alike, and after we finished eating, he agreed to arrange a tour of the aging facility in their basement for us.  We were taken down by the head chef, where he personally took us into the freezer room and showed off their racks off aging meat, being flavored as they dried by a whole wall of pink sea salts.  If you go and take the tour, be sure to check out the hunk of two-year aged beef sitting in the corner that they keep around for novelty purposes.
