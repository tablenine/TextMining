I can understand the one star reviews and the five star, the hype almost overwhelms the experience here. If you wait in line for anything this long, you're bound to be disappointed. If you go to the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa and wait for 3 hours, it'll just seem like a average little painting that's not as pretty as you'd hoped and not as large as you expected. That's kind of the game here, although I'm usually three sheets to the wind when I come so I don't notice as much.. . Maybe it's lived up to the hype for me for a couple of reasons. First, I don't really like hot dogs. I know what's in them and it's disgusting. Â They're good here for some reason, the Polish sausages are fine examples of how a dog should be. . . Secondly, I've always had fun in the line with friends and those around who are waiting in the same terminally long line. Don't come alone, or it will last forever. I suppose alot of those in line are tourists, but mostly it's club kids, frat boys, gangbangers and regular folks hanging out (usually peacefully) like hippies in the sixties. The wait is part of the charm. If there wasn't a line, it wouldn't be the same experience at all.. . It's crazy to me that you can come here any time of the day or night when Pinks is open and there will be a line around the block. That's impressive for anything, but especially for a hot dog stand.. . Everyone should come here once, it's part of LA lore and shouldn't be missed. I'm sure if you're a hot dog afficionado (do they really exist?) this wouldn't be that good, but for the rest of us it's a memory in the making.. . Food - B+. Ambience - B+. Service - C. Value - B
