Restaurant: Delicatessen
Category: American (New)
Delicatessen is like Cafeteria's fraternal twin sister.  They come from the same womb but they don't look alike.  . . The reason I will come back here and not go to a cheaper version for classic comfort food is the Cheeseburger Springrolls.   Cheeseburger whatnow? These appetizers are not messing around. . . When I saw them on the menu I was all like, "Eww that must be disgusting." Then someone at my table ordered them and before I knew what they were I was munching happily and wishing there were more.  All I know is they are greasy and cheesy w/ warm bits of meat.  Kind of like a fancy hot pocket.
