Does anyone go to Joy Yee's for the noodles? I mean, aren't you vaguely distracted by...oh I don't know, the ENORMOUS wall of fruit? And the separate bubble tea menu that could rival a dictionary in size? Frankly, on my first visit to Joy Yee, I was so bewildered by the choices, flavors, and accompanying technicolor photographs that I didn't know where to start. The friendly waiter didn't make things any easier by asking which of the three types of tapioca pearls I wanted in my drink. Initial speed bumps aside, this place rocks! Get yourself over here for some of the best bubble tea ever. Not that i have much of a frame of reference myself, but I have a good instinct about these things.
