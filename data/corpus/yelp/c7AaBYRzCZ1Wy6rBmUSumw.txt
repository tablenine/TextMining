This review is based on the two times I've been here.. . The first time I came here, it was on a whim.  I was looking for a place to eat after a movie at the Mann and was in the mood for something Thai... and something new.  As soon as I saw Thai Elvis karaoke-ing in all his glory, I knew I found the perfect place for me.. . I ordered the deer with green peppercorn and curry sauce, brown rice, and jasmine tea.  I really enjoyed my first eating adventure here.  The flavors were wonderful and it was fun eating something other than green curry for once.  My only regret was not snagging a pic of Thai Elvis for the memories.. . The second time I came here was for a birthday dinner post-UCBT.  This time I ordered the spicy coconut soup, and on that cold night it really hit the spot.  The tastes and the aromas were powerful but not overwhelming.  It was a great finish to a birthday outing.. . The service here is pretty good.  There's convenient valet parking available.  If you don't make reservations, no worries.  The wait is usually short and sweet.. . I'll definitely come here more often when I got that Thai itch that needs to be scratched.
