I really wanted to like this place. As my headline says, "Johnathan Gold es lo maximo" and he recommended this place as one of his 99 restaurants in 2007.   Yelpsters seemed to dig it too, so driving from downtown to eagle rock for a long lunch seemed like a no brainer. . . The old school Oinkster sign outside the place is awesome, the ambiance was a super clean, brightly lit 50's diner style, and the wait staff was really attentive (especially for a pay at the counter burger joint).  Smooth sailing until...... . I took a bite of the highly recommended pulled pork sandwich and it turned out to be just okay- ie TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT considering the pulled pork pedestal that was built on the foundation of my man Johnathan Gold.  The roll was fresh, the caramelized onions were excellent , and the fresh, red cabbage was a nice addition, but the meat was dry and bland.      . . The sauces were okay, but I ended up having to rely upon them to grub on the sandwich.   I dug the Memphis vinegar based BBQ sauce (although a lot of people don't), and the fries were standard at best.  . . I'm giving this joint three stars for decent sandwich mediocrity, but not worth the drive or my high expectations.
