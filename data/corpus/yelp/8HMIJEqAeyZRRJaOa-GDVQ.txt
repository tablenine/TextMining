Came here with Clara K in Jan but haven't reviewed until now.. . She had been wanting to come here for awhile so she handled the reservation. There is not a lot of room inside for people waiting and trying to stay out of the winter chill.. . Despite the reservation, we had to wait about 20 minutes for our table, so we got some drinks at the bar. I had a local beer, a. Pomona Queen amber lager from Upland. It wasn't bad.. . The tables are a bit small but the ambiance is nice and the settings are charming. We started with a caprese salad which was very good. I know it's simple and I can do it at home, but I love caprese salads so I feel compelled to pay for this overpriced dish. Curses. This one had a burrata cheese, which is basically a super soft and creamy mozzarella. Sweet baby jesus that was tasty.. . We split two pizzas, the Fennel sausage and Squash blossom. As Clara pointed out, the crusts were amazingly thin and crisp and tasty. Simply amazing. The squash blossom pizza was very good but it could have had just a little more taste to it. The fennel sausage pizza was almost perfect, tasty and savory. This one is highly recommended!. . I'd definitely come back, but the wait is a bit daunting.
