I would've liked to give 3.5 stars, but rounded up to four because I felt bad about only giving three.  Gorgeous interior and plating, ok food.  We got the fried calamari (yummy!), seafood curry, lamb shank, and seabass.  Everything we ordered, except the calamari, was too sweet, but the atmosphere made up for it.  . . I totally agree that this place is overpriced for Thai cuisine.  The girls and I split the bill and ended up paying about $40 between the three of us.. . Eh, on second thought, 3 stars because I feel jipped dropping $40 on Thai food.
