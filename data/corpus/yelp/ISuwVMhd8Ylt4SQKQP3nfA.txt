Definitely make a reservation, definitely try the gorganzola stuffed gnocchi in the tomato basil cream sauce.  The staff is great and the meals and wine are all really reasonable.  One of our favorite neighborhood spots - but I would travel to get here even if I didn't live close.  I would recommend this for a date or for a group.
