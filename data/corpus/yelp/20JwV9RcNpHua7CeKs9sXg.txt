Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Roscoe's is good but pricey for what it is, which is average fried chicken and decent waffles.  I personally make better corn bread, biscuits and gravy at home.  My mom said they need to work on their grits, not enough flavors she says.  And trust me my mom knows her grits.. . My advice, buy a pack of of beer or a couple bottles of your favorite wine.  Order a bucket of Churches or Popeye's, invite your friends over and enjoy a nice meal at home.
