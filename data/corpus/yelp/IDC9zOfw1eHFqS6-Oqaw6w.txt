First of all, I must tell you.... the cosmos were FANTASTIC! It was very refreshing and crisp. I would just come back for the cosmos.. . Carpaccio, came with a bed of arugula with a lemony dressing- TASTY!. . Pizza, with fontina cheese, carmelized onions, and pancetta, -  YUMMY...was a little salty  though, b/c of the pancetta. Next time I'd order it either w/o pancetta or light on the pancetta.. . Fried Squash Blossoms stuffed with goat cheese- good, but anything deep fried is good.. . Some kind of fried rice ball with meat sauce- not good... would definitely not order that again.. . Overall... will definitely come back. Food was tasty and the wait staff were friendly.
