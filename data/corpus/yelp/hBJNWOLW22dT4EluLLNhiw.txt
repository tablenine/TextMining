Restaurant: The Flying Biscuit
Category: American (Traditional)
I went here for my goodbye ATL brunch. I've been to the Flying Biscuit in Midtown and in Little Five Points area. This was my first dining experience at the Buckhead location.. . We went on a Sunday morning, so given the "BRUNCH" aspect and how ATL responds to brunch, it was busy. The restaurant is not too big, but they had this waiting are outside with coffee brewed for us to drink. The area was really cute. It is in between the Terminus Building and the day there was a nice breeze. I liked how they had the coffee for us to grab ourselves and drink. . . The wait was a typical 30 minutes. Nothing to long since it was Sunday morning. After they seated us, got our drink orders. Everything was fast and in a timely matter. I didn't have any issues with the waitress. She was nice and very cool. . . I ordered the Mexican Burrito. It was a big tortilla with eggs, jalapenos, and onions with a spicy salsa on top. I have gotten this before, so when I sat down I knew this was what I wanted. It was very good. I also ordered potatoes to go alongside the entree. . . The group I was with got various items, one got the breakfast platter (scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes), another got the chicken gravy over biscuit. The biscuit was amazing! I also love the apple butter they have on the side for us to put on.. . Overall this place was like any other "ALL DAY" breakfast restaurant. The service was great and is always great every time I go to a Flying Biscuit location. The food comes out the same way and great every time.. . I wouldn't go here on a regular basis given that I can only eat breakfast food so much at a time in the weekday, but definitely a nice weekend brunch place.. . There was a connecting parking deck that didn't charge us. I'm assuming b/c of weekend, but I'm not too positive on that.
