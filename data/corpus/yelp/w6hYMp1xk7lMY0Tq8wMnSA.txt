I went here a couple of nights ago with a group of friends.. Ya the line was kinda long, but the wait was worth the dog.. . I got the apricot ginger which i personally thought was the best.. But I tasted quite a few and they were all really good.. . The fries WITH truffle oil are a must. But to take it even further next level, get as many dipping sauces as you can. They were all magic in my mouth but the blue cheese walnut bacon sauce holds a special place in my heart.. . The seating area in the back is dark and fun and loud and although we were worried about finding seating for 7, we had no problem at all.. . To make a long meat love story short...Check it out!
