Category: Pizza
Delicious thin crust pizza.. Expect a 20 minute wait. Â We went on a Thursday night around 8pm.... It was nice that they called to let us know when our table was ready so that we could enjoy some tasty beverages at the Chalet in the meantime.. . We were warned by the bartender to avoid the mushrooms.........they use CANNED.. . Garlic bread, a medium cheese pizza, caprese salad, and a carafe of chianti.... I'll definitely be back.
