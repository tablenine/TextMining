Restaurant: Pizzeria Mozza
Category: Pizza
The pizza here was great.  Fennel sausage, panna, red onion &amp; scallions. Really really good pizza. But your breath will reek.  A little greasy.. Tricolore with Parmigiano Reggiano &amp; anchovy dressing - A really bitter tasting salad.. Meatballs al forno. Pretty good. A little spicy. If you are okay with something heavier, we didn't order it but the Mozza caprese and garlic bread looked delicious.  The people next to us had it and it looked delicious.. And we had the ice cream with fresh fruit and granola for dessert. Pretty good but I wish it was colder.
