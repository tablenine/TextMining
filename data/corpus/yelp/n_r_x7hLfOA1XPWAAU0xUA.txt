Wonderful!  Love the Papa's Portobello with Steamin' Kale.  A nice, meaty portobello with a tasty pesto, caramelized onions, lettuce, and red onions on a wheat bun.  The kale is great too--steamed enough to be tender without being mushy, and covered with a delicious and slightly tangy ginger/sesame/miso sauce.  The pumpkin cheesecake is amazing too--immensely satisfying, but doesn't leave you feeling heavy.  I shared a piece of cheesecake with my coworkers, and they were fighting over it!  I wasn't as impressed (on my second visit) by the Baja Fiesta as I was with the Papa's Portobello (on my first visit), but then again, the Baja Fiesta had a pretty tough act to follow.  Place gets packed by noon on weekdays with local workers, so come a little early if you can.  Even the carnivorous folk love the place.  Delicious...!  A place I can go to get great food that's also relatively guilt-free.
