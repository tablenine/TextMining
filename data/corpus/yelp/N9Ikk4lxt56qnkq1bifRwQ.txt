Great seafood at The Water Grill.  Their white chowder with manila clam is delicious.  I got seabass and my friend got the lobster and we both enjoyed the food very much.  We also got crabcake for appetizer.  It was nicely seasoned and meaty.  Service was wonderful and their dessert was great too.  Nice special occasion restaurant.
