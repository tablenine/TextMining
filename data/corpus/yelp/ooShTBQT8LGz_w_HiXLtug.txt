Phenomenal, phenomenal coffee.  I'm not a tremendous snob (meaning that I don't grind my own coffee and couldn't tell you which coffee was a Sumatra or an Arabica in a blind test), but I do know this: I've seen places make mochas by pouring Nestle Quik into the cup, and I can sure as hell taste that kind of a difference.. . So while I typically stick to flavored fare like Mochas and Vanilla Lattes, LA Mill is the best I've ever had.  . . Three things keep this place from five stars:. . 1) Pricey coffee.  I *am* willing to spend $12 for two cups of heaven, but it's a part of heaven I don't access very often.  It's a destination, not a "grab 'n go" kind of coffee place.. . 2) Pricey food.  It would be nice to have more "snack" type alternatives than $16+ meals.  Much of the time, and glancing around the tables, it doesn't seem like there are a lot of people going for these big-ticket meals, so it would seem like I'm not the only one who gets a bit of sticker shock when I want a lunchy kind of thing. . . 3) Mom jeans.  Seriously, the high-waisted jeans that this place makes these girls wear just makes me feel bad for everyone involved.  I know part of the Silverlake / hipster aesthetic is the whole "I know I look ridiculous, because that's the look I was intentionally going for" vibe, but I hate that style of jeans so much that if I was the President I would make an executive order banning them all from sale or importation.  So clearly, I think about this a lot when I sit down with my cup of coffee.
