This is definitely a 5-star restaurant. Service was impeccable &amp; the decor is simple, cozy, elegant. The only thing that would have made my dinner better was if I hadn't burned my tongue on the amuse bouche! :(. . The menu is 4 course prix-fixe, and you get all kinds of gifts from the chef between courses. The amuse bouche that night was a little pastry with cheese on the inside - I was warned it was hot, straight from the oven, but I was so excited I just went for it...and burned my tongue. The courses I had were crab fritter, scallops &amp; pork belly, pecorino romano &amp; argula, and apple pie. Every course was superb. Their menu changes with the seasons so I wouldn't expect to have these same 4 courses again. And, after our last course - dessert, we had one last gift from the chef - cookies! I was so full by the time we left, but it really is a great experience, the food is so amazing.
