Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
One of my favorites. I consider this place a treat to go to. The bartenders and servers are so nice you could swear they are just a buddy tending the bar. The food is always top notch.. . Best things about smoke daddy:. . -Pulled pork sandwich. -Rib tips. -vegetable of the day. -corn bread. -coleslaw. . I go about once a week - wish I could go more.
