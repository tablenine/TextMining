Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Yeah, all you debbie downers- stop drinking the Tito's hater-ade!! Tito's is the best. It is the only Taco I ever crave, and let me tell you I crave it often. . . Yes, the lines are long, but they usually move pretty fast, and the food is DEFINITELY worth it. Yes, the menu is not especially extensive, but what they DO make is fantastic, so what more do you want? The Salsa is my ALL TIME FAVORITE. . . To all you Tito's virgins...you have to try it. You'll love it, I promise.
