The place is gorgeous!  . The waitstaff is always friendly and attentive.  . $4 guinness?  YES!!  . One of the best burgers I have ever had (and I've had a LOT). The curry chips rocked my world!. The shepards pie is amazing.. . You get the picture....:)  . Fantastic place that has yet to disappoint.  GO!!
