If you can't tell by all the photos people have uploaded here, this is a true Atlanta landmark. My husband and I finally tried it (so many BBQ joints, so little time) last weekend and were not disappointed. We had heard the Que Wraps were good - and thought, BBQ in an eggroll? No way. YES WAY, these taste as natural together as peanut butter and jelly. They should package these and sell them at Kroger!. We both had the pulled pork plates - with Texas Toast, of course. Good flavor, some fat (hence, the four stars...I'm pretty picky about that). Sauces were nice, although the hot wasn't too hot. I had a hard time telling the difference. The Mac and Cheese rocked, a solid potluck/church picnic contender.. Only one high chair, so be prepared for that if bringing a little one.. And, of course, great service. . Will definitely be going back.
