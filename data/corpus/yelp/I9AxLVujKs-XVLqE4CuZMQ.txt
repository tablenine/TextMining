FOOD IS SO EXPENSIVE HERE, but I'm sure it's because of the location and not because the business wants to screw you over.. . ... . ... . .. right?. . I went clubbing here a few weeks ago. I've been meaning to Yelp about it, but I couldn't find the energy to do so (probably because it didn't have anything special that I NEEDED to write about.) This place is gorgeous and it's really fun as a club. I saw Paula Abdul here and a few other celebrities who I did not recognize. Nonetheless, I was still fired up and excited to be there along the infamous Hollywood Blvd amongst the stars! . . But even with my heightened energy boost as a yelp-review advantage from being star-struck, I only had an 'okay' time at Geisha House. Aside from the place being cutesy in Japanese theme and being on Hollyhood Blvd, I didn't feel like the facility had much to offer. It was so (and I hate to sound rude) mediocre.. . The bar is great, though. Great bartender, good drinks, and usual prices. Though I don't want to encourage anyone to go or influence anyone into thinking "they HAVE to go," it truly is a nice place and I do intend to come back.. . But only for drinks.
