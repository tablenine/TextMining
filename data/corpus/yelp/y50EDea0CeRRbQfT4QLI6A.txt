i loved this place!  . . first of all, i really liked the atmosphere.  that part of town has really built up.  the clientele was very "LA-art-hipstery" and it had that kind of rough, modern, rudimentary look inside to match.  . . food:. . i had the Austin sausage (dont remember the full name) but it had pork and three peppers in it.  it was very tasty.  the outside was blackened the way i like it, and the inside was moist, sweet and peppery all at the same time.  had carmalized onions and sweet peppers on top which were perfectly cooked.  dont remember the bun but it was adequate.. . also had the Belgian Frites.  They were great!  the had some sort of seasoning on them which i am often opposed to, but the seasoning just seemed to turn this potatoes into little crack sticks that i just could not stop eating.  the dipping sauces on the side didnt help, either.  the one i really loved was the blue cheese and walnut dip.  it went so well with the fries.  but the chipotle aioli was also very good.. . Beer:  i so dont remember (like usual) what i had to drink.  it was recommended by the bartender though.  all i know is that it was german and had a crisp, fruity taste.. . recommended.
