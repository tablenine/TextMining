I don't get it...This place has average sushi and a long wait.  We were seated at a table in the middle of two busy aisles and had slow unenthusiastic service.  At Streeterville location, there was a staple in the food and they did nothing for us.  I am talking about a piece of freaking metal in the food!!!!!  They are 0/2 at two locations thusfar...
