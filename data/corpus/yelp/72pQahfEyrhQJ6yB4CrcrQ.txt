Great sushi joint.  Small place and there usually is a wait, but it goes pretty fast.  If you don't want to wait, the sushi bar usually has seats open but a minimum of 4 orders and no lunch specials can be ordered.  . . The kampachi(sp?) fish head with appetizer sashimi lunch special ($15).  The fish has lots of fatty meat goodness that melts in your mouth.  . . Service is good and fast.  The only bad thing is that you have to pay $1.50 for parking even after validation.
