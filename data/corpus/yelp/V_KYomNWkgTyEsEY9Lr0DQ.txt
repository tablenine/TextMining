So I was a bit hesitant because of all re hype for this place, but I must say! Their food blew me away! The night staryed off slow.. Appetizer (rissoto balls) were not very good.. But man!! Their trenne pasta... seriously was fantastic! Every bite was like a piece of heaven!. . The clam pizza was good too.. But not as good as the trenne pasta. You have to try this!
