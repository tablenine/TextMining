Restaurant: Philippe The Original Restaurant
Category: Sandwiches
It's pretty easy to please a stomach like mine, especially after I've played a three day volleyball tournament. Philippe's definitely hit the spot after a crazy weekend of sun, shouting, and volleyball on asphalt. Luckily for me, friends waited in the reeediculous line for us and ordered a smorgasboard of things for us to try. My top picks were the original french dip (which oddly enough did not come with any dip, nor was extra dip provided) and the chili. Though my friends ordered quite a bit of food, I felt like they didn't even tap the surface of the all encompassing menu. There were so many items whether it was sandwich, side, or dessert, that now I am very obligated to come back and try even more of Philippe's offerings.
