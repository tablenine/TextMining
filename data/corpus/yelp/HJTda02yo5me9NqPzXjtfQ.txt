Devon is a staple in my Happy Hour routine. It's right down the street from the office and we gather here quite often for "scampi and 'tinis." The Happy Hour menu contains some great deals on shrimp scampi, calamari, mussels, crab legs, and even lobster. I'm not always a big fan of the "Martini of the Day" selection, but they have plenty other options for you to drink.. . The staff is always very friendly and attentive. It's a great place to just hang out and relax b/c it's cool without being pretentious...Which is super important!. . P.S. Make sure to get the biscuits while you're there!. .
