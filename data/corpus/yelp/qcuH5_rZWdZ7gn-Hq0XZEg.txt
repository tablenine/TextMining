There was no line when I saw them across the street from the Yogurtland-Miracle Mile. Short rib tacos are pretty good. If you were one of the people that waited 2.5 hours for Kogi when they started, you better check your sanity. No food is that good to wait in line for that long, especially tacos that come from a truck.
