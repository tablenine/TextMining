We arrived a little early before our reservations but ended up waiting one hour total just to be seated. I had to go back to the hostess to "remind" her that we were here and had 8:30 reservations. I walked up to her after I saw another party get seated before us, but we were there BEFORE them?? . . The worst part was that we were sitting at our table for 15 minutes without anyone coming to greet us, give us water and we had no idea who our server was. The waitress (tall blonde w/long curly hair working upstairs) was supposed to be our server, but didn't bother acknowledging us at all. She was rude and we had to get another guy, James, to serve us!?! Maybe bc we weren't a table full of guys where she could milk a fat tip out of us?. . The quality of the sushi was really good but the side of rice was a little on the mushy side. GOOD food, CRAPPY service. Parking is bad since it's on Hollywood Blvd. Disappointed there were no Geisha pic opportunities, especially on New Years Eve???!
