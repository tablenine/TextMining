My mother wanted to take me out for dinner for my birthday and I had always wanted to try this place (seems like everyone I know had been except me).. . I liked the decor - it was very unique.  It reminded me of going on a ride at Disneyland.  There were stars painted on the ceilings and our table was enclosed by tapestries, as were the other tables.. . I love garlic so I thoroughly enjoyed it!  We had the tub of garlic (don't remember the italian name of the top of my head) with the bread as an appetizer.  It comes as a pan full of butter and olive oil with roasted garlic cloves soaking in it - we were spreading 3 cloves at a time on the bread.  They also provide a pesto with raw minced garlic in it for spreading on the bread.. . My mother and I both had the Gnocchietti.  It was very good, although from the description I was expecting a lighter sauce than the heavy cream sauce that it came with.  Still, it was tasty.. . My husban had the pork chop which he said was decent, but didn't stand out.  He wouldn't shut up about how good the mashed potatoes were, though.  My mother's date had the 40 clove garlic chicken.  Both my husband and mother tried it and noted that they liked his dish the best.. . The 4 of us split some of the garlic ice cream.  My reaction was the same that I have for Circus Peanuts: "This is disgusting and weird.........why can't I stop eating it?". . Service was excellent - may be at least partly because we were there on a Monday an the place was sparse.
