You can't call yourself a Chicagoan and skip Gibson's. This is a review for the bar area only, as I haven't dined here in probably 20 years. My SevenStar companion and I wandered in here for a cocktail the other day, which was fun 'cos I get regaled with tales of his bad behavior . . . in the past. ;-). . Yeah, it's the Viagra Triangle. But . . . that crowd does know quality, and good bartenders. The bartenders here are the real deal, very friendly and great at their job. Martinis are icy and beautifully crafted. Mmm! This is a REAL oldskool bar for oldskool people . . . and the place has always been great for people watching.. . The lobster and artichoke appetizer was tasty. I don't know why, but I would have preferred that it be a hot appetizer. At any rate, I happily noshed on it, 'cos hello . . . lobster? Are you going to turn that down? I'm not that kind of girl, I'll always enjoy me some lobster!
