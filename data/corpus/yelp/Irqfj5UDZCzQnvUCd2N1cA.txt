Restaurant: The Earl
Category: Dive Bars
If The Earl were a non-smoking establishment, I would give it five stars. The sound is great; the lighting, muted and warm; the bar service, fast; and the bathrooms, ne'er crowded and consistently clean. I most recently caught Noot d' Noot headline at this East Atlanta dive, excitement built with performances by The Selmanaires and one of Mathis Hunter's jam band side projects. During the three performances, I moved to different spots in the room, all offering quality sight and sound. Surprisingly, I got a little cold beneath the fervently spinning fans. . . I always leave The Earl with ringing ears and a smoky stench.
