This place is impressive!  Tight at times to get around (bathroom, bar) , but the food is great and the service was top notch.  They undercooked my filet, brought out a whole new one and didn't charge for it.  Very unexpected, but it was a large bill so I know it was a small compensation for the amount, but almost unheard of anymore to do something like that.  Hugo Frog's is the same kitchen attached so if you can't get into Gibson's just eat there for the same food and same great atmosphere.  Probably the best cuts of meat around if you like steak!  Make a reservation or you might not get in until later in the evening.
