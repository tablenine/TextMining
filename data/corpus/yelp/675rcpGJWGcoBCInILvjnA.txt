My kind of spot. A fresh hearty salad is all I need to help me keep my mind off heavy american portioned pasta which is exactly what I was craving during my time of the month. . It kinda reminded me of Pluto's in the bay area minus the huffy and puffiness of the workers rushing you to choose your salad toppings which in this case the salads toppings are already chosen for you depending on the type of salad you're ordering. I had ordered the Oxnard Vegetables on a hot plate with the baby spinach salad. Basically the only carb-ey item was the mashed potatoes on the side which I shared with two others. . Staying the weekend in a house w/out a functioning AC in this HOT LA weather, you just gotta enjoy the evening outdoor seating.
