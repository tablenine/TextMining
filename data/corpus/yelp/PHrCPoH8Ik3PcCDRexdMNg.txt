Restaurant: Hakata Ramen Shin-Sen-Gumi
Category: Japanese
Sometimes, culinary inspirations hit you at the most inopportune times.. Like during a meeting when someone pulls out their yakisoba and all you can do is try to re-focus your attention on the topic at hand. sigh!! I hate when that happens =(. . Sometime in that meeting, I made up my mind that I must have some spicy ramen that very night. Thankfully, Hakata Ramen was open until 11PM!. . The wait to get into this small ramen-ary (no, that's not a word), was approximately 1/2hr - enough time for my tummy to throw a fit and demand it be fed (it was already 10:00PM when we got there). I quelled it by saying...soon my dear...soon!. . We ordered 2 Hakata Ramen bowls. . These bowls are customizable:  . -ramen noodle firmness. -heaviness of the soup base. -saltiness and. - extra condiments (extra noodles, pork, egg, pickled  veggies, seaweed etc etc). . . About $7-$8/ bowl. You can also order half bowls for $5.. . The ramen noodles were excellent (much thinner than the ones we had in Japan) and the broth was very good too. . . Our waitress forgot that we ordered an extra helping of noodle but that was no big deal. Overall service was pleasant and I guess the wait wasn't so bad. :). . ** advice? It's a bit risky, but go like... 15-20 minutes before closing time if you plan on a late dinner - it seemed that most people cleared out by then and you wouldn't have to wait in line.
