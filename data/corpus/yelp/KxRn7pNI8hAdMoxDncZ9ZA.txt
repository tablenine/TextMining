One of the best sushi places I've been to! My best friend took me here for my bday and we ate about 100 dollars worth of food. We ordered the sushi deluxe (good, but still room in our stomach for more, and the cucumber roll almost killed us with the shocking amout of wasabi in it) and the giant clams (soooo gooooooooooodddd), and then we were still hungry so we ordered the sashimi delux ($30). Next time we go there, we will just order the sashimi delux. It was huge, filling, and the fish was so buttery. My friend tried to make me eat the snail-like thing and I tried it for the first time in my life. Not bad... I liked that they gave a lot of tuna cuz...that's mostly what I eat (yes, i'm a sushi neophyte). we ordered the plum wine, which was HEAVENLY. the Tuna with shredded yam was weird. I was thinking that the yam was going to be cooked but it was sticky and raw... not used to that. . . We also got the yellowtail collar, which melted in your mouth. I want to try the salmon collar next time. . Mmmm. so good..
