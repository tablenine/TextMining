If I were a true sweets person, I would probably appreciate this place more.  However, even though I'm not, I know how people can really like this place.. . Almost closing time on a Saturday night and the place still had a line out the door.  Luckily, we just wanted an after dinner bite or two of sweets so it worked out perfectly for us.. . I will say, the blue velvet cake was good!!!  Get it... no really, get it!!!  My friend also got one of their ice cream sandwiches (forgot the flavor) which was pretty tasty as well and I got the peanut butter brownie which tasted more like peanut butter fudge it was so heavy.  Overall, good place.... . They get a star ding since we did get there a little late and right at 11, they kept coming by and say, we're closing... we're closing.
