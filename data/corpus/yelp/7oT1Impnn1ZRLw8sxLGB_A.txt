Sweating profusely? Severe stomach pains? Persistent vomiting? Don't worry, you don't have swine flu. You probably just dined at Flash Taco last night. You'll be ok, just don't ever, ever make that mistake again. I know you're plastered and "sooooo hungry," but no no no. No. Just trust me on this one.
