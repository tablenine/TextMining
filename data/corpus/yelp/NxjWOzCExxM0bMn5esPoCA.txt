I went to Taste and partook of their Dine LA menu.  I ordered the white truffle mushroom mac n' cheese, kobe meatballs with linguini, and a pear tart.  The mac n' cheese was served hot, with the perfect blend of cheese and a crusty top.  It was definitely one of the best I've ever had.  The kobe meat balls were giant and flavorful  The raisins inside didn't detract from the dish.  The pear tart was ok, and came out cold.  It would have been much better served hot.  Well cocktails were cheap and stiff. . . Overall, I liked everything I ordered except for the pear tart.  My friend orderd the shrimp cocktail, salmon with cous cous, and bread pudding.  I got a taste of his dishes and though the shrimp cocktail was good.  The salmon was fine, but the cous cous was odd.  For some reason, it was kind of gummy and sweet from the dried fruits that were mixed in.  Needless to say, my friend did not finish the cous cous.  The bread pudding, on the otherhand, was amazing.  It was served warm, oozing with delicious chocolate, and paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.. . With the yummy food and cheap booze, I'll definitely be coming back to Taste.
