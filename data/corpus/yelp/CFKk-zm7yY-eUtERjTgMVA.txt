Made my second visit before heading to the Clipper game.  There was a nice crowd eventhough it was faily early, 5ish.  Awsome service and unbelievable food.  For the 5 of us, we had the $79 combo meal.  It was just enough for 3 guys and 2 women.  With 3 bottles of beers, the total with tip was only $25pp.  We left there content and trying to figure out the next time we will be back.  Thanks Alyssa!!
