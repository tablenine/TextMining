The food is great, service impeccable, the price over the top. The Price is not why I gave this restaurant just an OK review. . . Last time I went there was a group of Cougars from what seemed like Agoura. Not only did the Cougars make themselves painfully apparent with the outlandish clothes they were draping the silicone with, but they were also very loud and made the dining experience unpleasant. After there loud voices simmered down they started to walk around the restaurant and sit with the men that were single. For a five star restaurant I wanted the staff to say something to them to get them simmered down. . . The place has peaked out with decadence and the price in no way reflected the atmosphere the Cougars pushed on the restaurant. I was so distracted by the constant noise and brightly dressed cosmetic surgery nightmares I could hardly taste my food.
