Came here on a recommendation from a friend. Great place to check out. Service was awesome, food was good too although I ordered the wrong thing by accident. I was supposed to get the skirt steak. I just saw steak and ordered some rice dish instead. I was wondering why they didn't ask me how I wanted my steak cooked.. . If you get the sangeria, stick with the red wine. The white wine is $9 bucks more, totally not worth it unless you really can tell the difference besides looking at the color hah.. . The only thing that kinda sucks is that when you sit in the patio, the tables are really close together, you can totally hear everyting being said at the next table. I had to be careful with what I said cause I didn't want to offend anyone. . . fyi. For you pervs out there, I think theres a really hot waitress that works at the Lala's in Studio City. I've been told this by many many people. Why I didn't go there I have no idea. Doh !
