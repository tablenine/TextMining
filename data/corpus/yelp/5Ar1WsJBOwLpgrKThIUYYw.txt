The first thing that came to mind when coming here was, "oooOOOOooo! FANCY BURGER JOINT!'' . . I came here on a rainy romantic date with my 'boy toy', and upon ordering, i notice that sides aren't included with the burger. I thought; "CHEAP ASSES!!!!" Lucky for them i wasn't that hungry so i only order the onion rings. My Boy toy orders the Portabello burger and he wanted to substitute some of the items for veggies, the waiter said; "Sorry at this time we aren't allowing substitutions''. . . WTF?? WHY NOT??? IF A BURGER COST $10 BUCKS... THROW SOME GOLD IN THERE! its the least they could do. . . So we order fries, onion rings, and the burger. Once we get the food i wonder, why the hell it shrunk in the process. I tried the onion rings, and the batter that they use is good but i feel it retains too much grease. (YES, I DO UNDERSTAND ITS DEEP FRIED) but still. I had a bite of the burger and it was really yummy, but really greasy. At the end of the night my tummy was all gassy from too much grease, NO BUENO! :( . . I liked the food, but... it wasn't filling and it wasn't great. For $20 bucks... we didn't walk out full, because apparently they only give you 5 onion rings in 1 order! Yes, i know I'm a fatty :(
