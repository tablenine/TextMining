Restaurant: Tito&#39;s Tacos
Category: Mexican
Absolutely NO STARS!!!! Sadly to say my friend and I were very dissappointed in the food...we saw that there were tons of people at Tito's Tacos and thought hmmm... maybe this place is poppin. so we check it out and ask a local what we should order and he said the burritos and tacos were the best.  the price was decent but the food tasted nasty...im not sure why there was a crowd outside just for the food here.  the meat was too mushy and poo looking and the taste was similar to leftover stew that was sitting in the frige for a few weeks (trust me that doesn't taste good)! So dont be fooled by the crowd when you pass by Titos Tacos, because its surely not authentic.
