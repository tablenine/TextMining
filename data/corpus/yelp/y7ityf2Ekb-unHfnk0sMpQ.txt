What a great little place. . . Bone marrow with oxtail ragu was good but very heavy.  I like the one at Pizzeria Mozza a lot better.  . . The rack of lamb was cooked perfectly and loved the mustard spaetzle and brussel sprouts.  My friend had the beef bourguignon with creamy pureed potatoes. . . It was a solid dinner but no real ooh and ahh moments.  Will definitely go back for the burger and maybe some "lighter" choices :)
