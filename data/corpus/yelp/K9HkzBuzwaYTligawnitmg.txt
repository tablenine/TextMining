Restaurant: Crust
Category: Pizza
UPDATE 7/22:. Stopped by Crust a few weeks ago (they were only place that had tables available for my friend and our dogs) and was sorely disappointed. Gone are the unique family-farm-grown ingredients, gone is the flavor spectrum, gone is my desire to go back and try it again - which is unfortunate because I'd rather support organic and local ingredient-using restaurants. But a few weeks later and I'm still feeling sore each time I bike by with a tsk, tsk mutter under my breath. Â I've been told that they've gone through a handful of Kitchen Manager's and that may have done more damage than they'd planned, so I am opting for lenience and chalking it up to the possibility that maybe that was an off night. Just not sure if I want to take my chances again anytime soon. . . Okay service, yummy food, good selection of beers, good for you and not so bad on your wallet. Some may complain about the premium you pay for organic, but if organic is important to you then you'll appreciate the options. I've been a couple of times and each time ordered something different - from the spinach/shroom/goatcheese pizza to the El Greco to the sweet basil salad - and each time I enjoyed every last bite (although part of me thinks I could do just as well making pizza at home). . . Dinners fill up fast so you may want to head over early, or prepare to wait 30-45 minutes for a table - they do have a bar to keep the libations flowing while you wait.
