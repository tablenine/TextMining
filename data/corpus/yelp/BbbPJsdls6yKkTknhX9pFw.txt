More hype than good food.. . I ordered the sausage pizza and chopped salad and I thought it was good, but mediocre.   I think the decor and overall hype of the venue was more dazzling than the thing I came for - the food.  . . If you are deciding on a place for a date, don't pick this place because it is extremely noisy.  The interior decor of the venue is wall-to-wall marble with marble floors.  Yeah, the restaurant is visually pleasing because it has a spatial floor plan, but conversations bounce off every wall. . . Would I go again?  Yes, I think I would every once in a while.
