I had a great experience at FLIP Burger.  Prepare to wait over an hour most night for seating.  I recommend sitting at the bar and dining.  Try grabbing a seat close to the kitchen, that's where all the action happens.. . You get a perfect view of how they make their crazy milkshake concoctions.  I ordered the Krispy Kreme Milkshake. They throw in a whole glazed doughnut into the blender then top it off with nitrous oxide for FX... Fun!!!. . I couldn't make up my mind on which burger I wanted so I had TWO.  I tried the Southern and the Butcher Cut Burgers. Sweet potato tots and the vodka battered onion rings rounded out the meal.. . Everything was quite tasty.  I did prefer the Southern over the Butcher Cut.  I think it was the country fried patty that won me over.. . The design of the place is fresh and new.  The bar is too close to the main dining area for my liking. I noticed seated customers constantly scooting their chairs in to make way for waiting customers inching towards the bar for a drink. . . One day I shall return and try out their exquisite $45 gourmet Kobe Burger topped with Foie Gras.. . Reminder: Flip is NOT open on Sundays. I learned the hard way.
