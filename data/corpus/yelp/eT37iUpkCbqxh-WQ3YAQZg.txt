Restaurant: The Stinking Rose
Category: Italian
I knew the reviews were bad (~16 for food in the Zagat), and I knew I'd be disappointed, but I couldn't resist going anyway. A garlic themed restaurant? What's NOT to love?. . Apparently, the food.. . I lost my appetite right after the first bite. We got the GARLIC SOAKING IN A HOT TUB (Garlic cloves, oven-roasted in extra virgin olive oil &amp; butter with a hint of anchovy. A wonderful treat for spreading on our house-baked focaccia bread. Served at your table in an iron skillet), which was mediocre but bearable. The famous 40 Clove Garlic Chicken is nowhere near as flavorful or tender as my husband's (and I can get you dozens and dozens of people who will attest to that), everything else was forgettable. Applebees/"neighborhood grill" quality.. . I knew not to expect much, but I wanted to try it once anyway, just because we love garlic that much. Nope, bad idea. Not even worth that one time for the uniqueness of it :(
