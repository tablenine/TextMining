But I would walk 500 miles. And I would walk 500 more. Just to be the man who walked 1000 miles. To fall down at your door. . So this place has been on my list of to do's in NYC for a while.. . Friday as I was riding the bus up from DC I got the twitter: "Sorry kids were are in NJ serving making hundres of kids at camp happy with our waffles".   OH! NO! I prayed they would be back in NYC the next day, as I was leaving Sunday.. . Saturday Morning Twitter " We are in Brooklyn @ 7th Ave and Carroll. Sing a MJ song and get a second topping free!"  . . Okay....time to explore whatever is in that area just so I can eat a waffle.  So I dragged my cousin and her friend from Queens to Park Slope for the waffles.. . We get to the truck, finally!  I ordered the Liege waffle--the guy asked what topping I wanted, and I said none.  He looked at me curiously.  I guess I was anti-topping because when I lived in Holland the waffles were sans topping often, and that is how I liked them.  Anyway, I gave in and had butter. num num num.  Delicious.. . So I went back to the cart (because I figure all the walking made the first waffle calorie neutral), this time Eddie was at the helm.  He asked what I was up to and I had to admit that I had spent most of my day getting to him---and it was totally worth it.  Took me back to my study abroad days. . . So I asked Eddie what speculoos was, one of the toppings options---and he gave me a sample.  You know those Biscoff cookies you get on the plane sometimes?  We this is a sauce that tastes just like that  (maybe because it comes from a jar called Biscoff sauce, haha).  It tasted delicious---.. . Anyway, follow them on twitter, and when you find them enjoy.
