Restaurant: Social
Category: Wine Bars
Subdued, refined bistro in the heart of downtown.  Social has a well priced wine list, with many half-bottle carafe choices.  The charcuterie plate was solid but unassuming. Our entrees - lamb tanjine, vegetable tanjine, and vegetable lasagna were all excellent. Especially noteworthy was the delicious falling off the bone texture of the lamb and the bright, light flavors of preserved lemons in the vegetable tangine.  . . Our waiter was great but pulled in too many directions, which left huge gaps of time in the service.  Other than that, I would highly recommend Social.
