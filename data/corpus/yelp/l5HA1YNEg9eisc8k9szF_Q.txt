Restaurant: R Thomas Deluxe Grill
Category: American (New)
So I was pretty drunk the one and only time I came here (because apparently this is where people go when they're drunk as mentioned by the previous reviews) but I still remember the portions being VERY small and the prices VERY high...the food wasn't life changing or anything but the ambiance was fun.  I haven't been back in years b/c I just didn't feel like it was a good value.  I mean I can understand small portions if they're to die for but R. Thomas?  Not so much...I wanted to love it SO MUCH, too, because of the ecclectic decor and the 1,000 birds in cages outside the door.  It just wasn't what I hoped for...
