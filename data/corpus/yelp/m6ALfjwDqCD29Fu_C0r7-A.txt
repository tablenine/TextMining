Category: Pizza
Service of oppression should be the tag line for this restaurant.  Lots of really busy waiters running around and doing nothing at all.  That is until you are seated and they hover over you like vultures.. . The decor is beautiful and they must of dropped a lot of money in this area but the high ceilings and marble floors lead to a VERY LOUD RESTAURANT the requires you to SHOUT AT THE PEOPLE at your table.. . Food was decent but the pizza we ordered was burnt underneath which added a very unpalatable bitter flavor.  Speaking about the pizza, the dough was way too freaking salty.. . The Pasta Figole is a bit on the bland side and lacks body and mouth feel.  The French Lentils are "meh" as was the shaved fennel.. . Overall a beautiful location but a  decent experience.  They really need to work on the food and service.
