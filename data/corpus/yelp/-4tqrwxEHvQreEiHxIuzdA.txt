Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
This place will probably have a lot of different opinions because I can see how some people will love it while others will hate it.  . . This Boiling Crab is the kind of restaurant where you sit down and they wrap a bib around your neck and you order seafood by the pound.  The table itself is covered with a piece of plastic and no utensils are provided by default.  It's messy.  It's dirty.  It's gross.  It's how I'd love it if I could choose.... . ...and yet, it's not that great.  The reason is because their seafood isn't that fresh.  If you are the type of person who lives for freshness - i.e. likes to see the creatures swimming beforehand and boiled alive - I do not think this is the place for you.  Maybe it's because they drown it in the sauces (an insane amount of oil).  I'm not sure but I don't think their seafood was that fresh.  . . I dld enjoy my meal.  My hands got completely greased over but I found myself licking them clean since that garlic butter is amazingly good.  I guess the problem comes when you start expecting too much.  . . If you're a simple person who just wants some seafood served to you in a plastic bag and left alone to unleash yourself on it, then go right ahead.  Pretentious food connoisseurs will probably want to stay away...
