Restaurant: Geisha House
Category: Sushi Bars
Geisha House seems a little intimidating at first with its all black face on the primo Hollywood Boulevard, but once you step in through it's doors it is truly an amazing experience.. . I came here last night with a few friends and we were seated promptly upon arrival upstairs, as we had a reservation. The service, off the bat, was PHENOMENAL! We were seated in a cute booth (Across from the band 30 Seconds to Mars) and we immediately dove into cocktails. I ordered a basic cosmopolitan, which was $12. Not too bad, this is Hollywood after all.. . The ambiance of this place made for a gang of small talk and soon after we all doused our cocktails we dove into food. I ordered the Chef's Selection of sushi/sashimi rolls. At $40, I was expecting a very intense dish, and I got just that. Presented in (of all things) an Igloo, the various rolls were perfect to taste and I was treated to a Sake Flight (on the house) to compliment the flavours of each individual roll.. . If you'd like to splurge on a great night in Hollywood with your friends, then definitely come here. If you're economically conscious, then don't. This place will break bank.. . Overall, EXCELLENT time.
