Restaurant: Lola&#39;s
Category: Restaurants
Lola's is such a cool place. I love everything about it. the food, the people and of course the martinis. sooo good. . . Today my favorite has got to be the star fucker, tomorrow...who knows. with so many to choose from I can have a new fave every day. . . your best bet, with the recession and all is to come between 5 and7 30 for happy hour. $
