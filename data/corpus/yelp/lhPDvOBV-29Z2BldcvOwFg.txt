Restaurant: Ugo: An Italian Cafe
Category: Italian
Ugo is a no-no. another sad Culver City business that fails to be anything special. some hostess fat idiot wouldn''t seat us inside or let us pull up a chair, even though there was plenty of room and it was 40 degrees outside. "oh but we'll put the heat lamp right above you." are you kidding me? that's BS. i recommend going to Fraiche as it looked nice and toasty (and crowded) or the Korean place Gyenari across the street. I haven't tried either of these places, but when we finally were seated at the cafe around the corner (dumb hostess' suggestion), I was totally disappointed by the food. i got the mushroom fettucine (bland, tasteless), cold untoasted bread, and wine. the wine was good but that's because Ugo didn't make it. I wouldn't want to go back again.
