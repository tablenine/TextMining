Restaurant: The Water Grill
Category: Seafood
There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said.  The Water Grill has the best seafood in LA (Providence is a close 2nd).  My favorite dishes are the John Dory.  If you are going with people who don't like fish they also have a nice Colorado rach of lamb.  The food is great, the service is excellent and the prices are high.  Its a great place for a special occasion or if you're downtown to see a show at Disney or Dorothy Chandler.
