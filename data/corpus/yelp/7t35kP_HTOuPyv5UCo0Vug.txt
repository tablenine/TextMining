The burgers were incredible.  I split a truffle and pork burger with a friend and both were great.  The truffle burger was slightly better, but that is a matter of mere percentage points.  The large cut fries were also pretty darn tasty.  The burgers are coated with a shine (probably butter) meshing well with the excellent meat patty.. . My only suggestion is that you ask for a little more ketchup with your fries right when you order.   If the place is packed and the server is busy, getting more will be a bit of a struggle.
