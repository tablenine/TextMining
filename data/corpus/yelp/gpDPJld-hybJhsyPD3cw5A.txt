Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Beware, if you come to Pinks with over hyped expectations you may be disappointed as there's really only sooo much you can do with a hotdog.  That said, if you come in with the attitude of just checking it out you probably won't leave disappointed.  . . Yes, there's a line.  And yes, there's not a lot of seats, but if you're coming here you're coming because its a historical place that should be tried.  The hotdogs are very tasty and they've got some really unique flavor combinations, but I'll be honest it wouldn't be my last meal on earth - but I'll be back again before then so no worries ;). . Also as a separate note, who actually orders the cheese burger off this menu????  its pinks for pete sake.
