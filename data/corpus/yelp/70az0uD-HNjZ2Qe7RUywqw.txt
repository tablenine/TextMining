Y'know, I hate to be a party pooper, but as a starving student I am pretty disappointed I wasted my free meal (dad paid!) on this place. I was excited about the fried chicken and grits (swapped out the mashed potatoes), both of which were just OK.  The fried chicken was tender yes, but very much on the peppery, borderline spicy side - causing me to consume extra hydrogen oxide and emptying the glass.. . Anyone who's dined with me a few times realizes just how much I HATE for my water to run out, particularly when I have mildly spicy food that I need to wash down.  This often results in cold food. =(. . Cute place (transformed house), good looking menu (free biscuits and cornbread, both just OK), good atmosphere (lively but not too loud), awesome instant reservations through open table, but since I only get so many free meals (read: parent visits) a year, I doubt I'll be back and chance it again.
