If you could choose between the best sex you've ever had and all the food at Gloria's, I would pick Gloria's....well...right after the best sex. but that's how good it is! . . The Horchatas were definitely home made, because it tasted a whole lot different than any other horchata i've had before.  You can taste the ricey sediments and was strange at first, but after every sip it tasted better and better.  It also really helped subside the very spicy salsa they served with the tortilla chips.. . The pork and cheese papusas were soft and cheesy. i loved the red sauce that came with it, and the coleslaw mixture.  I also got this interesting green corn tamale, which was part of the Salvadorian Plate.  it was like sweet fried cornbread, kinda heavy but also really good. . . I would say be prepared, the papusas are good but heavy. food baby for suree.  I would also recommend the pork Adobada and the Garlic pork chop dish.  The sauces were so flavorful and delicious.. . The service was a little slow, but understandable because it was bumpin on a friday night.  Our server was super friendly and nice, and the other staffers were very courteous as well.
