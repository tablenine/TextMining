So the problem with this place is that it's too good.  If I could I would eat here every day.  Thank God I live in Norcal or else I would be at least 300 lbs.  The chicken is juicy and waffles are fluffy.  If you like organ meat, like I do - get the fried livers.  Be warned though the order of livers is huge.
