The burgers were juicy. I liked the roquefort cheese. The carmelized onions were SUPER salty, I had to scrap them off to eat the burger. And I have sort of an issue with buns that are way bigger than the hamburger itself..boooooooooo. So I give this place a 3.. . It's def a fun place to go with a group of drunk friends for gorging and drinking your last beer, but the food itself is just A-OK.
