I love my ramen almost as much as I love my alcohol. buahaha.. . Anyways, I was in LA one day and my friend took me to this ramen place that she claims to be the BEST ever, so I took her up on that. . . Came here on a rainy day a few months back and I was VERY IMPRESSED. Parking sucks though...street only, it's LA after all. The exterior definitely reminded me of how ramen shops looked like back in Japan, but the inside is A LOT bigger than most ramen places.. . Even on a random day at around 4ish on a rainy day in LA, this place was PACKED! Good thing there were 2 spots at the bar for my friend and I, my lucky day I guess (except for the fact that my umbrella broke and my suit was drenching wet). But anyways back to the ramen, sat down and was immediately greeted and had our orders taken. I went with the Daikoku ramen ($7.50 I believe) and it was the best choice I have made in a while! The ramen came out swiftly and in a pretty big bowl, I was pleasantly surprised. The soup was soooo flavorful and the ramen, the perfect firmness level. I loved all the sides it came with, bamboo shoots, the egg, bean sprouts, and green onion! I love green onion!. . I would have to say since coming back from Japan, this has to be the best reminder of what Japanese ramen should taste like, and that is saying a lot!. . Food babies allllllllll day, everyday!
