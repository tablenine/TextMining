Restaurant: Kitsch&#39;n On Roscoe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
This place is very different than most other restaurants in Chicago. The menu is cool and interesting (who put jalapenas in my tunafish sandwich?) and the decor is a hoot, not a cozy place but funky and fun.. . They can't decide if they want a retro 70's or retro 80's vibe, but it doesn't matter. Bad 1970's TV shows hum in the background. Kids menu comes in an old lunch box with a goofy discontinued 80's toy. Great:) Â The salads are very sizeable and yummy too. And where else do you get a Tang Martini...if you want one that is?
