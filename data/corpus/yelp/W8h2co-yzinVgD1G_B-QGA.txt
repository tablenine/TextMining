I went here today for lunch at 4 PM.  The atmosphere is pretty busy, and the workers look like they are part of one of those Visa Check Card commercials where everything is operating flawlessly and efficiently.  You know, then somebody pays via cash, the scenery turns black and white, the workers drop dishes and disgruntled expressions span across the faces of everyone in the room.  Well, that somebody was me today!  Except it did not really slow them down.... . Anyways, I digress.  Their prices are very low.  Only .65 for lemonade is a deal.  Their sandwiches are nearly all $5.15 with only a small additional charge to add cheese.  Overall, this is a very good destination for a quick and enjoyable meal.  . . You can also maybe bring your pet hamster or gerbil along to play on their floor of wood shavings.  I am not too sure of this, you may want to check with them first.
