Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
HOLY BBQ!  You won't go wrong at this joint.  An abundance of smoky flavor and perfect seasonings...Try the chicken wings as an app. . . I dove right in with the pulled brisket and pork platter and it delivered!  I might try the pulled chicken next time too.  The Smoke Daddy puts itself at the top of the BBQ class with its side dishes though.. . You name it...Mac 'n Cheese, Smoked Beans, Corn Bread, Cole Slaw...All to die for.   Top that off with a great selection of beers, accommodating and friendly service, not to mention a fun, vibrant atmosphere plopped in the middle happenin' neighborhood and you've got a winner!
