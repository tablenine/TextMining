3 1/2 Stars.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is great and it reminds me of the big Sunday dinners at church when I was little.  It's just a little on the pricey side.  $12 for lunch is just a bit more than I like to pay.  . . The portions are pretty hearty though.  The sides are well done and the chicken rocks.  It is authentic southern food without the nauseating "Suthunuss" of some more well known places.  You know, the type that Japanese tourists go to after visiting the Gone with the Wind Museum.
