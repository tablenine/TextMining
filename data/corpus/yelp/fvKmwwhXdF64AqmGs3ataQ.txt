The French Butcher..... . Now, I have worked with and for some of the better/Offal French Chefs in the region and this left me with some pretty high expectations.. . I know the Bacchanalia guys kick ass and I have met and worked with a few of their key players at various outpost around town.But I left missing the love.. . Charcuterie/ Terrines X everything. Served too cold, lacked salt, and way to much gelatin. My grandma's Neon Green Casserole had more technique and flavor.. . Lamb Kidneys-- meh. Cheese---Frigidaire Flavor. . Haricot Vert and Rabbit Jerky Salad--Simple, Clean, Missed Acid and Salt, but nothing to bad nor good.. . Ribeye and Pork Entrees--pretty delicious, overcooked by 1minute and 37 seconds, boring plating but true to simple flavors.. . Bread was f''''n delicious for me.Atmosphere was very refined Southern/ Classic European which was a very nice touch to the resto.. . Service was half assed but still did the trick. . . They need an Old School French Chef or let the Exc. Chef Daniel take over this piece before the place losses it's luster.. . Dessert................Give me more meat.. . I will be back to update soon.. . 3.3333 Stars. . Chef Invisible--Out
