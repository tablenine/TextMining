Went for dinner on a Friday. Ordered:. - kanoom jeep chau moung (royal thai dumplings): after the beautiful presentation, taste was only okay. - som tom (green papaya salad): some parts of the salad were make-your-voice-two-octaves-lower spicy and other parts quite spice-less. - moo choo chee (pork tenderloin): probably the best-tasting thing we ordered, very tender. - kra pow nuea (beef tenderloin): okay. - green curry: okay. . The taste here is very... safe... non-ethnic... The kind of food you can eat on a first-date and not worry about your breath stinking something bad. . . Really great service and really cool bathroom, I definitely recommend taking a break to check out the restroom :). . Will I go again? Probably not.
