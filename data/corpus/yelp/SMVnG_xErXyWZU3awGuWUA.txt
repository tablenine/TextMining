We came here with the intentions of $1 sliders and $3 beer. After pre-gaming in a local bar in Sunnyside, we head out to the city with the birthday boy for some merriment. . . Their disclaimer for hottest bartender is pretty misleading unless they meant the hottest bartender of the block. No, really. It's pretty packed and I wouldn't advise coming in with more than 6 people. We had 9 and ended up sitting on 2 different tables.. . The $1 sliders are White Castle size, although it's pretty damn tasty. You have to order a minimum of 3 sliders. Waffle fries are fresh and crunch. The buffalo wings are not too shabby too. The table settled for the beer tube ($30). Any beer on the tap. So the food ain't that shabby ... the service is meh. The asked for my credit card and ID to open a tab. Not too much of a fan for an establishment to hold on to two of my most important document.. . Giving this place a 3 star, would have been 2 if the food was not good.
