We were going to go to Ford's for a birthday.  I stopped by to check out the wine list.  The only Champagne was a 375ml bottle of Billecart -Salmon for $50. . . WHAT??  I could not believe it.  Maybe the sommelier does not drink.  That is my only explaination.. . I drank some vodka and tried two appetizers.  I sent one back.  Unpalatable.. . We are done with Ford's.  Sorry.
