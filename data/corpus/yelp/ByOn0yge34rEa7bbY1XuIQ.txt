Restaurant: The Flying Biscuit
Category: American (Traditional)
I had been to the Midtown location and liked its ecclectic feel. The shiny, new terminus building totally takes that away.  The Flying Biscuit lost its quaintness and uniqueness at this location.  If you see my review for the Midtown location, it was a totally different experience. I went with several friends for brunch this time. While we didn't have to wait long, the place was packed. I ordered the trusty pancakes because I knew I'd like them.  That's the reason for star number one.  The oraganic oatmeal pancakes with peaches were yummy.   But they tasted just like soft, fluffy oatmeal cookies - no syrup needed. So I wouldn't put them in the same category as pancakes.  The reason for star number 2: the mimosa. They give you a mini bottle of champange with your OJ, which I thought was nice.  But that's where the positives end.   The namesake, biscuits, weren't good at all. They were doughy and tasted uncooked.  Plus, my friends warned me not to try the jam, so the biscuit kept sticking to the roof of my mouth.  What's a biscuit without jelly?  The "salsa" on the eggs was marinara sauce.  Nobody in the group liked the bloody marys.  It was made with sake instead of vodka. And a spicy okra leaf instead of celery. I would rename it something else, anything but a bloody mary.  I was going to stay for a 2nd mimosa, but the waitress never came back. So we left. We were in a larger group, so we were prettty loud.  The other tables were only parties of 2 or 3, so they were all pretty quiet.  What you can always count on - good looking people being out and about Sunday afternoon in Buckhead.
