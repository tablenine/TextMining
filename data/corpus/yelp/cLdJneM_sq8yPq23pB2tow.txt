A very cute place with a romantic ambiance. My friend and I were seated in the back area, and although the service was kind of slow, our server was friendly and the food was delicious.. . We started off with a Coxinha and Croquete de Camarao to share, and we also had the Manuella's Pasta and Ribeye. Everything was yummy, including the Tiramisu we had to top off the meal. Prices were reasonable too! Apparently they open till 4am, which is amazing for LA.
