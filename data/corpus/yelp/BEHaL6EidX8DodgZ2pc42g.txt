Restaurant: Chabuya Tokyo Noodle Bar
Category: Japanese
My experience at Chabuya only strengthened by desire to visit Asahi Ramen the next time I'm around Sawtelle Road.  We violated Rule #1 concerning ethnic restaurants - always go for the dingy looking, craptastic decor place over the nice, smooth, and sophisticated veneer when you are looking for an authentic experience.  . . While the aesthetics and service almost keep this place from receiving the dreaded one star review, it simply wasn't enough given what happened with the food.  The first thing I placed in my mouth from here was FROZEN.  Definitely not cool.  My friend kept telling me to return it, but I think an angry Yelp review will suffice.  . . I also ordered the Zenbu bowl which basically consisted of pork chasu, boiled egg, green onion, and fried garlic in pork broth.  Something was off concerning the flavor of the broth.  There was almost a chalky consistency to it.  It had a watery aftertaste.  It lacked complexity.  When I lived in Japan, I developed an appreciation for ramen.  This broth was an absolute assault to one of my favorite foods.  In fact, in some ways, it was even worse than eating frozen food.  At least in that case I didn't feel a dish of national significance was being violated at its very core.  . . I don't know about Chabuya.  It is possible the kitchen was having an off day of epic proportions, but in a city the size of LA, I don't have to give it another chance.
