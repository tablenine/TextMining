I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!. . So I used to feel like this was my secret place until I read all the reviews. lol I also learned that my boss likes this place. How do I know? Well let me tell you.... . So last week I decided to leave work a little early. I figured I'd go get some lunch and then hang out for the rest of the day. So as I'm walking in to the restaurant guess who was walking out? Yep! You guessed right. My boss. BUSTED! lol What are the odds??? Anyway, enough about that. (shaking head). . So, as for the restaurant its a GEM. I love it. The champagne lemon chicken is my favorite as well as the sweet and sour chicken. The chicken is quality. No fatty or grainy pieces. Just pure white chicken breast. Yum. Also, make sure to get the egg rolls for an appetizer. Always perfection. . . I have never had to wait for a table which is amazing. This place is good. I don't know why they don't get more traffic but hey I'm not complaining! I love the chocolate fortune cookies (just thought I'd throw that in). The service is OK. Nothing to scream about. Mediocre at best but the food more than makes up for it. The dinner portion is great and you get enough for leftovers. The lunch portion is perfect. Definitely not too much which is good. You wouldn't want to fall asleep at your desk right?. . So run (don't walk) to this place right now. Just make sure you don't run into your boss :-)
