Restaurant: The Little Door
Category: French
I came here in celebration of UCLA graduation and boy was it crowded.  I made reservations for 7:30 pm, arrived at 7 and didn't get seated until almost 9!!  If there wouldn't have been so much hype, I would have left. . . This is a great date place, very trendy, very LA kind of scene.  The Little Door seems very authentically french; maybe because the hostess is on the snooty side and speaks with a thick french accent, and because there is practically a cloud of cigarette smoke over the entire restaurant (at least in the front room).  . . As soon as we sat down, we were served bread and this amazing olive oil dip.  It was unique and delightful.  We ordered the ahi tuna tartar and the calmari for starters and as an entree, I had the scallops.  The ahi tuna and the scallops were the best i've ever had!  I also found their extensive wine list to be quite impressive, and I was thrilled to pair my meal with a glass of Chianti Classico.  . . Everything was excellent: the service, food, and ambience.  I thought the portions were perfect and I left feeling perfectly satisfied, and not ridiculously stuffed or hungry.  I highly recommend The Little Door and cannot wait until I come here again.
