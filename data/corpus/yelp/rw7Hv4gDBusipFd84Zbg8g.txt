Restaurant: El Tepeyac Cafe - Manuel&#39;s Original
Category: Mexican
We love Tepeyac! The food is pretty good but most people come here for the portion sizes. The burritos are bigger than your head!. . I ordered the Hollenbeck burrito with pork. The pork chunks were just too big to be enjoyed. My mom ordered the Hollenbeck de asada and the steak was chopped to tiny pieces. We ended up sharing hers and took mines to go (my dad ate it later). So hands down the hollenbeck de asada is my favorite.. . Word to the wise. Prepare to wait for at least an hour! Unless you sit at the counter. There's always room there.. . There's this cool guy who gives you free beer. I forgot his name. But he's nice. Ask for a "cervesita or tequilita" and they'll hook you up.. . Gracias tepeyac for yummy in the tummy food!
