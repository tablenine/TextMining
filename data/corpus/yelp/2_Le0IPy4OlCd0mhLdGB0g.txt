Yum.. . ok i'm a fan.. . but this place can get pricy.. . but it's ok.. . because its good.. . and Fun!. . all crowded and hip and modern looking. heheh!  and the ordering process is cool.  let's see. 2 burgers, 1 order of sweet potato fries, 2 glasses of wine + tip = $60.. . well.... its certainly not the cheapest place i've ever been, but i think it lives up to its hype. :) its' an 'experience'.. . the beer/wine list is pretty extensive. and the burger i got was medium, and it was juicy and delicious. i love arugula. and how interesting of them to have no substitutions, just ONE burger and thats that. heheeh! awesome how crowded it still is! i felt like i was going into an exclusive club. haha! they checked our id's going in, and had to open this lil 'strap' to let us in.. . i was surprised it was served on a roll and not a bun. the meat is pretty thick and juicy!  the carmelized onion, the juices/sauce, and the arugula taste great together. on top of THAT the sweet potato fries are AMAZING and i love the sauce it comes with!. . yay for FO!
