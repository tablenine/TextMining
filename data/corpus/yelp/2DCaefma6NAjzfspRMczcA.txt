This place is the ultimate Man dining experience.  They serve nothing but sausage, fries, and alcohol.  The food is absolutely amazing. The exotics are fun, but the classics really show their talent.  Anyone who says a sausage is a sausage doesn't know what they are talking about. The atmosphere is perfectly Man as well.  Big rows of bench seating, dim seedy lighting, and raw exposed wood beams holding it all together.  One of the best overall dining experiences I have had in LA.  Keep your fancy restaurants, I'll take Wurstkuche any day.
