Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
40 minutes drive to Porto's Bakery????. . Oooh, so worth it!. . The pastries here are so, so good.  It is so flaky and fresh tasting.  I highly recommend the Potato Ball and Cheese and guava rolls.  They also have good strudels.. . The only downfall of this place is that parking is limited and there are always people in line.  However, it is so worth the wait, and the 40 minutes drive!!!
