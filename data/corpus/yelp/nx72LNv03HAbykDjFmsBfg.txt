OOoook so for my 35th Review I will give the honors to Kogi.. Eagle Rock - Eagle Rock Boulevard/Lincoln. 6:30-8:30PM. . OK heres the thing, this place is new, its cool, its innovative, but I do not just have 2 hours out of my day to wait in line for this food. The chicken, beef and spicy pork tacos are delicious and the burritos are excellent and most importantly its all really cheap. 2 dollars for a taco. 5 dollars for a burrito.  It works for now, but they need to do something about the line, or get more trucks. Sooo far soo Good! . . I arrived there at 6:15. The line circled the corner. I asked the person in front of me "Is this line for the Korean BBQ thing", the guy in front of me said "The truck has not even arrived yet'  Wah Wah wahh woW. . I waited an hour an half to pay for my food. Plus like 20 minutes after paying. Waiting in line was like waiting to go on a roller coaster. Everyone was excited to try this new thing out. . Everyone couldn't help but talk about the experience of waiting for two hours in line for food coming off of a truck.. . When the truck finally arrived, the guy comes out, and puts a sign on the last person in line.  The sign said that they couldn't guarantee food for people waiting in back of this person.  If you did not get there in time or if you were not willing to wait 2 hours you were not getting food.. Later they limited to three taco per person as a comprise to feed the people who were waiting. . . The food was delicious. Really cheap. But the tacos are small as hell. They will not fill you up. Go for the burritos or quesodilla instead!!!
