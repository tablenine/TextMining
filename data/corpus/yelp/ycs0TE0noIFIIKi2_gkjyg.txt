Restaurant: Phoenix Restaurant
Category: Dim Sum
The boyfriend and I were craving dim sum, and we'd heard about Phoenix although I can't remember where from. Our lunch was a complete disappointment, made even more so by a pretty good first dish, which happened to be the shrimp + dou miao dumplings. Everything after that went downhill...the xiao long bao (little soup dumplings) were huge and leaky, and the other dishes just didn't taste very good. . . Moreover, the serving ladies couldn't really describe in English what they were pushing around on their carts. I don't know how people even managed to order anything without speaking Chinese - Cantonese to be specific since we had a bit of trouble using Mandarin. Given the food and the service, we definitely paid more than what we could get for a far better meal elsewhere.
