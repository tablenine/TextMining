Greasy, angry goodness in a paper bag.  DO NOT GO HERE LATE NIGHT, if you are offended by four letter words or the sight of inebriated yuppies hurling insults at young black women.  Actually the women behind the counter ALWAYS get the better of the patrons when it comes to insults.  I almost got into a fist fight with a motorcycle gang here with a few buddies.  I averted the fight by throwing my friend into the garbage can outside after he tried to smash in the windshield (with a 4-iron - don't ask) of a girl who threw a full size coke on his white polo shirt which inadvertently splashed on some of the bikers.  The girl behind the counter asked the only biker of caucasian descent: "What choo want eminem?"  The night descended further from there...
