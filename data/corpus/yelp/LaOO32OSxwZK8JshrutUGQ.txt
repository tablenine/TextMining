DAMN, DAMN , DAMN!. Why i haven't eaten here earlier, I don't know...... maybe it's the crazy line i always see going out their doors each time I'm in the area.... but my honey and I finally got to taste what all the commotion is all about and we are major fans. . First , the size of that ramen bowl was pretty big, I might have to share next time.. Secondly, the milkiness in Â their broth is one I have not tasted before. All I can say is YEAH to pork fat. . Third, those were the best bowl of ramen noodles we h ve ever had. The noodles were cooked to perfection, the broth is so tasty and silky, and the pork belly included in the bowl is a nice touch.. I will definitely go back again, I may actually go to the Costa Mesa branch since it's closer to my work. But call me a FAN.
