Starters: . . Speck and figs. What is speck? Smoked, paper thin prosciutto - here, on top of watercress, marcona almonds, aged balsamic vinegar.. . Baby beets were chunks of light pink, sweet, delicate and paired with hazelnuts, mache, sitting pretty on ricotta.. . Entrees: . . We heard so much about the monkfish so we had to try it. Â As yelpers have noted, delicious. Soft but firm, cooked to perfection with spinach, white wine, potato puree, and shallots.. . I typically don't go for main courses of pig, but we opted to try something new with the kurobuta pork chop. Even if I'm still not a convinced pork fan, it was probably the prettiest dish of the evening. Bone-in hunk of korubata sat on a green potato chive puree, sided by carrots, haricot vert, and violet mustard. . . Dessert was chocolate coulant. Aka molten chocolate lava cake...I like Roy's, but this was comparably, fabulously hot and sweet.
