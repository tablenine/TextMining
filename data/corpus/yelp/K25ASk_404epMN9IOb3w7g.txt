Restaurant: Los Nopales
Category: Mexican
I typically don't like Mexican food, but Los Nopales is different. Fresh, yummy, always a tasty spin on Mexican food. Enchiladas are supreme and any fish is always delicious. And their specials are always awesome. Also, the waitress are wonderful. They really want to take care of you and give you a good meal. Oh, and great guacamole.
