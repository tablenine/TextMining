Took the challenge after hearing it was going to be on Man vs. Food. I wasn't able to finish, mainly because I was super full and it was so spicy my mouth went numb and was practically quivering from the pain. I enjoyed the experience, but wouldn't ever come here if not for the kitsch of trying to get a Polaroid on the wall.
