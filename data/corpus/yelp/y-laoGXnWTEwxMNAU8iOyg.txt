There are plenty of Mediterranean places around town, and this is one of the worst. I've been here twice, and did not have a good experience on either occasion. . . Today I got the Kufta Plate (spiced lamb with rice and salad), which was very disappointing. The rice was yellow and bland, and the meat was dry and overcooked. The "salad" was just some romaine lettuce and tomato slices, and the tahini they serve on the side is thin and tasteless. Not to mention the pita, which was dry and not fresh at all. . . I also found the service unpleasant. Basically nothing was good here.. . Don't go here.. . It's not good.
