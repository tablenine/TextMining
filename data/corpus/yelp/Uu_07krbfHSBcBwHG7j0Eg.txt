I am ashamed to say that this is within walking distance, yet I had not eaten here until today. . . Glad we got here early since at 9:15 on a lazy Saturday morning, the place was already hopping.  Our server was friendly, fast and not overly talkative (a plus since it was early to be out and about for me on a weekend).  . . The food was very enjoyable.  It wasn't fall-out-of-my-seat breakfast, but my ricotta pancakes were light, fluffy, drizzled in yummy blueberries and I will assume relatively healthy.  My breakfast mate's yogurt and granola looked equally good and nutritious.  The coffee was strong, hot and with no hint of burnt or over processed beans.. . I will say it can get very loud in here.  With all of the hungry patrons, a few crying kids and the exposed brick walls, prepare to be speaking slightly louder than usual if you want to be heard above the din. . . All in all, great new (at least for me) breakfast spot!
