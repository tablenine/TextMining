Spring has an amazing dining room and serves top shelf modern fushion.  My wife was also pleased by their vegetarian options.  We found the wine list to be very interesting but did need some help from the sommelier to pick a wine.  The only fault I can find with the experience was that our server (who looked not a day over 19) did not seem to know either the menu nor the wine list that well.  Still, it was a great (albeit pricey) meal out.
