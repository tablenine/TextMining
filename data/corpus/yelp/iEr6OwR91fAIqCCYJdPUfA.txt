It's great! 63 martini menu and a great food menu to go with it. Oh yeah and the Martinis are quiet large! You might want to share the second one with your date! Â  The bread pudding is worth the wait. I've been a few times and the wait staff is always good and the dinning area is pretty quiet compared to the bar area. Not a bad place for a date. But you have to sit in the dining area if you want to talk to them and then you can move out to the bar after dinner to share the last martini. Or go on an off night to just enjoy the drinks and your date.
