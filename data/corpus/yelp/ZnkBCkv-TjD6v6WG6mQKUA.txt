Cheap grub and decent service. Great service for regulars.. . $4 happy hour well cocktails. Fo Sho.. . California rolls, calamari, seared tuna, Korean beef, etc. Food is a bit hit-or-miss (it's never bad...) but the prices are GREAT.. . Relaxed atmosphere. Great if you're in the mood to chill somewhere unassuming.
