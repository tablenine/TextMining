Very good Hainan Chicken.  Some other dishes tried were the Chicken Curry and Baked Halibut with tomato sauce.. . The downside is the restaraunt is quite small so it isn't fun waiting outside in the cold.  Wait time is usually longer than we experienced as we came at an off time but still had to wait about 20 minutes.. . I think the food is very good for lunch but they need to find a bigger location.  I will definitely go back or go for some takeout when I crave Hainan Chicken again!
