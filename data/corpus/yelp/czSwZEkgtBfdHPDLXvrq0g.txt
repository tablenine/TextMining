Restaurant: Father&#39;s Office
Category: American (New)
My GF raves about this place to me all the time.  Gave this place a chance and now I see the light.  I am now in the Fathers Office fan club.  It is a bar first and a restaurant second to me.. . It is a bar set up inside the place, but there are also lunch benches and tables outside of the patio area.  There is a huge parking lot so there will be plenty of parking.  There are TVs inside so you can enjoy your food and drinks with the game one.  I heard there are sometimes lines with a bouncer up front.  Fortunately I went on a Wednesday around 6 PM and there were no lines.  I left around 8 PM and there was a crowd, plus a line starting to form.  So show up early if you guys don't want to wait in line.  Well worth the wait though.  A great place to hang out with friends.. . I ordered the burger, sweet potato fries, with a coke.  The burger was good, but the star of the show are the sweet potato fries.  I have tried sweet potato fries from other restaurants such as The Counter, but the sweet potato fries here just demolishes the competition.  Just like how Godzilla demolishes the Japanese buildings.  You HAVE to order the sweet potato fries if you go there.  The Coke came in the glass bottle (the ones from Mexico with cane sugar).  . . The only negative thing I can say about this place is they do not have ketchup!  Really minor thing, but to ketchup lovers like me, its a big deal.  Won't take a star away, but please offer ketchup Fathers Office.  Pretty please!!. . Bon Apettit!
