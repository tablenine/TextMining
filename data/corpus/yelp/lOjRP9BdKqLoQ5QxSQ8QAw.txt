I have done a non-scientific study and decided that whenever I go out with friends I always order the best drink.. . I think it's because most people want to taste a crap-load of alcohol, while I want to taste sweet sugary goodness on my tongue.. . While enjoying a perfectly sweetened mango martini (almost the price of a whole meal, mind you) three of us ordered three separate dishes to split.  Each one was mind-blowingly filled with flavor.'. . Honestly, I can't even remember what we ordered, but I'm thinking three out of three is pretty good.  It's a little on the pricey side, but you do get large portions, and word of advice, it's BYOB.. . Prepare to strain your voice a little - lack of walls and plants make the place awfully noisy.. . These guys also own Wakamono just across the street, which too is fabulous.
