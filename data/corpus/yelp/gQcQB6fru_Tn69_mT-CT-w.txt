I love meat. I love steak. I just now fell in love with Mastro's. Enough for me to write a review on yelp after many months of being an absent yelper. . . Bone In - Filet 12 oz. Every bite was as good as the first. Seasoned perfectly, cooked like I wanted, and tender, tender, tender. . . I had a couple of bites of the New York Strip too. Excellent! I'm not a big NY strip fan because it usually comes out overcooked, dry, and chewy but Â I would order it again from Mastro's. Although, next time, I'm gonna gun for the 28 oz. prime rib. Mind you, I've got a tiny frame - but I will eat a horse to prep myslef for that prime rib. . . I also recommend the Oyster Rockefeller ( Baked oysters with spinach and cheese), creamed corn, sugar snow peas as your side orders. And for dessert, butter cake and chocolate sin.
