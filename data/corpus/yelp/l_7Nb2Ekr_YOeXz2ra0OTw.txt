It's wonderful. Back in the day people went there in their coveralls and in minks. Sandwiches were 25 cents, coffee 5 cent a cup. And everyone went, because it was the best in town. . . They had all kinds of pies, and I can't tell you much more because that wasn't my long suit, but also they had pickled hard-boiled eggs, and pickles, and cheesecake. Oh, yes, and they did have baked apples. I think that's their complete menu! . . I like the beef dip, double dipped. Share it with your husband, but put on as much mustard as you like and make him live with it. He likes cole slaw and potato salad, and will share if you sit close enough together. . . Even today, you can't beat it for your dollar, it's the best bet in town, consistently good, and Harry and I love to visit. The coffee is 9 cents now, I think. That's still a deal, and I love the people watching.. . It's crowded, so my suggestion is that you find a nice seat and make your grandkids wait in line for you. See you there!
