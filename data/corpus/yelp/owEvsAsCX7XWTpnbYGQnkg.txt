Restaurant: The Little Door

I brought my girlfriend here a couple weeks ago for our 5 year anniversary. Overall, it was a good experience.. . I made reservations online through OpenTable. The Little Door kindly gave me a call the day of the reservation as a reminder. When we arrived, the valet service was nice and quick. I'm not sure if the guy at the door is the 'door guy', but he was a little awkward. The host/hostess/waiter/bus boys were very friendly.. . We sat in the patio area which was very nicely decorated. Our server was good overall. The food was pretty good. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the taste of our dinner. I had the filet mignon and my girlfriend had the black cod. Both very surprisingly good. I wasn't expecting much from my filet mignon. I only ordered it because I really felt like steak, and it turned out to be pretty good. My girlfriend's cod was really good IMO. It almost melts in your mouth.. . My girlfriend also ordered the soup that's on the regular dinner menu. I'm not sure what it was, but she said it was pretty good. We shared a tuna tartar which was okay. It had an interesting taste to it. I probably wouldn't order it again though.. . The Little Door made for a nice romantic dinner. The food was good overall, and the ambiance was very nice. It's very relaxing.
