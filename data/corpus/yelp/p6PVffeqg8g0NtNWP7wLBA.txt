I love this place.  I have never been to the original (Glendale) location, but this location is spacious and beautiful, in addition to serving the most heavenly food around.  I've probably eaten here 20 times, and it's always wonderful.  Things I love here:. . * Old Havana espresso. * Cheese rolls - the best pastry known to humankind. * Steak fajita sandwich. * Chicken torta sandwich. * Laredo omelet sandwich (before 11 AM). * Machaca wrap/burrito (before 11 AM). . I have found most of the sandwiches to be divine.  For my tastes, however, the basic pork sandwich (pan con lechon) needs a side of guacamole or its too dry.  The other pork sandwiches that I've had work out great due to the mix of ingredients.. . I live in Claremont, and I will drive the 90-mile roundtrip to Burbank/NoHo just to eat at Porto's.. . Tip: if you are there just before closing you might get a free loaf of bread - especially if you get a full meal and/or a full order of pastries.
