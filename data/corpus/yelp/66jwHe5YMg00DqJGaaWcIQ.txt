=========UPDATE!! (03/10/08)==========. . I returned to Comme Ca last night and I've bumped it up to 5 stars. My coq a vin was simply heaven. I tried the Marrow and Oxtail jam this time, and it was unusual, but good. Don't know how I felt about eating marrow out of a bone. The mac and cheese was very good too! . . The service was top notch. We ordered a bottle of Bordeaux, and we drank it all, but the waitress found a bottle of it behind the bar and topped us of for free! The bartenders are spot on with the Dealers Choice.. . =========END UPDATE==========. . The menu is classic French. They were out of the Beef Marrow and Oxtail jam, so I order the Steak Tartar ($14). Hand cut and delicate but full of flavor and ever so tender. For the main course I order the New Zealand Snapper ($27). The skin is crispy and full of flavor. I am always reluctant to eat fish with the skin still on, but I couldn't resist the flavors grilled into the fish, it was salty, but I love salt. It was served on a bed of diced carrots, artichokes and potatoes, drizzled with a light pesto sauce. It was simple, but amazing. If you like cheese, you will love the cheese bar.. .
