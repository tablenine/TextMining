OMG.  OMG.  OMG.  Asian fusion I guess.  Kinda weird looking inside like the other KDK restaurants.  . . Wow.  I will definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone I know...although I have to recommend getting a FANTASTIC deal and going on Sunday or Tuesday for their prix-fixe.  This deal is $25 a person and includes ANY appetizer or salad, ANY entree and ANY dessert.  AMAZING.  (Especially when you realize that the filet mignon is $32 alone!). . We all shared a bit of our plates (which I never do) so I got to try everyone's food.  And the sizes of food were really big so no one seemed angry when I stole some of their food.  It seemed good to have 4 of us to share as I think it wouldn't have been the same experience with only 2 people.. . Appetizers:. Golden Shrimp Wok Smoked Chili-Sichuan Peppercorn Glaze. Maine Lobster Springroll Mango-Lime  . Lobster &amp; Pork Sui Mai Roasted Chili Pesto, Scallion-Ginger Sauce  . Shanghai Shrimp Dumplings Prawn Chips, Ginger-Scallion Relish  . . Entrees:. Fire Cracker Chicken Chicken Breast, Roasted Chilies, Herbs, . Opera Filet Mignon - Chinese Broccoli, Black Mushromm, Red Wine-Rack of Lamb - Night Special . Swordfish - Night Special . . The wine was a bit pricier than I am used to but you could definitely get a glass for $10 if you didn't want to shell out $50-100 for a bottle.  (gotta remember that next time!). . I hope to go back with a group of girl friends in the near future.
