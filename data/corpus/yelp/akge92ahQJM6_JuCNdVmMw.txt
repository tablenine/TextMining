Restaurant: Langer&#39;s Delicatessen-Restaurant
Category: Delis
I love me some Langer's pastrami. This place is a bit of a conundrum. On one hand, it has some of the best pastrami I've ever had. Their corned beef rueben? Omg, I love their russian dressing just slathered on that rye bread, the coleslaw-smothered pastrami, the huge slices of pies and cakes. Foodwise, Langer's is delicious, delicious jewish deli, food-coma food. Personally I like it better than Fillipes in LA. This is a place you definitely have to see at least once. . . On that OTHER hand, its prices have gone up like crazy and they've cut portions down which makes me REALLY sad. One of my favorite things about this place was ordering a pastrami and corned beef sandwich and seeing this hot, steaming, gargantuan pile of fatty meat and coleslaw barely covered by the top slice of bread. All koshered-up of course. Now I can eat one and barely feel the food coma-ing knockin'.. . And let's put in a third hand. One thing that hasn't change is this place is ghetto. Well, the restaurant isn't, the entire block around it is. There's a guarded parking lot across the street you can park in, it's under surveillance so I guess that's safe. In that 2 min walk to the restaurant; however, you're going to want to walk really fast. But refrain in case they try to chase you. Once you're inside it's okay, there are usually always one or two cops around getting their pastrami fill for the day.
