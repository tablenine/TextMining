I may be the only reviewer who's middle of the road on this place. I read about it in the LA Weekly and finally got a chance to taste the well-talked about bacon. It is indeed as good as everyone says BUT you get so little for the price you pay. . . The food is good and substantial but you pay a price. I found the service about average and the decor kinda eh. The most troubling was all the flies in the back patio on this july day. I felt like I spent more time swatting the flies than enjoying the food.. . But back to the food. It is good and tasty. I didn't like how vinegary the potatoe salad was but it's just different. My burger was quite tasty and fulfilling plus the bacon on top was very good. Yes, of course that's not a lot of bacon, but reading the menu, that's pretty much what you would get in say a breakfast meal too so I opted to get it on my burger. . . The gourmet bacon is costly so I imagine that's why you don't get much. The o.j. is freshly squeezed and tasty but for $5 in a medium size glass, not really worth it. . . I would go back maybe but the wait is like 30 minutes or more and for food that although good, come-on is it too trendy for it's own good? . . It's certainly a step up from Denny's and iHop but you kinda leave wandering if your money could've been spent making your own breakfast and spending the time at home reading the morning paper. I make great eggs and gourmet bacon cooks just the same as heart-killing generic stuff from Food 4 Less. And I don't feel compelled to leave a tip for myself.. . Okay call me jaded.
