Restaurant: New Wave Coffee
Category: Coffee & Tea
Professionals working on their laptops, parents with kids running around, girlfriends gossiping about so and so, hipsters reading Kafka, good looking people, not so good looking people, Johnny Cash on the speakers, strong coffee and free WIFI.  Big bright space.  Big space.  This is the coffee shop Logan Square's been waiting for!
