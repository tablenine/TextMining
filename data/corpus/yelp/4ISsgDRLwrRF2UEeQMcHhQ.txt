Restaurant: Dolce Enoteca e Ristorante
Category: Italian
Drinks and desserts were excellent. Try their dulce de leche and banana split - they were so rich that my friends and I shared them.. . The wait staff was a lot of fun, but it was hard to find them when it came check time.. . Atmosphere rivals that of hot restaurants in NYC and LA. The bathroom sinks are definitely a talking piece, as well as lighting. But what's up with the ghetto LCD fireplaces?
