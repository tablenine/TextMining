I met Kamil Majer through my best friend.  Since then, I have been delighted to know him, his cooking, his family Goulash (mmmm), and every breakfast creation you can think of.  Imagine art, made from food, which you are supposed to eat, where it not only delights the eyes, but your taste buds!  Its no wonder that he's rated one of the best breakfast places in town!  He also does a superb job when catering private parties; I know this, as we've had several at his location.  Lastly, if you have traveled abroad, and you're used to fine bistro cuisine, you will experience it again with Kamil's food.  He has run in the past bistro nights, where you'll need to make a reservation a month (or two) in advance, as you'll be transported via his food, to the region that he's chosen to cook for that evening.  You will be delighted at the atmosphere, the food is top notch, and the clientele are all warm and friendly.  You'll realize on a bistro night, you're not eating with strangers, but new friends waiting to share they're joy and experience with you, as it all comes together in a synchronous moment in time.
