As people have reviewed before, this place is tiny.  However, my friend and I had no problems during lunch, as no one else was eating there.. . The Service: Left much to be desired.  The young lady, although nice, was not knowledgeable about the menu items and even though we were the only guests she couldn't get us a refill to save her life, even after we asked her.. . The Food: The macaroni cheese that everyone raves about was mediocre.  We had the version with the mushroom and truffle oil.  It was runny.  I was expecting more creaminess, but alas, was disappointed.  It also was a bit too seasoned.  The concept was there, however the execution lacked. . . We were also going to order the cheese steak sandwich until they informed us that they only prepared it as medium.  I'm a big steak eater, and medium is just not going to do it for me.  That is already overcooked, so we passed on that.. . Instead, we got one of their specials, I believe it was the pulled pork sandwich.  Again, nothing memorable.  What I do remember is that there was too much liquid from the pork, and the bun ended up soggy.  Taste-wise, it was ok.. . Overall, we were disappointed with whole experience.  For a $40 lunch, we were expecting a lot more, especially after everyone was waxing poetic about the mac and cheese.  . . Sorry, but there were just too many missing ELEMENTS for me.
