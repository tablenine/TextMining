Restaurant: Pops For Champagne
Category: Wine Bars
The ambience here is lovely (but the clientele is all 40+, not that there's anything wrong with that), but this place is EXPENSIVE (which probably explains the dominant age group - people with significant disposable income).. . My work partner and I planned a Christmas work outing here, assuming the champagne list would be comparable to a wine list at a nice restaurant - glasses starting at $7-$8, with a bottle price list starting in the mid-twenty dollar range. WRONG. There are only a few champagnes by the glass, and they're about $15 a pop (pardon the expression). The bottles start - no kidding - at $60.. . For a student-loan-saddled twentysomething like myself, this place is about the worst place in the city you could ever go. See ya in 20 years, Pops.
