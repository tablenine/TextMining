Restaurant: Toast
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Had breakfast here this morning. Wednesday morning = no crowd. I was not impressed. . . We were seated in the back, near where the waiter does his prepping, when there were two perfectly nice tables in front. I just have a thing for chaos going on behind my back that I can't see. And I'm not even gonna pull the race card here.... . Anyway, I got the eggs benedict. It was alright. The potatoes were not good. It was messy - most of the skins were falling off and some of it was burnt. My eggs were over done for my preference - they didn't ask me how I liked them though. Prosciutto a little hard to chew. Friend got scrambled eggs with chorizo - which she did not finish. She also got multi-grain bread that she didn't like. I'm not exactly sure why. But, and I quote "how can you ruin toast" ... "toast was TOOO thick, should have been for a sandwich"... Not enough jam, too much butter. . . Can't complain too much about the service, since there really wasn't any... Didn't take long for food to come, but he was sure quick on his feet to pick up our plates when we finished. Again... not gonna pull the race card... No lie, in and out in less than an hour. And what's up with the brown paper bag like cover over the table cloths?
