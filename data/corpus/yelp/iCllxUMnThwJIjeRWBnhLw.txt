id give it a 4 for food. 1 for the price- wayyy over priced for rameun ( dont care if you add pork). rameun still should not cost $13!! are you kidding me!!. although it did taste good... . it still does not justify the price. so i guess if price isnt an option and you dont mind paying a crap load for cheap dishes, rice and noodles then try it.. . table arrangements sucks in my opinion, i know they tried to do something different but it doesnt work out too well.. . conclusion: food that should be really cheap tastes good for a very expensive price
