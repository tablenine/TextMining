This is Chicago's hidden jewel. This is by far the best Chicago pizza.  The have a Pizza Pot pie and it is one of the best things I have ever eaten.  This place is amazing! Expect to wait in line and expect crowds but there is a reason for this.  I have eaten here 6-8 times easy.  They have a Mediterranean flatbread that is soooooooo good. I have had almost everything here and it this is as good as it gets.  The guy who seats you doesnt even write down your name and clearly 30 people will be waiting for a table. He always gets it right, I have no idea how he does this but dont woryy.....you will get seated! It is worth the hassle each and every time. You can valet the car so dont worry about parking. I moved back to the Dirty Water aka Boston, MA but truly miss this place. I send everyone that tells me they are in Chicago to go here and all i have heard is thank you's when they try it.  My mouth is watering writing this.......
