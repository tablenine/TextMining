Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Lived in SoCal all my life &amp; had never been here until last friday (7.17.09). . I've been to all sorts of 'nice' restaurants in town and this place was without a doubt a complete let down in terms of the food. I've had prime rib just as good IF NOT BETTER at almost every brunch I've ever been too. . . Maybe my friends and other locals have hyped this place up too much but I was definitely disappointed. Not what I was expecting at all. The atmosphere was like a damn restaurant at DisneyLand or something. Almost no one was dressed nicely. It looked like everybody walked straight from the mall over here to eat. At these prices I expected a lot more. Not that I like pretentious restaurants or anything but there's a certain atmosphere and level refinement I was expecting and none of it was met. This place is like a damn zoo. . . I guess I was just expecting something more formal and polished. Nothing here was bad essentially but this is not what I would consider to be fine dining. . . The service was spot on but I'll never look at this place the same way and I will never go back by choice.
