Restaurant: Orochon Ramen
Category: Japanese
Granted, I haven't been to that many other ramen places (Daikokuya in Little Tokyo and Ajisen in Irvine) but this is my favorite by FAR.. . I usually get #3 Shoyu base ramen. For me, that's comfortably spicy, and when I feel up for a challenge, I get #2. (I don't think I'll ever get to Special #2...) The meal was oh-so-yummy and flavorful. As far as "authenticity" is concerned, my gut feeling tells me it's not "authentic," but as long as it tastes good, who cares?? Plus, the portions are pretty good--and if you're feeling extra hungry, you can order extra noodles for a little over a dollar. i hear that they give you LOTS of extra noodles if you ask for them.. . Orochon is for people who like spicy ramen. My two other roommates liked Daikokuya a lot more, but I'm forever an Orochon fan. If you don't love spicy ramen, it's not worth coming here.. . One star less because service is usually kind of slow--takes forever to get a seat and takes forever for the food to come out. But maybe it only feels like forever because my stomach craves for that yummy goodness.
