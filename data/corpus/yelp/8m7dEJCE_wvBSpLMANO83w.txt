I'm new to Chicago and new to Humboldt Park and this place is one of the reasons I'm falling in love with this city! I love Mexican food and it's great to get something other than the usual suspects of tex-mex we're all used to. The Cemitas sandwich is unlike any Mexican food I've ever seen and is vastly different from a torta sandwich. I don't care where you live, it's worth a trip to visit us in the hood for this sandwich! Trust me!
