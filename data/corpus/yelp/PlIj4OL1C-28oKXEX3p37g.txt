Restaurant: Yolk
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Yolk is a cute breakfast and lunch restaurant located across from Grant Park. It's sweet staff, sunny decor and reasonable prices make it a must for breakfast in the Loop. The only downside to Yolk are the dry pancakes. No amount of syrup and butter can make them moist.
