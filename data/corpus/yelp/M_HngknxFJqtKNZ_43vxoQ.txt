Restaurant: Lawry&#39;s The Prime Rib
Category: Steakhouses
Overfuckingrated.. Salad is nothing sensational. Basically, it's a salad in a bowl and your server spins it around while pouring their special secret dressing (which was basically French dressing mixed with some Thousand Island). So the fucking salad bowl spins around in a bigger bowl for a few seconds. Big fucking whoop. I could do this at home without having to deal with their incompetent valets.. Prime rib was lackluster. It was good but not as good as everyone makes it out to be.. Creamed corn was runny and not very tasty when I went. I've made better with supermarket brand cans of corn.. If you like meat, just go to Ruth's Chris Steak House for a steak that will make your thighs go up in flames.
