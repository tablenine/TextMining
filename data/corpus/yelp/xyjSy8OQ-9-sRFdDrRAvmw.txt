Good beer selection, decent atmosphere. Not bad for Culver City.  . . HOWEVER, the burgers are disgusting.  They're made of some rubber meat substance, whether medium or medium well it feels and looks like a tire. They are FRIED not grilled.  And the toppings are vomitious.  They used a mesclun mix much more suitable for a salad as it wilts under the heat of the meat.  And there was this sweet sauce that overpowered everything. And we couldn't find the bacon or even aioli.  . . Other places I order a really similar burger and have never had something that's so simple be screwed up SO bad.  I mean really really bad and I'm not some sort of food snob.  Both of us only ate 1/2 the burger and it was 3PM and that's all we had all day.
