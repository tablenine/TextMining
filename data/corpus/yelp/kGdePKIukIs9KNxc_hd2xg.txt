Restaurant: The Boiling Crab
Category: Seafood
Garlic. Butter. Seafood. This place smells like heaven. Welcome to olfactory paradise. . . Food: I know what you need. Shrimp the 'whole shebang' style (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). Sure, the crawfish are good, but they're a lot of work for a small meaty reward.  The fried oysters are also pretty satisfying but you don't get much and they're not dripping in garlic and spices (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). Same story with the king crab (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). It's downright delicious, but you'll never get full off of 2 legs. To complement your shrimp, I suggest the cajun fries (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). It's the closest thing you'll find to a vegetable here.. . Service: You'll have to wait for at least a half an hour, but trust me when I say it's worth it. They seem kind of irritated all the time and won't let you stand inside the restaurant if you're waiting (they do have a decent waiting patio with benches, but dammit! I wanna smell the action inside!). . . Atmosphere: You know a restaurant has class when your food is served in a plastic bag which you dump in front of you onto a paper tablecloth before consuming the irretrievably greasy food with your bare hands. You're given a bib to shield yourself from crustacean juices, too. The inside looks like a dock with a lot of graffiti that just finished a mardi gras party (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ). I thought it would be more ghetto inside than this.  . . Synopsis: Seafood heaven.
