I've been going there for years.  By far the best sushi place I've ever been to.  The decor is nothing to rave about but the quality and freshness of the fish is amazing.  Only minor drawback is the long wait and you have to pay for parking.  I thought their service were adequate.  They may be a bit understaffed when they're busy but the waitresses were always friendly.
