. http://I.just.love.it. .. Despite the fact that the Italians have a bad tendancy lately to get rid of the French team of FOOTBALL (I will always refuse to call it soccer, sorry!) - we just got kicked off yesterday from the European Championship..... - I can't stay mad at them for very long because I love their food. I fell in love with it a long time ago and Spacca Napoli is keeping the flame alive. Their dough/crust is the best I've had in a long time, even in Italy, and I love their authentic mozzarella "di bufala"... Their menu is simple and basic but they always have a few specials which I really appreciate. Their appetizers are not quite as good as the pizze but who cares when you have so much love on your plate?!?!? I can't get enough of it.. They do take reservations but not on Friday and Saturday nights....be prepared for a long wait if you come right at dinner time!!!
