This place will get 5 stars as soon as it expands...that's the only downside.. . Otherwise, what's not to love. I come for my favorite sandwich. Apricot glazed and ham with double creme Brie. Order it on the baguette. It's amazing.. . I have yet to try most of the food but I do remember that the mac n cheese was great. Cupcakes are good too. No red velvet but the chocolate with marshmallow creme and the coconut are pretty good.. . They also have a great cheese selection and a very knowledgable fellow more than willing to educate you about the fine cheese as well as give you samples.. . Parking is bad...and seating is limited. Definitely try to call in your order otherwise you'll be there a while.. . I know, it sounds negative, but people come back for a reason.
