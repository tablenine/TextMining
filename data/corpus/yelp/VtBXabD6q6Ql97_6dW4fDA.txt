Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
As a Chicagoan, I am ashamed to read so many negative reviews of this place.  . . 1. The crust is NOT bland, it is FRESH (sans gobs of salt and all that other BS that is in many other crusts).  . 2. There is NOT too much cheese,  though I would say that about Giordano's.... 3. The tomatoes and sauce taste very fresh.  . 4. If you get a lot of meat on the pizza, yes, it is greasy.  Blame the meat, not the pizza... This isn't rocket science here.    . . I can understand how someone who dislikes pizza in general would not like it because, well, it's PIZZA.   The best way to judge the quality of a pizza is to get it plain.  I challenge anyone to get a plain old deep dish Lou's pizza (tomato sauce and cheese) and tell me that it's not better than the rest.  Sorry for the rant, but I go way out of my way for a slice of Lou's and don't like hearing bad things about it, especially from people who don't like pizza in the first place!  . . BOTTOM LINE: If you like pizza and you like fresh tasting food, you will LOVE lou's.
