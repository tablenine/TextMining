I have only been here once, but really enjoyed it.  My husband and I went to use our Groupon, and had a really good time.  The service was very friendly.  We tried the madai chef's special dish, which was very refreshing--thinly sliced grapes and tomatoes, green onions, and ponzu.  So tasty!  The watermelon salad was also very nice.  We had some maki sushi too, which was good, but the star of the night was the escolar nigiri.  It was so buttery and fresh that we had 2 orders (one for dessert!).  I would definitely go back, especially if it were closer to home!
