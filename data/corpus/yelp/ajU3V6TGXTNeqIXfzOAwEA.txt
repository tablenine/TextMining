Restaurant: Mastro&#39;s Steakhouse
Category: Steakhouses
The food is exquisite. The boneless filet literally melts in your mouth and is probably one of the best cuts I've ever had. It's juicy and flavorful and just...yummy, for lack of a better fine dining word.. . If there is any food I know a little something about it's mac 'n cheese. Mac 'n cheese from a lovely restaurant is always something worth trying and Mastro's version is a must must MUST! I almost feel naughty eating it it's so good. Also worth indulging - shrimp/seafood cocktail, mashed potatoes, and also the lobster mashed potatoes!. . The ambiance of the restaurant really sets the mood and makes the experience that much more enjoyable. Make sure you have a reservation, because even then there will still be a wait!
