I am gving 4 stars because of the food AND ambiance. If it was just for the food, I would have not given as many stars. . . I had the oyster shooter, which was very good; and the Cracked Pepper Filet Mignon, which was just ok. My gf had the American Wagyu, which was great. The drinks were also good, I just cannot remember the name of the Â drinks. The dessert wass also good.. . Service here is very friendly and the ambiance is the best. You might have a little bit of a problem trying to find this place, but nothing too complicated.. . I would suggest this place for a romantic occasion.
