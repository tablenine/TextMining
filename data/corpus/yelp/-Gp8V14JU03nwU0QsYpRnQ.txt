I kind of feel bad for these guys. I know they made a real effort to fix this place up - and they did a great job, but the neighborhood just did not head in the direction they thought it would (ie with less bums). That said: why exactly would I want to fight off harrassing bums in order to pay $8 for a maker's mark &amp; ginger ale? The sandwiches are great, but they need to bring it down on the drink prices.
