Restaurant: The Brick Store Pub
Category: Pubs
The Brick Store Pub is definitely one of my favorites! I won't go on and on about it since there are already so many great reviews. I would like to add that the pierogi primavera is wonderful, I get it every time. Lots of beers to choose from. Also, there are some good wines on the menu. The atmosphere is good - fun but chill - always crowded. If there were anything bad to say it'd be the fact that it is so damn crowded all the time and sometimes you have to do a lot of waiting. But, this speaks to the quality of bsp and it's worth the wait!
