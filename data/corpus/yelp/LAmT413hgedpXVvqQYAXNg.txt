I had a very yummy Thai lunch here last week with a friend.  I didn't try the sushi, but the Pad Woon Sen with Chicken was very good and clearly made with fresh veggies.  A nice touch was the unexpected miso soup.  We were in and out in an hour, so a great place for a business or personal lunch.  . . Plus, it's right down the street from D'Amato's, my favorite Italian bakery!  You can't beat that.  :)
