I feel bad giving it only two stars cuz everyone enjoyed their food so much at my table. Me? I didn't think it was worth $100/pp for the quality of the food. . It's french/viet fushion. . Starting from appetizer.. uh, is it just me or I can get the same thing from regular PHO place... at half of the price... if not less... . Entree: Crab and lobster. I Don't know, everything taste like a decent chinese restaurant but at a fraction of the price. . Will I come back again.. hmm.. not really.. . . Yeah, ppl say that the see thru fish tank under ur footstep is cool... but i try to stay away from it cuz i m afraid that the glass is gonna break if i walk on it... . I guess the restaurant is like Matt Damon. Many ppl find him super hot and attractive.. ME? i don't get it.. still.... . OH, as for garlic noodle.. yeah.. it's good.. but I really think i can get a similar noodle else where...
