Go at all costs.  Especially if you love sushi, but don't want to spend over 150$/pp.  If you really want to do it right... sit under the head sushi chefs and order the omakase... it is mind blowingly delicious.  Their cuts drape over the rice and you can ask them to make all their cuts on the belly, the area which, of course, is the most tasty :). . Toro (always orgasmic). Halibut Fin (my new favorite cut of sushi). Giant Clam. Hamachi Belly. Kanpachi. Uni (some of the best i've had). Aji. Sweet shrimp (they'll deep fry the heads for you, this is my favorite part). Saba. Fresh Water eel. . Quality and freshness is the creed here along with expert cutting... you really will not regret it and for good sushi it won't destroy your pocketbook.  Go on a Tuesday if you can... since most of the Japanese chefs in the LA area go to the fish market on Monday... but I will go here any day of the week.  Remember to eat your ginger between orders!
