It is amazing how many places in the city are scared by any number larger than 4 for brunch on a regular weekend! Thankfully Silver Cloud was not frightened by our group of 8-although we couldn't sit outside, we could only sit inside. We made the most of it with our mimosas (mini champagne bottles and all) and bloody mary's. They have burgers and eggs galor. Their mac n cheese is awesome! Our waiter was hysterical and def took shots at us because of the state we were in but we all enjoyed it.
