I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. It's a redecorated house that's really small. If you're an older person you might like this joint, because that's who was all there, old people. My husband and I ordered the fried calamari, which was good. For the entree he order the lobster ravioli which was good but they only give you about six! So, he was hungry when we left. I order the chicken breast with risotto, which was ok. This meal was very bland, and needed salt. Overall, if i didn't have a coupon I would not go back
