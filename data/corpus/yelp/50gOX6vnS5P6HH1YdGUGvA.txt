Yeah, I can't jump on the bandwagon.  I've flipped between 2 and 3 stars a bunch while writing this.... . While I appreciate the concept of the place, the execution of the actual food is not for me.  Food is heavily seasoned, refreshing in the midwest where bland is easy to come by.  But the flavors for me go a little too far and end up one-dimensional.  All that yummy stuff in my soup should combine into a complex blend of flavors and aroma.  Instead I get tons of cinnamon and ginger in every taste of rice cake, broth, meatball, noodle, whatever.  I've eaten here a bunch of times, both dine in and carry out, but still find myself having trouble getting excited about it.
