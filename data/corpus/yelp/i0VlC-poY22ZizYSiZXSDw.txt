Yep, I'm now on day 10 of my flu so it's time for tofu soup, take #2. My first tofu soup review was for Cho Dang (. http://www.yelp.com/bi.... ).. . I came here at 2:30 on a rainy Saturday afternoon, expecting it to be empty, and the place was half full! Apparently I'm not the only person who eats at strange in-between-meal times.. . Pros:. (1) Located in a convenient and visible location across from Mozart Bakery on Buford Hwy.. (2) Nice atmosphere, kinda cutesy decor.. (3) Food flavors appeal to a wide range of tastes.. (4) Menus come with some English explanations.. (5) They have one Chinese-speaking waitress.. (6) You can get full on the tasty and endless supply of appetizer dishes.. . This is the one Korean restaurant in town where you're most likely to see lots of non-Koreans, probably due to most of the reasons listed above.. . Cons?. Not sure I can think of any right away. However, I will say that their beef tofu soup today tasted a bit watered-down compared to the usual, the fish was a little over-fried, and the bbq ribs were kind of chewy. On the other hand, this is the first time I've been able to find anything to complain about out of the 8-10 times I've been here so it's probably an exception.
