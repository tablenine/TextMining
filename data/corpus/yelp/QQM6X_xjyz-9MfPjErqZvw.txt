Restaurant: Porto&#39;s Bakery
Category: Latin American
Abundance is the first impression you get at Porto's Bakery.  The second is variety.  A testament to it's greatness, a huge line of hungry patrons snakes in front of a long glass case filled with the largest and most beautiful collection of pastries I've ever seen.  Everything is freshly made - and they also bake cookies, cakes and the most amazingly beautiful and glistening fruit tarts.  If the long line seems daunting, you'll be thankful for the extra time deciding what to order.  From flavorful Cuban sandwiches on light, crusty bread to hot, deep-fried savory street treats, Porto's has got you covered for lunch too.
