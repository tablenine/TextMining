The best part about La Creperie, is the back patio where you can eat in the sun on a warm Chicago day!  I've been here twice while visiting Chicago, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to the heavy brunch places .  It might be my passion for crepes, or the fact that this place combines two great loves of mine: crepes &amp; wine.  I would recommend ordering off "Le Brunch" menu, because you get a few strips of bacon as well as potatoes.  During my last visit, I ordered their Tomates Buckwheat Crepe (sauteed with onions and garlic).  It was healthy and light.  If your tum can handle dairy, I would recommend throwing in some goat cheese as well to add that extra flavor and texture!! . . Bon Appetit!
