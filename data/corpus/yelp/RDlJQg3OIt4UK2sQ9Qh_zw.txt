Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Now, I make some good chicken and waffles but nothing that rivals this popular place!! Came here with my family and our wait was short, waitress was a cute old lady who had a great sense of humor, and the food was awesome. . . Waffles so soft and chicken so crispy, man, texture overload!!! I am not sure if the version of this place that they built in Chicago is better but I am sure anxious to give it a go!
