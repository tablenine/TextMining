Restaurant: Bourgeois Pig Cafe
Category: Coffee & Tea
I like this cafe always and forever if for no other reason that it reminds me of Cambridge/Boston.  The website listed gives a good idea of what this place is like.  . Of note: Everyone who enters here is attractive and brilliant, if not only in their own head.
