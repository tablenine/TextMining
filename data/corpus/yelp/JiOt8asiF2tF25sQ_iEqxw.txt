The stuffed French toast with the apple chicken sausage is incredible. Just a smidge too much cream cheese, but the flavors are a great mix. The orange-flavored cream cheese, the mango salsa on top, the light dusting of cinnamon, powdered sugar, and just the right amount of drizzled syrup. The chicken-apple sausage was extremely flavorful and different too. I don't know who came up with both of these flavor creations, but they're pretty close to a perfect flavorful breakfast for lunchtime.. . The service was not the worst in the world as some people have claimed. I mean my Coke glass did stay empty for about 40 seconds before it was refilled, but that's pretty acceptable in my book.
