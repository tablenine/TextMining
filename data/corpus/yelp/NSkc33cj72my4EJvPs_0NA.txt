Don't understand the praise this place gets.  Pastrami is ok.  Pulled pork is meh.  Fries are average.  Good house blends of ketchup and mustard though.  Love the concept but execution is lacking.  I've tried twice and left confused at all the accolades both times.  There are reviews from Gourmet magazine on the wall and in the end it's just basic decent fast food.  LA has a million places like this, not sure why this one gets the praise/attention.  I won't go back.
