Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
This place is highly overrated. Yes it has a lot of history. Yes a lot of celebrities have eaten there. Yes it's a landmark/tourist trap. Good hot dogs? I guess so. I can't say it's spectacular or worth the wait. You'll definitely want to bring friends along for this trip. Lots and lots of friends. . . The lines are ridiculously long at all hours of the day. They're especially long on the weekends late at night/early morning (for all the drunk people). You can count on waiting at LEAST 45 minutes to an hour and a half for a hot dog. . . The cool thing about Pink's is the variety of toppings you can get on your dog. Anything from pastrami to bacon to the more traditional chili or sauerkraut. They also have these burrito dogs that are quite good, but MASSIVE! . . A word of warning: after you devour the Pink's Hot dog with the tons of toppings, you'll feel sick with yourself for having consumed all that food and wonder why you could have done such a thing to yourself. Then a week or two later when your friends ask you if you want to get some hot dogs at Pink's again, you'll readily agree and drive to LA to wait in line and eat and feel sick again. Ahh, and the cycle continues.
