Great place!!  We had a large group of us...around 16 people, and everbody's dish was amazing.  The appetizers were very tasty...my favorite being the tuna (ahi) tartare.  The sauce they used with that appetizer was addictive!  Of course, since they are a steak place, their stakes were excellent.  But, what made this place stand apart was their accompaniments (side dishes).  Wow!  It was one of best twice baked potatoes I have ever had.  And, their mac and cheese was so rich and tasty!  This was one of the best steak restaurants I have been to!
