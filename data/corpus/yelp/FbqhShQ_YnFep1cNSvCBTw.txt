Best steakhouse I have been to in Atlanta; probably ranks in my Top 5 nationwide. I live in Chicago, the city of meat, so this is quite an accomplishment.. . Prices are what one would expect for a top quality steakhouse; $40 steaks, etc. For a good piece of meat, well worth it.. . I had the rib-eye and the table shared some sides. Steak was top notch, melt in your mouth, deliciousness.. . Service here is superb. When / if you make reservations they remember everything you say (special occasion, name, where you are from, etc). Servers are friendly and welcoming.
