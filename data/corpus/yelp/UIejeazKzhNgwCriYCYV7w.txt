Restaurant: Nakato
Category: Japanese
Nakato is a good sushii spot, not too expensive(well compared to MF), and good quality. I would put the quality higher than Rusan's, just a different kind of atmosphere. I really don't go to Rusan's for sushii, I go here for sushii ans sashimi. The sashimi was fresh as well.
