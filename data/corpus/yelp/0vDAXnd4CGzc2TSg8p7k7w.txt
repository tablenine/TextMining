Yes yes yes. I love this place. I love the vibe, the food is fantastic, interesting, thoughtfully prepared, and it is so PC (local, organic all the way down to the rainwater toilet) it almost makes your head explode - but in a good way.. . Though fully carnivorous, I have enjoyed their meatless salads, pizzas, vegan dinner specials, Â and other dishes more than most other meals this year. (Note re: "meatless" - not all of their food is vegan, and they do on occasion prepare meat.) Also - the chocolate cake.. . I am looking forward to picking up my summer and fall CSA vegetables there (they are currently the only intown business i know of that serves as a CSA pickup). . . I only wish they were open more days, and longer hours!
