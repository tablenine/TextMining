Great place for a date for dinner or just drinks.  I'm surprised by the food reviews.  I only had the burger and some mac and cheese but the burger was absolutely phenomenal (ranks among the best in the city).  The mac and cheese had good bits of bacon and is something I would order again.  I can't speak for the rest of the menu but I would go back for another burger.
