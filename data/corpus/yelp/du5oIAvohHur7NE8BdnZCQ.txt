Well folks, in the left corner of the ring we have NY style pizza, delivery that doesn't discriminate against my "up and coming" part of the 'hood, five out of seven "pizza of the day" specials are vegetarian, and pizza happy hour when the giant slices (yes, large and thin enough for origami) are only two bucks.. . In the right corner of the ring, we have Counter Dude scolding me for not ordering at one counter and then acting annoyed at me again for not immediately returning to pay, and he even has the gall to wave my credit card around in the air and laugh when I can't snatch it back immediately.  I already have one bum hand this week, it's hard enough to juggle my wallet without your hijinks, pal.  And while we're examining the irritating and unhelpful side of the fight, the tomatoes in my mozzarella sandwich were sliced a half inch thick, resulting in a big gushy mouthful in the center of a hot and otherwise delicious sandwich.. . Who will win out?  A right, and a jab, and a calculated left hook...it's hard to say...all of us sitting at the ringside seats (at dirty tables, mind you) are left undecided.  The first round is a draw.  We'll have to match these two up again.
