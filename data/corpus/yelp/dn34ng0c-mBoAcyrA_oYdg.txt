Restaurant: Yard House
Category: Bars
Given all the choices in the Old Town and adjacent areas, I'm not sure why I keep going back to the Yardhouse.  . . I guess its the combination of its huge beer selection along with the fact that they actually have a good kitchen, allowing for a one stop deal for both dinner and drinks afterwards.  . . Their menu is pretty solid, with decent appetizers, and really good entrees IMHO.  My favorite entree is their porcini crusted halibut, which is served with a cream sauce - great dish and one I haven't seen in any other seafood restaurant.. . For me, Yardhouse is  a good starting point for a bar crawl after downing some appetizers or dinner and getting the ball rolling with a few brews before venturing along Colorado Blvd.
