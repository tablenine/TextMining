madness utter sheer buttery peppery madness. filthy shellfishy garlicy madness. anywayssss here's what we got. . btw the line is reallyyyyy long, if ur not seated by 9:45 you're not eating. and water costs $.25. . raw oysters - haven't had these in a while, the chili sauce they give you for them is bombbbbbb. 1lb of clams - possibly my favorite choice of the night because the shells are like natural little spoons for the sauce and they're by far the least work to eat.. 1lb of shrimp - rather large and plump and pretty much everything you would expect. 1 lb of crawfish - these are a lot of work for how little food is actually in them, and i feel like in terms of weight for food you're paying mostly for the shell. 1 dungeness crab - i'm pretty happy we got this, the meat was nice and thick and the sauce really went with it. fried catfish - someone in line told me to try it and i was in no way dissapointed. they breading they use for the fish is pretty incredible, i wonder how they do it?. . yea this place is pretty amazing, if i didn't have to wait so long i'd probably go more often. on the other hand this stuff is all way high in cholesterol so it's probably good that i can't go more often
