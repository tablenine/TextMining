Took some visitors here for the "LA" dining experience, and they absolutely loved it.  The restaurant itself is very aesthetically pleasing, so chicks will automatically love this place.  They are famous for their crabs, which was delicious but little too oily for me.  If you ever wonder whatever happened to a once famous celebrity, you can probably find some here on any given weeknight.  I almost forgot to mention that our waiter was awesome!  I think it's one of those places where you would think it's overrated and overpriced if you had to pay, but you would love this place if someone paid for your meal and your $15 appletini.
