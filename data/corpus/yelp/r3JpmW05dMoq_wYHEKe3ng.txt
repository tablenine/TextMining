Restaurant: JCT Kitchen &amp; Bar
Category: Southern
Gentrification of old factory/warehouse districts often results in places that have a split personality of ambiance.  The bar at JCT epitomizes that to a 'T' - the bar is open and airy, with great high ceilings and cool building features.  It is also cool and clammy, with acoustics destined to give an old man (like me) a headache thanks to the tinny echoes of barmates' cackling and the terribly loud speakers pumping in the live musician's vocals from the patio.. . Prices are average, and food was just a notch above.  Service was exceptional, often with everyone working checking on me, even with only 3 servers taking care of the whole joint.. . The restaurant below seems more subdued and a bit less noisy, but I know if ever I am not here solo, I would get stuck at the center tables, which fall victim to the 'too many, too close' principle.  That too would drive me a bit nutty and likely not bump up this review.  (ladies and gentlemen, I have become Larry David). . Parking is odd, and I am not sure if I even parked legally - though there is valet if you are willing to wait.. . Still, this neighborhood is a good spot for something out of the ordinary - and while I wasn't wow'd by my food here, I can honestly say that the bar bites menu was unlike any other place I have visited.  I will have to give it another go when the weather is nicer and I can maybe venture out to what seems to be a large patio area around the bar and get away from the gaggle inside.
