We decided to go here last night for dinner. Alternatively, we wanted to try the Wednesday New England Fish Fry, but that will have to wait until another day! There are 2 seating areas, one facing the street, where people can peer inside and also a seating area in the back, which has an attached outdoor garden. They have a few interesting cocktails and beers on the menu. We had a Pom Spritz and a Whale's Tale Pale Ale, both very good! The shrimp "chowda" was amazing, with roasted corn and the oh-so yummy poblano cream. Yummy! I am salivating now just thinking about it. My BF had the seared scallops with beet puree, and it was really really good. I am on a beet craze lately, so it was so exciting when my BF offered me all the beet puree! We opted to share an entree, as we werent that hungry. We shared the codfish, which was OK, and also had cranberry risotto as a side. The risotto was pretty good, lots of cranberries and veggies! But it wasnt as good as my BF's radicchio risotto! They didnt have a dessert menu, but they did offer complimentary chocolate mousse, which was decent, but not scrumptious, but hey it was on the house, so I will cease from complaining. We were also given Miracle Fish, Fortune Teller. That was a fun way to end the evening. Kind of like chinese fortune cookies, except better. My fish had a moving tail when I placed it in my palm, indicating "indifference." Mmmm... My BF had the fish curl up entirely, which represents, "passionate." And we were def passionate about this place! Will come back to try the NE Fish Fry :)
