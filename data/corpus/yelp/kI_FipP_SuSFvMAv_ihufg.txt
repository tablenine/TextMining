Restaurant: La Fonda Latina
Category: Latin American
Tasty. Cheap. Fun.. . What more can I say? I love La Fonda. Haven't been to the other locations, but it is always a pleasurable experience when I eat here. The food is so fresh and flavorful. Service is always quick and efficient. The decor isn't anything to gush over, but that's probably why 2 can dine for under $20.. . La la la la la la Fonda!!!!!!!!! . . tip - great place to go to before or after Martinis and Imax
