Restaurant: Manna Korean BBQ
Category: Barbeque
The floor is greasy and slippery. . The meat is fatty. . There are gnats flying around.. The side dishes minus the egg are yucky.. The meat just sits around in large barrels in the kitchen.. Loud. Imagine a frat party.. . If you are a college student and you absolutely don't care about your health and you want to just come here because you "heard" it's the only Korean BBQ AYCE place, then come here. Just.. gross.
