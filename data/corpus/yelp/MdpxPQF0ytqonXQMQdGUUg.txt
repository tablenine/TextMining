My wife and I went to Fritti last night and I have to say that the food was spectacular as usual and the service was great.  My wife requested an item that was not on the menu that they used to carry and because they had the ingredients, they made it for us.  Also, the pizza chef, from Itally, greeted our table.  Even though he didn't speak much English, he really wanted to hear feedback on the pizza.  It was perfect, so of course I gave him a "thumbs up!"
