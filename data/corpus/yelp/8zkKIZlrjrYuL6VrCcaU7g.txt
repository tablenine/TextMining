Very casual atmosphere, apparently it has live music every night (though there wasn't any when we were there.) Bit of a run down appearance - the benches were peeling and nothing seemed very new. Still, that's certainly no direct reflection on the food. I had a drink called the Lucille, which had something peachy in it, maybe Cointreau, not sure - but it had a very Southern feel to it, and I liked it enough to have a second one. The rib platter was big but I ate almost the whole thing! The ribs were tasty, I really liked the sweet sauce. There wasn't as much meat on the bone as I hoped, but they were still really good ribs. The sweet potato fries weren't as hot or crispy as I'd hoped, but still tasted good because of what they are. I didn't care for the beans, they were really smoky and had big chunks of meat in them - I think there's enough meat in the ribs, thanks! Still, it was a fun, casual place to go for decent BBQ.
