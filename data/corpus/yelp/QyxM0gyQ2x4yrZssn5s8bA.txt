We came the night of the Inman Park festival (which is right across the street) and it was packed!! We had a reservation but still ended up waiting 15 minutes. It was slightly awkward because the bar was so packed, we had to wait in the entryway, and people kept walking through. When we finally sat down, our waitress seemed pretty chatty and friendly. We ordered a bottle of wine, but they had run out of wine glasses, so we had to wait a while until she could find some. I can't remember what kind of pizza we ordered, but it was delicious. For two people to split a salad and pizza is the exact right amount of food. Yum! For all the craziness at the beginning, it was really a nice relaxing evening. If it's a nice night, make sure to request outside seating if you can...we were seated right by the outside/inside divider, but on the inside. Anyway, a little out of the way for me, but worth the trek on a pleasant evening! (PS I came with 3 other people, but it doesn't seem like a great restaurant for extremely large groups...)
