Restaurant: Roscoe's House of Chicken &amp; Waffles
Category: Southern
Compared to the Pico location, this one is harder to find decent parking for, but the food more than makes up for any difficulties.  The chicken is the best tasting, juiciest chicken you've ever had.  The french fries and mac and cheese are to die for.  And the waffles are the sweetest, richest waffles I've ever had.  This place is an institution and deserves tons of praise.
