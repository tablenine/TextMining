Up, Up, Up and away.  Yamashiro is such a wonderful place to see and visit.  Valet is super easy, hosts are very friendly, food is wonderful and bar area is quite nice.  I'm not much of a sushi person but the more "traditional meals" are great.  . . At the end of a day or season where I've produced beauty events all week, it's a great way to unwind, enjoy a drink, nice meal &amp; chat.  A must for tourists or travelers especially for the view. Yamashiro is up in the Hollywood hills w/ the most amazing views, and view points by the valet.   . . Thank you Yamashiro.
