Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
On the day I lunched at Calo Ristorante I had a bunch of other meetings lined up and of course they all involved food. What else is new? So I figured I'd have a very light lunch before moving on to my next meal, but this was pretty much impossible at Calo.   They certainly give you lots of food for your $$$ here at Calo!. . After making my way thru the bread basket (so much for that light lunch) I ordered the grilled calamari from the lunch specials menu.  This meal, which I believe was supposed to be an appetizer also came with a soup and a side of pasta. All that for just about $12.  Hello...good deal!  And the meals of my 3 dining companions also came with soup or salad and a side of pasta. Where has Calo been all my life during very hungry times?. . Not the best grilled calamari I've had, but pretty good. I also enjoyed my minestrone soup and the pasta was a nice treat being the carboholic that I am. The food didn't wow me so I probably wouldn't go back unless in the area, but definitely a place to keep in mind when looking for a good deal.
