Wanted to love this place, as the pizza options in chicago are subpar.. . Got takeout when it first opened...cold, extremely burnt and not super.. . Just tried it again last night and although it was improved, it was still not what I was hoping for. I like a slightly burnt crust, but they seem to take it to the extreme at some parts. The sauce and cheese are nothing to write home about and at the price for what you get I don't plan on going back.. . Especially since they are about to get their liquor license...lame
