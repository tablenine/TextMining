Restaurant: The Smoke Daddy
Category: Barbeque
I like the Smoke Daddy a lot, but I have experienced too large a variance in quality to give it any more than 3 stars. Some nights, it feels like the food has been sitting under heat lamps for a while and other nights, it tastes fresh. When it's good, it's really good and totally something I'd reccomend. If you go, be prepared to be dissapointed (but hope for the best!).
