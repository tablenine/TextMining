Restaurant: Canter&#39;s Delicatessen
Category: Bakeries
Canter's is an amazing place to go after the clubs. It's walking distance from my apartment. I am the type that always gets the same thing at a restaurant, but at canter's I am open to a few different options. I LOVE the corn beef, pickles are good but they don't have the neon green garlic one's factor's does. This may not be an issue to most, but to my pregnant sister this was a major factor on whether or not canter's was worth a second visit. I also love the matzoh brie when I don't feel like meat. The matzoh ball soup is pretty pimp as well. I was discussing this place with my boss and she was telling me about how she ate here once and had her meal in front of her; it was late night and she was drunk. Her boyfriend pointed out a roach on the floor crawling towards her and she ignored it. Is it bad that I would have done the same thing?
