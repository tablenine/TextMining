Restaurant: Hae Woon Dae BBQ
Category: Korean
good lawd! I don't know why I was so afraid to try Korean BBQ except that I have the stomach problems of an 80 year old and didnt know how i would react to it.. This place is great. . Its opened until4 am I think and re-opens at 6am.. The service is great and friendly. . I had fun trying out all the different condiments that came with the brisket (soy paste anyone?) Â smokey and marinaded meats and that awesome Soju... yeah be careful with that and sip slowly.
