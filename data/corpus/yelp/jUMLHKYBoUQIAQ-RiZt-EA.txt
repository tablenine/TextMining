Restaurant: Pink&#39;s Hot Dogs
Category: Hot Dogs
Pink's, please hire a graphic designer. If you are too cheap, I will do it for you for free. Just please, get rid of those eyesore laminated menu printouts clipped to the counter and I'll give you five stars. I'll even excuse the fact that your line features a wait turnaround longer than the DMV. . . With that being said, here's my mini-review. Complete with tough love.. . + Serves perhaps the most authentic delicious hot dogs on planet Earth . + A great place to come with friends for inexplicable reasons . + Mushroom Swiss Dog, enough said. - The menu is not very pleasing to look at. Did something blow up on the right half of your display?; I can't read it. . - Laminated printouts with clip art do not make for the most legendary hot dog stand ever. + Just felt like ending with a plus
